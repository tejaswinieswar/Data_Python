b'ABOUT a year ago, I flew to Singapore to join the writer Malcolm Gladwell, the fashion designer Marc Ecko and the graphic designer Stefan Sagmeister in addressing a group of advertising people on \xe2\x80\x9cMarketing to the Child of Tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d Soon after I arrived, the chief executive of the agency that had invited us took me aside. What he was most interested in, he began \xe2\x80\x94 I braced myself for mention of some next-generation stealth campaign \xe2\x80\x94 was stillness.'b'A few months later, I read an interview with the perennially cutting-edge designer Philippe Starck. What allowed him to remain so consistently ahead of the curve? \xe2\x80\x9cI never read any magazines or watch TV,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, perhaps a little hyperbolically. \xe2\x80\x9cNor do I go to cocktail parties, dinners or anything like that.\xe2\x80\x9d He lived outside conventional ideas, he implied, because \xe2\x80\x9cI live alone mostly, in the middle of nowhere.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Around the same time, I noticed that those who part with $2,285 a night to stay in a cliff-top room at the Post Ranch Inn in Big Sur pay partly for the privilege of 'b'not'b' having a TV in their rooms; the future of travel, I\xe2\x80\x99m reliably told, lies in \xe2\x80\x9cblack-hole resorts,\xe2\x80\x9d which charge high prices precisely because you can\xe2\x80\x99t get online in their rooms.'b'Has it really come to this?'b'In barely one generation we\xe2\x80\x99ve moved from exulting in the time-saving devices that have so expanded our lives to trying to get away from them \xe2\x80\x94 often in order to make more time. The more ways we have to connect, the more many of us seem desperate to unplug. Like teenagers, we appear to have gone from knowing nothing about the world to knowing too much all but overnight.'b''b'Internet rescue camps'b' in South Korea and China try to save kids addicted to the screen.'b'Writer friends of mine pay good money to get the Freedom software that enables them to disable (for up to eight hours) the very Internet connections that seemed so emancipating not long ago. Even Intel (of all companies) experimented in 2007 with conferring four uninterrupted hours of quiet time every Tuesday morning on 300 engineers and managers. (The average office worker today, researchers have found, enjoys no more than three minutes at a time at his or her desk without interruption.) During this period the workers were not allowed to use the phone or send e-mail, but simply had the chance to clear their heads and to hear themselves think. A majority of Intel\xe2\x80\x99s trial group recommended that the policy be extended to others.'b'THE average American spends at least eight and a half hours a day in front of a screen, Nicholas Carr notes in his eye-opening book \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shallows,\xe2\x80\x9d in part because the number of hours American adults spent online doubled between 2005 and 2009 (and the number of hours spent in front of a TV screen, often simultaneously, is also steadily increasing).'b'The average American teenager sends or receives 75 text messages a day, though one girl in Sacramento managed to handle an average of 10,000 every 24 hours for a month. Since luxury, as any economist will tell you, is a function of scarcity, the children of tomorrow, I heard myself tell the marketers in Singapore, will crave nothing more than freedom, if only for a short while, from all the blinking machines, streaming videos and scrolling headlines that leave them feeling empty and too full all at once.'b'The urgency of slowing down \xe2\x80\x94 to find the time and space to think \xe2\x80\x94 is nothing new, of course, and wiser souls have always reminded us that the more attention we pay to the moment, the less time and energy we have to place it in some larger context. \xe2\x80\x9cDistraction is the only thing that consoles us for our miseries,\xe2\x80\x9d the French philosopher Blaise Pascal wrote in the 17th century, \xe2\x80\x9cand yet it is itself the greatest of our miseries.\xe2\x80\x9d He also famously remarked that all of man\xe2\x80\x99s problems come from his inability to sit quietly in a room alone.'b'When telegraphs and trains brought in the idea that convenience was more important than content \xe2\x80\x94 and speedier means could make up for unimproved ends \xe2\x80\x94 Henry David Thoreau reminded us that \xe2\x80\x9cthe man whose horse trots a mile in a minute does not carry the most important messages.\xe2\x80\x9d Even half a century ago, Marshall McLuhan, who came closer than most to seeing what was coming, warned, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen things come at you very fast, naturally you lose touch with yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d Thomas Merton struck a chord with millions, by not just noting that \xe2\x80\x9cMan was made for the highest activity, which is, in fact, his rest,\xe2\x80\x9d but by also acting on it, and stepping out of the rat race and into a Cistercian cloister.'b'Yet few of those voices can be heard these days, precisely because \xe2\x80\x9cbreaking news\xe2\x80\x9d is coming through (perpetually) on CNN and Debbie is just posting images of her summer vacation and the phone is ringing. We barely have enough time to see how little time we have (most Web pages, researchers find, are visited for 10 seconds or less). And the more that floods in on us (the Kardashians, Obamacare, \xe2\x80\x9cDancing with the Stars\xe2\x80\x9d), the less of ourselves we have to give to every snippet. All we notice is that the distinctions that used to guide and steady us \xe2\x80\x94 between Sunday and Monday, public and private, here and there \xe2\x80\x94 are gone.'b'We have more and more ways to communicate, as Thoreau noted, but less and less to say. Partly because we\xe2\x80\x99re so busy communicating. And \xe2\x80\x94 as he might also have said \xe2\x80\x94 we\xe2\x80\x99re rushing to meet so many deadlines that we hardly register that what we need most are lifelines.'b'So what to do? The central paradox of the machines that have made our lives so much brighter, quicker, longer and healthier is that they cannot teach us how to make the best use of them; the information revolution came without an instruction manual. All the data in the world cannot teach us how to sift through data; images don\xe2\x80\x99t show us how to process images. The only way to do justice to our onscreen lives is by summoning exactly the emotional and moral clarity that can\xe2\x80\x99t be found on any screen.'b'MAYBE that\xe2\x80\x99s why more and more people I know, even if they have no religious commitment, seem to be turning to 'b'yoga'b', or meditation, or tai chi; these aren\xe2\x80\x99t New Age fads so much as ways to connect with what could be called the wisdom of old age. Two journalist friends of mine observe an \xe2\x80\x9cInternet sabbath\xe2\x80\x9d every week, turning off their online connections from Friday night to Monday morning, so as to try to revive those ancient customs known as family meals and conversation. Finding myself at breakfast with a group of lawyers in Oxford four months ago, I noticed that all their talk was of sailing \xe2\x80\x94 or riding or bridge: anything that would allow them to get out of radio contact for a few hours.'b'Other friends try to go on long walks every Sunday, or to \xe2\x80\x9cforget\xe2\x80\x9d their cellphones at home. A series of tests in recent years has shown, Mr. Carr points out, that after spending time in quiet rural settings, subjects \xe2\x80\x9cexhibit greater attentiveness, stronger memory and generally improved cognition. Their brains become both calmer and sharper.\xe2\x80\x9d More than that, empathy, as well as deep thought, depends (as neuroscientists like Antonio Damasio have found) on neural processes that are \xe2\x80\x9cinherently slow.\xe2\x80\x9d The very ones our high-speed lives have little time for.'b'In my own case, I turn to eccentric and often extreme measures to try to keep my sanity and ensure that I have time to do nothing at all (which is the only time when I can see what I should be doing the rest of the time). I\xe2\x80\x99ve yet to use a cellphone and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never Tweeted or entered Facebook. I try not to go online till my day\xe2\x80\x99s writing is finished, and I moved from Manhattan to rural Japan in part so I could more easily survive for long stretches entirely on foot, and every trip to the movies would be an event.'b'None of this is a matter of principle or asceticism; it\xe2\x80\x99s just pure selfishness. Nothing makes me feel better \xe2\x80\x94 calmer, clearer and happier \xe2\x80\x94 than being in one place, absorbed in a book, a conversation, a piece of music. It\xe2\x80\x99s actually something deeper than mere happiness: it\xe2\x80\x99s joy, which the monk David Steindl-Rast describes as \xe2\x80\x9cthat kind of happiness that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t depend on what happens.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s vital, of course, to stay in touch with the world, and to know what\xe2\x80\x99s going on; I took pains this past year to make separate trips to Jerusalem and Hyderabad and Oman and St. Petersburg, to rural Arkansas and Thailand and the stricken nuclear plant in Fukushima and Dubai. But it\xe2\x80\x99s only by having some distance from the world that you can see it whole, and understand what you should be doing with it.'b'For more than 20 years, therefore, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been going several times a year \xe2\x80\x94 often for no longer than three days \xe2\x80\x94 to a Benedictine hermitage, 40 minutes down the road, as it happens, from the Post Ranch Inn. I don\xe2\x80\x99t attend services when I\xe2\x80\x99m there, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never meditated, there or anywhere; I just take walks and read and lose myself in the stillness, recalling that it\xe2\x80\x99s only by stepping briefly away from my wife and bosses and friends that I\xe2\x80\x99ll have anything useful to bring to them. The last time I was in the hermitage, three months ago, I happened to pass, on the monastery road, a youngish-looking man with a 3-year-old around his shoulders.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re Pico, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d the man said, and introduced himself as Larry; we\xe2\x80\x99d met, I gathered, 19 years before, when he\xe2\x80\x99d been living in the cloister as an assistant to one of the monks.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing now?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI work for MTV.

The auction would end in 32 minutes. My family, though, had just begun a long evening of blessings and chicken soup. I scanned the bid history, now up to $150.

A regular Christofle ladle retails for $390. How much was dictator kitchenware worth? I remembered my nights in Baghdad, the shattered sleep, the shrieks of signal whistles every hour from the uniformed men in khaki caps biking around our neighborhood, spying for Saddam.

A short-wave cone cell sends violet shades to his brain; a long-wave cone sends something in the yellow or green range. So although the bear would be able to view the colors of some of the later animals in the books, like the white dog and the yellow duck, his perception of a bird\xe2\x80\x99s redness is likely to be very weak.

The macaques, which like George are tailless, scored high on a \xe2\x80\x9ccuriosity index\xe2\x80\x9d when faced with oddities like organic paint and mealworms. Males were especially curious, but all macaques were less curious than the spider monkeys.

My mother\xe2\x80\x99s gold bracelet is \xe2\x80\x9cjust melt stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d one merchant told me bluntly.'b'My mother was of the same generation as Elizabeth Taylor, whose jewelry was sold at Christie\xe2\x80\x99s last month, with a portion of the proceeds from the exhibition going to her AIDS foundation. None of Elizabeth Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s items were \xe2\x80\x9cmelt stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d I watched the auction as even her everyday pieces commanded hundreds of thousands of dollars.'b'My mother\xe2\x80\x99s baubles, which she bought at Fortunoff on Long Island, in the 1970s and \xe2\x80\x9980s, generally cost around $200 then, which was a lot to her. She never had money to burn, but every once in a while she would buy something to make her suburban existence a bit more Elizabeth Taylor-ish. Then she had her bouts with cancer; when chemotherapy swelled her fingers, her rings were banished to a safe deposit box, where they remained for 25 years, along with about a dozen necklaces and bracelets.'b'Last month, with the price of gold at a record high, I decided to find out how much I could get for my mother\xe2\x80\x99s jewelry \xe2\x80\x94 not to fund AIDS research, but for my children\xe2\x80\x99s education, a charity my mother would surely have endorsed.'b'Knowing nothing about selling jewelry, I started with a necklace \xe2\x80\x94 a thick chain with charms hanging from it \xe2\x80\x94 that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t remember from my childhood and therefore didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind giving up. On 47th Street between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas, the diamond district, I entered a brightly lighted store, one of many, without even noticing its name. I produced the necklace from the lining of my coat. (A hole in my pocket lining gave me a perfect hiding place.) A young man told me he liked the necklace \xe2\x80\x94 so much that he would give me $1,200 for it. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to sell it to me now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to give it to my grandmother for her 80th birthday, and the party is tomorrow night.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I was in no mood to be hustled. I took the necklace to another store, where I received an offer of $1,250. And then to another, where, when I mentioned the $1,250, I was offered $1,400. (Not one jeweler I talked to believed the grandma-turning-80 story. It was, they said, a fiction to warm my heart \xe2\x80\x94 and cloud my business judgment.) Still, I walked back to the first store I visited, where I invited the young man to match the $1,400 offer. He said he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford to spend more than $1,200 for his grandma\xe2\x80\x99s birthday present. I went back to the dealer who offered me $1,400, and took it.'b'Could I have gotten more? Who knows? The price of gold is no secret, nor is the weight of the jewelry (every jeweler I visited had an electronic scale). The purity of the gold in a piece of jewelry is hard to know. But a jeweler looking at an item through a loupe and testing it with acid from an eyedropper can make an educated guess. Still, offers for one piece of jewelry will vary \xe2\x80\x94 sometimes significantly \xe2\x80\x94 from shop to shop, even on one block.'b'And then there\xe2\x80\x99s the X factor \xe2\x80\x94 the cachet that led frenzied bidders to buy Elizabeth Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s jewelry items for hundreds of times their intrinsic value.'b'For my mother\xe2\x80\x99s jewelry, the X factor is 1.'b'My only hope was to play jewelers against one another. A few days after my first outing, the $1,400 safely in the bank, I decided to see what I could get for the bracelet with the tricky clasp. Just two blocks from Christie\xe2\x80\x99s, I tried three stores, where offers ranged from $1,100 to $1,900.'b'I returned to the highest bidder, who walked into a vault and emerged with 19 C-notes. He asked for my driver\xe2\x80\x99s license, and gave it to an assistant to photocopy \xe2\x80\x94 a procedure that reduces the risk that he\xe2\x80\x99s buying stolen property, he said. We chatted for a while, and he told me that the piece weighed about 30 pennyweight (a pennyweight is a 20th of an ounce). If I brought in 200 pennyweight of gold, he said, I could go with him to watch it being melted down.'b'Would I be intrigued or repelled, I wondered, watching my mother\xe2\x80\x99s prized possessions turned into pure lucre?'b'I promised to return with some more pieces; what I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say was that I would take each item to at least three stores before selling. Just like Christie\xe2\x80\x99s, I was running a jewelry auction.'b'COLLECTING the past year\xe2\x80\x99s words is like sifting one\xe2\x80\x99s pockets at the end of a trip. Some things you\xe2\x80\x99ll keep, some you\xe2\x80\x99ll discard \xe2\x80\x94 the dinner receipt for the expense-account meal vs. the one-peso coin. Each is a reminder of what you did, where you went and whom you were with.'b'In 10 years, some of last year\xe2\x80\x99s words will be relics.

A movement so well labeled, if not cohesive in thought and action, that its name instantly lent itself to variation and satire.'b'We create all this new language, political and otherwise, for a lot of reasons.

No one else has the background to actually get the economy going, understand the economy in a very fundamental way.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen political wives, like Michelle Obama and Alma Powell, who grimaced at the thought of their husbands running. And ones like Nancy Reagan, who gazed adoringly in public and strategized adeptly in private.'b'But this campaign season, some spouses are not only the power behind the throne, they\xe2\x80\x99re the propulsion out front. Helpful nags have replaced quiet helpmeets.'b'As one top Republican here put it, if Ann can go all out to persuade Mitt to run, even though she has to endure the rigors of campaigning with multiple sclerosis, then voters may begin to believe there\xe2\x80\x99s more to Mittens than a glossy bankroll and glossy hair (especially compared with Newt, who left two wives facing illness.)'b'At Iowa campaign stops, the elegant Ann introduces her husband by describing how steadfast he has been as she fought her disease. In the post-Elizabeth Edwards age, candidates can\xe2\x80\x99t risk looking as if they are placing their ambition ahead of a spouse\xe2\x80\x99s health. So it\xe2\x80\x99s a calculation for Romney\xe2\x80\x99s image that Ann be seen as a driving force rather than a victim.'b'Like another animatronic candidate, Michael Dukakis, Romney uses his wife as a way to convey passion; Mittens also dwells on patriotic songs and poems, and stories about traveling the country with Mom and Dad in a Rambler, to humanize himself and quell some evangelical voters\xe2\x80\x99 fears that Mormonism is an alien cult.'b'Newt Gingrich credits his wife\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstubbornness\xe2\x80\x9d with keeping him in the race.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere were several critical moments where I said to Newt, \xe2\x80\x98If we can just get to the debates, if we can just get to September,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Callista told the Christian Broadcasting Network.'b'Their relationship was born in sin and hypocrisy.

According to the latest People magazine, Callista has played Henry Higgins to Newt\xe2\x80\x99s Eliza Doolittle, remaking him into a more docile man who plays golf, loves opera, worships at a Catholic church, and, for the first time, shares his calamari.'b'At an event for Iowa mothers at a coffee shop here Friday, Gingrich was asked how he could prove he had really changed.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI would say I am a sadder and slower person than I was 25 years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, noting that back then, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought if you just kept moving fast enough, somehow everything would always work.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Gingrich was emphasizing the influence women have had on him when he broke down as he described his mother\xe2\x80\x99s battles with bipolar disease and depression.

You don\xe2\x80\x99t become president without clawing your way into the Oval Office, but voters prefer pols like J.F.K., Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama who wear their ambition lightly.'b'The key to ambition is the ability to cloak it. Better yet, attribute it to your wife.'b'IN 1984, after serving three terms in the House of Representatives, Ron Paul was defeated by Phil Gramm in Texas\xe2\x80\x99s Republican Senate primary. Paul left Congress, and a few years later he left the Republican Party entirely to run for president on the Libertarian line. In the 1988 election, after a campaign that Texas Monthly 'b'compared'b' to something \xe2\x80\x9cout of Robert Altman\xe2\x80\x99s movie \xe2\x80\x98Nashville,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d he took home just 0.47 percent of the popular vote.'b'Thus marginalized by the public, the former congressman proceeded to marginalize himself. Through the various newsletters that bore his name \xe2\x80\x94 most notably the Ron Paul Political Report and the Ron Paul Survival Report \xe2\x80\x94 he spent the early 1990s as a peddler of far-right paranoia. In an exhaustive 2008 'b'piece'b' for Reason magazine, Dave Weigel and Julian Sanchez argued that the most abhorrent language in Paul\xe2\x80\x99s eponymous newsletters \xe2\x80\x94 the claims that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. \xe2\x80\x9cseduced under-age girls and boys,\xe2\x80\x9d that AIDS sufferers \xe2\x80\x9cenjoy the attention and pity,\xe2\x80\x9d and so on \xe2\x80\x94 weren\xe2\x80\x99t actually written by the man himself. But the fact that they had Paul\xe2\x80\x99s imprimatur suggests that the former congressman had grown comfortable way out on the xenophobic fringe.'b'That fringe is like the Hotel California: When public figures hang out there for a while, they usually find that it\xe2\x80\x99s easier to check out than to leave. Yet in 1997, Paul was back in Congress, representing the same Republican Party that he\xe2\x80\x99d previously abandoned. In 2008, after a decade as a marginal figure on the Hill, his long-shot campaign for the presidency suddenly gained him one of American politics\xe2\x80\x99 most devoted followings. And now this following has grown large enough that a man whose Survival Report once counseled would-be militia members to \xe2\x80\x9cavoid the phone as much as possible\xe2\x80\x9d has a chance to win the Iowa caucuses.'b'There are two commonplace interpretations of Paul\xe2\x80\x99s unusual trajectory. To his many sympathizers \xe2\x80\x94 libertarians, dissident conservatives and some left-wingers as well \xe2\x80\x94 the extremism in his past has nothing to do with the issues that he\xe2\x80\x99s campaigning on today. The case for Paul, as The Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s Conor Friedersdorf 'b'put it'b', is that \xe2\x80\x9che alone, among viable candidates, favors reforming certain atrocious policies\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 scaling back America\xe2\x80\x99s overseas commitments, ending a failed war on drugs, curbing a runaway public sector and reducing the powers of an imperial presidency. The newsletters may reflect badly on his past, but in the current political landscape he\xe2\x80\x99s a voice of reason rather than of madness.'b'To his many critics, on the other hand, Paul\xe2\x80\x99s present-day positions are connected to his past derangements, because they share the same essentially conspiratorial root. Then as now, Paul blames shadowy elites for the country\xe2\x80\x99s ills; then as now, he flirts with narratives that are straight out of the fever swamp. For all its superficial idealism, the critics insist, his campaign is a conduit through which fundamentally poisonous ideas are entering the mainstream body politic, and thus he needs to be not only defeated but repudiated.'b'But consider a third possibility. There\xe2\x80\x99s often a fine line between a madman and a prophet. Perhaps Paul has emerged as a teller of some important truths precisely because in many ways he\xe2\x80\x99s still as far out there as ever.'b'The United States is living through an era of unprecedented elite failure, in which America\xe2\x80\x99s public institutions are understandably distrusted and our leadership class is justifiably despised. Yet politicians of both parties are required, by the demands of partisanship, to embrace the convenient lie that our problem can be pinned exclusively on the other side\xe2\x80\x99s elites \xe2\x80\x94 as though both liberals and conservatives hadn\xe2\x80\x99t participated in the decisions that dug our current hole.'b'In this climate, it sometimes takes a fearless crank to expose realities that neither Republicans nor Democrats are particularly eager to acknowledge.'b'In both the 2008 and 2012 campaigns, Paul has been the only figure willing to point out the deep continuities in American politics \xe2\x80\x94 the way social spending grows and overseas commitments multiply no matter which party is in power, the revolving doors that connect K Street to Congress and Wall Street to the White House, the long list of dubious policies and programs that both sides tacitly support. In both election cycles, his honest extremism has sometimes cut closer to the heart of our national predicament than the calculating partisanship of his more grounded rivals. He sometimes rants, but he rarely spins \xe2\x80\x94 and he\xe2\x80\x99s one of the few figures on the national stage who says \xe2\x80\x9ca plague on both your houses!\xe2\x80\x9d and actually means it.'b'Obviously it would be better for the country if this message weren\xe2\x80\x99t freighted with Paul\xe2\x80\x99s noxious baggage, and entangled with his many implausible ideas. But would it be better off without his presence entirely? I\xe2\x80\x99m not so sure.'b'Neither prophets nor madmen should be elected to the presidency. But neither can they safely be ignored.'b'Coralville, Iowa'b'AS the hour of actual caucusing drew closer, Ron Paul\xe2\x80\x99s campaign trumpeted his endorsement by a pastor who, as it happens, has 'b'spoken'b' of executing homosexuals. Rick Perry pledged to devote predator drones and thousands of troops to the protection of the Mexican border, making the mission to keep every last illegal immigrant from crossing sound as urgent as rooting out terrorists in Pakistan.'b'And Rick Santorum, bringing his \xe2\x80\x9cFaith, Family and Freedom\xe2\x80\x9d tour to this eastern Iowa town on Thursday, promised never to be cowed by all those craven secularists who believe that a stable, healthy household needn\xe2\x80\x99t be headed by a God-fearing mom and dad.'b'None of these three men is likely to win the Republican nomination. But before they exit stage right \xe2\x80\x94 stage far right, that is \xe2\x80\x94 they and a few of their similarly quixotic, similarly strident competitors will do no small measure of damage to the Republican Party and no great favors to the country as a whole. What happens in Iowa doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stay in Iowa: it befouls Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 image nationally, becomes a millstone around the eventual nominee\xe2\x80\x99s neck and legitimizes debate about some matters that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be debatable.'b'The run-up to the Iowa caucuses, like the rest of the primary season thus far, has underscored just how much general nuttiness and moral extremism the party has come to accommodate, with Iowa serving as a theater of the conservative absurd. The state\xe2\x80\x99s unrepresentative caucuses \xe2\x80\x94 in which a mere 100,000 or so of the most fervent voters, almost all of them white, are expected to participate \xe2\x80\x94 coax a Bible-thumping, border-militarizing harshness from candidates that\xe2\x80\x99s a tonal turnoff to the swing voters who will probably decide the general election.'b'The more reasoned, practical members of the Republican establishment know this. That\xe2\x80\x99s why many of them are doing all they can to expedite the coronation of Mitt Romney, whose mild manner and time as the governor of a heavily Democratic state give him a centrist aura, or at least the possibility of one. They\xe2\x80\x99d like to get his loopier and more incendiary rivals away from the television cameras, soon.'b'Many Democrats take heart from the spectacle of ultra-conservative pandering in Iowa, correctly surmising that it bolsters their own party\xe2\x80\x99s fortunes and President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s re-election chances. They shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, not if they care about the country, best served by a vigorous back-and-forth about the proper size and role of government and about budgetary restraint. In its least hypocritical moments, the Republican Party has provided an important counterbalance to a Democratic tropism toward paternalism and bloat. It can\xe2\x80\x99t do that if it marginalizes itself by repelling fiscally conservative but socially moderate voters who have little appetite for the shenanigans in Iowa.'b'Last week, Paul remained at or near the top of polls of the state\xe2\x80\x99s Republicans, despite his refusal to disavow support from white supremacist and anti-Zionist groups and \xe2\x80\x94 on an infinitely lighter note \xe2\x80\x94 a campaign style that just won\xe2\x80\x99t cut it.'b'I caught up with him in Newton, where his staff distributed glossy pamphlets, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ron Paul Family Cookbook,\xe2\x80\x9d with recipes for \xe2\x80\x9ccherry-pineapple dump cake,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cimpossible pie,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9crazzle bo-dazzle pork tenderloin\xe2\x80\x9d and more. His remarks were less sculptured stump speech than meandering civics seminar, with none of the customary oratorical swells and dips.'b'An advocate of abolishing the Federal Reserve, he got questions unlike those other candidates receive, including one about monetary policy that concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cMy thought is: maybe the silver standard?\xe2\x80\x9d He responded by earnestly weighing silver against gold, the pol as metallurgist.'b'He terrifies more pragmatic conservatives like the commentator Michael Medved, who has called him \xe2\x80\x9cDr. Demento.\xe2\x80\x9d Medved 'b'wrote'b' in The Daily Beast last week that a strong showing by Paul in the caucuses and beyond would be \xe2\x80\x9cdisastrous to Republican prospects,\xe2\x80\x9d validating the impression that \xe2\x80\x9ctoday\xe2\x80\x99s Republicans have become a wild and crazy bunch, harboring oddball, irresponsible notions that place them far outside the American mainstream and make them untrustworthy when it comes to the serious business of governance.\xe2\x80\x9d He added, rightly, that Paul\xe2\x80\x99s associations aren\xe2\x80\x99t helpful to a party whose future may depend on its appeal to Hispanic and black voters.'b'That future was lost on Perry, too. I caught up with him on Wednesday in Pella, where he was introduced by 'b'Joe Arpaio'b', the polarizing Arizona sheriff who once 'b'marched'b' 200 immigrants awaiting deportation through the streets and is widely loathed by Hispanics. Perry spoke of Arpaio\xe2\x80\x99s support as a compliment higher than any imaginable. And when one of the Iowans who got to ask Perry a question commenced a vicious tirade against \xe2\x80\x9cthese Mexicans\xe2\x80\x9d who come to America and \xe2\x80\x9cfly their flag above the United States flag,\xe2\x80\x9d Perry didn\xe2\x80\x99t push back one iota.'b'IN response to weak poll numbers, he also doubled down on God. Early in the week he toughened his already tough stance on abortion, saying he was now opposed to it even in instances of rape and incest. In Pella and elsewhere he crowed about how many Planned Parenthood clinics in Texas he had shut down. He quoted the Bible, telling voters they must, like the prophet Isaiah, offer their service to the Lord \xe2\x80\x94 by voting for Perry.'b'The symbolism in one of his television 'b'ads'b' included stained glass, a church steeple, a cross: religious imagery that was par for the pious course in Iowa. As the political strategist Mark McKinnon 'b'told'b' the Times\xe2\x80\x99s Jeremy W. Peters, vote-desperate, subtlety-bereft candidates \xe2\x80\x9cwill light a fire and stand by a burning bush in order to send a signal to evangelicals, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m one of you.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A 'b'prior ad'b' of Perry\xe2\x80\x99s questioned the end of the United States military\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d prohibition concerning gays. They remain favorite punching bags for conservative Republicans, and that\xe2\x80\x99s another way in which the party jeopardizes its future. Surveys make clear that younger Americans are much more supportive of gay rights than older ones. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know it from the likes of Perry and Santorum.'b'Santorum at long last experienced a surge of his very own \xe2\x80\x94 you have to wonder if Tim Pawlenty has developed hematomas from kicking himself for quitting the race \xe2\x80\x94 and reveled in it. And he talked not only about the economy but also about abstinence, Christianity, morality, decency.'b'A remark he made in Coralville had a xenophobic, even racist edge. Digressing to recall that Hillary Clinton had written a book titled, \xe2\x80\x9cIt Takes a Village,\xe2\x80\x9d he pointed out, gratuitously, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s an African proverb.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He then plugged his own book, \xe2\x80\x9cIt Takes a Family.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It takes a perspective less morally smug and divisive to lead this country. And for all of Romney\xe2\x80\x99s own pandering and cringe-inducing policy gyrations, he gets this, I think.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s possible he\xe2\x80\x99ll prevail in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s caucuses and indeed be speeded toward the general election. But the rightward bobs he has felt compelled to make and the ugly carnival here will cling to him and his party. More than any vote tally, that will be Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s harvest, a bitter one.'b'HERE\xe2\x80\x99S a paradox: We\xe2\x80\x99re finding authentic leadership these days not from our nominal leaders in Washington but from unelected (and mostly unelectable) figures whom we like to deride as self-indulgent narcissists.'b'Congress is so paralyzed and immature, even sleazy, that we reporters sometimes leave a politician\xe2\x80\x99s press conference feeling the urgent need to shower. But look at university and high school students. Sure, plenty still live for a party, but a growing number have no time for beer 'b'because they\xe2\x80\x99re so busy'b' tutoring prisoners, battling sex trafficking or building wells in Africa.'b'Even more startling, we can now turn to moral leadership from \xe2\x80\x94 brace yourself \xe2\x80\x94 Hollywood\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmost beautiful people.\xe2\x80\x9d I know, I know. What we expect from celebrities is mostly scandalous sex lives and crackpot behavior, and some do oblige. But increasingly as our \xe2\x80\x9cleaders\xe2\x80\x9d debase the national conversation, sex symbols elevate it.'b'Take Angelina Jolie, who is making her debut as a director and writer with the aching new movie \xe2\x80\x9c'b'In the Land of Blood and Honey'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s a Bosnian love story set against genocide, and it illuminates the human capacity to both love and kill.'b'Let me acknowledge that I regularly embarrass my kids with my ignorance of popular culture. The first time I met Jolie, four years ago, I was brought over to a couch where three women were seated \xe2\x80\x94 and realized, to my horror, that I had no idea which one she was. She rescued me by introducing herself.'b'(Maybe I should warn of a conflict here. Jolie submitted a blurb for a book that my wife and I wrote about empowering women. Better yet, she held our book, the cover perfectly upright for the cameras, as a shield when paparazzi were hounding her.)'b'Jolie\xe2\x80\x99s new movie doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pander to anyone. For starters, she isn\xe2\x80\x99t in it. The cast is made up of unknowns from the Balkans, speaking foreign languages with subtitles. When Jolie wrote the screenplay and proposed filming it, she said, everyone thought she was nuts.'b'The movie portrays the romance between a Bosnian Serbian man and a Bosnian Muslim woman. When the Bosnian war begins, he becomes an officer in a genocidal army and she becomes a survivor in one of the army\xe2\x80\x99s rape camps. The couple reunites, but she is his prisoner as well as his lover. The army officer reminds me of war criminals I\xe2\x80\x99ve interviewed: a good and decent guy when he\xe2\x80\x99s not committing crimes against humanity.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow do people get to the point,\xe2\x80\x9d Jolie asks, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen they\xe2\x80\x99re murdering the grandmother next door. How does that happen? If we can start to understand it, then maybe we can figure out how to address the signs earlier.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Jolie also wants viewers to meditate on humanitarian intervention and what can be done to prevent mass atrocities. \xe2\x80\x9cI hoped people would watch the film and think, \xe2\x80\x98Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t we stop it?\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'I started off rather scornful of celebrities dabbling in humanitarian causes. When 'b'Mia Farrow'b' inquired about going to Darfur with me, I archly declined on the presumption that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hack it. Then she traveled to the region on her own, and I began to run into her anyway.'b'Once Farrow consulted me about her plan to buy a donkey and hike off by herself across a desert occupied by murderous militias. She planned to travel without even a tent, just a rope to encircle her as she slept in the sand on the theory that snakes and scorpions would turn aside at the rope.'b'Farrow has since become a friend, but I\xe2\x80\x99m now afraid to travel with her. I might not be able to hack it.'b'Likewise, the war in Congo is the most lethal since World War II, but it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been much covered by many news organizations. One person who has visited repeatedly is 'b'Ben Affleck'b'. He has made himself an expert on Congo, and he plans to return this month.'b'Or think of 'b'Sean Penn'b' and 'b'Olivia Wilde'b', who have shown a more sustained commitment to Haiti than most news organizations.'b'Look, as a journalist, I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of my profession. Yet it\xe2\x80\x99s also clear that commercial pressures are driving some news organizations, television in particular, to drop the ball. Instead of covering Congo, it\xe2\x80\x99s cheaper and easier to put a Democrat and a Republican in a studio and have them yell at each other.'b'Frankly, it\xe2\x80\x99s just humiliating when news organizations cover George Clooney ('b'my travel buddy on one Darfur trip'b') more attentively when he breaks up with a girlfriend than when he travels to Sudan and 'b'uses satellite photos'b' to catch the Sudanese government committing mass atrocities.'b'So here\xe2\x80\x99s my hope for the new year. That our \xe2\x80\x9cleaders\xe2\x80\x9d in Washington will pause in their supercilious narcissism and show a hint of the seriousness and moral purpose of, yes, celebrities.'b'The economy was weak in 2011, but it ended better than it started, with growth up from its lows and unemployment down from its highs. The question now is whether that progress will continue into 2012. We wish we could say yes, but unless policy makers are incredibly lucky or remarkably adept \xe2\x80\x94 certainly not the description that comes to mind when thinking of, say, Congress \xe2\x80\x94 the answer is no.'b'When data is released later this month, economists expect growth of around 3 percent for the last quarter of 2011, compared with 1.2 percent on average in the first three quarters. But there is little in the latest growth spurt to signal a self-reinforcing recovery going forward.'b'Holiday shoppers had more cash to spend because of the decline in oil prices, not a rise in wages. A drop in the jobless rate was driven by a mix of new hiring and a large number of potential workers who gave up futile job searches. Signs of life in the housing market, including more sales, were dampened by falling prices as foreclosures continued.'b'The way to revive sustainable growth is with more government aid to help create jobs, support demand and prevent foreclosures. As things stand now, however, Washington will provide less help, not more, in 2012. Republican lawmakers refuse to acknowledge that government cutbacks at a time of economic weakness will only make the economy weaker. And too many Democrats, who should know better, have for too long been reluctant to challenge them.'b'The drag from premature cuts is significant. Waning stimulus spending subtracted an estimated half a percentage point from growth in 2011; this year, cutbacks will very likely cost the economy a full percentage point of growth. That means the best-case economic projection is for a new year of anemic expansion and high joblessness \xe2\x80\x94 muddling along with growth of about 2 percent, which is too weak to push unemployment much below its current 8.6 percent.'b'And even that dismaying prospect assumes that Congress will extend the payroll tax cut and federal unemployment benefits beyond their expiration in late February. It also assumes that the inevitable recession in Europe and the expected slowdown in China will be shallow and pose no real threat to the United States recovery. If those assumptions are wrong, growth in the United States economy, if any, will be exceedingly meager and joblessness will rise.'b'It does not have to be this way. After nearly a year of trying to accommodate Republicans in their calls for excessive budget cuts, President Obama finally pushed a strong jobs bill including spending for public works, aid to state and local governments and an infrastructure bank, as well as renewal of a payroll tax break and jobless aid. Congressional Republicans blocked the bill, and with it, the chance to create some 1.9 million jobs. But late last month, the Republican leadership in the Senate and House retreated \xe2\x80\x94 even if extremists in the party did not \xe2\x80\x94 and managed to temporarily extend the payroll tax cut and jobless benefits.'b'The extension is only for two months, setting up another fight. But the good news is that in the showdown, Mr. Obama and the Democratic leadership did not back down. And at least some Republicans seemed to realize that their relentless calls for cutting may have a political cost.'b'The economy, and struggling Americans, need a lot more help. Mr. Obama needs to translate his newfound focus on the middle class into an agenda for broad prosperity, making the case that what the nation needs now is a large short-run effort to create jobs coupled with a plan to cut the deficit as the economy recovers.'b'Happy New Year!

Maybe there is, and we owe it to Fintan O\xe2\x80\x99Toole. That trenchant Irish commentator is a biographer and theater critic, and a critic also of his country\xe2\x80\x99s crimes and follies, as in his gripping if horrifying book, \xe2\x80\x9cShip of Fools: How Stupidity and Corruption Sank the Celtic Tiger.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He reminds us of the famous if gnomic saying by Donald H. Rumsfeld, then the United States secretary of defense, that \xe2\x80\x9cThere are known knowns... there are known unknowns ... there are also unknown unknowns.\xe2\x80\x9d But the Irish problem, says Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Toole, was none of the above. It was \xe2\x80\x9cunknown knowns.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What he means is something different from denial, or evasion, irrational exuberance or excess optimism. Unknown knowns were things that were not at all inevitable, and were easily knowable, or indeed known, but which people chose to \xe2\x80\x9cunknow.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Unknown knowns were everywhere, from Wall Street to Brussels, from the Pentagon to Penn State. Ireland merely happened to offer an extreme case, where \xe2\x80\x9ceveryone knew.\xe2\x80\x9d They just chose to forget that they knew \xe2\x80\x94 about the way that Irish banks ran wild, how easy credit fueled a monstrous explosion of property prices and speculative house-building. Bertie Ahern, the Irish prime minister at the time of the rapid economic growth, merely boasted, \xe2\x80\x9cThe boom is getting boomier,\xe2\x80\x9d preferring to unknow the truth that booms always go bust.'b'Beginning in 2008, the skies were lighted up by financial conflagrations, from Lehman Brothers to the Royal Bank of Scotland. These were dramatic enough \xe2\x80\x94 but were they unforeseeable or unknowable? What kind of willful obtusity ever suggested that subprime mortgages were a good idea? An intelligent child would have known that there is no good time to lend money to people who obviously can never repay it.'b'Or recall how we were taken into the Iraq war. That was the origin of Mr. Rumsfeld\xe2\x80\x99s curious words 10 years ago. When he murmured about \xe2\x80\x9cthings we do not know we don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d he was touching on the unconventional weapons that Saddam Hussein might \xe2\x80\x94 or might not \xe2\x80\x94 have held.'b'In a sense, Mr. Rumsfeld was more right than he realized. Those of us who opposed the war may be asked to this day whether we knew what weaponry Iraq possessed, to which the answer is that of course we didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Nor, as it transpired, did President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, Mr. Rumsfeld or Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.'b'But that was the wrong question. It should have been not \xe2\x80\x9cwhat weaponry does Saddam Hussein possess?\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cIs Saddam Hussein\xe2\x80\x99s weaponry, whatever it may be, the real reason for the war, or is it a pretext confected after a decision for war had already been taken?\xe2\x80\x9d The answer to that was obvious and could have been known to all, but too many people chose to unknow it.'b'Then there was another unknown known: the likely consequences of an invasion. Shortly before it began, Mr. Blair met President Jacques Chirac of France. As well as reiterating his opposition to the coming war, Mr. Chirac offered the prime minister specific warnings. Mr. Blair and his friends in Washington seemed to think that they would be welcomed with open arms in Iraq, Mr. Chirac said, but that they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t count on it. It was foolish to think of creating a modern democracy in an artificial country with a divided society like Iraq. And Mr. Chirac asked whether Mr. Blair realized that, by invading Iraq, they might yet precipitate a civil war.'b'This has been described in a BBC documentary by someone present, Sir Stephen Wall, a Foreign Office man then attached to Downing Street. As the British team was leaving, Mr. Blair turned and said, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor old Jacques, he just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get it,\xe2\x80\x9d to which Sir Stephen now adds dryly that he turned out to get it rather better than \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d did.'b'At that time, Mr. Chirac was reviled in America, and his career has just ended in 'b'disgrace'b', with a court conviction for embezzlement. But who was right about Iraq? All the calamities that followed the invasion were not only foreseeable, they were foreseen. And yet for Mr. Blair, as well as Washington, they were unknown knowns.'b'One more such, bitter as it is to say so when many people have been ruined, was the Bernard L. Madoff fraud. For years, his investors gratefully and unquestioningly accepted returns that were strictly incredible. Loud warning voices sounded. Harry Markopolos, a former investment officer, exhaustively back-analyzed Mr. Madoff\xe2\x80\x99s supposed figures by computer. He spent nearly nine years repeatedly trying to explain to the Securities and Exchange Commission that these figures were not merely incredible but mathematically impossible. And still the S.E.C. chose to unknow it. Leos Janacek wrote a harrowing opera called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Makropulos Affair\xe2\x80\x9d; Peter Gelb at the Met should commission someone to write \xe2\x80\x9cThe Markopolos Affair\xe2\x80\x9d as a fable for our times.'b'In a very different kind of scandal, not everyone at Penn State, and certainly not every fan, knew what had happened in the showers. But quite enough was known by people who could have acted. They chose instead to unknow. And so to another classic unknown known, the euro. The recent summit in Brussels turned into a silly melodrama, with a British prime minister, David Cameron this time, once more playing the pantomime villain. But Mr. Cameron was right, if for the wrong reasons, to oppose the European Union\xe2\x80\x99s latest frantic (and doomed) plan to prop up the euro.'b'If truth be told (but it so rarely is!), the euro cannot work and could never have worked. That is, a single currency embracing countries as diverse in social culture, productivity, work practices and taxation as Germany and Greece, or the Netherlands and Portugal, is economically impossible without much closer fiscal and financial union \xe2\x80\x94 which is politically impossible. Anyone could have known that at the time the euro was introduced, but for the rulers of the European Union it was their very own unknown known.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Cloud of Unknowing\xe2\x80\x9d is a medieval classic of mystical writing, and unknowing still hangs over us. It will be a happier new year if we can dispel some of that cloud, try to unknow less, and know a little more.'b'The struggle for racial integration is neither bygone nor exclusively Southern. In Westchester, north of New York City, county leaders are stonewalling federal authorities over a longstanding housing desegregation case. Led by County Executive Rob Astorino, they are defending an ultrawhite status quo against the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s effort to upend decades of housing discrimination.'b'In 2007, the Anti-Discrimination Center of Metro New York, a nonprofit advocacy and litigation group, sued Westchester, saying it had violated the False Claims Act by taking federal housing grants while falsely certifying that it was living up to its legal requirement to provide affordable housing without reinforcing racial segregation. In 2009 a federal judge ruled that the county had indeed \xe2\x80\x9cutterly failed\xe2\x80\x9d to meet its obligations and had misrepresented its desegregation efforts when it applied for more than $50 million in grants. It is still failing.'b'Westchester has dozens of communities where the black and Hispanic populations are negligible. Instead of working to change that, the county left it up to local officials to decide where affordable housing would be built while turning a blind eye to the exclusionary practices white communities use to keep out minorities and the poor \xe2\x80\x94 imposing minimum lot sizes, thwarting high-density development and shifting vacant land to other uses.'b'Rather than fight a losing case, Westchester settled in 2009. It signed a landmark consent decree obliging it to build at least 750 units of affordable housing in 31 wealthier, mostly white communities. It agreed to educate residents, real estate agents and landlords about fair-housing issues, to solicit housing development proposals from community leaders and groups, and to identify municipalities that were persistent in excluding minorities. Yet when the Board of Legislators passed a bill banning discrimination against tenants who pay with vouchers, Mr. Astorino vetoed it.'b'On Dec. 16, the Department of Housing and Urban Development sent a letter to James Johnson, the court-appointed monitor overseeing the settlement, the latest of several critical letters about the county listing its failures to meet its obligations.'b'Mr. Astorino and his allies have been pleading powerlessness, saying state laws granting home rule to local municipalities prevent them from doing anything meaningful to integrate Westchester. But as part of the agreement, the county admitted that it had the authority under state and federal law to challenge zoning rules and compel municipalities to integrate. Mr. Astorino and Westchester have a moral and a legal obligation to live up to the settlement. There is no excuse.'b'Is there a connection between last year\xe2\x80\x99s extreme weather events and global warming? The answers might be a lot clearer if the Republicans in Congress were less hostile to climate change research.'b'A typical year in the United States features three or four weather disasters costing more than $1 billion. In 2009 there were nine. Last year brought a dozen, at a cost of $52 billion, making it the most extreme year for weather since accurate record keeping began in the 19th century. There was drought in the Southwest while Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee destroyed homes and rerouted rivers in the Northeast. The most severe tornado ever recorded, and the most tornadoes recorded in a single month, flailed the Southeast. Floods drowned the Midwest.'b'Climate researchers have been cautious about linking individual events to rising global temperatures. Yet the evidence tells us the earth is warming, largely as a result of the burning of fossil fuels and other human activity. And many of last year\xe2\x80\x99s extreme weather events were consistent with the effects of climate change. A warming atmosphere will hold more water, supplying the fuel for storms; steadily rising temperatures are likely to promote droughts. Climate is a complex subject, and definitive answers will require more study. But as Justin Gillis 'b'recently noted in The Times'b', the political climate for that is not favorable. House Republicans, many of whom reject the scientific consensus about the human causes of global warming, took aim at almost every program that had to do with global warming.

The best way of easing that gridlock \xe2\x80\x94 not to mention saving gas, curbing pollution and finally finishing that novel \xe2\x80\x94 is public transit.'b'Yet, as more Americans are sensibly leaving their cars at home and opting for the bus or train, mass transit is in deep financial trouble. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are going over the cliff,\xe2\x80\x9d Elliot Sander, chairman of the Regional Plan Association, said recently. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will be back where we were in the 1970s and 1980s, where the older systems across the country are literally falling apart.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That alarm is not an idle one. But it comes with one piece of good news: the number of trips taken annually on public transit is now more than 10 billion and rising, compared with 7.8 billion trips in 1995, outstripping population growth and the number of miles traveled on streets and highways.'b'Ridership, which dipped during the recession in 2009, is rising again as more baby boomer retirees take buses and high gas prices push more people to try the thriftier option. Even some cities in areas dominated by cars \xe2\x80\x94 like 'b'Dallas'b' and 'b'Salt Lake City'b' \xe2\x80\x94 have expanded their public transit systems.'b'The problem is, financing for mass transit has not kept pace as cash-strapped state and local governments limit their support. The federal government, which provides only about 17 percent of financing for transit systems, should be doing a lot more, particularly since nearly 60 percent of rides are related to work, with commuters from every income level.'b'Of the 18.4 cents per gallon federal gas tax, only 2.86 cents goes to public transit and almost all of the rest is reserved for highways. Although Congress has increased transit support in recent years, it is still too stingy to maintain stable services in many areas. The Federal Transit Administration has estimated that to bring all of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s networks up to good repair \xe2\x80\x94 not expanding them, but mostly fixing what\xe2\x80\x99s already there \xe2\x80\x94 would take more than $78 billion.'b'Meanwhile, systems are relying more on fares or state and local money. Many have had to cut back services, increase fares, raise local taxes, lay off workers, borrow to meet operating costs and put off replacing old vehicles. The chart below shows how 16 large transit agencies coped with dwindling resources.'b'In Chicago, the Transit Authority has seen a huge drop in local funding, largely derived from sales taxes that plunged with the recession. Transit officials borrowed more than $550 million in a four-year period starting in 2008 to pay day-to-day expenses \xe2\x80\x94 a desperate and costly move. And even with fare increases, in 2010 bus service was cut 18 percent and rail service 9 percent.'b'In Atlanta, Beverly Scott, general manager of the 'b'Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority'b', said that her agency faced \xe2\x80\x9cmassive, draconian, horrifying\xe2\x80\x9d budget gaps in 2009. It consolidated bus routes and cut train service. That means more crowding and longer waits, even with higher fares. InBoston ridership is up, but so is debt; last year, virtually every dollar paid by riders went to debt service. The 'b'Metropolitan Transportation Authority'b' in New York, by far the nation\xe2\x80\x99s biggest, managed to balance its budget, but has also cut services and raised fares for three years.'b'The budget pain comes at a time when more people are finally realizing that public transit is a better deal than driving. The question is how we turn that into a broader cultural shift.'b'The president of the American Public Transportation Association, Michael Melaniphy, predicts that more commuters will reach a choking point and say: \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t sit in this car any longer and waste any more time.\xe2\x80\x9d On a bus, you can text friends legally. On a train, you can keep your eyes on a Kindle.

Much of the problem with today\xe2\x80\x99s Republican and Democratic parties is that they cast too wide a net and represent no one effectively. I believe that they are both effectively centrist. Both parties campaign at the extremes and govern in the center, and I find very little to actually distinguish one from the other.'b'Instead of trying to recruit centrists from the Republicans and the Democrats into a new party, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see two or more new parties that would siphon off the Tea Party-libertarian constituency, the progressive constituency and even the religious constituency. This would leave healthier Republican and Democratic parties, and allow people to more realistically vote their conscience. It\xe2\x80\x99s likely that no party would win a clear majority, and the resulting governing coalitions would be a more honest representation of the will of the people.'b'For any such multiparty plan to work, we will have to have major campaign finance reform, and a complete reworking of the election laws that give special privileges to the two major parties.'b'TIMOTHY TAYLOR'b'\nLathrup Village, Mich., Dec. 28, 2011'b''b'As a political consultant who worked to help Ross Perot craft his message for his 1996 campaign, I know the electoral rules of the game are rigged against third parties.

Reformers need to win only a small number of Congressional seats to give them the balance of power in organizing the next House.'b'Reformers can concentrate on just 30 to 40 competitive Congressional districts. Primary elections in competitive districts attract larger numbers of candidates, so the winner needs fewer votes \xe2\x80\x94 often a plurality, not a majority. And primaries have vastly reduced turnout.'b'These two factors allow an organized group of reform-minded voters to \xe2\x80\x9ctake over\xe2\x80\x9d a handful of close primaries in the two major parties.

Third parties in the past never confronted the gridlock, partisanship and dysfunction that exist in Washington today.

These parties never prospered over the long run because their platforms did not have broad national appeal, or because their leaders lost interest.'b'I agree with respondents like Mr. Freedland, who cast money and special interests as the villains in politics. But they are not going to go away as long as the Republicans and the Democrats hold power. The current parties are not going to relinquish their stranglehold on the political system voluntarily by agreeing to reform measures that will reduce their advantageous positions. The only way true electoral, campaign finance and ethical reform will be enacted is through a third party that is not in thrall to the special interests.'b'In response to Mr. Mooney and others who say that a third party needs to be progressive rather than centrist, I believe that the two are not mutually exclusive. As this new party would be guided by pragmatism and not constrained by ideology, on some issues it might veer to the left and on others to the right. In some areas, big government might be seen as the problem and in others as the solution. Market-based answers might work for some problems and worsen others.'b'When a centrist third party emerges, it will have to organize and be able to compete on a municipal, district, state and national level to gain credibility. And Mr. Richter\xe2\x80\x99s idea that a centrist third party should contest Congressional seats in order to hold the balance of power has validity. Even if a third party were able to have its candidate take the presidency, he or she would still have to deal with a gridlocked Congress.'b'The bottom line is that America\xe2\x80\x99s political system is broken and needs to be fixed if the nation is to deal successfully with the challenges ahead.

Although any medication can be inappropriately administered, the wholesale denigration of psychotropic medication for this population is misplaced.'b'People with autism do indeed have a brain disorder, and so using medications that treat the brain makes perfect sense. Many autistic patients have symptoms that warrant such medications for their own protection. These include behaviors like head banging, self-biting, sleeplessness and aggression.'b'I recently saw a patient in a developmental center who wore a helmet because of constant head-banging. When I asked what medications had been tried, staff members proudly told me that they had successfully avoided medicating this patient. But this decision came at a terrible cost to him, as his constant head-banging caused detachment of both retinas and blindness.'b'Articles implying that all psychotropic medications are inappropriate for this population do a terrible disservice. They make family members and staff members fearful of medications that can often make important quality-of-life improvements and, as a result, actually hurt the patients we desire to help.'b'ERIC LONDON'b'\nNew York, Dec. 26, 2011'b''b''b'The writer is a founding member of the scientific advisory board of the Autism Science Foundation.'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Better Care for the Disabled'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Dec. 21): I am the mother of a disabled adult who receives services from Wildwood Programs, an agency in upstate New York.

However, the process of change should not hurt those who are well served or those who provide their excellent care.'b'MARYBETH KALWEIT'b'\nSchenectady, N.Y., Dec. 23, 2011'b''b'ACCORDING to a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control, drug overdoses have increased almost six-fold in the last 30 years. They now represent the leading cause of accidental death in the United States, having overtaken motor vehicle accidents for the first time on record.'b'One might expect such news to spur politicians to explore new options for drug abuse treatment, prevention and enforcement. Instead, at precisely the wrong time, extremists on both sides have taken over the conversation. Unless we change the tone of the debate to give drug-policy centrists a voice, America\xe2\x80\x99s drug problem will only get worse.'b'Indeed, moderates have historically been key contributors to both the debate and the practice of effective drug policy. In 1914, Representative Francis B. Harrison, a New York Democrat, worked with Republicans and President Woodrow Wilson to pass the first major piece of federal 'b'anti-drug legislation'b', in response to a surge in heroin and cocaine use.'b'Other moderates, from Theodore Roosevelt to John F. Kennedy, made drug policy an important part of their domestic agendas. President Bill Clinton worked closely with Bob Dole, the Republican Senate majority leader, on sensible measures like drug courts and community policing. And Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is the reason there is a 'b'drug czar'b' in the first place, having pushed the idea for years before President Ronald Reagan approved it.'b'So where are the moderates now? Certainly, the current political climate makes it hard to come together on any question. Republicans are too timid to touch any domestic policy issue, like effective drug prevention and treatment, that might appear to cost taxpayers more money. And too many Democrats have yet to recognize that drugs are an issue that they and their constituents should care deeply about: after all, drug abuse and its consequences affect the most vulnerable in society in especially harmful ways.'b'In their place, a few tough-on-crime conservatives and die-hard libertarians dominate news coverage and make it appear as if legalizing drugs and \xe2\x80\x9cenforcement only\xe2\x80\x9d strategies were the only options, despite the fact that the public supports neither.'b'This stalemate comes just as a new range of cost-effective, evidence-based approaches to prevention, treatment and the criminal justice system are within our reach. We know much more about addiction than we did 20 years ago; with enough support, we could pursue promising medications and behavioral therapies, even a possible vaccine against some drug addictions.'b'Meanwhile, smart, innovative law enforcement strategies that employ carrots and sticks \xe2\x80\x94 treatment and drug testing complete with swift but modest consequences for continued drug use, or incentives for abstinence \xe2\x80\x94 have produced impressive results, through drug courts or closely supervised probation programs.'b'And drug prevention has moved from a didactic classroom exercise to a science of teaching life skills and changing environmental norms based on local data and community capacity. We now know that recovery from addiction is possible, and that policies that give former addicts a second chance are in everyone\xe2\x80\x99s interest.'b'Most recently, R. Gil Kerlikowske, President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s top drug policy adviser, introduced a sensible four-point plan to curb prescription drug abuse: educate prescribers, parents and young people about the dangers of overdose; shut down illegitimate \xe2\x80\x9cclinics\xe2\x80\x9d that freely sell these drugs; establish electronic monitoring at pharmacies; and encourage the proper disposal of unused medications. Yet his plan received little attention from the news media or Capitol Hill.'b'Of course, there is no magic bullet for America\xe2\x80\x99s drug problem. The magnitude and complexity of our drug problem require us to constantly refine and improve our policies through thoughtful analysis, innovation and discussion.'b'Moderates should lead that conversation. To remain silent not only betrays widely shared values of compassion and justice for the most vulnerable. It also leaves policy in the hands of extremists who would relegate a very serious and consequential discussion to frivolous and dangerous quarters.'b'The news that Oklahoma is now ready to accept and celebrate Woody Guthrie, the seminal American folk singer who died in 1967, as a native son with an exhibition and a study center for his archives is welcome if long overdue. The state resisted honoring him for decades, because of his leftist politics. \xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t a Communist necessarily,\xe2\x80\x9d Guthrie said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I been in the red all my life.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Guthrie, who wrote hundreds of songs during the Great Depression \xe2\x80\x94 about the jobless, the impoverished, the socially ostracized \xe2\x80\x94 is as relevant today as he was when he wandered and sang across the old Dust Bowl. His songs, some updated, could be heard during the recent Occupy protests. Any academic approach at the Tulsa center must not lose his fundamental sense of humanity or fallibility. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope that Woody will not be canonized where people try to examine every little word,\xe2\x80\x9d Pete Seeger, his friend and fellow proletariat-troubadour smartly cautioned decades ago.'b'There may be no sadder or more current song about the xenophobic demeaning of immigrants than Guthrie\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cDeportee,\xe2\x80\x9d a tragic ballad about Mexican farmworkers. Anybody caught singing his songs without permission, Guthrie once advised, \xe2\x80\x9cwill be mighty good friends of ours.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He wrote \xe2\x80\x9cThis Land Is Your Land\xe2\x80\x9d to reach beyond the national anthem to the ordinary citizens facing life\xe2\x80\x99s ups and downs with a lyrical edge. \xe2\x80\x9cAs I go walking that freedom highway/ Nobody living can ever make me turn back/ This land was made for you and me.\xe2\x80\x9d Guthrie would probably not have been surprised by Oklahoma\xe2\x80\x99s late embrace. \xe2\x80\x9cLife has got a habit of not standing hitched,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou got to ride it like you find it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Five years ago, New York State stopped requiring that all applicants for food stamps be electronically fingerprinted. Recently, California and Texas ended their requirement, leaving New York City and Arizona the only jurisdictions to continue the stigmatizing requirement.'b'Especially at a time when so many families are struggling, the Bloomberg administration should drop the requirement that leads too many New Yorkers to forgo help. If it does not, Gov. Andrew Cuomo should issue an executive order ending the city\xe2\x80\x99s exemption.'b'Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his human resources commissioner, Robert Doar, contend that fingerprint matching is essential for detecting and deterring fraud and avoiding costly duplications. But there is no evidence that finger-imaging is either cost-effective or necessary. Collecting fingerprints is useless for uncovering scams like government employees\xe2\x80\x99 making up phony cases or applicants\xe2\x80\x99 lying about their income. Matching applicants\xe2\x80\x99 names with Social Security numbers, as other jurisdictions do, would be cheaper and equally effective.'b'At a recent City Council hearing, Mr. Doar said that fingerprinting allows the city to find about 2,000 duplication errors annually. He could not say how many are due to fraud and how many to innocent administrative errors. Tellingly, he could not cite a single fraud prosecution.'b'Seeking to pressure the Bloomberg administration to end the requirement, Christine Quinn, the City Council speaker, is supporting a bill to require the administration to report annually on the number of cases of food stamp fraud detected, the number referred for prosecution and the cost of the fingerprinting program. It is expected to pass the Council in January. The fact that over 40 percent of eligible working New York families are not signed up for food stamps should be enough evidence to persuade City Hall to do things differently \xe2\x80\x94 or for Mr. Cuomo to force the issue if it will not.'b'The Republicans believe they have President Obama in a box: either he approves a controversial Canadian oil pipeline or they accuse him of depriving the nation of jobs. Mr. Obama can and should push back hard.'b'This is precisely the moment for him to argue the case for alternative fuel sources and clean energy jobs \xe2\x80\x94 and to lambaste the Republicans for doubling down on conventional fuels while ceding a $5 trillion global clean technology market (and the jobs that go with it) to more aggressive competitors like China and Germany.'b'The payroll tax cut bill, which Mr. Obama signed last month, gave him 60 days to decide on the Keystone XL pipeline. That is not enough time to complete the required environmental review of a project that, in its present design, crosses ecologically sensitive territory and risks polluting an aquifer critical to Midwestern water supplies.'b'The Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 claim that the pipeline will create tens of thousands of new jobs \xe2\x80\x94 20,000 according to House Speaker John Boehner and 100,000 according to Jon Huntsman \xe2\x80\x94 are wildly inflated. A more accurate forecast from the federal government, one with which TransCanada, the pipeline company, agrees, says the project would create 6,000 to 6,500 temporary construction jobs at best, for two years.'b'The country obviously needs more jobs. Mr. Obama needs to lay out the case that industry, with government help, can create hundreds of thousands of clean energy jobs without incurring environmental risks \xe2\x80\x94 by upgrading old power plants to comply with environmental laws, retrofitting commercial and residential buildings that soak up nearly 40 percent of the country\xe2\x80\x99s energy (and produce nearly 40 percent of its carbon emissions) and promoting growth in new industries like wind and solar power and advanced vehicles.'b'By even the most conservative estimates, the power plant upgrades required by the new rule governing mercury emissions are expected to create about 45,000 temporary construction jobs over the next five years, and as many as 8,000 permanent jobs as utilities install pollution control equipment. And while the projects are new and the numbers tentative, the Energy Department predicts that its loan guarantee programs could create more than 60,000 direct jobs in the solar and wind industries and in companies developing advanced batteries and other components for more fuel-efficient cars.'b'Much more needs to happen. Europe has encouraged the commercial development of carbon-reducing technologies with a robust mix of direct government investment and tax breaks, loans and laws that cap or tax greenhouse gas emissions. This country needs a comparably broad strategy that will create a pathway from the fossil fuels of today to the greener fuels of tomorrow.'b'We are under no illusions that such an appeal by Mr. Obama would win support among Republicans on Capitol Hill. House Republicans voted 191 times last year to undermine existing environmental protections or reject Democratic efforts to strengthen them \xe2\x80\x94 even killing off a modest regulation requiring more energy efficient light bulbs \xe2\x80\x94 and in general have vowed to resist new energy strategies or do anything at all that might disturb their patrons in the fossil fuel industries.'b'American voters are smart enough to see through the ridiculous pipeline gambit. And they will surely listen if Mr. Obama makes a compelling argument for both protecting the environment and investing in clean energy industries that will create lasting jobs.'b'Beijing'b'A PECULIAR feature of Chinese society is that a complaint process runs parallel to, but outside, the legal system.'b'Victims of corruption and injustice have no faith in the law, and yet they dream that an upright official will emerge to right their wrongs. Although a complaint mechanism is in place at all levels of Chinese government, petitioners seem to believe that the central authorities are less susceptible to corruption, and so make Beijing their destination. By some estimates, more than 10 million complaints are filed around the country each year, far more than are heard by the regular courts.'b'Law in China, at least on paper, is more firmly established than it once was, and some legal experts propose doing away with the grievance system. But the government has retained it \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps it, too, lacks confidence in China\xe2\x80\x99s laws. Also \xe2\x80\x94 and crucially \xe2\x80\x94 it wants to leave the petitioners some slender hope, a fantasy that one day injustice will find redress. If all hope is lost, petitioners may take more extreme action.'b'Often, the State Bureau for Letters and Visits simply goes through the motions of registering the complaints, then asks the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 local governments to look into them. But years of failure have sharpened the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 wits. They know that the only way they can put pressure on their local governments is by persistent, repeated visits to Beijing, and they realize that collective visits are even more effective. The government rigidly controls demonstrations, but the collective submission of a complaint remains a means for ordinary people to exert pressure.'b'At the same time, some petitioners have come to focus more on the process of lodging a complaint than on the outcome. Seeing the judiciary as biased and the grievance process as a sham, they treat petitioning as a means of extortion.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s an example. In the fall of 2007, during the Chinese Communist Party\xe2\x80\x99s 17th Congress, a man from Shandong Province phoned his village chief and told him he was in Tianjin and about to board a train for Beijing to appeal a miscarriage of justice. The village chief was shocked: if the petitioner were to appear in Tiananmen Square at such a prominent moment, not only would the chief lose his job, but his immediate superiors \xe2\x80\x94 the township and county chiefs \xe2\x80\x94 would be disgraced as well. He begged the villager not to go to Beijing. All right, the man said, but there was a price for his acquiescence: 20,000 yuan, about $2,600 at the time. The village chief put down the phone, withdrew this sum from public funds, and personally delivered it that very day, to the man\xe2\x80\x99s wife.'b'The pay-off should not surprise us. Alarmed by worsening social unrest, government officials have adopted \xe2\x80\x9cstability maintenance\xe2\x80\x9d as a mantra \xe2\x80\x94 and a pretext to stifle protest. While the grievance process coexists politely with the regular legal system, the insistence on maintaining stability is, all too often, utterly at odds with it.'b'The priority now given to keeping order has enabled local officials to regain the initiative when there are complaints or protests. In the name of maintaining stability, the interception and detention of petitioners seems perfectly reasonable, and higher-ups look the other way.'b'After the collision of two high-speed trains near the southeastern city of Wenzhou last July, relatives of those killed and injured rushed to the scene. Three days later, law offices in Wenzhou received an urgent notice from the local judicial bureau and lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 association: \xe2\x80\x9cThe train collision is a major, sensitive incident that bears on social stability.\xe2\x80\x9d The notice directed lawyers to \xe2\x80\x9cimmediately report\xe2\x80\x9d all requests for legal assistance to the judicial bureau and the lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 association and not to \xe2\x80\x9crespond to such requests without authorization.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When the contents of this circular were revealed by the news media, an uproar ensued. The lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 association took responsibility and issued an apology, saying it had issued the notice without judicial permission.'b'But the lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 association takes orders from the judiciary, so this apology was greeted on the Internet with derision. It reminded me of the old adage, \xe2\x80\x9cA soldier fears his superior more than he fears the foe.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The recent episode in Wukan, a village in southern China where residents staged an uprising that received international attention, reflected the uneven balance among the grievance process, the legal system and the insistence on stability. Local officials ignored complaints about corruption involving the sale of farmland and then cracked down on the subsequent protests. The uproar was eventually resolved through political arrangements, not judicial action.'b'In China, an extramarital love interest who comes between a happy couple is known pejoratively as \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Three.\xe2\x80\x9d The expression appears in a joke about three kindergartners who want to play house.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be the daddy,\xe2\x80\x9d the boy says.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be the mommy,\xe2\x80\x9d one girl says.'b'Another girl frowns: \xe2\x80\x9cI guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be Little Three.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If the law, the grievance process and stability maintenance were ever to play house, I think we\xe2\x80\x99d see the following exchange:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the daddy,\xe2\x80\x9d Stability Maintenance says.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the mommy,\xe2\x80\x9d Grievance Process says.'b'The Law pouts. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m Little Three.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Baghdad'b'THE Iraq the United States left behind last month is dramatically different from the country it invaded in 2003. Gone are the comforting simplicities of the \xe2\x80\x9cwar on terror\xe2\x80\x9d and democracy building. The geopolitical context that America has bequeathed to Iraq is now defined by five critical challenges.'b'First, Iraq is at the center of the American-Iranian confrontation; it is the only place where the American military has faced off directly against Iranian-backed militias.'b'Second, it stands in the middle of the conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia for regional supremacy. The Saudi royals oppose the current Iranian government but not necessarily the Iranian system itself; they might happily co-exist with a different Iranian leadership, as they did during the 1990s.'b'Third, as Turkey reasserts itself in the Middle East, both to counter Iran and to promote its own vision of modernizing Islamism, Iraq is in the middle once again. Turkey is a patron to the large Sunni-dominated Iraqiya parliamentary bloc and the biggest source of investment in the Iraqi Kurdistan region. And it is intimately involved in the affairs of the Kurdistan Regional Government, the K.R.G., in order to keep close tabs on Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s own Kurdish separatist movement, which is based there.'b'Fourth, Iraqi Kurdistan is thriving, and will most likely drift toward some form of de facto independence. It is already nearly there. The spectacle of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s fugitive vice president, Tariq al-Hashimi, holed up in Kurdistan beyond the reach of Baghdad, is the clearest proof. The K.R.G.\xe2\x80\x99s success in providing security and services \xe2\x80\x94 in contrast to the central government\xe2\x80\x99s dismal record \xe2\x80\x94 is now fueling demands for other autonomous regions throughout Iraq, posing a major challenge to the historically centralized and militarized Iraqi state.'b'Finally, the current atmosphere in the region reeks of an impending sectarian explosion. Shiite-Sunni conflict led Iraq to the brink of all-out civil war between 2005 and 2007. Today, a reprise of that disaster is quite possible. The triumphalism of Shiite politicians masks anxieties about their community\xe2\x80\x99s ascendancy. And the news media, especially Arabic-language satellite channels, are brimming with blatantly offensive sectarian sentiments and contributing to an atmosphere of crisis and impending disaster \xe2\x80\x94 prompted in no small measure by the nefarious work of bigoted and ignorant clerics, often inspired by the intolerant ideology of Wahhabist Islam.'b'The French historian Fernand Braudel used the term \xe2\x80\x9clongue dur\xc3\xa9e\xe2\x80\x9d to describe how changes in the deep socio-economic and technological structures of civilizations play out over long periods of time. Such shifts are as important in determining the history of societies and nations as major political events and crises.'b'The Middle East is today experiencing a twofold upheaval of immense proportions: a dramatic acceleration of climate change, water shortages, urban growth, environmental degradation, persistent economic and resource imbalances, and population explosions that coincide with wars, invasions, foreign interventions, civil and religious strife, and mass uprisings. And the longue dur\xc3\xa9e is now exerting its influence on Iraq.'b'The livelihood of Iraqis is overly dependent on a state that is entirely reliant on a single resource. Agriculture has effectively collapsed; the great river systems of Mesopotamia have shriveled; trade routes based on Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s unique geography have vanished; and transport links have atrophied. Merchants and entrepreneurs are merely recyclers of state-owned and state-generated wealth and a previously open and culturally and religiously accommodating society has been replaced by beleaguered communities locked in laagers.'b'The Arab successor states to the Ottoman Empire have all proved to be unstable, prone to violence and easy targets of foreign intervention and control. Left unchecked, Iraq will remain hostage to the turbulent region in which it finds itself \xe2\x80\x94 and to the price of oil.'b'This is Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s legacy, but it need not be its destiny. Iraq must reimagine the Middle East, creating new economic, security and political structures that weave Middle Eastern countries closer together while peacefully accommodating the region\xe2\x80\x99s ethnic and religious diversity.'b'In the American-Iranian cold war, Iraq must resist being dragged into a confrontation. We have real interests on both sides and can play an important role in mediating and even defusing that conflict.'b'In the regional struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran, Iraq must stand on the side of justice and equity by pushing for free and fair elections, representative government, minority rights and the rule of law in places like Bahrain, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.'b'Iraq should welcome Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s return to the Middle East, not as a neo-Ottoman Empire but as a successful example of a dynamic economy rooted in a democratic state that respects its Islamic heritage.'b'And it could halt the drift of the K.R.G. toward independence by creating open and fair Iraqi national institutions and civic culture. These are the best guarantors of national unity.'b'Finally, to prevent a sectarian war in the Middle East, Iraq must resist the rhetoric of extremists and push for an inclusive understanding of Islam that undermines the viciousness of hateful ideologues.'b'The passivity and indifference of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s leaders to these fundamental challenges contrasts with the ferocity with which they have fought their battles for political power and influence, and the frenzy with which they have sought material gain for themselves and their cronies.'b'Wise leadership and statesmanship could lead us out of this morass. Failing that, the forces buffeting Iraq and the region may very well lead us to a catastrophe.'b'In 2011, as in 2010, America was in a technical recovery but continued to suffer from disastrously high unemployment. And through most of 2011, as in 2010, almost all the conversation in Washington was about something else: the allegedly urgent issue of reducing the budget deficit.'b'This misplaced focus said a lot about our political culture, in particular about how disconnected Congress is from the suffering of ordinary Americans. But it also revealed something else: when people in D.C. talk about deficits and debt, by and large they have no idea what they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about \xe2\x80\x94 and the people who talk the most understand the least.'b'Perhaps most obviously, the economic \xe2\x80\x9cexperts\xe2\x80\x9d on whom much of Congress relies have been repeatedly, utterly wrong about the short-run effects of budget deficits. People who get their economic analysis from the likes of the Heritage Foundation have been waiting ever since President Obama took office for budget deficits to send interest rates soaring. Any day now!'b'And while they\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting, those rates have dropped to historical lows. You might think that this would make politicians question their choice of experts \xe2\x80\x94 that is, you might think that if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about our postmodern, fact-free politics.'b'But Washington isn\xe2\x80\x99t just confused about the short run; it\xe2\x80\x99s also confused about the long run. For while debt can be a problem, the way our politicians and pundits think about debt is all wrong, and exaggerates the problem\xe2\x80\x99s size.'b'Deficit-worriers portray a future in which we\xe2\x80\x99re impoverished by the need to pay back money we\xe2\x80\x99ve been borrowing. They see America as being like a family that took out too large a mortgage, and will have a hard time making the monthly payments.'b'This is, however, a really bad analogy in at least two ways.'b'First, families have to pay back their debt. Governments don\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x94 all they need to do is ensure that debt grows more slowly than their tax base. The debt from World War II was never repaid; it just became increasingly irrelevant as the U.S. economy grew, and with it the income subject to taxation.'b'Second \xe2\x80\x94 and this is the point almost nobody seems to get \xe2\x80\x94 an over-borrowed family owes money to someone else; U.S. debt is, to a large extent, money we owe to ourselves.'b'This was clearly true of the debt incurred to win World War II. Taxpayers were on the hook for a debt that was significantly bigger, as a percentage of G.D.P., than debt today; but that debt was also owned by taxpayers, such as all the people who bought savings bonds. So the debt didn\xe2\x80\x99t make postwar America poorer. In particular, the debt didn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent the postwar generation from experiencing the biggest rise in incomes and living standards in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s history.'b'But isn\xe2\x80\x99t this time different? Not as much as you think.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s true that foreigners now hold large claims on the United States, including a fair amount of government debt. But every dollar\xe2\x80\x99s worth of foreign claims on America is matched by 89 cents\xe2\x80\x99 worth of U.S. claims on foreigners. And because foreigners tend to put their U.S. investments into safe, low-yield assets, America actually 'b'earns more'b' from its assets abroad than it pays to foreign investors. If your image is of a nation that\xe2\x80\x99s already deep in hock to the Chinese, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been misinformed. Nor are we heading rapidly in that direction.'b'Now, the fact that federal debt isn\xe2\x80\x99t at all like a mortgage on America\xe2\x80\x99s future doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that the debt is harmless. Taxes must be levied to pay the interest, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be a right-wing ideologue to concede that taxes impose some cost on the economy, if nothing else by causing a diversion of resources away from productive activities into tax avoidance and evasion. But these costs are a lot less dramatic than the analogy with an overindebted family might suggest.'b'And that\xe2\x80\x99s why nations with stable, responsible governments \xe2\x80\x94 that is, governments that are willing to impose modestly higher taxes when the situation warrants it \xe2\x80\x94 have historically been able to live with much higher levels of debt than today\xe2\x80\x99s conventional wisdom would lead you to believe. Britain, in particular, has had 'b'debt exceeding'b' 100 percent of G.D.P. for 81 of the last 170 years. When Keynes was writing about the need to spend your way out of a depression, Britain was deeper in debt than any advanced nation today, with the exception of Japan.'b'Of course, America, with its rabidly antitax conservative movement, may not have a government that is responsible in this sense. But in that case the fault lies not in our debt, but in ourselves.'b'So yes, debt matters. But right now, other things matter more. We need more, not less, government spending to get us out of our unemployment trap. And the wrongheaded, ill-informed obsession with debt is standing in the way.'b'The Obama administration surprised supporters and critics when it decided to let states define the \xe2\x80\x9cessential health benefits\xe2\x80\x9d that must be provided to their citizens under health care reform. The move could lessen opposition in Republican-led states and increase the chances that they will move ahead on building new health insurance exchanges to comply with the reform law.'b'The impact on most consumers may be minimal. Even the most fiercely antiregulation states will not be free to approve extremely miserly policies, because they will have to be comparable to popular and fairly comprehensive \xe2\x80\x9cbenchmark\xe2\x80\x9d private plans. There are concerns that insurance company lobbyists \xe2\x80\x94 who are even more powerful in many states than in Washington \xe2\x80\x94 will find ways to shape requirements to favor their bottom lines rather than consumers. In the longer run, it would be better to set a national standard. That would also be easier for federal regulators to monitor.'b'The health care reform law requires private health insurers that sell policies to individuals and small businesses to provide, starting in 2014, a set of \xe2\x80\x9cessential health benefits\xe2\x80\x9d in 10 categories, including hospitalization, ambulatory care, maternity care, prescription drugs and laboratory services. The law also said the benefits should be comparable to those provided under \xe2\x80\x9ca typical employer plan.\xe2\x80\x9d But it left it up to the secretary of health and human services to define what benefits are \xe2\x80\x9cessential\xe2\x80\x9d and what employer plans are \xe2\x80\x9ctypical.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Now Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has passed those decisions to the states, at least for a two-year transition period in 2014 and 2015. The benchmark the states will be required to use could be one of the three largest plans covering small businesses, state employees or federal employees in the state or the largest health maintenance organization serving commercial customers.'b'The administration contends that a similar benchmarking approach has worked well in the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Health Insurance Program. It also believes that differences among the states in demographics, economics, patterns of illness and the way medicine is practiced warrant starting cautiously from current benchmarks.'b'Federal health officials will need to monitor developments during the transition period to make sure consumers and employers can easily compare the benefit packages offered by private insurers. In the long run, it would seem best to move toward a system in which all Americans enjoy the same benefits with only limited state-by-state adjustments.'b'GOVERNMENTS and newspapers around the world attributed the horrific Christmas Day bombings of churches in Nigeria to \xe2\x80\x9cBoko Haram\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a shadowy group that is routinely described as an extremist Islamist organization based in the northeast corner of Nigeria. Indeed, since the May inauguration of President Goodluck Jonathan, a Christian from the Niger Delta in the country\xe2\x80\x99s south, Boko Haram has been blamed for virtually every outbreak of violence in Nigeria.'b'But the news media and American policy makers are chasing an elusive and ill-defined threat; there is no proof that a well-organized, ideologically coherent terrorist group called Boko Haram even exists today. Evidence suggests instead that, while the original core of the group remains active, criminal gangs have adopted the name Boko Haram to claim responsibility for attacks when it suits them.'b'The United States must not be drawn into a Nigerian \xe2\x80\x9cwar on terror\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 rhetorical or real \xe2\x80\x94 that would make us appear biased toward a Christian president. Getting involved in an escalating sectarian conflict that threatens the country\xe2\x80\x99s unity could turn Nigerian Muslims against America without addressing any of the underlying problems that are fueling instability and sectarian strife in Nigeria.'b'Since August, when Gen. Carter F. Ham, the commander of the United States Africa Command, warned that Boko Haram had links to Al Qaeda affiliates, the perceived threat has grown. Shortly after General Ham\xe2\x80\x99s warning, the United Nations\xe2\x80\x99 headquarters in Abuja was bombed, and simplistic explanations blaming Boko Haram for Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s mounting security crisis became routine. Someone who claims to be a spokesman for Boko Haram \xe2\x80\x94 with a name no one recognizes and whom no one has been able to identify or meet with \xe2\x80\x94 has issued threats and statements claiming responsibility for attacks. Remarkably, the Nigerian government and the international news media have simply accepted what he says.'b'In late November, a subcommittee of the House Committee on Homeland Security issued a report with the provocative title: \xe2\x80\x9cBoko Haram: Emerging Threat to the U.S. Homeland.\xe2\x80\x9d The report makes no such case, but nevertheless proposes that the organization be added to America\xe2\x80\x99s list of foreign terrorist organizations. The State Department\xe2\x80\x99s Africa bureau disagrees, but pressure from Congress and several government agencies is mounting.'b'Boko Haram began in 2002 as a peaceful Islamic splinter group. Then politicians began exploiting it for electoral purposes. But it was not until 2009 that Boko Haram turned to violence, especially after its leader, a young Muslim cleric named Mohammed Yusuf, was killed while in police custody. Video footage of Mr. Yusuf\xe2\x80\x99s interrogation soon went viral, but no one was tried and punished for the crime. Seeking revenge, Boko Haram targeted the police, the military and local politicians \xe2\x80\x94 all of them Muslims.'b'It was clear in 2009, as it is now, that the root cause of violence and anger in both the north and south of Nigeria is endemic poverty and hopelessness. Influential Nigerians from Maiduguri, where Boko Haram is centered, pleaded with Mr. Jonathan\xe2\x80\x99s government in June and July not to respond to Boko Haram with force alone. Likewise, the American ambassador, Terence P. McCulley, has emphasized, both privately and publicly, that the government must address socio-economic deprivation, which is most severe in the north. No one seems to be listening.'b'Instead, approximately 25 percent of Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s budget for 2012 is allocated for security, even though the military and police routinely respond to attacks with indiscriminate force and killing. Indeed, according to many Nigerians I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to from the northeast, the army is more feared than Boko Haram.'b'Meanwhile, Boko Haram has evolved into a franchise that includes criminal groups claiming its identity. Revealingly, Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s State Security Services issued a statement on Nov. 30, identifying members of four \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal syndicates\xe2\x80\x9d that send threatening text messages in the name of Boko Haram. Southern Nigerians \xe2\x80\x94 not northern Muslims \xe2\x80\x94 ran three of these four syndicates, including the one that led the American Embassy and other foreign missions to issue warnings that emptied Abuja\xe2\x80\x99s high-end hotels. And last week, the security services arrested a Christian southerner wearing northern Muslim garb as he set fire to a church in the Niger Delta. In Nigeria, religious terrorism is not always what it seems.'b'None of this excuses Boko Haram\xe2\x80\x99s killing of innocents. But it does raise questions about a rush to judgment that obscures Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s complex reality.'b'Many Nigerians already believe that the United States unconditionally supports Mr. Jonathan\xe2\x80\x99s government, despite its failings. They believe this because Washington praised the April elections that international observers found credible, but that many Nigerians, especially in the north, did not. Likewise, Washington\xe2\x80\x99s financial support for Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s security forces, despite their documented human rights abuses, further inflames Muslim Nigerians in the north.'b'Mr. Jonathan\xe2\x80\x99s recent actions have not helped matters. He told Nigerians last week, \xe2\x80\x9cThe issue of bombing is one of the burdens we must live with.\xe2\x80\x9d On New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve, he declared a state of emergency in parts of four northern states, leading to increased military activity there. And on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, he removed a subsidy on petroleum products, more than doubling the price of fuel. In a country where 90 percent of the population lives on $2 or less a day, anger is rising nationwide as the costs of transport and food increase dramatically.'b'Since Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s return to civilian rule in 1999, many politicians have used ethnic and regional differences and, most disastrously, religion for their own purposes. Northern Muslims \xe2\x80\x94 indeed, all Nigerians \xe2\x80\x94 are desperate for a government that responds to their most basic needs: personal security and hope for improvement in their lives. They are outraged over government policies and expenditures that undermine both.'b'The United States should not allow itself to be drawn into this quicksand by focusing on Boko Haram alone. Washington is already seen by many northern Muslims \xe2\x80\x94 including a large number of longtime admirers of America \xe2\x80\x94 as biased toward a Christian president from the south. The United States must work to avoid a self-fulfilling prophecy that makes us into their enemy. Placing Boko Haram on the foreign terrorist list would cement such views and make more Nigerians fear and distrust America.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Darrell Driver, Jin Pak and Kyle Jette, in their Dec. 27 Op-Ed essay, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t Go After Military Pensions'b',\xe2\x80\x9d make the case for the military retaining its pension system for those who have served 20 years. Their argument neglects about 83 percent of current military veterans, according to a 'b'report'b' from the Defense Business Board.'b'The military pension system is a very generous retirement benefit for those members who serve a full 20 years. Any soldier who serves 19.5 years, though, walks away with no retirement benefit. For the vast majority of soldiers, myself included, the promise of a pension 20 years away was not the reason for joining the military, and not a compelling enough incentive to stay 20 years.'b'The reasons the writers cite for keeping the pension benefit \xe2\x80\x94 that service members typically cannot build home equity, have trouble finding work for their spouses and have difficulty finding civilian employment \xe2\x80\x94 are equally good reasons for the Pentagon to offer better assistance to all separating soldiers.'b'STEPHEN GIFFORD'b' New Haven, Dec. 27, 2011'b''b''b'The writer is a former Army captain and veteran of two tours in Iraq.

The writers, three Army officers, imply that the United States may be forced to return to conscription should cuts in these benefits make it difficult for the military to recruit volunteers if the country were to enter another major armed conflict.'b'The important question is not whether pension cuts might harm military recruitment, but whether devoting disproportionate resources to the military in a nation straining under its financial burdens undermines civilian interests. The veiled threat of a return to conscription distracts from this needed discussion.'b'JEREMY ABRAMOWITZ'b' Washington, Dec. 27, 2011'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'It is time to revisit military pensions. The general rule is that a military retiree receives a lifetime annuity of 50 percent of his or her basic pay after 20 years of service. A large percentage of military retirees begin receiving their pension before 50 and have skills or leadership experiences that are transferrable to civilian-sector employment. It is reasonable to expect military retirees to have a future work history just as civilians are expected to work to 65.'b'A recent government report indicates that military personnel are now paid more than comparable federal civilian employees, so the retirement benefits are greater for today\xe2\x80\x99s retirees than in the past. Moreover, the education and training benefits are now superior to the benefits offered in the past.'b'One possibility for reform would be an initial annuity of 25 percent of base pay that would increase 1 percent a year until it reaches the 50 percent level.'b'BILL MORSE'b' Hayward, Calif., Dec. 27, 2011'b''b''b'The writer worked on veterans affairs for 30 years.'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'It is simply amazing that some bureaucrats at the Pentagon would even consider changing the military retirement system to a market-based (401K) program.

Residents here say they have never seen anything like the constant negativity in decades of witnessing the quadrennial combat of the state presidential caucuses. The ads have transformed the Republican race for a simple reason: a new landscape of unlimited contributions to \xe2\x80\x9cindependent\xe2\x80\x9d groups that was created by the Supreme Court.'b'To influence the small fraction of Iowa voters who will participate in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s caucuses, the candidates and their supporters will have spent $12.5 million, an unprecedented amount. Only a third of that was spent by the candidates themselves; the rest comes from the \xe2\x80\x9csuper PACs\xe2\x80\x9d that most of the candidates have allowed to be established. These political action committees are essentially septic tanks into which wealthy individuals and corporations can drop unlimited amounts of money, which is then processed into ads that are theoretically made independently of the candidates.'b'But the PACs are, in fact, a vital part of the campaigns\xe2\x80\x99 strategy. They are run by intimates of each candidate, and whether they actually communicate in detail about the timing and content of particular ads is beside the point. In many cases, the PACs (most of which have not disclosed their donors) have clearly been assigned the dirty work of tearing down a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s opponent, while the candidate gets to hide behind sunny, stirring ads ending with a statement of approval of the message.'b'The best example is Mitt Romney, whose campaign has spent more than $1 million on upbeat ads about his work in the private sector, his long marriage and his devotion to his church. 'b'One even featured his wife, Ann'b', talking about the importance of character in a candidate. Meanwhile, his PAC, Restore Our Future, has spent $2.85 million largely to attack other candidates, in particular Newt Gingrich. As Nicholas Confessore and Jim Rutenberg 'b'put it in The Times on Saturday'b', Mr. Romney \xe2\x80\x9chas effectively outsourced his negative advertising to a group that has raised millions of dollars from his donors to inundate his opponents with attacks.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'These ads, attacking Mr. Gingrich for his government lobbying and ethics violations, are the major reason why his support has tumbled since they were first broadcast a month ago. But they do not bear Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s fingerprints, and thus avoid the taint of voter disapproval that often accompanies negative ads. In one example, 'b'a Restore Our Future ad'b' attacks both Mr. Gingrich and Rick Perry as \xe2\x80\x9ctoo liberal on immigration, too much baggage on ethics.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s name is never mentioned, and few viewers will realize that the ad\xe2\x80\x99s producers are all close associates of his who worked on his campaign four years ago.'b'Mr. Gingrich has complained about the assault, but a few days ago his super PAC, Winning Our Future, began running ads saying the attack ads were \xe2\x80\x9cfalsehoods.\xe2\x80\x9d It also has been urging viewers not to let \xe2\x80\x9cthe liberal Republican establishment pick our candidate,\xe2\x80\x9d presumably a reference to Mr. Romney.'b'These primary ads, of course, are just a preview of what lies in store when the heavy armament is rolled out for the general election. President Obama already has a Super PAC, Priorities USA, that hopes to raise at least $100 million and can be expected to return the fire already coming from the Republican PACs. The president, too, will not be heard saying he approves of their messages.'b'As bad as the 2010 midterm elections were for the influence of big money, this year\xe2\x80\x99s presidential campaign \xe2\x80\x94 the first since the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s Citizens United decision two years ago \xe2\x80\x94 is shaping up to be worse. There are no limits to the dollars involved, and no accountability for the candidates those dollars are buying.'b'Des Moines'b'Given how assiduously plotted every last detail of Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s events has been, it was impossible not to wonder about the levels of meaning in the song blaring from speakers in Ames, Iowa, as he loped to the microphone on a recent night.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEye of the Tiger\xe2\x80\x9d was the anthem of the moment.

Years back, he was light blue; now, he\xe2\x80\x99s red; by next fall, if he gets there, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be purplish. He adapts to his context.

In Council Bluffs, Iowa, he cracked that the gap between Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s pledges and performance is \xe2\x80\x9cthe largest I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, well, since the Kardashian wedding and the promise of \xe2\x80\x98til death do we part.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Mitt and Kim, a marriage of the utmost convenience.'b'The attention to atmospherics is extraordinary. In Atlantic, Iowa, he notably bypassed the Pizza Ranch, a Christian-affiliated chain that his rivals have visited. Why? His watchful aides had determined that one of its founders did prison time for sexually abusing employees, as A.G. Sulzberger and Michael Barbaro 'b'reported'b' in The Times.'b'So no pepperoni for Mitt. Instead he hit a different restaurant down the road. Its name? The Family Table.'b'Romney is as limber as almost any politician I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen. As soon as complaints about his avoidance of interviews reached a crescendo last month, he started popping up everywhere and chattering ad nauseam. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t escape him.'b'A week ago, he had no definite plans to spend as much time in Iowa as he ended up doing over the last few days. But when polls suggested that he had a good shot at winning the caucuses, he scrambled, and after leaving the state Friday for New Hampshire, he was back on Saturday. He stumped on Sunday with bags under his eyes.'b'Is he really conservative? Moderate? To watch him deliver his gauzy stump speech is to behold a beautifully framed, impeccably coiffed blur: a vague shimmer of presidential-looking light that means everything and nothing.'b'The takeaway from the speech? Romney good. America great. Obama bad. America in trouble.'b'He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t delve into the soporific specifics pouring out of Rick Santorum, who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know a sound bite if it ripped off his sweater vest. So you can fill in the blanks as you like.'b'In the primaries, that\xe2\x80\x99s a liability, and Santorum, with his ideological rigidity, could haunt Romney for a while. But if Romney nabs the nomination, his malleability may be an asset, allowing Obama-soured voters to talk themselves into him. After all, a creature without passionate conviction doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cling to extremes. He surveys the scenery and makes sure his outfit doesn\xe2\x80\x99t clash.'b'Democrats have considered all this. They\xe2\x80\x99re questioning whether flip-flop barbs are the best weapons against Romney in a battle for swing voters.'b'As for Romney, he has to spend the primaries claiming inalterable conservative stripes. That\xe2\x80\x99s the nature of the game. But there are paisleys in his wardrobe as well. Maybe polka dots, too.'b'Ottumwa, Iowa'b'The Republican Party is the party of the white working class. This group \xe2\x80\x94 whites with high school degrees and maybe some college \xe2\x80\x94 is still the largest block in the electorate. They overwhelmingly favor Republicans.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a diverse group, obviously, but its members generally share certain beliefs and experiences. The economy has been moving away from them. The ethnic makeup of the country is shifting away from them. They sense that the nation has gone astray: marriage is in crisis; the work ethic is eroding; living standards are in danger; the elites have failed; the news media sends out messages that make it harder to raise decent kids. They face greater challenges, and they\xe2\x80\x99re on their own.'b'The Republicans harvest their votes but have done a poor job responding to their needs. The leading lights of the party tend to be former College Republicans who have a more individualistic and even Randian worldview than most members of the working class. Most Republican presidential candidates, from George H.W. Bush to John McCain to Mitt Romney, emerge from an entirely different set of experiences.'b'Occasionally you get a candidate, like Tim Pawlenty, who grew up working class. But he gets sucked up by the consultants, the donors and the professional party members and he ends up sounding like every other Republican. Other times a candidate will emerge who taps into a working-class vibe \xe2\x80\x94 Pat Buchanan, Mike Huckabee or Sarah Palin. But, so far, these have been flawed candidates who get buried under an avalanche of negative ads and brutal coverage.'b'This year, Romney is trying to establish some emotional bond with the working class by waging a hyperpatriotic campaign: I may be the son of a millionaire with a religion that makes you uncomfortable, but I love this country just like you. The strategy appears to be only a partial success.'b'Enter Rick Santorum.'b'Santorum is the grandson of a coal miner and the son of an Italian immigrant. For years, he represented the steel towns of western Pennsylvania. He has spent the last year scorned by the news media \xe2\x80\x94 working relentlessly, riding around in a pickup truck to more than 370 towns. He tells that story of hard work and elite disrespect with great fervor at his meetings.'b'His worldview is not individualistic. His book, \xe2\x80\x9cIt Takes a Family,\xe2\x80\x9d was infused with the conservative wing of Catholic social teaching. It was a broadside against Barry Goldwater-style conservatism in favor of one that emphasized family and social solidarity. While in Congress, he was a leader in nearly every serious piece of antipoverty legislation. On the stump, he cries, \xe2\x80\x9cThe left has a religion, too. It\xe2\x80\x99s just not based on the Bible. It\xe2\x80\x99s based on the religion of self.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Santorum does not have a secular worldview. This is not just a matter of going to church and home-schooling his children. When his baby Gabriel died at childbirth, he and his wife, a neonatal nurse, spent the night in a hospital bed with the body and then took it home \xe2\x80\x94 praying over it and welcoming it, with their other kids, into the family. This story tends to be deeply creepy to many secular people but inspiring to many of the more devout.'b'He is not a representative of the corporate or financial wing of the party. Santorum certainly wants to reduce government spending (faster even than Representative Paul Ryan). He certainly wants tax reform. But he goes out of his way in his speeches to pick fights with the \xe2\x80\x9csupply-siders.\xe2\x80\x9d He scorns the Wall Street bailouts. His economic arguments are couched as values arguments: If you want to enhance long-term competitiveness, you need to strengthen families. If companies want productive workers, they need to be embedded in wholesome communities.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know how his campaign will fare after a late surge that he is experiencing in Iowa. These days, he is a happy and effective campaigner, but, in the past, there has been a dourness and rigidity to him. He\xe2\x80\x99s been consumed by resentment over unfair media coverage. As his ally in the AIDS fight, Bono, once told a reporter, Santorum seems to have a Tourette\xe2\x80\x99s syndrome that causes him to say the most unpopular thing imaginable.'b'But I suspect he will do better post-Iowa than most people think \xe2\x80\x94 before being buried under a wave of money and negative ads. And I do believe that he represents sensibility and a viewpoint that is being suppressed by the political system. Perhaps, in less rigid and ideological form, this working-class experience will someday find a champion.'b'If you took a working-class candidate from the right, like Santorum, and a working-class candidate from the left, like Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, and you found a few islands of common ground, you could win this election by a landslide. The country doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want an election that is Harvard Law versus Harvard Law.'b'Central Falls, R.I., is a speck of a city, one square mile of triple-decker houses and tired storefronts a few miles up the road from the state capital, Providence. It is the poorest city in Rhode Island, with 27 percent of its residents below the poverty line, 'b'according to the Census Bureau'b'. Earlier this year, it started 'b'bankruptcy proceedings'b'. Its mayor, who is the subject of a state police investigation, 'b'has been pushed aside'b' in favor of a receiver, who has taken control of the city\xe2\x80\x99s finances.'b'Central Falls, though, also has one of the most promising reading experiments in the country. 'b'The Learning Community'b', a local 'b'charter school'b', and the Central Falls public elementary schools 'b'have joined forces'b' in a collaboration that has resulted in dramatic improvements in the reading scores of the public schoolchildren from kindergarten to grade 2. Given the mistrust of charter schools by public schoolteachers, creating this collaboration was no small feat. And while the city\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy now threatens it, the Central Falls experiment not only needs to be preserved, it should be replicated across the country. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen anything that makes more sense.'b'When 'b'I last wrote about public schools'b', it was through the prism of Steven Brill\xe2\x80\x99s book, \xe2\x80\x9cClass Warfare: Inside the Fight to Fix America\xe2\x80\x99s Schools.\xe2\x80\x9d Though a fan of the charter school movement, Brill concluded that, by themselves, charters were never going to fix what ails the nation\xe2\x80\x99s public schools; you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly scale them to encompass 50 million public school students.'b'As it turns out, Meg O\xe2\x80\x99Leary and Sarah Friedman, the co-founders of The Learning Community, had gotten there a whole lot earlier. Before starting The Learning Community in 2004, they spent three years working with the Providence school system on a pilot program designed to come up with ways to \xe2\x80\x9ctransform teaching practices and improve outcomes,\xe2\x80\x9d says Friedman. During a time of upheaval in the school system, a small corps of great teachers were the real anchors in the schools. In setting up The Learning Community, O\xe2\x80\x99Leary and Friedman wanted to apply the best practices they had learned during the Providence project \xe2\x80\x94 and, eventually, to use their knowledge to help public school districts in Rhode Island.'b'They got their chance in 2007, when 'b'Frances Gallo'b' became the Central Falls Schools superintendent. After she got the job, Gallo stopped in on several families just as they had learned that their children had won a spot (via lottery) in The Learning Community. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were so excited,\xe2\x80\x9d recalls Gallo. She wanted to understand why.'b'So Gallo began spending time at The Learning Community \xe2\x80\x94 where she, too, became excited. The school drew from the same population as the public schools. It had the same relatively large class sizes. It did not screen out students with learning disabilities. Yet the percentage of students who read at or above their grade level was significantly higher than the public school students. When Gallo asked O\xe2\x80\x99Leary and Friedman if they would apply their methods to the public schools, 'b'they jumped at it'b'.'b'Did everything go smoothly at first? Not even close. \xe2\x80\x9cAt first it was, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, here comes another initiative,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d recalls Friedman. There were plenty of \xe2\x80\x9cventing\xe2\x80\x9d sessions at the beginning, along with both resentment and resistance. But The Learning Community invited the teachers to visit its classrooms, where the public school teachers saw the same thing Gallo had seen. And very quickly they also began to see results. Most public schoolteachers yearn to see their students succeed \xe2\x80\x94 just like charter schoolteachers do. Most of the resistance melted away.'b'There is another important element to this collaboration: The Learning Community advisers who work most closely with Central Falls teachers haven\xe2\x80\x99t just done a fly-by. They have worked hand in hand with their public school colleagues for three years. They have been a constant, encouraging presence. They have developed relationships. And they have treated the public schoolteachers with respect. It makes a huge difference.'b'Early on, O\xe2\x80\x99Leary and Friedman convinced Gallo to hire reading specialists for Central Falls. (The Learning Community\xe2\x80\x99s methods call for a great deal of one-on-one instruction, especially when a teacher sees a student beginning to lag behind.) Ann Lynch, a Central Falls elementary school principal, told me that budget cuts have already forced her to cut back from two specialists to one. Everybody is worried about more cuts: the combination of the bankruptcy and a new state funding formula \xe2\x80\x94 which will cut back some state financing for 'b'the Central Falls School District'b' \xe2\x80\x94 has people fearful that The Learning Community\xe2\x80\x99s project will be pared back, too.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen. What is happening between this one charter school and this one school district offers an all-too-rare chance for optimism \xe2\x80\x94 not just about Central Falls\xe2\x80\x99s public schools, but America\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'A stinging 'b'opinion'b' by Justice Elena Kagan for a unanimous Supreme Court reinforced last month a message that lower courts have been 'b'sending'b' for many years: the law applied in immigration cases too often fails to meet the standards of justice.'b'In Judulang v. Holder, the failure was total: a decision on deportation that made no sense. As Justice Kagan pointedly wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cWe must reverse an agency policy when we cannot discern a reason for it.\xe2\x80\x9d That judgment, unfortunately, applies to much of the snarled and absurd processes in the immigration courts.'b'The case is about the policy the Board of Immigration Appeals uses in deciding when a resident alien who has been ordered deported can apply to the attorney general to overturn that order. Joel Judulang, a native of the Philippines, has been a permanent resident of the United States since 1974 when he was 8 years old. At 14, he pleaded guilty and received a suspended sentence for voluntary manslaughter after taking part in a fight in which someone else shot and killed another person. In 2005, after he pleaded guilty to a theft, the government began deportation proceedings based on the manslaughter conviction, and an immigration judge ordered him deported.'b'In determining whether Mr. Judulang could apply for a waiver from deportation, the board looked to a repealed law, which dealt with excluding aliens from admission to this country. If the basis for deporting an alien is \xe2\x80\x9cessentially equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d to a basis in the law for excluding someone, the board said, the deportee could apply for a waiver. But it ruled that Mr. Judulang could not because the grounds for his deportation were not comparable to the grounds that apply to exclusion.'b'Justice Kagan properly pointed out that this analysis was essentially arbitrary. The board made \xe2\x80\x9can irrelevant comparison between statutory provisions,\xe2\x80\x9d which had nothing to do with Mr. Judulang\xe2\x80\x99s fitness to remain in the United States. Instead, it turned a deportation decision into a \xe2\x80\x9csport of chance,\xe2\x80\x9d like \xe2\x80\x9cflipping a coin \xe2\x80\x94 heads an alien may apply for relief, tails he may not.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The board\xe2\x80\x99s ruling in this case was irrational, but at least it issued a written opinion. Often, the board rubber-stamps deportation rulings with no written opinion or explanation, making it almost impossible to appeal in the federal courts. The board\xe2\x80\x99s decision-making process 'b'reflects'b' the dysfunction of the overburdened immigration court system, which is in need of a complete overhaul.'b'On Sunday, Washington became the first state to have a minimum wage above $9 an hour, $9.04 to be exact. Seven other states also had increases on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day because they, too, adjust their minimum wages to keep pace with rising costs. In Oregon, the hourly minimum rose to $8.80; in Colorado to $7.64, with the wages in Arizona, Florida, Montana, Ohio and Vermont in between.'b'The federal minimum wage, however, remains stuck at $7.25 an hour. It has been so since 2009, and will stay there until Congress passes a law to lift it. Such raises are too few and far between; there have been only nine legislated increases since the first minimum wage \xe2\x80\x94 .25 cents an hour \xe2\x80\x94 was enacted in 1938.'b'Worse, the real value of the wage peaked in 1968, at a level that is roughly equivalent to $9.85 in 2011 dollars, and it has declined by more than 25 percent since then. States like Washington that protect their workers this way are to be commended. But the purpose of the minimum wage \xe2\x80\x94 to reward work, reduce poverty and help ensure that economic growth is broadly shared \xe2\x80\x94 would be better met if the federal government was again the standard setter. For a minimum wage to combat income inequality, it must apply to a large section of the labor force.'b'During the 2008 campaign, President Obama called for a minimum wage of $9.50 an hour, indexed to inflation. It is time to keep that promise, making a higher minimum wage part of any jobs agenda.'b'Republicans will inevitably complain that a higher wage will be a \xe2\x80\x9cjob killer.\xe2\x80\x9d Studies have not been able to determine definitively whether the employment impact of a higher wage is positive or negative, just that it is small. 'b'Researchers'b' at the Economic Policy Institute have shown that the increase in wages from a higher minimum is greater than any wage decreases because of fewer hours worked. At a time of increasing inequality, America\xe2\x80\x99s low-wage workers need a raise.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s nearly a century since 'b'the magazine Poetry'b' was founded on uncertain prospects and an \xe2\x80\x9copen door\xe2\x80\x9d promise: \xe2\x80\x9cMay the great poet we are looking for never find it shut.\xe2\x80\x9d Across the decades, the slim, challenging magazine has survived, publishing all manner of startling new poets, including T.S. Eliot, Langston Hughes, Wallace Stevens, Gwendolyn Brooks, Ezra Pound and Marianne Moore. Robert Frost happily celebrated its first decade in a subscription blurb urging readers to try Poetry as the \xe2\x80\x9cbest boost\xe2\x80\x9d ever for struggling versifiers.'b'Frost understood poets need all the help they can get, and it is a pleasant surprise to discover the magazine currently grappling with success. Its circulation has nearly tripled to 30,000 since Christian Wiman, a poet and critic, took over as 'b'editor'b' eight years ago. Poetry receives 100,000 submissions a year and publishes 300 \xe2\x80\x94 the open door now closer to the eye of a needle.'b'The magazine has a busy foundation and splendid new headquarters in Chicago financed from what, in the imagined world of threadbare poets, was an eye-popping and deeply envied bequest of $200 million in 2002 from Ruth Lilly, the pharmaceutical heiress.'b'Lyrical and affordable things are happening, like poetry apps for readers\xe2\x80\x99 smartphones and an increase in the rate paid to poets. The magazine now has an inviting edge of criticism that does not spare established poets \xe2\x80\x94 and lively complaints from some loyalists that its 100-year-old mission is being compromised in a populist vs. elitist squeeze. In short, Poetry has become a controversial must-read, not a bad formula for a happy centenary.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Congratulations to Pico Iyer for the solid reasoning behind his Jan. 1 Sunday Review article, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Joy of Quiet'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d His emphasis on the importance of slowing down to see more feelingly and to think more carefully than the Internet age seems to allow is necessary to our individual and collective well-being.'b'CAROL HEBALD'b' New York, Jan. 1, 2012'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Pico Iyer sees the world whole from a distance beyond the dissonance.

F.E.C.'b', a First Amendment challenge to a federal law that prohibits noncitizens living in the United States (but who don\xe2\x80\x99t have green cards) from making contributions to American political candidates or from spending money on independent speech to influence elections.'b'The lead plaintiff, Benjamin Bluman, is a Canadian lawyer who lawfully lives in New York City. He is legally prohibited from paying for leaflets he planned to distribute urging the re-election of President Obama.'b'The case raises fundamental questions about the scope of the First Amendment. Do noncitizens who lawfully reside in this country have a First Amendment right to advocate the defeat or election of American political candidates? And do American voters have a First Amendment right to hear what noncitizens have to say about our politics?'b'Last August, a panel of three federal judges in Washington answered both these questions with a resounding \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d That was a mistake, and the Supreme Court should correct it.'b'While it may sound surprising that the First Amendment could protect electoral advocacy by noncitizens, including political contributions and expenditures, the argument is grounded in precedent. The Supreme Court has held for over 35 years that the First Amendment protects the right to make political contributions and expenditures. Moreover, courts have long held that noncitizens who lawfully reside within the United States are entitled to the full protection of the First Amendment. The plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 argument in Bluman simply combines these two strands of precedent.'b'Noncitizens who have permanent residency are allowed to make contributions and political expenditures. Allowing lawful temporary residents to do the same, on the same terms as United States citizens, would also reflect the general rule that the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protections do not vary based on the identity of the speaker. That belief was at the center of the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling in Citizens United v. F.E.C., which held that Congress lacked the power to prohibit corporations from spending money to influence federal elections.'b'The reasoning of Citizens United applies with even greater force to noncitizens who lawfully reside in the United States. Whatever one thinks of that ruling, the most common criticism against it \xe2\x80\x94 that corporations are not people \xe2\x80\x94 certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t apply to the millions of noncitizens affected by the law, as cited by the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights in its amicus brief. Even critics of the decision, like the election-law scholar Richard L. Hasen, have argued that the only way to rule against the plaintiffs in Bluman is to ignore that decision.'b'Which is precisely what the three-judge panel did last August. Rather than engaging with Citizens United or the rest of the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s campaign finance jurisprudence, the panel turned to a different line of cases holding that noncitizens could be prohibited from holding elective office or serving as police officers or public school teachers. Based on these cases, the panel concluded that the ban on noncitizen campaign activity was a permissible means of preventing \xe2\x80\x9cforeign influence\xe2\x80\x9d over elections in the United States.'b'The cases upon which the panel relied establish that, with regard to holding actual positions of government authority, noncitizens can be treated differently from citizens. But those cases have no direct bearing on the First Amendment questions presented in Bluman. Nobody, foreign or otherwise, has a First Amendment right to hold elective office.'b'Moreover, there is a world of difference between actually wielding government authority and merely attempting to influence the electoral process. The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that the only reason sufficiently powerful to justify restrictions on efforts to influence the electoral process is the prevention of quid pro quo corruption. The panel, however, concluded that foreigners may be prohibited from participating in American politics, not because they are corrupt, but simply because they are foreign. That conclusion breaks entirely new First Amendment ground and, for that reason alone, is worthy of Supreme Court review.'b'The panel\xe2\x80\x99s belief that political advocacy by noncitizens poses some sort of distinctive threat is also belied by the evidence. One need look no further than politics at the state level. United States citizens are permitted to speak out for or against candidates from any state in the nation, even candidates they are not eligible to vote for, yet proponents of the restriction on noncitizen speech have not shown that this wide open marketplace of ideas has put any state\xe2\x80\x99s politicians in thrall to out-of-state interests. This is not surprising. No matter how loudly noncitizens may promote or oppose candidates, those candidates will ultimately be judged by voting citizens, to whom they must be responsive.'b'Indeed, the most dangerous thing about the panel\xe2\x80\x99s ruling \xe2\x80\x94 and the biggest reason the Supreme Court should grant review and reverse it \xe2\x80\x94 is that it undervalues the role that voters play in our democratic system. That system is based on the idea that voters are the ultimate judges of what messages are worth considering before casting their ballots. Respect for that idea demands that voters be permitted to consider messages from noncitizens.'b'Cambridge, Mass.'b'THE end of the Iraq war occasioned few reflections on the scale of destruction we have wrought there. As is our habit, the discussion focused on the costs to America in blood and treasure, the false premises of the war and the continuing challenges of instability in the region. What happened to Iraqis was largely ignored. And in Libya, 'b'the recent investigation'b' of civilian casualties during NATO\xe2\x80\x99s bombing campaign was the first such accounting of what many believed was a largely victimless war.'b'We rarely question that wars cause extensive damage, but our view of America\xe2\x80\x99s wars has been blind to one specific aspect of destruction: the human toll of those who live in war zones.'b'We tune out the voices of the victims and belittle their complaints about the midnight raids, the house-to-house searches, the checkpoints, the drone attacks, the bombs that fall on weddings instead of Al Qaeda.'b'Gen. Tommy R. Franks famously said during the early days of the war in Afghanistan, \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t do body counts.\xe2\x80\x9d But someone should. What we learn from body counts tells us much about war and those who wage it.'b'More than 10 years after the war in Afghanistan began, we have only the sketchiest notion of how many people have died as a consequence of the conflict. The United Nations office in Kabul assembles some figures from morgues and other sources, but they are incomplete. The same has been true for Iraq, although a number of independent efforts have been made there to account for the dead.'b'But such numbers, which run into the hundreds of thousands, gain scant attention. American political and military leaders, like the public, show little interest in non-American casualties.'b'Denial, after all, is politically convenient. Failing to consider the mortality figures, the refugees, the impoverished, the demolished hospitals and clean water systems and schools is to deny, in effect, that the war ever happened.'b'The American military cannot afford to be so cavalier about the dynamics of war. The consequences of how we fight wars reveals a great deal about how and why others fight us.'b'In Iraq, for example, the causes of the Sunni resistance were often attributed to lost social status; the role of American violence against civilians early in the conflict was rarely discussed. Yet many of the captured Iraqis said they were defending their communities by resisting the occupying forces. Roughing up, detaining or killing suspected enemy fighters \xe2\x80\x94 as the coalition forces did in countless operations \xe2\x80\x94 prompted some Iraqis to take up the gun, the I.E.D. and the suicide bomb. The more violence from the occupiers, the more ferocious their reaction.'b'Gen. David H. Petraeus recognized this and sought to reform Army practice. In a field manual he co-authored in 2006, he explained that when \xe2\x80\x9cforces fail to provide security or threaten the security of civilians, the population is likely to seek security guarantees from insurgents, militias or other armed groups. This situation can feed support for an insurgency.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In several opinion polls, Iraqis identified American forces as the primary cause of the violence besetting their country. And although the violence of war and occupation was a proximate cause of the Iraqi resistance, we have few metrics to understand its scope. WikiLeaks released military documents in October 2010 that included accounts of Iraqi fatalities, but such reports are incomplete and sometimes biased, and they reflect only what the troops actually witnessed. News media reports are similarly limited. And our political and military leaders barely consider these numbers anyway.'b'They dwell instead in a make-believe world of vastly less mayhem, oblivious to what actually besets the civilian population. In 2006, two separate household surveys, by the Iraqi Ministry of Health and by researchers from Johns Hopkins University, found between 400,000 and 650,000 \xe2\x80\x9cexcess deaths\xe2\x80\x9d in Iraq as a result of the war. At the time, however, the commanding general in Iraq put the number at 50,000 and President Bush had claimed in late 2005 that it was just 30,000.'b'If our leaders are unwilling to grasp the scale of death and social disruption, and the meaning of this chaos for the local population, then American war efforts are likely to end badly and relationships with allies will become strained, as has happened with President Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan.'b'Mr. Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s repeated complaints about NATO actions that cause civilian casualties are often dismissed in the West as political posturing, but his persistence on this issue indicates how deeply it resonates with Afghans. While we dismiss it, Muslims around the world take note.'b'Ignoring the extent of civilian casualties and the damage they cause is a moral failing as well as a strategic blunder. We need to adopt reliable ways to measure the destruction our wars cause \xe2\x80\x94 an \xe2\x80\x9cepistemology of war,\xe2\x80\x9d as another general, William Tecumseh Sherman, called it \xe2\x80\x94 to break through the collective amnesia that has gripped us.'b'If we do not demand a full accounting of the wages of war, future failures are all the more likely \xe2\x80\x94 and warranted.'b'Medford, Mass.'b'CENTRAL bankers barely averted a financial panic before Christmas by replacing hundreds of billions of dollars of deposits fleeing European banks. But confidence in the global banking system remains dangerously low. To prevent the next panic, it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough to rely on emergency actions by the 'b'Federal Reserve'b' and the 'b'European Central Bank'b'. Instead, governments should fully guarantee all bank deposits \xe2\x80\x94 and impose much tighter restrictions on risk-taking by banks. Banks should be forced to shed activities like 'b'derivatives'b' trading that regulators cannot easily examine.'b'The Dodd-Frank financial reform act of 2010 did nothing to secure large deposits and very little to curtail risk-taking by banks. It was a missed opportunity to fix a regulatory effort that goes back nearly 150 years.'b'Before the 'b'Civil War'b', the United States did not have a public currency. Each bank issued its own notes that it promised to redeem with gold and silver. When confidence in banks ebbed, people would rush to exchange notes for coins. If banks ran out of coins, their notes would become worthless.'b'In 1863, Congress created a uniform, government-issued currency to end panicky redemptions of the notes issued by banks. But it didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop bank runs because people began to use bank accounts, instead of paper currency, to store funds and make payments. Now, during panics, depositors would scramble to turn their account balances into government-issued currency (instead of converting bank notes into gold).'b'The establishment of the Fed in 1913 as a lender of last resort that would temporarily replace the cash withdrawn by fleeing depositors was an important advance toward banking stability. But although the Fed could ameliorate the consequences of panics, it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent them. The system wasn\xe2\x80\x99t stabilized until the 1930s, when the government separated commercial banking from investment banking, tightened bank regulation and created deposit insurance. This system of rules virtually eliminated bank runs and bank failures for decades, but much of it was junked in a deregulatory process that culminated in 1999 with the repeal of the 1933 'b'Glass-Steagall Act'b'.'b'The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation now covers balances up to a $250,000 limit, but this does nothing to reassure large depositors, whose withdrawals could cause the system to collapse.'b'In fact, an overwhelming proportion of the \xe2\x80\x9cquick cash\xe2\x80\x9d in the global financial system is uninsured and prone to manic-depressive behavior, swinging unpredictably from thoughtless yield-chasing to extreme risk aversion. Much of this flighty cash finds its way into banks through lightly regulated vehicles like certificates of deposits or repurchase agreements. Money market funds, like banks, are a repository for cash, but are uninsured and largely unexamined.'b'Relying on the Fed and other central banks to counter panics is dangerous brinkmanship. A lender of last resort ought not to be a first line of defense. Rather, we need to take away the reason for any depositor to fear losing money through an explicit, comprehensive government guarantee. The government stands behind all paper currency regardless of whose wallet, till or safe it sits in. Why not also make all short-term deposits, which function much like currency, the explicit liability of the government?'b'Guaranteeing all bank accounts would pave the way for reinstating interest-rate caps, ending the competition for fickle yield-chasers that helps set off credit booms and busts. (Banks vie with one another to attract wholesale depositors by paying higher rates, and are then impelled to take greater risks to be able to pay the higher rates.) Stringent limits on the activities of banks would be even more crucial. If people thought that losses were likely to be unbearable, guarantees would be useless.'b'Banks must therefore be restricted to those activities, like making traditional loans and simple hedging operations, that a regulator of average education and intelligence can monitor. If the average examiner can\xe2\x80\x99t understand it, it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be allowed. Giant banks that are mega-receptacles for hot deposits would have to cease opaque activities that regulators cannot realistically examine and that top executives cannot control. Tighter regulation would drastically reduce the assets in money-market 'b'mutual funds'b' and even put many out of business. Other, more mysterious denizens of the shadow banking world, from tender option bonds to asset-backed 'b'commercial paper'b', would also shrivel.'b'These radical, 1930s-style measures may seem a pipe dream. But we now have the worst of all worlds: panics, followed by emergency interventions by central banks, and vague but implicit guarantees to lure back deposits. Since the 2008 financial crisis, governments and central bankers have been seriously overstretched. The next time a panic starts, markets may just not believe that the Treasury and Fed have the resources to stop it.'b'Deposit insurance was also a long shot in 1933 \xe2\x80\x94 President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Treasury secretary, the comptroller of the currency and the American Bankers Association opposed it. Somehow advocates rallied public opinion. The public mood is no less in favor of radical reform today. What\xe2\x80\x99s missing is bold, thoughtful leadership.'b'Two things have struck me about the Republican presidential candidate debates leading up to the Iowa caucuses. One is how entertaining they were. The other is how disconnected they were from the biggest trends shaping the job market of the 21st century. What if the 2012 campaign were actually about the world in which we\xe2\x80\x99re living and how we adapt to it? What would the candidates be talking about?'b'Surely at or near the top of that list would be the tightening merger between globalization and the latest information technology revolution. The I.T. revolution is giving individuals more and more cheap tools of innovation, collaboration and creativity \xe2\x80\x94 thanks to hand-held computers, social networks and \xe2\x80\x9cthe cloud,\xe2\x80\x9d which stores powerful applications that anyone can download. And the globalization side of this revolution is integrating more and more of these empowered people into ecosystems, where they can innovate and manufacture more products and services that make people\xe2\x80\x99s lives more healthy, educated, entertained, productive and comfortable.'b'The best of these ecosystems will be cities and towns that combine a university, an educated populace, a dynamic business community and the fastest broadband connections on earth. These will be the job factories of the future. The countries that thrive will be those that build more of these towns that make possible \xe2\x80\x9chigh-performance knowledge exchange and generation,\xe2\x80\x9d explains Blair Levin, who runs the Aspen Institute\xe2\x80\x99s Gig.U project, a consortium of 37 university communities working to promote private investment in next-generation ecosystems.'b'Historians have noted that economic clusters always required access to abundant strategic inputs for success, says Levin. In the 1800s, it was access to abundant flowing water and raw materials. In the 1900s, it was access to abundant electricity and transportation. In the 2000s, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit will be access to abundant bandwidth and abundant human intellectual capital,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 places like Silicon Valley, Austin, Boulder, Cambridge and Ann Arbor.'b'But we need many more of these. As the world gets wired together through the Web and social networks, and as more and more sensors run machines that are talking to other machines across the Internet, we are witnessing the emergence of \xe2\x80\x9cBig Data.\xe2\x80\x9d These are the mountains of data coming out of all these digital interactions, which can then be collected, sifted, mined and analyzed \xe2\x80\x94 like raw materials of old \xe2\x80\x94 to provide the raw material for new inventions in health care, education, manufacturing and retailing.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re all aware of the approximately two billion people now on the Internet \xe2\x80\x94 in every part of the planet, thanks to the explosion of mobile technology,\xe2\x80\x9d I.B.M.\xe2\x80\x99s chairman, Samuel Palmisano, said in a speech last September. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there are also upward of a trillion interconnected and intelligent objects and organisms \xe2\x80\x94 what some call the Internet of Things. All of this is generating vast stores of information. It is estimated that there will be 44 times as much data and content coming over the next decade ...reaching 35 zettabytes in 2020. A zettabyte is a 1 followed by 21 zeros. And thanks to advanced computation and analytics, we can now make sense of that data in something like real time.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The more information and trends you are able to mine and analyze, and the more talented human capital, bandwidth and computing power you apply to that data, the more innovation you\xe2\x80\x99ll get.'b'When eight doctors from around the world can look at the same M.R.I. in real time, said Levin, it enables the acceleration of small breakthroughs, which is where big breakthroughs eventually come from. Big bandwidth, he added, would enable these same doctors doing high-risk surgery to practice the life-saving procedures in advance over network-enabled simulators, leading to better results, new kinds of surgical innovations and new forms of medical education. Big bandwidth, combined with 3-D printers, would also allow for the rapid prototyping of all kinds of manufactured products that can then be made anywhere.'b'Right now, though, notes Levin, America is focused too much on getting \xe2\x80\x9caverage\xe2\x80\x9d bandwidth to the last 5 percent of the country in rural areas, rather than getting \xe2\x80\x9cultra-high-speed\xe2\x80\x9d bandwidth to the top 5 percent, in university towns, who will invent the future. By the end of 2012, he adds, South Korea intends to connect every home in the country to the Internet at one gigabit per second. \xe2\x80\x9cThat would be a tenfold increase from the already blazing national standard, and more than 200 times as fast as the average household setup in the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d The Times reported last February.'b'Therefore, the critical questions for America today have to be how we deploy more ultra-high-speed networks and applications in university towns to invent more high-value-added services and manufactured goods and how we educate more workers to do these jobs \xe2\x80\x94 the only way we can maintain a middle class.'b'I just don\xe2\x80\x99t remember any candidate being asked in those really entertaining G.O.P. debates: \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you think smart cities can become the job engines of the future, and what is your plan to ensure that America has a strategic bandwidth advantage?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Iowa caucuses, in which a nation awaits the verdict of a handful of some of its least representative citizens, are not going to settle the race for the Republican nomination for president. But they did put on display the choice the Republicans present to voters: right, far right or the far, far right.'b'The caucuses Tuesday night were headed to an astonishing draw between Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney, followed by Ron Paul. More than anything, the tight finish suggested that Mr. Romney has had a hard time selling his recently minted conservatism to hard-core Republican conservatives; two-thirds of caucusgoers identified themselves as Tea Party supporters.'b'The Republican caucuses only do a middling job of predicting who will win the presidency in November. But, this year, perhaps more than others, they were an important event to watch for any American voter.'b'The errors, absurd misstatements and unrelenting extremism were not the result of some \xe2\x80\x9cgotcha\xe2\x80\x9d moment in which a candidate was cornered in an interview or debate by a tricky (or maybe not so tricky) question. The Republicans have had months, millions of dollars and the advantage of there being no competing Democratic contest, to present the images of their own choosing \xe2\x80\x94 and they are dark and disturbing.'b'The candidates were all nasty to each other; 'b'Newt Gingrich called Mr. Romney a \xe2\x80\x9cliar\xe2\x80\x9d on Tuesday'b'. But when it came to President Obama, they were off the charts with baseless charges that would be laughable if they were not so insulting to the president and to the intelligence of voters.'b'Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s economy is not as bad as that in many parts of the country, so the candidates mainly tried to outbid each other in pandering to its socially conservative Republicans. Mr. Gingrich served up a right-wing theology that would dismantle every social advance since the institution of child labor laws and eviscerate the judiciary that has protected civil rights for a half-century.'b'Mr. Santorum talked endlessly about his opposition to a woman\xe2\x80\x99s right to choose an abortion and gay Americans\xe2\x80\x99 right to marry, while insisting that he would protect Americans\xe2\x80\x99 right to carry guns anywhere at anytime.'b'Even then, he had a hard time keeping up with Representative Michele Bachmann, founder of the House Tea Party caucus, who said she was the only Republican who would defend \xe2\x80\x9cfaith, marriage and the protection of life from conception to natural death.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Representative Paul delighted young crowds with his libertarian slogans \xe2\x80\x94 no war, no Federal Reserve, basically no government \xe2\x80\x94 but seemed to have no real ideas other than to follow the literal words of the Constitution.

Rick Perry of Texas based virtually his entire appeal on his religious faith \xe2\x80\x94 a desperation play that failed and led him to retreat to Texas to decide whether to continue his obviously pointless candidacy.'b'In the middle of all this, of course, was Mr. Romney, no real conservative trying to be all forms of conservative \xe2\x80\x94 forswearing his belief in abortion rights and global warming while insisting the health care reform he championed in Massachusetts isn\xe2\x80\x99t right for the rest of the country. He rivaled Mr. Gingrich in his false attacks on Mr. Obama, including claiming that the president travels the world apologizing for America.'b'As the Republican competition moves to New Hampshire next week, it is likely to focus less on social issues and more on economic issues. But that means even more of the slash-and-burn economics and class warfare that were also on display here.'b'Primaries bring out the extremism in candidates, but this year seems much worse because the \xe2\x80\x9ccenter\xe2\x80\x9d of the Republican Party has lurched so far to the right. The only good news in this primary season is that the more Americans listen to the Republican hopefuls, the more the voters will realize how out of touch these candidates are with the majority of Americans.'b'The House showed its utter disregard for public safety in November when it approved the National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act, which would take away the authority of states to decide who is allowed to carry a concealed and loaded handgun within their borders.'b'For example, New York, New Jersey and other states that bar individuals under 21 from obtaining a concealed carry permit would have to honor permits from states with no age requirement. The measure would also hamper efforts to combat illegal gun trafficking. An individual with a concealed carry permit from Florida \xe2\x80\x94 which allows the holder to carry unlimited numbers of concealed weapons \xe2\x80\x94 could drive a stash of weapons into New York and would have to be caught selling the guns on the street to get arrested.'b'Proponents contend the measure will make it easier for law-abiding Americans to protect themselves, no matter where they travel. But 'b'a recent report in The Times by Michael Luo'b' shows what has happened in North Carolina, one of dozens of states where a concealed carry permit can be easily obtained after a basic background check and perhaps a required safety class.'b'A review of state databases of criminal court cases and concealed carry licensees found more than 2,400 permit holders with felony or misdemeanor convictions over the past five years, excluding traffic-related offenses. At least 60 of the roughly 200 permit holders convicted of a weapon-related crime committed some sort of assault; 10 permit holders were convicted of murder or manslaughter, 8 of them using a gun. The Times also cited chilling examples where the presence of a loaded concealed weapon helped escalate an angry encounter into tragedy.'b'Two years ago, when he was facing a tough re-election campaign, Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, supported a similar concealed-carry measure. This time he needs to block it. President Obama has been silent on the issue. He should make clear that, for the sake of public safety, he will veto the bill.'b'The power to pardon is an essential means of justice, allowing a governor to right what the law got wrong. Gov. Jerry Brown of California has been 'b'asked'b' to commute to time served the sentence of Shirley Ree Smith, who was convicted in 1997 of killing her grandson and has already served 10 years of a 15-years-to-life sentence. We urge the governor to commute her sentence so she does not now have to return to prison as a result of a misguided Supreme Court ruling.'b'Ms. Smith was convicted of shaking her grandson to death. When the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit 'b'overturned'b' her conviction in 2006, it found \xe2\x80\x9cno demonstrable support\xe2\x80\x9d for it.

The court concluded \xe2\x80\x9cthere has very likely been a miscarriage of justice in this case.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This fall, however, five years after Ms. Smith was released, the Supreme Court overruled the Ninth Circuit, which means that she must complete her sentence unless it is commuted. The Supreme Court acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9cdoubts about whether Smith is in fact guilty are understandable.\xe2\x80\x9d They include what Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in dissent, that Ms. Smith was poorly represented at trial when \xe2\x80\x9ccompetent counsel\xe2\x80\x9d may have won the case. But the court\xe2\x80\x99s majority ruled \xe2\x80\x94 after a bitter six-year, three-review tug of war with the Ninth Circuit \xe2\x80\x94 that the federal appeals court did not have enough authority to overturn the state court\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.'b'Ms. Smith has already served 10 years for a crime she likely did not commit.

Those programs will now have to compete with other potential providers, who will have a chance to show that they can do a better job.'b'These reforms are part of the 'b'Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007'b', which required programs to raise teacher qualifications, improve classroom offerings and broaden access to vulnerable groups, including children who are homeless.'b'In the next few years, all the country\xe2\x80\x99s 1,800 or so Head Start grant holders will be evaluated for performance, including the effectiveness of teachers as measured by visiting evaluators. The classroom rating system will begin this year, and deficient programs will be reviewed for eligibility for federal money. The reforms, which also include more technical assistance for program providers, have the backing of Head Start defenders like the 'b'National Head Start Association'b', which supports greater accountability from the preschool centers.'b'Even as the Obama administration strengthens performance measures, financing for Head Start may be at risk in fiscal 2013, when big federal spending cuts start to kick in.

SILVERMAN'b'\nNew Haven, Dec. 29, 2011'b''b'Cairo'b'AS we approach the first anniversary of Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s revolution, renewed protests are polarizing Egyptian public opinion in a manner not seen since the initial occupation of Tahrir Square.'b'Those who support the interim rulers, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, argue that the young protesters who have returned to the square are, at best, impatient and greedy. Or, worse, the activists are cast as traitors and anarchists \xe2\x80\x94 not the young idealists of January 2011 who drove a tyrant from power, but a new breed of saboteurs, some of whom even answer to unnamed foreign entities seeking to destabilize Egypt. After all, this argument goes, Hosni Mubarak and his cronies are being tried for their crimes or at least have lost their jobs. And free parliamentary elections are under way in response to the central demands of the 2011 revolutionaries.'b'But a poisonous political culture has survived the revolution, and largely defines the approach of Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s interim rulers. To be sure, last year the military council\xe2\x80\x99s promises of a better future undercut what was once a pervading Egyptian cynicism toward all things political. But the country remains hamstrung by a debilitating political inertia at the institutional level, and that is an invitation for cynicism to revive. Many Egyptians already are saying that the interim council has embraced the time-honored political strategy of disavowing responsibility for Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s woes, as it ducks the blame for blood that continues to spill while it is in charge.'b'Those who have continued to protest in Tahrir Square are diverse: there are the core revolutionary leaders who first spurred their countrymen into action; mercurial \xe2\x80\x9cUltras\xe2\x80\x9d whose former passion for soccer scores has morphed into a newfound political zeal; Coptic Christians who refuse to accept the military\xe2\x80\x99s hands-off approach in the face of renewed sectarian tensions, and Egyptian women who find in the new government the same institutionalized misogyny that brought them to the square 11 months ago.'b'Among the protesters are wealthy Egyptians and the dispossessed, liberals and Islamists. They are overwhelmingly young, but if you look closely, you can find some with gray hair. And if their detractors are correct in saying that they cannot be reasoned with, it is only because the protesters rarely speak with one voice and they refuse to listen like children to the patronizing echo of the old establishment. If any one spirit unites them, it is a justifiable anger about the establishment\xe2\x80\x99s mind-set.'b'The durability of the old political culture\xe2\x80\x99s approach to free expression and opposition politics was starkly in evidence last month when soldiers raided as many as 10 democracy promotion groups, at least three of them American-financed, in Cairo, along with other nongovernmental organizations.'b'The humiliating image of the \xe2\x80\x9cwoman in the 'b'blue bra'b',\xe2\x80\x9d a protester whose modest abaya pulled open to reveal her lingerie as she was dragged in the street, also offered chilling evidence that pre-revolutionary Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s violent ways have not been uprooted. The military council would be wise to remember that it was the gruesome post-mortem image of Khaled Said, a young Egyptian brutally beaten by the police in 2010 and found dead a few minutes later, that served as a rallying symbol for protesters who would ultimately oust a 30-year dictator and his minister of the interior.'b'It remains unclear who, if anyone, will be held accountable for the deaths of hundreds \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps more than 1,000 \xe2\x80\x94 protesters since the Egyptian revolution began. To date, one police sergeant has been sentenced in absentia; meanwhile, the recent exoneration of six police officers in the killing of protesters last winter has further inflamed local passions, and countless other casualties, including dozens of Egyptians whose 'b'eyes were wounded'b' when they were intentionally shot at with rubber bullets or pellets, have accumulated since last January.'b'Until now, in the most optimistic interpretation of events, the transitional government has delayed indefinitely its accountability for crimes like these. And the protesters\xe2\x80\x99 understandable anger at this delay in justice has only fed their distrust of their interim rulers. The result is a cycle of violence that creates a larger and larger incentive for the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces to avoid future accountability.'b'And that is precisely the way in which the cynicism that hobbled Egypt before is being reborn. If the current political powers do not tread carefully, then even the freely elected government that Egyptians have been promised in 2012 could face a long and counterproductive power struggle with a military establishment that would have every reason to remain a state-within-a-state \xe2\x80\x94 autonomous and, in a depressingly familiar way, untouchable.'b'WHEELCHAIR users have long been deprived of a quintessential New York City experience: riding in a taxi. So after years of discussion, litigation and experimentation, the governor and the mayor of New York last month 'b'announced'b' a 'b'deal'b' to put 2,000 wheelchair-accessible cabs on the streets, setting aside 'b'up to $54 million'b' in subsidies and loans to retrofit vehicles for wheelchair use or buy new wheelchair-accessible vehicles.'b'The plan is well intentioned but might not achieve the desired results. Rather than improving access for the disabled, it will require taxpayers and the taxi industry to foot the bill for taxis that will in all likelihood rarely be used by the target ridership. A more sensible alternative would be to set up a small fleet of wheelchair-accessible cabs that disabled passengers could call upon, through a centralized dispatch system, at any time of day or night, as part of the region\xe2\x80\x99s mass transit system.'b''b'Advocates'b' estimate that there are about 'b'60,000 wheelchair users'b' in the city \xe2\x80\x94 and that\xe2\x80\x99s not counting out-of-town visitors. No one doubts that getting around New York in a wheelchair can be daunting. Most subway stations are not accessible; many bus stops are too distant for wheelchair users to reach; and the 'b'Metropolitan Transportation Authority'b'\xe2\x80\x99s van program for the disabled requires registration and making a reservation, usually days in advance.'b'In response, the state and the city now plan to sell 2,000 new taxi medallions (the current total is 13,237) that will be designated for wheelchair-accessible vehicles and issue 18,000 permits \xe2\x80\x94 one-fifth of them wheelchair-accessible \xe2\x80\x94 for a new class of livery cabs that will be permitted to pick up street hails in upper Manhattan and the four other boroughs, areas traditionally underserved by yellow cabs.'b'But simply putting more accessible vehicles on the street is impractical and, for many, unaffordable. Drivers of accessible cabs would find it difficult to find space in the middle of heavily congested streets to accommodate wheelchair users; insurance premiums for drivers and vehicle owners are likely to rise; and many disabled riders would far prefer home pickup to an uncertain wait on a corner in bad weather (though advocates for the disabled are loath to admit it).'b'The new plan put forward by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is partly a response to judicial pressure. On Dec. 23, two days after the deal was announced, a federal judge in Manhattan 'b'ruled'b' that the taxi commission had failed to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act by not providing sufficient wheelchair access. The judge even stopped the city from auctioning any new permits or medallions unless they are all accessible and until a plan is approved by the court.'b'There is a better approach: a centralized taxi-dispatch system for disabled riders. From July 2008 to June 2010, the 'b'Taxi and Limousine Commission'b' tested such a system. When riders called the city\xe2\x80\x99s 311 information line, a company dispatched one of 232 accessible yellow cabs to pick them up.'b'The 'b'results'b' were not promising, but also not conclusive. The median wait time was 22 minutes. Only 2,700 individuals used the service \xe2\x80\x94 and most of them for just one trip per year. Only about eight rides took place each day. The $1 million budget for the 5,828 trips taken meant that each trip cost, on average, $172. The overwhelming majority of the rides began and ended in Manhattan (as is typical of cab usage in the city).'b'However, I believe the disappointing results were more a reflection of the high cost of riding a cab \xe2\x80\x94 a particular deterrent for people who are on fixed incomes \xe2\x80\x94 than of the challenges of a dispatch system.'b'My proposal is this: convert the existing van program run by the M.T.A. into a system of subsidized door-to-door taxi rides. The van system, known as paratransit or Access-a-Ride, spends more than $380 million a year. The average cost per ride is $30 to $50, which I believe could be lowered to $12 to $15 if the little-used vans were replaced with accessible cabs. The system would rely on usage patterns to determine the right number of cabs \xe2\x80\x94 instead of setting them by fiat. Passengers would pay $2.25 a ride (with a discount for purchasers of certain fare cards), the same cost as a subway trip.'b'The M.T.A. has been testing such a program; it should become permanent. It would allow the use of custom-built vehicles instead of retrofitted ones. The M.T.A. or the city would enforce service standards to ensure that wait times were reasonable and drivers properly trained. Over time, as the service became more reliable, demand would rise \xe2\x80\x94 after all, door-to-door service for the cost of a subway ride is far cheaper than hailing a retrofitted yellow cab. One model for this is Chicago, where only 90 wheelchair-accessible cabs (about 1 percent of the total fleet) are efficiently dispatched through a single toll-free number.'b'Congress could also help. The Americans With Disabilities Act, enacted in 1990, exempted taxicabs, but subsequent federal regulations required cabs for the disabled to provide \xe2\x80\x9cequivalent service.\xe2\x80\x9d So governments are not required to provide accessible cabs, but if they do, they are open to being sued (as New York City was) for discrimination. The act should be amended to provide incentives for disability access instead of punishing municipalities that try to do the right thing.'b'Putting thousands of accessible cabs on the road looks good in theory, but how it will work in practice is a different matter. Quite possibly, the result will be further irritation \xe2\x80\x94 not enhanced mobility \xe2\x80\x94 for disabled New Yorkers.'b'ALTOONA, Iowa'b'At the Altoona Elementary School on Tuesday night, a partition separated the gym from the cafeteria and one group of voters in Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s deeply fractured Republican Party from another. The city\xe2\x80\x99s first precinct, caucusing in the gym\xe2\x80\x99s grandstand seats, supported Ron Paul. The second precinct, at the cafeteria tables, went for Rick Santorum.'b'The surrounding county, which includes Des Moines, preferred Mitt Romney, who also \xe2\x80\x9cwon\xe2\x80\x9d the state by eight votes. That\xe2\x80\x99s a victory only in the most technical sense of the term. For all the $4 million spent on his behalf, he will eventually win only a minuscule number of delegates, gained no momentum and established no sense that he has even begun to unite his party behind his effort to be nominated to run against President Obama.'b'Disunity was virtually the only consistent theme to emerge from Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s caucuses, actually more party rallies than real delegate-selection events, even with all the candidates shoved against the far-right wall of the ideological spectrum \xe2\x80\x94 including Mr. Romney, who seemed profoundly uncomfortable there. The state\xe2\x80\x99s highly conservative Republican voters had to choose based on extremely small distinctions.'b'Several voters here in Altoona, 10 miles northeast of downtown Des Moines, said they had picked the one who seemed most sincerely committed to the anti-abortion message. That led Perry Franklin, a U.P.S. employee, and his wife Lisa, a Wal-Mart cashier, to choose Mr. Santorum, particularly after he was endorsed by the Family Leader, an influential evangelical group.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he signed their marriage pledge, which the others didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Franklin, referring to a vow promulgated by the Family Leader that equates same-sex marriage with bigamy and polygamy and requires signers to promise to stay faithful to their spouses. (Actually, Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry signed it, too. )'b'Nearly half of the state\xe2\x80\x99s voters said they had made up their minds only at the last minute, according to entrance polls. There was so much hand-wringing in this first-in-the-nation caucus that, in many cases, it came down to a stray remark by a candidate that impressed or repelled a voter, or a suggestion by a neighbor at the caucus itself.'b'Cody Darr, who supported Mr. Paul in Altoona Elementary\xe2\x80\x99s cafeteria, said he did so only after strongly considering Mr. Santorum, Mrs. Bachmann and Newt Gingrich. He almost went with Mrs. Bachmann until she claimed that her state chairman, Kent Sorenson, had been bribed by Mr. Paul.'b'Indecision and last-minute wavering can afflict any election, but the Republican caucus system is designed to encourage it. Before voting, participants had to listen to speeches from the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 supporters, each hoping to change a few minds. Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s campaign required its Altoona surrogate, Lynn Kent, to read from his talking points. (She delivered them better than he usually does.)'b'Mr. Perry\xe2\x80\x99s advocate at the school was a young politician from Dallas, James Stanton, who drove up with his family from Texas and spent a week here on his own dime. He plastered the gym and cafeteria with Perry posters, distributed literature and made an impassioned speech. Mr. Perry won 22 percent of the 135 voters in the gym and 12 percent of the 68 people in the cafeteria, and he was forced to regroup his campaign before heading to South Carolina after coming in fifth in Iowa.'b'The only sign of cohesiveness in the cafeteria came when the caucus chairman, Lowell Whistler, playfully asked if anyone wanted to defeat President Obama. The group erupted in cheers and applause, and Mr. Whistler, a Santorum supporter, said they would have to organize and give money to avoid being \xe2\x80\x9coutworked by the liberals.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The liberals, for all their infighting, at least know whom they stand for. The Republicans, so far, have only agreed on what they are against.'b'The 'b'Taliban\xe2\x80\x99s announcement'b' that 'b'they plan to open an office in Qatar'b' and possibly begin peace negotiations deserves a close look and a full draught of skepticism.'b'This is the same group of militants, led by Mullah Muhammad Omar, that ruled Afghanistan with such medieval brutality, denying women access to an education or health care. It is the same group that gave sanctuary to Al Qaeda before Sept. 11, 2001, and that is still killing NATO troops and terrorizing and murdering the Afghan people. But if there is even a remote chance of a political settlement \xe2\x80\x94 one that does not reimpose the Taliban\xe2\x80\x99s horrors \xe2\x80\x94 it must be explored.'b'Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s announcement was short on specifics, but it did make clear that the militants want to talk to Washington, not Kabul. Early talks with American officials might get things moving. But there can be no deal without full Afghan participation, and the Obama administration should consider appointing an international mediator to bring a broad mix of participants \xe2\x80\x94 including Afghanistan\xe2\x80\x99s meddling neighbors \xe2\x80\x94 to the table.'b'For months, the administration has been signaling its interest in talks, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t know why the Taliban responded now. One theory is that they are being squeezed by American and NATO military operations. Another is that the Taliban are hoping to use the negotiations to speed up an American withdrawal and lock in Taliban terms. Either way, coalition forces must keep pushing back hard.'b'Apart from wanting the Americans out, it is not clear what the Taliban will demand. Washington must not budge on its insistence that as part of any agreement, the Taliban must sever all ties to Al Qaeda, renounce violence and accept the Afghan Constitution and its commitments to political and human rights for all Afghans.'b'There are many more big questions, including whether other Afghan extremists \xe2\x80\x94 most notably the Haqqani network \xe2\x80\x94 will come to the table, whether there can be a peace deal if they don\xe2\x80\x99t and whether their patrons in Pakistan can be persuaded to support serious negotiations or will work to undermine them.'b'As a confidence-building measure, Washington is considering a Taliban request that it transfer some Taliban detainees to custody in Afghanistan or Qatar from the prison camp in Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay, Cuba. Any prisoner release will first require careful vetting, and then there will have to be vigilant monitoring to ensure that the prisoners don\xe2\x80\x99t go back to the battlefield. There is also talk from Americans of identifying some cease-fire zones where the Taliban\xe2\x80\x99s interest in stopping the fighting could be tested.'b'President Obama has pledged that the bulk of NATO troops will be withdrawn from Afghanistan by the end of 2014. That will be easier to achieve if there is a political agreement with the Taliban, but it must be one that ensures that Afghanistan does not again become a launching pad for attacks on this country and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t revert to the horrors of Taliban rule.'b'Gov. Andrew Cuomo spent a good part of 'b'his State of the State address'b' congratulating himself and lawmakers for ending the \xe2\x80\x9cdysfunction\xe2\x80\x9d of state government. He made real progress, but Albany still has a long way to go.'b'This year, 'b'he said he will'b' turn his attention to creating jobs with an ambitious program to build new bridges and repair thousands of miles of roads across the state. That is a worthy agenda, but he offered too few specifics, starting with how he plans to pay for such an effort. He is still facing a $2 billion budget deficit \xe2\x80\x94 partly a result of his refusal to extend an income-tax surcharge on wealthy New Yorkers. He will need to lay out a lot more details when he releases the budget on Jan. 17.'b'We are concerned about his plan to bolster state finances and create jobs with a lot more gambling. He said on Wednesday that he will pursue a constitutional amendment that would allow gambling throughout the state and not just in the five casinos run by American Indians and the locations with \xe2\x80\x9celectronic gaming machines.\xe2\x80\x9d There\xe2\x80\x99s little evidence that casinos, which carry high social costs, will create good, high-wage jobs.'b'Governor Cuomo also announced plans for a new education commission to recommend reforms for school management, teacher accountability and student achievement. The idea is sound, but the issue is whether he will do a lot more to help poorer school districts in his 2012-13 state budget, especially after last year\xe2\x80\x99s $1.2 billion cut to education.'b'School districts all over the state have had to lay off employees, increase class size and reduce course offerings. But the hit on poor districts, which are especially dependent on the state, cannot continue.'b'There were other welcome announcements \xe2\x80\x94 like his promise to end New York City\xe2\x80\x99s fingerprinting requirement for food stamp recipients and his commitment to provide new protections for tenants or homeowners facing foreclosure.'b'On the good-government front, Governor Cuomo repeated his pledge to revamp the campaign finance system and veto politically drawn district maps this year. If he really wants to end Albany\xe2\x80\x99s dysfunction, he must do both this year.'b'Nearly six months after it opened its doors, the 'b'Consumer Financial Protection Bureau'b' finally has a director, after 'b'President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s recess appointment'b' of Richard Cordray, a former attorney general of Ohio who served as the bureau\xe2\x80\x99s chief of enforcement.'b'The appointment means the bureau will have a strong pro-consumer leader and can now exercise its full powers \xe2\x80\x94 regulating consumer products and practices both at banks and nonbanks, including mortgage brokerages and student loan providers. It also means that Mr. Obama has confronted Republican obstructionists.'b'Last year, Senate Republicans refused to consider any nominee to run the bureau unless the White House first agreed to drastically curtail the bureau\xe2\x80\x99s powers. Mr. Obama refused to weaken the bureau, but he did throw the opponents a bone by passing over Elizabeth Warren, who had developed the idea for the bureau and was vehemently opposed by the banks and their Republican defenders. After Mr. Obama nominated Mr. Cordray, the Republicans blocked a confirmation vote.'b'Congressional Republicans are calling the appointment \xe2\x80\x9cunprecedented\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cillegitimate\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 that is rich given that they are determined to use any and all tactics to thwart the bureau and the Dodd-Frank reform law that created it.'b'Mr. Obama also appointed three new and qualified members to 'b'the National Labor Relations Board'b'. Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 objection to an earlier nominee had threatened to reduce the five-member board to two; the recess appointments will ensure that the board has enough members to do its job. Mr. Cordray and the others can serve until the end of 2013.'b'Announcing the appointments, Mr. Obama also asserted a welcome new credo: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Congress refuses to act, and as a result, hurts our economy and puts our people at risk, then I have an obligation as president to do what I can without them.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Hear. Hear.'b'PETERBOROUGH, N.H.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the New Hampshire primary! This is a big deal! I can\xe2\x80\x99t even believe I\xe2\x80\x99m standing here!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jon Huntsman, who yearns to be the Rick Santorum of New Hampshire.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s what it\xe2\x80\x99s come to. Do you think this is what Huntsman told himself when he quit his distinguished post as ambassador to China? (\xe2\x80\x9cDiplomacy is all well and good, but I believe I was meant for greater things. Like being the Rick Santorum of New Hampshire.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'Santorum, of course, was the man of the hour when he sort-of-almost-nearly came in first in the Iowa caucuses on Tuesday. Actually, Mitt Romney won. (Eight Republicans can\xe2\x80\x99t be wrong!) But Santorum has the momentum. His strategy of spending his entire life going from one Iowa Pizza Ranch to another paid off.'b'After campaigning only in New Hampshire, with 150 events in the bag, Huntsman hopes for a similar triumph. It\xe2\x80\x99s the famous one-state strategy that worked so well in 2008 for Rudy Giuliani.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d thought we\xe2\x80\x99d never get here, but here we are!\xe2\x80\x9d he told an audience in the Peterborough town hall. Actually, getting to the Peterborough town hall is not all that remarkable. I have personally been there several times, but, of course, that is because I have a glamorous career in journalism, which allows me to have elite access to events like the one headlined: \xe2\x80\x9cTom Ridge Introduces Jon Huntsman.\xe2\x80\x9d You may remember Ridge from his stint as chief of the Department of Homeland Security. He was the one with the yellow-orange-red terror colors.'b'Huntsman is incredibly buoyant, to the point of appearing to be just a little bit goofy. (\xe2\x80\x9cLast night in Dover I was met by a goat! The same goat that bit my kneecap when I was there three months ago!\xe2\x80\x9d) He has a large, attractive family, but large attractive families are a dime a dozen this year. Michele Bachmann had 23 foster children, and she\xe2\x80\x99s already out of the race.'b'Jon Huntsman is the Republican that the White House most feared, possibly because the White House is full of Democrats. He is way behind in the New Hampshire polls, and he lacks the loony streak that primary voters seem to find so attractive this time around. Really, he is toast unless he does something remarkable over the next week. Not remarkable in the sense of making a good point in the next debate. Remarkable as in saving a baby from being run over by stopping a speeding car with one hand.'b'There are still plenty of other Republican options. After his fifth-place finish in Iowa, Rick Perry suspended his campaign but then tweeted, \xe2\x80\x9cHere we come, South Carolina.\xe2\x80\x9d This appeared to surprise some of his staff, who seemed to feel as if their long political nightmare had ended in Des Moines. But it turned out that Perry had jogged his way back into the race.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was out on the trail when it kind of came to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Quite a lot comes to the governor of Texas when he\xe2\x80\x99s jogging. You will remember the coyote he killed with his laser-sighted Ruger. No word on whether a pistol was involved in this latest revelation.'b'Ron Paul is still in competition, as is Newt Gingrich, who appears to be running mainly on rancor, the candidate of the I Want to Eat Mitt\xe2\x80\x99s Liver Party. And Rick Santorum, who continued the excitement of Iowa by flying into New Hampshire for a rally at a nursing home.'b'Mitt Romney himself was greeted in Manchester by a group of people cordoned off into half a high school auditorium. This helped disguise the crowd\xe2\x80\x99s small size but not the fact that it appeared to be made up mainly of Ron Paul supporters, dragooned teenagers and refugees from Occupy Wall Street.'b'The highlight of the event was supposed to be an endorsement from John McCain, whose innermost thoughts we would love to be privy to. Or maybe not.'b'McCain\xe2\x80\x99s old loathing of Romney has now been totally overshadowed by his hatred of President Obama. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t hide from your record of making this country bankrupt, from destroying our national security and making this nation one that we have to restore with Mitt Romney as president of the United States of America!\xe2\x80\x9d McCain snarled into the mic. It was an endorsement, but not the feel-good moment we were sort of looking for. Fortunately, they did play the new Kid Rock theme song that implicitly compares Romney to a wild stallion.'b'Can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see what the Republicans do next. You have to admit they\xe2\x80\x99re desperate. Rick Santorum. Geesh.'b'Did I ever mention that Romney once drove to Canada with the family Irish setter strapped to the roof of the car? The dog\xe2\x80\x99s name was Seamus. New Hampshire Republicans, if you can\xe2\x80\x99t think of anybody to vote for on Tuesday, consider writing in the name Seamus when you go to the polls. Maybe we can start a boomlet.'b'Makes as much sense as the Newt Gingrich moment.'b'Reston, Va.'b'FROM the streets of Tunis to Tahrir Square and beyond, protests around the world last year were built on the Internet and the many devices that interact with it. Though the demonstrations thrived because thousands of people turned out to participate, they could never have happened as they did without the ability that the Internet offers to communicate, organize and publicize everywhere, instantaneously.'b'It is no surprise, then, that the protests have raised questions about whether Internet access is or should be a civil or human right. The issue is particularly acute in countries whose governments clamped down on Internet access in an attempt to quell the protesters. In June, citing the uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa, a 'b'report by the United Nations\xe2\x80\x99 special rapporteur'b' went so far as to declare that the Internet had \xe2\x80\x9cbecome an indispensable tool for realizing a range of human rights.\xe2\x80\x9d Over the past few years, courts and parliaments in countries like France and Estonia have pronounced Internet access a human right.'b'But that argument, however well meaning, misses a larger point: technology is an enabler of rights, not a right itself. There is a high bar for something to be considered a human right. Loosely put, it must be among the things we as humans need in order to lead healthy, meaningful lives, like freedom from torture or freedom of conscience. It is a mistake to place any particular technology in this exalted category, since over time we will end up valuing the wrong things. For example, at one time if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a horse it was hard to make a living. But the important right in that case was the right to make a living, not the right to a horse. Today, if I were granted a right to have a horse, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure where I would put it.'b'The best way to characterize human rights is to identify the outcomes that we are trying to ensure. These include critical freedoms like freedom of speech and freedom of access to information \xe2\x80\x94 and those are not necessarily bound to any particular technology at any particular time. Indeed, even the United Nations report, which was widely hailed as declaring Internet access a human right, acknowledged that the Internet was valuable as a means to an end, not as an end in itself.'b'What about the claim that Internet access is or should be a 'b'civil 'b'right? The same reasoning above can be applied here \xe2\x80\x94 Internet access is always just a tool for obtaining something else more important \xe2\x80\x94 though the argument that it is a civil right is, I concede, a stronger one than that it is a human right. Civil rights, after all, are different from human rights because they are conferred upon us by law, not intrinsic to us as human beings.'b'While the United States has never decreed that everyone has a \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d to a telephone, we have come close to this with the notion of \xe2\x80\x9cuniversal service\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the idea that telephone service (and electricity, and now broadband Internet) must be available even in the most remote regions of the country. When we accept this idea, we are edging into the idea of Internet access as a civil right, because ensuring access is a policy made by the government.'b'Yet all these philosophical arguments overlook a more fundamental issue: the responsibility of technology creators themselves to support human and civil rights. The Internet has introduced an enormously accessible and egalitarian platform for creating, sharing and obtaining information on a global scale. As a result, we have new ways to allow people to exercise their human and civil rights.'b'In this context, engineers have not only a tremendous obligation to empower users, but also an obligation to ensure the safety of users online. That means, for example, protecting users from specific harms like viruses and worms that silently invade their computers. Technologists should work toward this end.'b'It is engineers \xe2\x80\x94 and our professional associations and standards-setting bodies like the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers \xe2\x80\x94 that create and maintain these new capabilities. As we seek to advance the state of the art in technology and its use in society, we must be conscious of our civil responsibilities in addition to our engineering expertise.'b'Improving the Internet is just one means, albeit an important one, by which to improve the human condition. It must be done with an appreciation for the civil and human rights that deserve protection \xe2\x80\x94 without pretending that access itself is such a right.'b'The reassuring thing about Mitt Romney is that for most of his life he probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have voted for today\xe2\x80\x99s Mitt Romney.'b'This is a man who registered as a Republican only in preparation for his 1994 Senate campaign against Edward Kennedy; previously, Romney had registered as an independent. As recently as 2002, in his successful run for governor of Massachusetts, 'b'he described himself this way'b': \xe2\x80\x9cPeople recognize that I am not a partisan Republican, that I\xe2\x80\x99m someone who is moderate, and that my views are progressive.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That was accurate, and Romney became an excellent, moderate and pragmatic governor of Massachusetts. But then, in 2005, 'b'he apparently began to fancy himself'b' as Republican presidential timber and started veering to the right in what we can all pray was a cynical, unprincipled pander.'b'This does, at least, furnish opportunities for 'b'political humor'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cMitt Romney will face his fiercest ideological opponent,\xe2\x80\x9d Conan O\xe2\x80\x99Brien has suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cHimself from four years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Jay Leno offered: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, the presidential race is getting interesting. In an effort to clear up his reputation as a flip-flopper, Mitt Romney will give a speech on health care. And then, right afterward, he\xe2\x80\x99ll give a five-minute rebuttal.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Now that he has won the Iowa caucuses, Romney\xe2\x80\x99s chances for winning the Republican nomination are better than 80 percent, according to 'b'the betting site Intrade'b'. For the general election, Intrade predicts that the Republican nominee (whomever it ends up being) has a 46 percent chance of winning the presidency in November. The Democrat, presumably Barack Obama, has a 52 percent chance of winning, it says.'b'The upshot is that Romney, assuming that he continues his ascent between now and the primaries\xe2\x80\x99 Super Tuesday on March 6, will soon have to make a final flip \xe2\x80\x94 back to his old self.'b'The narrative of a flip-flopper has been used effectively in the past against Democrats such as Al Gore in 2000 and 'b'John Kerry in 2004'b'. In the 1992 Democratic primaries, Paul Tsongas 'b'accused Bill Clinton'b' of being a \xe2\x80\x9cpander bear.\xe2\x80\x9d Romney should be forewarned: once the narrative gets started, it feeds itself.'b'The Democratic National Committee has already released 'b'a slick four-minute video'b' that plays to this theme by excoriating Romney for his gymnastics:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMitt Romney, unparalleled flip-flopper, has proved he is his own toughest opponent on the issues,\xe2\x80\x9d the Democrats write on 'b'MittvMitt.com'b', where the video is housed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe one thing Mitt and Mitt can agree on? That they want to be president \xe2\x80\x94 so Romney will say and do whatever it takes to get elected, no matter how contradictory.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s true that Romney has clearly shifted positions on abortion \xe2\x80\x94 apparently a calculated reversal so that he could compete in Republican presidential primaries \xe2\x80\x94 and on assault weapons, tax pledges and the legacy of President Ronald Reagan. And he ties himself in knots explaining why he opposes a national health care plan modeled on the Massachusetts plan that became law when he was governor.'b'But the Democratic claims of constant inconstancy seem exaggerated. The excellent Web site 'b'FactCheck.org'b' found that most of the accusations in the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 video 'b'were dubious'b'. Typically, Romney had a fairly complex position, and the Democrats caricatured it to portray a flip that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there or that was ambiguous. For example, Romney supported a stimulus, but not of the magnitude of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s, so it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a flip-flop for him to oppose the Obama stimulus.'b'If we do see, as I expect we will, a reversion in the direction of the Massachusetts Romney, that\xe2\x80\x99s a flip we should celebrate. Until the Republican primaries sucked him into its vortex, he was a pragmatist and policy wonk rather similar to Bill Clinton and President Obama but more conservative. (Clinton described Romney to me as having done \xe2\x80\x9ca very good job\xe2\x80\x9d in Massachusetts.) Romney was much closer to George H.W. Bush than to George W. Bush.'b'One reason to expect a re-emergence of the traditional moderate Romney \xe2\x80\x94 other than that it will be expedient \xe2\x80\x94 is that his advisers incline in that direction.'b'On the economy, Romney has been advised by the likes of Professor 'b'Gregory Mankiw'b' of Harvard and Professor 'b'Glenn Hubbard'b' of Columbia. Both are experienced, prominent figures, albeit tending conservative. In foreign affairs, Romney\xe2\x80\x99s advisers have included 'b'Richard Williamson'b', 'b'Eric Edelman'b', 'b'Meghan O\xe2\x80\x99Sullivan'b', 'b'Paula Dobriansky'b', 'b'Daniel Senor'b' and 'b'Dov Zakheim'b'. These, too, are credible, respected figures.'b'So, in the coming months, the most interesting political battle may be between Romney and Romney. Now, do we really want a chameleon as a nominee for president? That\xe2\x80\x99s a legitimate question. But I\xe2\x80\x99d much rather have a cynical chameleon than a far-right ideologue who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require contortions to appeal to Republican primary voters, who says things that Republican candidates have all been saying and, God forbid, actually means it.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Teachers Resist High-Tech Push in Idaho Schools'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cGrading the Digital School\xe2\x80\x9d series, front page, Jan. 4):'b'A State Legislature mandates that all high school students take online courses to graduate?'b'It may seem counterproductive for adults to encourage technology-absorbed American teenagers to stray further from critical thinking and discussion.

Six centuries is a long time to continue to mark the birth of a girl who, according to her family and friends, knew little more than spinning and watching over her father\xe2\x80\x99s flocks. But type her name into Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s search engine and you get more than 6,000 results. France\xe2\x80\x99s national archives include tens of thousands of volumes about her. She has been immortalized by Shakespeare, Voltaire, Twain, Shaw, Brecht, Verdi, Tchaikovsky and Rubens; more recently, her life was fodder for the CBS television series \xe2\x80\x9cJoan of Arcadia.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What is it about Joan of Arc? Why is her story of enduring interest more than a half a millennium after her birth?'b'By the time Joan of Arc was 16 and had proclaimed herself the virgin warrior sent by God to deliver France from her enemies, the English, she had been receiving the counsel of angels for three years. Until then, the voices she said she heard, speaking from over her right shoulder and accompanied by a great light, had been hers alone, a rapturous secret.'b'But in 1428, when the voices pressed her to undertake the quest for which they had been preparing her, they transformed a seemingly undistinguished peasant into a visionary heroine who defied every limitation placed on a woman of the late Middle Ages. The least likely of military leaders, Joan of Arc changed the course of the Hundred Years\xe2\x80\x99 War and of history.'b'Joan said she sheared off her hair, dressed in male attire, put on armor and took up her sword at God\xe2\x80\x99s behest. She was feverish in her determination to succeed at what was, by anyone\xe2\x80\x99s measure, a preposterous mission. As Joan herself protested to her voices, she \xe2\x80\x9cknew not how to ride or lead in war\xe2\x80\x9d; and yet she roused an exhausted, underequipped and impotent army into a fervor that carried it from one unlikely victory to the next. She raised the siege of Orl\xc3\xa9ans by defying the cautious strategies of seasoned generals to follow inaudible directions from invisible beings.'b'Illiterate and uncouth, Joan moved purposefully among nobles, bishops and royalty. So intent on vanquishing the enemy that she threatened her own men with violence, she herself recoiled at the idea of bloodshed. To avoid having to use her sword, she led her army carrying a 12-foot-long banner emblazoned with the words Party of the Kingdom of Heaven. Witnesses said she was luminous in battle, light not glinting off her armor so much as radiating from the girl within. Her enemies spoke of clouds of butterflies following in her wake, a curiously beatific report from men who said she was in league with the devil.'b'In the aftermath of combat she didn\xe2\x80\x99t celebrate victory but mourned the casualties; her men remembered her on her knees weeping as she held the head of a dying enemy soldier, urging him to confess his sins. Her courage outstripped that of seasoned men at arms; her tears flowed as readily as any other teenage girl\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'After a series of victories, Joan suffered the reversals her voices had predicted. Captured and sold to the English, and shackled in a dank cell for more than a year, Joan was put on trial for her life. For refusing to renounce the voices that guided her as deviltry, Joan, 19 years old, was burned at the stake before a jeering crowd, her charred body displayed to anyone who cared to examine it. Thirty years later, in 1450, a Rehabilitation Trial overturned the guilty verdict that condemned her to death; the 19th-century rediscovery of the transcripts from both trials resulted in her canonization in 1920.'b'Like all holy figures whose earthly existence separates them from the broad mass of humanity, a saint is a story, and Joan of Arc\xe2\x80\x99s is like no other.'b'The self-proclaimed agent of God\xe2\x80\x99s will, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t immortalized so much as she entered the collective imagination as a living myth. Centuries after death, she has been embraced by Christians, feminists, French nationalists, Mexican revolutionaries and even hairdressers. (Her crude cut inspired the bob flappers wore as a symbol of independence from patriarchal strictures.) Her voices have been diagnosed retroactively as symptoms of schizophrenia, epilepsy, even tuberculosis. It seems Joan of Arc will never be laid to rest. Is this because stories we understand are stories we forget?'b'Joan frustrates efforts to reduce her to mortal proportions. What can explain what her voices told her, whether directing her movements in battle or scripting answers to her inquisitors. And what about her reputed clairvoyance, accounts that her touch raised a child from the dead, her ability to direct the wind to fill her stalled boats\xe2\x80\x99 sails?'b'We don\xe2\x80\x99t need narratives that rationalize human experience so much as those that enlarge it with the breath of mystery. For as long as we look to heroes for inspiration, to leaders whose vision lifts them above our limited perspective, who cherish their values above their earthly lives, the story of Joan of Arc will remain one we remember, and celebrate.'b'Cambridge, Mass.'b'ON Wednesday President Obama, using his power to make recess appointments, named 'b'Richard Cordray'b' as the first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. A few hours later, he used the 'b'same power'b' to appoint three new members to the National Labor Relations Board, acting to overcome unprecedented Senate encroachment on his duty to appoint executive officials. The president\xe2\x80\x99s right to do so is clearly stated in the Constitution: the recess appointments clause empowers him to \xe2\x80\x9cfill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'However, since the twilight years of the George W. Bush administration, the Senate has tried to nullify this power by holding \xe2\x80\x9cpro forma\xe2\x80\x9d sessions every three days, during what no one doubts would otherwise be an extended recess. In these sham sessions, manifestly serving only to circumvent the recess appointment safety valve, a lone senator gavels the Senate to order, usually for just a few minutes; senators even agree beforehand that no business will be conducted.'b'It is this transparently obstructionist tactic to which President Obama said \xe2\x80\x9cenough,\xe2\x80\x9d striking a badly needed blow for checks and balances with strong support both from the text and the original purpose of the recess appointment clause.'b'Its aims, as Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 67, included facilitating appointments \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary for the public service to fill without delay.\xe2\x80\x9d Although the main concern in 1789 involved difficulties of travel that kept a recessed Senate from acting swiftly, the broad imperative retains modern relevance, even when the Senate engineers its own unavailability.'b'Past practice also points the way. Presidents have long claimed, attorneys general have long affirmed and the Senate has long acquiesced to the president\xe2\x80\x99s authority to make recess appointments during extended breaks within a Senate session. In 1905, the Senate Judiciary Committee concluded that \xe2\x80\x9crecess\xe2\x80\x9d referred to periods when, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of its absence,\xe2\x80\x9d the Senate could not \xe2\x80\x9cparticipate as a body in making appointments\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a definition that precludes treating pro forma sessions as true breaks in an extended recess.'b'Since 1867, 12 presidents have made more than 285 such appointments, without constitutional objection by the Senate. And attorneys general going back to Harry M. Daugherty in 1921 have held that the Constitution authorizes such appointments.'b'This does not free the president to make recess appointments whenever the Senate breaks for lunch or takes routine weekend vacations that conceal no objective scheme to frustrate presidential appointments. Without limits on both sides, he could bypass the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cadvice and consent\xe2\x80\x9d role by routinely recess-appointing controversial nominees.'b'These limits mean the president can resort to recess appointments of this kind only in instances of transparent and intolerable burdens on his authority. Article II charges him to \xe2\x80\x9ctake care that the laws be faithfully executed\xe2\x80\x9d; this duty, combined with appointment and recess-appointment powers, requires an irreducible minimum of presidential authority to appoint officials when the appointments are essential to execute duly enacted statutes.'b'In this case, the administration\xe2\x80\x99s focus on the gimmicky nature of pro forma sessions is best understood as one among several factors that combine to present unconstitutional interference with the president\xe2\x80\x99s irreducible power and duty.'b'Equally crucial is the identity of the two agencies involved. The N.L.R.B. cannot decide cases without at least three members, which it would have lacked without a recess appointment. And the C.F.P.B. cannot legally exercise its full statutory authority, including the regulation of credit reporting agencies and payday lenders, without a director. Some Senate Republicans vowed to filibuster any new N.L.R.B. appointments in an effort to shut down that agency, and nearly all pledged to deny any C.F.P.B. appointee an up-or-down vote unless the president agreed to weaken that new agency\xe2\x80\x99s statutory powers.'b'When these appointments are challenged in court \xe2\x80\x94 the United States Chamber of Commerce has already said it may file suit \xe2\x80\x94 the scant judicial doctrine on recess appointments will surely benefit from careful assessment of text, history and structure. But whatever standards the courts ultimately adopt to construe the clause, this case ought to be a slam-dunk.'b'I am no enthusiast for sweeping claims of unilateral executive authority, as I made clear during the debt ceiling crisis last summer, when I found nothing akin to a \xe2\x80\x9crecess borrowing clause\xe2\x80\x9d to authorize the unilateral action some had urged upon the president. Here, in contrast, President Obama has taken steps to enforce existing statutes, not ignore them.'b'The Constitution that has guided our Republic for centuries is not blind to the threat of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s extending its internal squabbles into a general paralysis of the entire body politic, rendering vital regulatory agencies headless and therefore impotent. Preserving the authority the president needs to carry out his basic duties, rather than deferring to partisan games and gimmicks, is our Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s clear command.'b'America\xe2\x80\x99s recovery from recession has been so slow that it mostly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like a recovery at all, especially on the jobs front. So, in a better world, President Obama would face a challenger offering a serious critique of his job-creation policies, and proposing a serious alternative.'b'Instead, he\xe2\x80\x99ll almost surely face Mitt Romney.'b'Mr. Romney claims that Mr. Obama has been a job destroyer, while he was a job-creating businessman. For example, he told Fox News: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a president who lost more jobs during his tenure than any president since Hoover. This is two million jobs that he lost as president.\xe2\x80\x9d He went on to declare, of his time at the private equity firm Bain Capital, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very happy in my former life; we helped create over 100,000 new jobs.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But his claims about the Obama record border on dishonesty, and his claims about his own record are well across that border.'b'Start with the Obama record. It\xe2\x80\x99s true that 1.9 million fewer Americans have jobs now than when Mr. Obama took office. But the president inherited an economy in free fall, and can\xe2\x80\x99t be held responsible for job losses during his first few months, before any of his own policies had time to take effect. So how much of that Obama job loss took place in, say, the first half of 2009?'b'The answer is: more than all of it. The economy lost 3.1 million jobs between January 2009 and June 2009 and has since gained 1.2 million jobs. That\xe2\x80\x99s not enough, but it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s portrait of job destruction.'b'Incidentally, the previous administration\xe2\x80\x99s claims of job growth always started not from Inauguration Day but from August 2003, when Bush-era employment hit its low point. By that standard, Mr. Obama could say that he has created 2.5 million jobs since February 2010.'b'So Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s claims about the Obama job record aren\xe2\x80\x99t literally false, but they are deeply misleading. Still, the real fun comes when we look at what Mr. Romney says about himself. Where does that claim of creating 100,000 jobs come from?'b'Well, Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post got an answer from the Romney campaign. It\xe2\x80\x99s the sum of job gains at three companies that Mr. Romney \xe2\x80\x9chelped to start or grow\xe2\x80\x9d: Staples, The Sports Authority and Domino\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'Mr. Kessler immediately pointed out two problems with this tally. It\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbased on current employment figures, not the period when Romney worked at Bain,\xe2\x80\x9d and it \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not include job losses from other companies with which Bain Capital was involved.\xe2\x80\x9d Either problem, by itself, makes nonsense of the whole claim.'b'On the point about using current employment, consider Staples, which has more than twice as many stores now as it did back in 1999, when Mr. Romney left Bain. Can he claim credit for everything good that has happened to the company in the past 12 years? In particular, can he claim credit for the company\xe2\x80\x99s successful shift from focusing on price to focusing on customer service (\xe2\x80\x9cThat was easy\xe2\x80\x9d), which took place long after he had left the business world?'b'Then there\xe2\x80\x99s the bit about looking only at Bain-connected companies that added jobs, ignoring those that reduced their work forces or went out of business. Hey, if pluses count but minuses don\xe2\x80\x99t, everyone who spends a day playing the slot machines comes out way ahead!'b'In any case, it makes no sense to look at changes in one company\xe2\x80\x99s work force and say that this measures job creation for America as a whole.'b'Suppose, for example, that your chain of office-supply stores gains market share at the expense of rivals. You employ more people; your rivals employ fewer. What\xe2\x80\x99s the overall effect on U.S. employment? One thing\xe2\x80\x99s for sure: it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot less than the number of workers your company added.'b'Better yet, suppose that you expand in part not by beating your competitors, but by buying them. Now their employees are your employees. Have you created jobs?'b'The point is that Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s claims about being a job creator would be nonsense even if he were being honest about the numbers, which he isn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'At this point, some readers may ask whether it isn\xe2\x80\x99t equally wrong to say that Mr. Romney destroyed jobs. Yes, it is. The real complaint about Mr. Romney and his colleagues isn\xe2\x80\x99t that they destroyed jobs, but that they destroyed 'b'good'b' jobs.'b'When the dust settled after the companies that Bain restructured were downsized \xe2\x80\x94 or, as happened all too often, went bankrupt \xe2\x80\x94 total U.S. employment was probably about the same as it would have been in any case. But the jobs that were lost paid more and had better benefits than the jobs that replaced them. Mr. Romney and those like him didn\xe2\x80\x99t destroy jobs, but they did enrich themselves while helping to destroy the American middle class.'b'And that reality is, of course, what all the blather and misdirection about job-creating businessmen and job-destroying Democrats is meant to obscure.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m to Rick Santorum\xe2\x80\x99s left on most social issues, like same-sex marriage and abortion. I\xe2\x80\x99m also put off by his Manichaean political rhetoric. He seems to imagine America\xe2\x80\x99s problems can best be described as the result of a culture war between the God-fearing conservatives and the narcissistic liberals.'b'Like most Americans, including most evangelicals under 40, I find this culture war language absurd. If conservative ideas were that much more virtuous than liberal ideas, then the conservative parts of the country would have fewer social pathologies than the liberal parts of the country. They don\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'But having said all that, I\xe2\x80\x99m delighted that Santorum is making a splash in this presidential campaign. He is far closer to developing a new 21st-century philosophy of government than most leaders out there.'b'One of Santorum\xe2\x80\x99s strengths is that he understands that a nation isn\xe2\x80\x99t just an agglomeration of individuals; it\xe2\x80\x99s a fabric of social relationships. In his 2005 book, \xe2\x80\x9cIt Takes a Family,\xe2\x80\x9d he had chapters on economic capital as well as social capital, moral capital, cultural capital and intellectual capital. He presents an extended argument against radical individualism. \xe2\x80\x9cJust as original sin is man\xe2\x80\x99s inclination to try to walk alone without God, individualism is man\xe2\x80\x99s inclination to try to walk alone among his fellows,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes.'b'Communities breed character. Santorum argues that government cannot be agnostic about the character of its citizens because the less disciplined the people are, the more government must step in to provide order.'b'His political philosophy is built around the Catholic concept of subsidiarity \xe2\x80\x94 that everything should be done at the lowest possible level. That produces a limited role for Washington, but still an important one.'b'Over the years, Santorum has sought to use the federal government to nurture healthy communities. Welfare reform, which he helped lead, was a paternalistic way to use state power to encourage hard work.'b'He seeks to triple the size of the child tax credit, to make families more financially secure. He has supported flex time and transportation policies to make life easier for working parents. After initial opposition, he came to support AmeriCorps, the federal community service program.'b'Santorum believes Head Start should teach manners to children. He has supported efforts to police the airwaves and corporate marketing campaigns. He believes that felons should recover the right to vote if they stay out of trouble for five years after their release from prison.'b'Santorum\xe2\x80\x99s policies on tax reform, entitlement reform and the other big issues are similar to Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s and most of the other Republican candidates. But he seems to understand that simply cutting is not enough to build a healthy society. To avert decline, America has to restore its values.'b'Santorum understands that we have to fuse economics talk and values talk. But he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t appreciated that the biggest challenge to stable families, healthy communities and the other seedbeds of virtue is not coastal elites. It\xe2\x80\x99s technological change; it\xe2\x80\x99s globalization; it\xe2\x80\x99s personal mobility and expanded opportunity; it\xe2\x80\x99s an information-age economy built on self-transformation and perpetual rebranding instead of fixed inner character. It is the very forces that give us the dynamism and opportunities in the first place.'b'Santorum doesn\xe2\x80\x99t yet see that once you start thinking about how to foster an economic system that would nurture our virtues, you wind up with an agenda far more drastic and transformational.'b'If you believe in the dignity of labor, it makes sense to support an infrastructure program that allows more people to practice the habits of industry. If you believe in personal responsibility, you have to force Americans to receive only as much government as they are willing to pay for. If you believe in the centrality of family, you have to have a government that both encourages marriage and also supplies wage subsidies to men to make them marriageable.'b'If you believe social trust is the precondition for a healthy society, you have to have a simplified tax code that inspires trust instead of degrading it. If you believe that firm attachments and stable relationships build human capital, you had better offer early education for children in disorganized neighborhoods. If you want capitalists thinking for the long term and getting the most out of their workers, you have to encourage companies to be more deeply rooted in local communities rather than just free-floating instruments of capital markets.'b'I doubt Santorum is going to win the nomination. Main Street Republicans like Romney usually beat social conservatives like Santorum because there are just so many more of them in the Republican electorate. But social conservatives and libertarians often provide the ideas that Main Street leaders co-opt.'b'America is creative because of its moral materialism \xe2\x80\x94 when social values and economic ambitions get down in the mosh pit and dance. Santorum is in the fray.'b'With his new defense strategy, President Obama has put forward a generally pragmatic vision of how this country will organize and deploy its military in the 21st century, while also addressing its deep fiscal problems.'b'It is based on the idea that the country must be smarter and more restrained in its use of force \xe2\x80\x94 a relief after President George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s disastrous war in Iraq. It will mean a significant reduction in the size of the Army and Marine Corps. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t minimize the fact that the world is a very dangerous place and says the country must still be ready to fight a major land war \xe2\x80\x94 although one lasting for years would require another buildup.'b'It argues, persuasively, that many of the challenges out there can be dealt with by air power, intelligence, special operations or innovative technologies like drones.'b'Mr. Obama wants to spend less on nuclear weapons \xe2\x80\x94 the most unnecessary part of the arsenal \xe2\x80\x94 although how much less is unclear. He plans to focus more resources on naval and air power in the Strait of Hormuz, to contain an increasingly assertive Iran, and in Asia, to moderate and counterbalance China\xe2\x80\x99s ambitions. We agree that the United States needs to be more engaged in both areas, but the new Asia focus, in particular, must not be an excuse to avoid other needed budget cuts.'b'With all American troops out of Iraq and Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s pledge to draw down in Afghanistan, it is time for a serious evaluation of the strategic environment and this country\xe2\x80\x99s role and responsibilities. The fiscal crisis has made that more urgent.'b'Congress has already mandated nearly $500 billion in cuts in Pentagon spending over the next decade, and this strategy takes those into consideration. The failure of the Congressional supercommittee to reach a deficit deal means almost $500 billion more are supposed to kick in next January, but it is unclear how that would affect the new strategy. Both sets of cuts can be absorbed, if made prudently. No one should feel sorry for the Pentagon: It has had a blank check for a decade, and even with these cuts, the budget will continue to grow.'b'Republicans are predictably in high dudgeon over the decision to jettison the cold-war concept of being able to fight and win two conventional land wars simultaneously. It was always an artificial construct intended mainly to ensure the Pentagon got all it wanted.'b'Still, the United States must be ready to face multiple contingencies. Our own chilling list includes a collapsing Pakistan, another state hijacked by Al Qaeda, Iran blocking oil shipping as it pursues its nuclear ambitions or a weak or unbalanced North Korean leader making a suicidal run across the South Korean border.'b'At a Pentagon briefing where 'b'Mr. Obama put his personal stamp on the strategy'b', Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, insisted that the country \xe2\x80\x9cwill always be able to do more than one thing at a time. More importantly, wherever we are confronted and in whatever sequence, we will win.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'They gave few details on what 'b'the new strategy'b' will mean in practice. 'b'According to reports in The Times'b', the Pentagon plans to shrink the Army even below current targets, dropping to 490,000 soldiers over the next decade. That sounds reasonable, but there must be a clear plan on how to build up again quickly if needed.'b'We understand the importance of sending a clear message that this country is not ceding anything in the Pacific to China. But that cannot become the Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s newest argument for unrestrained spending. The Times reported that Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has already made the mistaken decision not to eliminate any of the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s 11 aircraft carriers; even scaling back to 10 could save at least $4 billion over the next decade.'b'It came at the barrel of a budget-cutting gun, but President Obama has begun to bring more rationality to military planning. The real impact of the strategy will be seen in the budget he unveils later this month.'b'Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. tried to address growing concerns about ethical behavior and conflicts of interest on the Supreme Court in his annual 'b' report'b' on the federal judiciary. But he skirted the heart of the problem: the justices are the only American judges not bound by a code of ethics.'b'He dismissed criticism that justices are exempt from the Judicial Conference\xe2\x80\x99s Code of Conduct, contending that they do \xe2\x80\x9cconsult\xe2\x80\x9d the code, which \xe2\x80\x9cplays the same role\xe2\x80\x9d for the court as it does for other federal judges.'b'But he misstates the code\xe2\x80\x99s authority. While a justice can ignore the code, all other judges must obey it. If the Supreme Court is serious about abiding by an ethics code, there are ways for it to do so without impinging on the court\xe2\x80\x99s independence and its constitutional role.'b'Because of the court\xe2\x80\x99s unique position, a justice\xe2\x80\x99s decision to recuse cannot be appealed to any other court. But the court can certainly say which parts of the code should not apply to the justices and then adopt other suitable means of accountability.'b'For starters, the justices could follow a good 'b'example'b' set by the chief justice\xe2\x80\x99s usual ally, Justice Antonin Scalia. They should commit to explaining in written opinions any decisions they make to deny motions for their recusal, except on the most sensitive and confidential issues. They could also openly adopt the judicial conduct code as they work to adapt it.'b'Chief Justice Roberts\xe2\x80\x99s report disclosed that in 1991 the justices passed \xe2\x80\x9can internal resolution\xe2\x80\x9d on rules about financial disclosure and limits on gifts and outside income. The court could follow this precedent, but this time making public the language of the resolution and the names of the justices who support it, as in any opinion.'b'Until the court takes these steps, there will be continuing 'b'concerns'b' about the justices\xe2\x80\x99 impartiality. It is not enough for the justices to rely on their own \xe2\x80\x9cconstant vigilance and good judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d as Chief Justice Roberts contends. It is disingenuous for him to claim that \xe2\x80\x9cno compilation of ethical rules can guarantee integrity\xe2\x80\x9d when no code currently applies to the court. Adopting a conduct code would clarify the rules that apply to the justices and greatly bolster public confidence in the court.'b'The 'b'Federal Election Commission'b' ended 'b'another abysmal year'b' with its three Republican commissioners blocking an attempt to unmask the secret donors flooding the 2012 hustings with unlimited special-interest money.'b'The three Democratic commissioners favored closing an F.E.C. loophole from 2007 that requires disclosure only if a donor\xe2\x80\x99s stated \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose\xe2\x80\x9d is to electioneer \xe2\x80\x94 as if any would-be secret donor would admit that. It has been particularly exploited in the wake of the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s Citizens United ruling, which allows corporations, unions and other heavy hitters to spend unlimited amounts.'b'The result has been huge new money troughs improperly proclaiming social welfare goals so political donors can hide. More than $135 million in stealth funds for attack ads and wet-kiss endorsements was pumped into the 2010 campaigns. Hundreds of millions more in undercover money is on tap this year.'b'The one thread of hope in the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was its urging a mandate for \xe2\x80\x9cprompt disclosure\xe2\x80\x9d of donors so voters might discern whether candidates are \xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98in the pocket\xe2\x80\x99 of so-called moneyed interests.\xe2\x80\x9d Legislation to identify the big check writers was approved by the Democratic House in 2010 but was narrowly blocked by a Republican filibuster in the Senate.'b'Republicans contend that the F.E.C. somehow lacks authority to rewrite regulations to close the loophole that it created. Congressional Democrats and watchdog groups are sensibly pursuing a separate court challenge to the flawed rule.'b'Courage, not authority, is what the three Republican naysayers obviously lack as political operatives from both parties salivate for even more secret windfalls. Inevitably, the money will come with donors\xe2\x80\x99 quid-pro-quo expectations and even more political corruption.'b'When Linnaeus standardized the system of species description in the 18th century, Latin was the language of science. So it has remained, if only in a highly technical sense. The binomial names used by Homo sapiens are Latin, and for years botanists, unlike zoologists, were still required to use a page or two of Latin to describe the distinctive characteristics of a newly named species \xe2\x80\x94 the attributes that made it different from any other. But no more. As of Jan. 1, 'b'diagnostic botanical descriptions may be written in Latin or English'b', and the electronic publication of new names is accepted.'b'These changes acknowledge some basic facts. Botanical Latin is barely Latin at all, since it includes a huge new scientific vocabulary that would have stumped Cicero. Nor is a Latin description of a new species likely to be more accurate or internationally intelligible than one in English. Furthermore, scientific publication is increasingly moving to the Internet, expanding accessibility. It makes no sense to slow the rate of botanical description by forcing scientists to learn how to encode their discoveries in Latin or by putting up with the lag time in getting a discovery into actual print.'b'Unlike modern botanists, Linnaeus felt no special urgency in going about his job. As climate change alters our world, anything that speeds up the description of species before they vanish is welcome. As it is, botanists have described roughly 200,000 species, with about 2,000 new species being described each year at the current rate. At best, they are less than halfway through the task of indexing all the plants, fungi and algae on earth.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'How to Save Iraq From Civil War'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Dec. 28):'b'The gentlemen who wrote the article have seats in the Iraqi Parliament or government, granting them the powers and responsibilities to resolve differences, change or formulate the laws, and advocate the policies they favor, should they gain the required majority vote.'b'It is fair to ask why these gentlemen are not trying to make the changes they call for through the legislative body, rather than asking for external intervention. While claiming to be anti-authoritarian, the writers actually want to impose their own will after having failed to secure the needed support in Parliament.'b'The message conveyed to the Iraqi government by citizens from all over the country is that we do not want to return to sectarian conflict and violence.'b'I dispute the accusation that Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki has delegated the administration of the Defense Ministry and other security services to his allies and to officers from his Dawa Party. The Defense Ministry is currently run by a minister known for his professionalism who previously held the post. The government has chosen security officials from the former army, and perhaps there are some who were affiliated with the Baath Party, yet they were known as professional and loyal to the nation.'b'I think that the writers tried to give the impression that the Iraqi government is led by a single party. The prime minister\xe2\x80\x99s Dawa Party is part of a wider coalition, the National Alliance, which itself is part of a broader national unity government in which Iraqiya ministers occupy nine positions. The writers or their parties are now part of the government and have their ministers in the cabinet, but they behave like an opposition faction, seeking to impede its performance while simultaneously complaining that the government is not working well.'b'The fact that the writers, one of whom is a minister, have urged the United States government to reduce its support for the Iraqi government is a sad example of the type of \xe2\x80\x9cpartnership\xe2\x80\x9d they speak of.

The Muslim Brotherhood will most likely win half the lower house of Parliament, and more extreme Islamists will occupy a quarter. Secular parties will be left with just 25 percent of the seats.'b'Islamism did not cause the Arab Spring. The region\xe2\x80\x99s authoritarian governments had simply failed to deliver on their promises. Though Arab authoritarianism had a good run from the 1950s until the 1980s, economies eventually stagnated, debts mounted and growing, well-educated populations saw the prosperous egalitarian societies they had been promised receding over the horizon, aggrieving virtually everyone, secularists and Islamists alike.'b'The last few weeks, however, have confirmed that a revolution\xe2\x80\x99s consequences need not follow from its causes. Rather than bringing secular revolutionaries to power, the Arab Spring is producing flowers of a decidedly Islamist hue. More unsettling to many, Islamists are winning fairly: religious parties are placing first in free, open elections in Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt. So why are so many Arabs voting for parties that seem politically regressive to Westerners?'b'The West\xe2\x80\x99s own history furnishes an answer. From 1820 to 1850, Europe resembled today\xe2\x80\x99s Arab world in two ways. Both regions experienced historic and seemingly contagious rebellions that swept from country to country. And in both cases, frustrated people in many nations with relatively little in common rallied around a single ideology \xe2\x80\x94 one not of their own making, but inherited from previous generations of radicals.'b'In 19th-century Europe, that ideology was liberalism. It emerged in the late 18th century from the American, Dutch, Polish and especially French revolutions. Whereas the chief political divide in society had long been between monarchs and aristocrats, the revolutions drew a new line between the \xe2\x80\x9cold regime\xe2\x80\x9d of monarchy, nobility and church, and the new commercial classes and small landholders. For the latter group, it was the old regime that produced the predatory taxes, bankrupt treasuries, corruption, perpetual wars and other pathologies that dragged down their societies. The liberal solution was to extend rights and liberties beyond the aristocracy, which had inherited them from the Middle Ages.'b'Suppressing liberalism became the chief aim of absolutist regimes in Austria, Russia and Prussia after they helped defeat France in 1815. Prince Klemens von Metternich, Austria\xe2\x80\x99s powerful chancellor, claimed that \xe2\x80\x9cEnglish principles\xe2\x80\x9d of liberty were foreign to the Continent. But networks of liberals \xe2\x80\x94 Italian carbonari, Freemasons, English Radicals \xe2\x80\x94 continued to operate underground, communicating across societies and providing a common language for dissent.'b'This helped lay the ideological groundwork for Spain\xe2\x80\x99s liberal revolution in 1820. From there, revolts spread to Portugal, the Italian states of Naples and Piedmont, and Greece. News of the Spanish revolution even spurred the adoption of liberal constitutions in the nascent states of Gran Colombia, Argentina, Uruguay, Peru and Mexico. Despite their varied grievances, in each case liberalism served as a rallying point and political program on which the malcontents could agree.'b'A decade later, in July 1830, a revolution toppled France\xe2\x80\x99s conservative Bourbon monarchy. Insurrection spread to Belgium, Switzerland, a number of German and Italian states and Poland. Once again, a variety of complaints were distilled into the rejection of the old regime and the acceptance of liberalism.'b'The revolutions of 1848 were more numerous and consequential but remarkably similar to the earlier ones. Rebels with little in common \xe2\x80\x94 factory workers in Paris, peasants in Ireland, artisans in Vienna \xe2\x80\x94 followed a script written in the 1790s that was rehearsed continuously in the ensuing years across the continent.'b'Today, rural and urban Arabs with widely varying cultures and histories are showing that they share more than a deep frustration with despots and a demand for dignity. Most, whether moderate or radical, or living in a monarchy or a republic, share a common inherited language of dissent: Islamism.'b'Political Islam, especially the strict version practiced by Salafists in Egypt, is thriving largely because it is tapping into ideological roots that were laid down long before the revolts began. Invented in the 1920s by the Muslim Brotherhood, kept alive by their many affiliates and offshoots, boosted by the failures of Nasserism and Baathism, allegedly bankrolled by Saudi and Qatari money, and inspired by the defiant example of revolutionary Iran, Islamism has for years provided a coherent narrative about what ails Muslim societies and where the cure lies. Far from rendering Islamism unnecessary, as some experts forecast, the Arab Spring has increased its credibility; Islamists, after all, have long condemned these corrupt regimes as destined to fail.'b'Liberalism in 19th-century Europe, and Islamism in the Arab world today, are like channels dug by one generation of activists and kept open, sometimes quietly, by future ones. When the storms of revolution arrive, whether in Europe or the Middle East, the waters will find those channels. Islamism is winning out because it is the deepest and widest channel into which today\xe2\x80\x99s Arab discontent can flow.'b'MANCHESTER, N.H.'b'I know that this week you have been kicking yourself for not having paid more attention to Rick Santorum.'b'Me, too! How can we call ourselves informed citizens without a thorough grounding in the heart and mind of the man who almost won the Iowa caucuses? So, as a public service, I am concluding my job of reading books by all the Republican presidential hopefuls with the work of Rick Santorum.'b'So you won\xe2\x80\x99t have to. Not that you were planning to anyway.'b'I say that with some confidence, since Santorum\xe2\x80\x99s big book, \xe2\x80\x9cIt Takes a Family,\xe2\x80\x9d is about as easy to acquire as an original Gutenberg Bible. It\xe2\x80\x99s shocking, really.

One of the things you first notice about Santorum on the campaign trail, besides his affinity for sweater vests, is that he does like to go on and on. The other night in New Hampshire, he was introduced by a woman who told the audience about a house party she gave for him last summer in which her guest of honor was still talking at 11 o\xe2\x80\x99clock. \xe2\x80\x9cI was ready to go to bed, but Senator Santorum stayed,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe stayed and stayed.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s a little like a right-wing, avenging-angel version of Bill Clinton. You just set him down, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll run on for hours.'b'Santorum\xe2\x80\x99s book is only about his political vision, so we don\xe2\x80\x99t get much personal background. This is a shame, because he grew up at a veterans\xe2\x80\x99 hospital where his parents were on staff, and I would have liked to have heard about his feelings on being raised in the belly of a government-run health care system.'b'Instead, it\xe2\x80\x99s mainly a retort to \xe2\x80\x9cIt Takes a Village\xe2\x80\x9d by Hillary Clinton, whose claim that it takes more than just the nuclear family to rear a child has always raised Republican hackles. Santorum\xe2\x80\x99s hackles, however, have levitated to the stratosphere.'b'The village, he says, is 'b'terrible'b'. It\xe2\x80\x99s run by \xe2\x80\x9cthe Bigs\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the media, education establishment and federal government, through their minions, the liberal village elders. The elders just want to boss the peasants around, and they hate the whole idea of old-fashioned nuclear families \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of what it instills in children and society \xe2\x80\x94 traditional values.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'You may notice a tinge of paranoia in Santorum\xe2\x80\x99s thinking.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThanks to rogue decisions by liberal judges, liberal feminists and the other village elders have let the horses of No Fault-Freedom run wild and have boarded up the proverbial barn door to ensure that traditional morals are locked out,\xe2\x80\x9d Santorum explains. Prose-wise, he makes Mitt Romney sound like F. Scott Fitzgerald.'b'Santorum looks at Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s village and sees something like the evil mountain in \xe2\x80\x9cLord of the Rings.\xe2\x80\x9d Everything the liberal elders do is for the worst possible motives. They don\xe2\x80\x99t want to legalize same-sex marriage so that gay couples can have the right to commit themselves permanently and legally to each other. The liberals/gays don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in lifelong commitments! They only believe in \xe2\x80\x9ca kind of cohabitation,\xe2\x80\x9d where you can pack up and leave any time you like, and now they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to impose that on the poor, monogamous peasants.'b'To be fair, all of Santorum\xe2\x80\x99s village elders aren\xe2\x80\x99t bad. At one point, he calls for social conservatives to join hands with \xe2\x80\x9cour entertainment \xe2\x80\x98nobility\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the movie stars and sports heroes \xe2\x80\x94 to strip the sleaze from popular culture. He realizes his readers may accuse him of consorting with the enemy. (\xe2\x80\x9cAm I now suggesting appeasement, rapprochement, or perhaps even partial surrender?\xe2\x80\x9d) Of course not! Unlike the other top dogs, he explains, the entertainment celebrities are not really liberal, but only pretending to be \xe2\x80\x9cbecause that\xe2\x80\x99s the cultural norm created by the Bigs in their industry.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is pretty much the only time that anybody connected to business is accused of being a Big.'b'Since \xe2\x80\x9cIt Takes a Family\xe2\x80\x9d was published in 2005, Barack Obama doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make an appearance. But during his current campaign, Santorum has made it clear that he thinks Obama is the worst village elder of all, who is feeding us \xe2\x80\x9cthe narcotic of government dependency\xe2\x80\x9d so that Americans will be helpless and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be more powerful and important.'b'Do you think, people, that it might be possible to criticize the president without insisting that everything he does is propelled by sinister motives and bad character? O.K., maybe not this year.'b'I stand corrected.'b'Contrary to my assertion last Saturday, the N.C.A.A. does allow college athletes to engage a lawyer if they are accused of violating its rules. After hearing from the N.C.A.A., I made a few phone calls and discovered that, indeed, universities investigating improprieties by athletes do usually inform them that they can hire a lawyer.'b'In the course of those calls, however, I stumbled on a case so egregious \xe2\x80\x94 yet so perfectly illustrative of the N.C.A.A.\xe2\x80\x99s judicial \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 that I concluded it needed wider exposure. Last week, 'b'I described'b' the N.C.A.A. as a cartel. Turns out, it\xe2\x80\x99s a Star Chamber, too.'b'Meet 'b'Devon Ramsay'b', a fullback at the University of North Carolina, and once a big-time pro prospect. He is also a good student and \xe2\x80\x9ca fine citizen,\xe2\x80\x9d according to a former coach, John Shoop, \xe2\x80\x9cthe kind of person this university should be proud of.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the summer of 2010, 'b'a scandal befell the football team'b', when it was discovered that some players had attended a party that appeared to be thrown by sports agents trying to curry favor with them. (The N.C.A.A. forbids athletes from accepting gifts from agents.) North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s ensuing investigation led it to several instances of supposed \xe2\x80\x9cacademic fraud,\xe2\x80\x9d including a paper Ramsay had written two years earlier.'b'After practice one day early in the 2010 season, Ramsay was brought in for questioning by North Carolina officials and confronted with e-mails between himself and a university athletic tutor. The e-mails showed that she had made 'b'a series of minor suggestions'b' to improve a three-page sociology paper. The university\xe2\x80\x99s Honor Court would later conclude that the tutoring was so within the bounds of normalcy that it declined to hear a case against Ramsay.'b'The N.C.A.A., however, came to a rather different conclusion. After being shown the e-mail \xe2\x80\x9cevidence\xe2\x80\x9d by North Carolina officials, it told the school that Ramsay was guilty of academic fraud. Fearing that the N.C.A.A. would punish the university if it continued to play Ramsay, 'b'North Carolina declared him ineligible'b'. When it then asked the N.C.A.A. to restore his eligibility \xe2\x80\x94 as it must do to get a player back on the field \xe2\x80\x94 the N.C.A.A. refused. Thus, without so much as a hearing, much less any due process, Ramsay\xe2\x80\x99s college career appeared to be over, along with his hope of one day playing pro football.'b'Belatedly, Ramsay found a lawyer, Robert Orr, a former State Supreme Court judge. Or rather, Orr found him after 'b'reading an article'b' in which his mother expressed her anger and bewilderment at what had happened to her son. A date had been set to appeal the N.C.A.A.\xe2\x80\x99s decision, and university officials were pressuring Ramsay to admit wrongdoing. Such an admission, they said, was needed to sway the N.C.A.A.'b'Orr said no; his client had done nothing wrong. The appeal was canceled. Instead, Orr led an effort to convince the N.C.A.A. that the university had uncovered \xe2\x80\x9cnew evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d starting with the fact that no one knew whether Ramsay ever submitted the paper with the tutor\xe2\x80\x99s changes. The N.C.A.A. 'b'restored Ramsay\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility'b' \xe2\x80\x94 after the season had ended \xe2\x80\x94 without ever admitting its own culpability. It was a face-saving ploy.'b'I wish this story had a happy ending, but, so far, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. In the first game of his senior season, Ramsay 'b'suffered a terrible knee injury'b'. Earlier this week \xe2\x80\x94 after learning this column was in the works \xe2\x80\x94 the N.C.A.A. agreed to grant him an extra year of eligibility, so he can show pro scouts he can still play. In the interim, however, North Carolina hired a new football coach who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t use fullbacks in his offense.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI wish all the players had gotten a lawyer immediately,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ramsay\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Sharon Lee.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone needed someone to look out for their interests.\xe2\x80\x9d But these athletes are still kids, often na\xc3\xafve and overly trusting of their school. At the point at which Ramsay was told he could have a lawyer, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know what the accusation was; once he found out, he assumed it would quickly blow over because it was so insignificant. By the time he realized he needed a lawyer, it was far too late.'b'Whether he plays professional football or not, his mother says, for the rest of his life, \xe2\x80\x9cDevon is going to have to answer questions about his ethics. The N.C.A.A. has done far more damage to my son than just deprive him of the chance to play football games.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I know there are readers who believe I am wasting valuable space writing about sports. I got e-mails to that effect after last week\xe2\x80\x99s column. To my mind, though, the fact that the N.C.A.A. is willing to destroy an athlete\xe2\x80\x99s career without even a nod to a fundamental right like due process is simply wrong. It needs to change. That is why I will continue writing about this subject, as events warrant, in the coming months.'b'Now that the most polarized and paralyzed Congress in memory has managed to kill one of its most resilient boondoggles \xe2\x80\x94 the three-decade-old, multibillion-dollar subsidy for corn ethanol \xe2\x80\x94 we hope it has not exhausted its resolve and will take a hatchet to other harmful energy subsidies, chiefly those it gives to fossil fuels.'b''b'The ethanol subsidy was allowed to expire last Saturday'b', a death blow that was all the more remarkable coming just a few days before the Republican caucuses in the cornfields of Iowa, where the subsidy has long been seen as untouchable.'b'The 45-cent-per-gallon tax credit for oil companies to blend ethanol into gasoline cost taxpayers $5 billion to $6 billion a year, deepening the budget deficit. It boosted corn prices and increased food prices generally by encouraging farmers to replace other crops with corn. Its environmental virtues were less than advertised. Billed as a lower-carbon replacement for fossil fuels, corn ethanol generated more carbon dioxide than gasoline after taking into account the emissions caused when new land was cleared to replace the food lost to fuel production.'b'Several factors conspired to kill the tax break (as well as an exorbitant tariff on imports aimed at keeping cheaper Brazilian ethanol out). Conservatives did not like the subsidy\xe2\x80\x99s price tag and liberals saw it as a form of corporate welfare. It was also unnecessary and redundant. Corn ethanol is now commercially viable without the subsidy and is further supported by a Congressional mandate requiring refiners to blend up to 15 billion gallons a year.'b'Congress should now focus on the oil industry, which has long enjoyed a web of arcane and unnecessary tax breaks \xe2\x80\x94 deductions for well depletion and intangible drilling costs. They are unique to the industry and, when combined with other subsidies, 'b'cost roughly $4 billion'b' a year.'b'President Obama has tried twice to kill these subsidies, without success. We hope he tries again in his coming Budget Message. The Congressional Research Service says that ending the subsidies would have no effect on gas prices for consumers and only a trivial effect on industry profits, which have been at record highs.'b'But we are not holding our breath for a sea change in Congress on this issue. The unusual coalition that mobilized to fight the ethanol subsidy is unlikely to be replicated in any struggle over oil and gas subsidies, which House Republicans and their paymasters in industry have sworn to defend. We can, however, hope for modest progress in other areas. Congress allowed a grant program important to the solar power industry to expire at the end of the year. The program encourages private investment in solar power, is credited with creating thousands of jobs and should be renewed.'b'Similarly, a federal production tax credit that has provided incentives for wind power operators since 1992 will expire at the end of 2012. Congress most recently extended the program as part of the 2009 stimulus package, and it should make sure to extend it again. It, too, has been an important source of jobs.'b'The bottom line is clear: Congress should end the subsidies to Big Oil and redeploy the money saved to support truly new energy technologies, like wind and solar power, or even high-tech biofuels that don\xe2\x80\x99t harm the environment and threaten the food supply.'b'In its broad strokes, 'b'the December employment report'b' is an upbeat finish to a difficult year. Job growth accelerated, the workweek expanded modestly, wages ticked up and the unemployment rate declined.'b'Unfortunately, it will take far greater monthly growth than the 200,000 jobs created in December \xe2\x80\x94 and higher quality jobs \xe2\x80\x94 to spur significant consumer spending and a self-reinforcing recovery. For that to occur, the government will have to do more.'b'At a minimum, to avoid a collapse in consumer demand and a rise in joblessness, Congress needs to extend existing federal unemployment benefits and the payroll tax cut beyond their expiration in late February. To create jobs now while laying a foundation for future growth, the economy needs a broader jobs agenda, like the one proposed last year by President Obama, including government spending for public works, aid to state and local governments and an infrastructure bank.'b'Before Congress recessed for the holidays, Republican lawmakers resisted all that. In the face of intense public disapproval and pressure from their own leaders, they finally agreed to renew jobless aid and the payroll tax cut \xe2\x80\x94 but only for two months. The question now is whether Republican lawmakers will continue to resist and reduce even basic assistance.'b'If they don\xe2\x80\x99t do what is needed, it will be impossible to gain any traction in the still-ailing job market. 'b'December\xe2\x80\x99s tally'b', 200,000 more jobs, was almost surely inflated by about 40,000 jobs because of a problematic seasonal adjustment in counting holiday couriers and messengers.'b'Meanwhile, gains in higher-paying blue-collar jobs, which are essential to strong consumer spending, were tentative. An addition of 23,000 manufacturing jobs, for instance, followed four months of little change. Categories that have been steadily adding jobs (retail stores, bars and restaurants) tend to be low-paying, while categories that were flat in December (including state government jobs) tend to be solidly middle class.'b'Joblessness, though declining, continued to exert a profound drag on the economy. The unemployment rate dropped to 8.5 percent in December, compared with 8.7 percent in November and a peak of 10 percent in October 2009. The improvement is not as dramatic as it seems, however, because the difficult job market over that period has caused many potential workers to drop out (or never enter) the labor force.'b'In the four years since the Great Recession began in December 2007, nearly everyone in the country has been touched by mass unemployment. If you are lucky to have held on to your job, you surely have relatives and friends who have lost theirs or children who haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to find one. In December, unemployment among 16-to-24-year-olds was 16.7 percent, still up 5 percentage points since the start of the recession.'b'Among workers ages 25 to 54, joblessness was 7.6 percent, and for workers age 55 and older it was 6.2 percent; for both age groups, the current jobless rates are still far higher than their prerecession levels. Even among college graduates under 25, unemployment averaged 9.2 percent over the past year. A lot more help is needed.'b'The Obama administration is taking a major step toward bolstering legal immigration and protecting families \xe2\x80\x94 while removing some of the arbitrary cruelty from the workings of the immigration bureaucracy. 'b'It announced on Friday'b' that it would change a notorious process to avoid separating families when immigrants apply to become legal permanent residents.'b'Under current law, an illegal immigrant who has an American citizen for a spouse or parent is generally allowed to apply for a green card to become a legal permanent resident. But the application has to be made in an immigrant\xe2\x80\x99s home country \xe2\x80\x94 and any illegal immigrant who leaves the country is automatically barred from returning for at least three years, sometimes 10.'b'If such a separation would cause \xe2\x80\x9cextreme hardship\xe2\x80\x9d to an American citizen, an immigrant can apply for a waiver. But he or she has to make that application \xe2\x80\x94 and await the decision \xe2\x80\x94 in his or her home country. Because waivers are notoriously time consuming and hard to get, an applicant would typically wait months abroad for a waiver to be approved and risk being stranded from his or her family for years if it is not approved.'b'Not surprising, many immigrants who are eligible for visas \xe2\x80\x94 possibly hundreds of thousands \xe2\x80\x94 choose to stay in the shadows instead.'b'The new rule proposed by 'b'Alejandro Mayorkas'b', the director of the 'b'United States Citizenship and Immigration Services'b', would allow immigrants to obtain provisional waivers in the United States before they left to pick up their visas. This means they won\xe2\x80\x99t have to be separated from their families for long, uncertain periods and will go to their consular appointments knowing that they will be able to quickly come home. The agency also said it was also planning to streamline procedures to cut down the wait times for visas to a few weeks at most.'b'Mr. Mayorkas\xe2\x80\x99s announcement was a rare appearance of common sense and compassion on immigration in Washington. It was particularly welcomed by Mexicans, many of whom use the consulate south of El Paso, in Ciudad Ju\xc3\xa1rez, a city with a horrific murder rate. Waiting months there for visa processing and interviews involves not just bureaucratic risks, but risks to life and limb.'b'President Obama, like President George W. Bush before him, has been utterly stymied by members of Congress, mostly Republicans, who oppose any and all reforms of outdated, unjust immigration laws. Even actions that promote legality in the immigration system meet diehard resistance. Advocates have long urged Mr. Obama to take the lead with administrative actions that balance humane policies with the rule of law. This is one.'b'That didn\xe2\x80\x99t take long.'b'As we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten around to casting votes to select a Republican presidential nominee, the antiblack rhetoric has taken center stage.'b'You just have to love (and despise) this kind of predictability.'b'On Sunday, Rick \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Rooster'b'\xe2\x80\x9d Santorum, campaigning in Iowa, said what sounded like \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make black people\xe2\x80\x99s lives better by giving them somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s money.

So, on Thursday in New Hampshire, he sharpened the shiv and dug it in deeper, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m prepared, if the N.A.A.C.P. invites me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to their convention and talk about why the African-American community should demand paychecks and not be satisfied with food stamps.\xe2\x80\x9d On Friday, Gingrich 'b'defended himself'b', as usual, by insisting that exactly what he said wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly what he said. He was advocating for African-Americans, not disparaging them.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cUh huh.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The comments from Santorum and Gingrich came after a renewed exploration of Ron Paul\xe2\x80\x99s controversial newsletters, one of which 'b'said in June 1992 about the Los Angeles riots'b': \xe2\x80\x9cOrder was only restored in L.A. when it came time for the blacks to pick up their welfare checks three days after rioting began.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Paul has, of course, insisted that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t 'b'write or review'b' the newsletters, although they were written under his name, he made money from them and he used to 'b'brag about them'b'.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cUh huh.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'First, some facts. Take the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. PolitiFact has rated Gingrich\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfood stamp president\xe2\x80\x9d charge as only half-true. Yes, participation in the program is at a record high, but Bush-era efforts to increase participation and broaden the program \xe2\x80\x9cproduced consistent increases in the 'b'number of average monthly beneficiaries'b'. The number rose in seven out of the eight years of Bush\xe2\x80\x99s presidency \xe2\x80\x94 most of which were years not considered recessionary. All told, the number of recipients rose by a cumulative 63 percent during Bush\xe2\x80\x99s eight-year presidency.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Now to the singling out of blacks. The largest group of SNAP beneficiaries is by far non-Hispanic whites. However, it is true that the rate of participation is much higher among blacks than whites. Put the emphasis where you wish.'b'Finally, as to the false dichotomy of \xe2\x80\x9cfood stamps\xe2\x80\x9d versus \xe2\x80\x9cpaychecks.\xe2\x80\x9d First, according to the United States Department of Agriculture, most SNAP participants are either too old or too young to work. Forty-seven percent were under age 18, and 8 percent were 60 or older. Second, \xe2\x80\x9cnearly 30 percent of SNAP households had earnings in 2010, and 41 percent of all SNAP participants lived in a household with earnings.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But race is usually less about facts than historical mythology, which evokes the black bogyman, who saps the money from the whites who earn it. Ever since blacks first arrived on these shores in chains, they have been perceived as lazy and dependent on whites \xe2\x80\x94 first as slaves, and then as \xe2\x80\x9centitled\xe2\x80\x9d citizens.'b'It is the Shackles-to-Bootstraps Doctrine of Self-Defeat that disavows any and all structural inhibitors to success.'b'The preface of the \xe2\x80\x9cEncyclopedia of Black Folklore and Humor\xe2\x80\x9d tells a story about the first black captives arriving in the New World and one slave \xe2\x80\x9cmuttering angrily to himself.\xe2\x80\x9d The captain of the boat says to him, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you?

Here, for instance, is how the CNN analyst 'b'David Gergen'b' has described Japan: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s now a very demoralized country and it has really been set back.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But that presentation of Japan is a myth. By many measures, the Japanese economy has done very well during the so-called lost decades, which started with a stock market crash in January 1990. By some of the most important measures, it has done a lot better than the United States.'b'Japan has succeeded in delivering an increasingly affluent lifestyle to its people despite the financial crash. In the fullness of time, it is likely that this era will be viewed as an outstanding success story.'b'How can the reality and the image be so different? And can the United States learn from Japan\xe2\x80\x99s experience?'b'It is true that Japanese housing prices have never returned to the ludicrous highs they briefly touched in the wild final stage of the boom. Neither has the Tokyo stock market.'b'But the strength of Japan\xe2\x80\x99s economy and its people is evident in many ways. There are a number of facts and figures that don\xe2\x80\x99t quite square with Japan\xe2\x80\x99s image as the laughingstock of the business pages:'b'\xc2\x95 Japan\xe2\x80\x99s average'b' life expectancy'b' at birth grew by 4.2 years \xe2\x80\x94 to 83 years from 78.8 years \xe2\x80\x94 between 1989 and 2009. This means the Japanese now typically live 4.8 years longer than Americans. The progress, moreover, was achieved in spite of, rather than because of, diet. The Japanese people are eating more Western food than ever. The key driver has been better health care.'b'\xc2\x95 Japan has made remarkable strides in Internet infrastructure. Although as late as the mid-1990s it was ridiculed as lagging, it has now turned the tables. In a recent survey by Akamai Technologies, of the 50 cities in the world with the fastest Internet service, 38 were in Japan, compared to only 3 in the United States.'b'\xc2\x95 Measured from the end of 1989, the yen has risen 87 percent against the U.S. dollar and 94 percent against the British pound. It has even risen against that traditional icon of monetary rectitude, the Swiss franc.'b'\xc2\x95 The 'b'unemployment rate'b' is 4.2 percent, about half of that in the United States.'b'\xc2\x95 According to 'b'skyscraperpage.com'b', a Web site that tracks major buildings around the world, 81 high-rise buildings taller than 500 feet have been constructed in Tokyo since the \xe2\x80\x9clost decades\xe2\x80\x9d began. That compares with 64 in New York, 48 in Chicago, and 7 in Los Angeles.'b'\xc2\x95 Japan\xe2\x80\x99s current account surplus \xe2\x80\x94 the widest measure of its trade \xe2\x80\x94 totaled $196 billion in 2010, up more than threefold since 1989. By comparison, America\xe2\x80\x99s current account deficit ballooned to $471 billion from $99 billion in that time. Although in the 1990s the conventional wisdom was that as a result of China\xe2\x80\x99s rise Japan would be a major loser and the United States a major winner, it has not turned out that way. Japan has increased its exports to China more than 14-fold since 1989 and Chinese-Japanese bilateral trade remains in broad balance.'b'As longtime Japan watchers like Ivan P. Hall and Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr. point out, the fallacy of the \xe2\x80\x9clost decades\xe2\x80\x9d story is apparent to American visitors the moment they set foot in the country. Typically starting their journeys at such potent symbols of American infrastructural decay as Kennedy or Dulles airports, they land at Japanese airports that have been extensively expanded and modernized in recent years.'b''b'William J. Holstein'b', a prominent Japan watcher since the early 1980s, recently visited the country for the first time in some years. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a dramatic gap between what one reads in the United States and what one sees on the ground in Japan,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Japanese are dressed better than Americans. They have the latest cars, including Porsches, Audis, Mercedes-Benzes and all the finest models. I have never seen so many spoiled pets. And the physical infrastructure of the country keeps improving and evolving.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Why, then, is Japan seen as a loser? On the official 'b'gross domestic product'b' numbers, the United States has ostensibly outperformed Japan for many years. But even taking America\xe2\x80\x99s official numbers at face value, the difference has been far narrower than people realize. Adjusted to a per-capita basis (which is the proper way to do this) and measured since 1989, America\xe2\x80\x99s G.D.P. grew by an average of just 1.4 percent a year. Japan\xe2\x80\x99s figure meanwhile was even more anemic \xe2\x80\x94 just 1 percent \xe2\x80\x94 implying that it underperformed the United States by 0.4 percent a year.'b'A look at the underlying accounting, however, suggests that, far from underperforming, Japan may have outperformed. For a start, in a little noticed change, United States statisticians in the 1980s embarked on an increasingly aggressive use of the so-called hedonic method of adjusting for inflation, an approach that in the view of many experts artificially boosts a nation\xe2\x80\x99s apparent growth rate.'b'On the calculations of John Williams of 'b'Shadowstats.com'b', a Web site that tracks flaws in United States economic data, America\xe2\x80\x99s growth in recent decades has been overstated by as much as 2 percentage points a year. If he is even close to the truth, this factor alone may put the United States behind Japan in per-capita performance.'b'If the Japanese have really been hurting, the most obvious place this would show would be in slow adoption of expensive new high-tech items. Yet the Japanese are consistently among the world\xe2\x80\x99s earliest adopters. If anything, it is Americans who have been lagging. In cellphones, for instance, Japan leapfrogged the United States in the space of a few years in the late 1990s and it has stayed ahead ever since, with consumers moving exceptionally rapidly to ever more advanced devices.'b'Much of the story is qualitative rather than quantitative. An example is Japan\xe2\x80\x99s eating-out culture. Tokyo, according to the Michelin Guide, boasts 16 of the world\xe2\x80\x99s top-ranked restaurants, versus a mere 10 for the runner-up, Paris. Similarly Japan as a whole beats France in the Michelin ratings. But how do you express this in G.D.P. terms?'b'Similar problems arise in measuring improvements in the Japanese health care system. And how does one accurately convey the vast improvement in the general environment in Japan in the last two decades?'b'Luckily there is a yardstick that finesses many of these problems: electricity output, which is mainly a measure of consumer affluence and industrial activity. In the 1990s, while Japan was being widely portrayed as an outright \xe2\x80\x9cbasket case,\xe2\x80\x9d its rate of increase in per-capita electricity output was twice that of America, and it continued to outperform into the new century.'b'Part of what is going on here is Western psychology. Anyone who has followed the story long-term cannot help but notice that many Westerners actively seek to belittle Japan. Thus every policy success is automatically discounted. It is a mind-set that is much in evidence even among Tokyo-based Western diplomats and scholars.'b'Take, for instance, how Western observers have viewed Japan\xe2\x80\x99s demographics. The population is getting older because of a low birthrate, a characteristic Japan shares with many of the world\xe2\x80\x99s richest nations. Yet this is presented not only as a critical problem but as a policy failure. It never seems to occur to Western commentators that the Japanese both individually and collectively have chosen their demographic fate \xe2\x80\x94 and have good reasons for doing so.'b'The story begins in the terrible winter of 1945-6, when, newly bereft of their empire, the Japanese nearly starved to death. With overseas expansion no longer an option, Japanese leaders determined as a top priority to cut the birthrate. Thereafter a culture of small families set in that has continued to the present day.'b'Japan\xe2\x80\x99s motivation is clear: food security. With only about one-third as much arable land per capita as China, Japan has long been the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest net food importer. While the birth control policy is the primary cause of Japan\xe2\x80\x99s aging demographics, the phenomenon also reflects improved health care and an increase of more than 20 years in life expectancy since 1950.'b'Psychology aside, a major factor in the West\xe2\x80\x99s comprehension problem is that virtually everyone in Tokyo benefits from the doom and gloom story. For foreign sales representatives, for instance, it has been the perfect get-out-of-jail card when they don\xe2\x80\x99t reach their quotas. For Japanese foundations it is the perfect excuse in politely waving away solicitations from American universities and other needy nonprofits. Ditto for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in tempering expectations of foreign aid recipients. Even American investment bankers have reasons to emphasize bad news. Most notably they profit from the so-called yen-carry trade, an arcane but powerful investment strategy in which the well informed benefit from periodic bouts of weakness in the Japanese yen.'b'Economic ideology has also played an unfortunate role. Many economists, particularly right-wing think-tank types, are such staunch advocates of laissez-faire that they reflexively scorn Japan\xe2\x80\x99s very different economic system, with its socialist medicine and ubiquitous government regulation. During the stock market bubble of the late 1980s, this mind-set abated but it came back after the crash.'b'Japanese trade negotiators noticed an almost magical sweetening in the mood in foreign capitals after the stock market crashed in 1990. Although previously there had been much envy of Japan abroad (and serious talk of 'b'protectionist'b' measures), in the new circumstances American and European trade negotiators switched to feeling sorry for the \xe2\x80\x9cfallen giant.\xe2\x80\x9d Nothing if not fast learners, Japanese trade negotiators have been appealing for sympathy ever since.'b'The strategy seems to have been particularly effective in Washington. Believing that you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t kick a man when he is down, chivalrous American officials have largely given up pressing for the opening of Japan\xe2\x80\x99s markets. Yet the great United States trade complaints of the late 1980s \xe2\x80\x94 concerning rice, financial services, cars and car components \xe2\x80\x94 were never remedied.'b'The \xe2\x80\x9cfallen giant\xe2\x80\x9d story has also even been useful to other East Asian nations, particularly in their trade diplomacy with the United States.'b'A striking instance of how the story has influenced American perceptions appears in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Next 100 Years,\xe2\x80\x9d by the consultant George Friedman. In a chapter headed \xe2\x80\x9cChina 2020: Paper Tiger,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Friedman argues that, just as Japan \xe2\x80\x9cfailed\xe2\x80\x9d in the 1990s, China will soon have its comeuppance. Talk of this sort powerfully fosters complacency and confusion in Washington in the face of a United States-China trade relationship that is already arguably the most destructive in world history and certainly the most unbalanced.'b'Clearly the question of what has really happened to Japan is of first-order geopolitical importance. In a stunning refutation of American conventional wisdom, Japan has not missed a beat in building an ever more sophisticated industrial base. That this is not more obvious is a tribute in part to the fact that Japanese manufacturers have graduated to making so-called producers\xe2\x80\x99 goods. These typically consist of advanced components or materials, or precision production equipment. They may be invisible to the consumer, yet without them the modern world literally would not exist. This sort of manufacturing, which is both highly capital-intensive and highly know-how-intensive, was virtually monopolized by the United States in the 1950s and 1960s and constituted the essence of American economic leadership.'b'Japan\xe2\x80\x99s achievement is all the more impressive for the fact that its major competitors \xe2\x80\x94 Germany, South Korea, Taiwan and, of course, China \xe2\x80\x94 have hardly been standing still. The world has gone through a rapid industrial revolution in the last two decades thanks to the \xe2\x80\x9ctargeting\xe2\x80\x9d of manufacturing by many East Asian nations. Yet Japan\xe2\x80\x99s trade surpluses have risen.'b'Japan should be held up as a model, not an admonition. If a nation can summon the will to pull together, it can turn even the most unpromising circumstances to advantage. Here Japan\xe2\x80\x99s constant upgrading of its infrastructure is surely an inspiration. It is a strategy that often requires cooperation across a wide political front, but such cooperation has not been beyond the American political system in the past. The Hoover Dam, that iconic project of the Depression, required negotiations among seven states but somehow it was built \xe2\x80\x94 and it provided jobs for 16,000 people in the process. Nothing is stopping similar progress now \xe2\x80\x94 nothing, except political bickering.'b'Scientists have long worried that an influenza virus that has ravaged poultry and wild birds in Asia might evolve to pose a threat to humans. Now scientists financed by the National Institutes of Health have shown in a laboratory how that could happen. In the process they created a virus that could kill tens or hundreds of millions of people if it escaped confinement or was stolen by terrorists.'b'We nearly always champion unfettered scientific research and open publication of the results. In this case it looks like the research should never have been undertaken because the potential harm is so catastrophic and the potential benefits from studying the virus so speculative.'b'Unless the scientific community and health officials can provide more persuasive justifications than they have so far, the new virus, which is in the Netherlands, ought to be destroyed. Barring that, it should be put in a few government-controlled laboratories with the highest containment rating, known as biosafety level 4. That is how the United States and Russia contain samples of smallpox, which poses nowhere near the same danger of global devastation.'b'In the future, it is imperative that any such experiments be rigorously analyzed for potential dangers \xe2\x80\x94 preferably through an international review mechanism, but also by governmental funding agencies \xe2\x80\x94 before they are undertaken, not after the fact as is happening in this case.'b'The most frightening research was done by scientists at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, who sought to discover how likely it is that the \xe2\x80\x9cbird flu\xe2\x80\x9d virus, designated A(H5N1), might mutate from a form that seldom infects or spreads among humans into a form highly transmissible by coughing or sneezing. Thus far the virus has infected close to 600 humans and killed more than half of them, a fatality rate that far exceeds the 2 percent rate in the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed as many as 100 million people.'b'Working with ferrets, the animal that is most like humans in responding to influenza, the researchers found that a mere five genetic mutations allowed the virus to spread through the air from one ferret to another while maintaining its lethality. A separate study at the University of Wisconsin, about which little is known publicly, produced a virus that is thought to be less virulent.'b'These findings led to an unprecedented request from an American federal advisory board that the researchers and the two scientific journals that plan to publish the studies omit any details that might help terrorists figure out how to unleash a devastating pandemic. That presumably includes details on how the engineered virus was made and details on the precise mutations that allowed it to go airborne.'b'We doubt that anything at all should be published, but it seems clear that something will be.'b'The two journals reviewing the papers seem inclined to follow the advisory board\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations that the research be published in a redacted form, provided there is some way for researchers who need the information to gain access to the full details. The Erasmus team believes that more than 100 laboratories and perhaps 1,000 scientists around the world need to know the precise mutations to look for. That would spread the information far too widely. It should suffice to have a few of the most sophisticated laboratories do the analyses.'b'Defenders of the research in Rotterdam claim it will provide two major benefits for protecting global health. First, they say the findings could prove helpful in monitoring virus samples from infected birds and animals. If genetic analysis found a virus somewhere that was only one or two mutations away from going airborne, public health officials would then know to bear down aggressively in that area to limit human contact with infected poultry and ramp up supplies of vaccines and medicines.'b'But it is highly uncertain, even improbable, that the virus would mutate in nature along the pathways prodded in a laboratory environment, so the benefit of looking for these five mutations seems marginal.'b'A second postulated benefit is that the engineered virus can be used to test whether existing antiviral drugs and vaccines would be effective against it and, if they come up short, design new drugs and vaccines that can neutralize it. But genetic changes that affect transmissibility do not necessarily change the properties that make a virus susceptible to drugs or to the antibodies produced by a vaccine, so that approach may not yield much useful new information.'b'We cannot say there would be no benefits at all from studying the virus. We respect the researchers\xe2\x80\x99 desire to protect public health. But the consequences, should the virus escape, are too devastating to risk.'b'PERHAPS the most widespread peril children face isn\xe2\x80\x99t guns, swimming pools or speeding cars. Rather, scientists are suggesting that it may be \xe2\x80\x9ctoxic stress\xe2\x80\x9d early in life, or even before birth.'b'This month, the American Academy of Pediatrics is issuing a landmark warning that this toxic stress can harm children for life. I\xe2\x80\x99m as skeptical as anyone of headlines from new medical studies (Coffee is good for you! Coffee is bad for you!), but that\xe2\x80\x99s not what this is.'b'Rather, this is a \xe2\x80\x9c'b'policy statement'b'\xe2\x80\x9d from the premier association of pediatricians, based on two decades of scientific research. This has revolutionary implications for medicine and for how we can more effectively chip away at poverty and crime.'b'Toxic stress might arise from parental abuse of alcohol or drugs. It could occur in a home where children are threatened and beaten. It might derive from chronic neglect \xe2\x80\x94 a child cries without being cuddled. Affection seems to defuse toxic stress \xe2\x80\x94 keep those hugs and lullabies coming! \xe2\x80\x94 suggesting that the stress emerges when a child senses persistent threats but no protector.'b'Cues of a hostile or indifferent environment flood an infant, or even a fetus, with stress hormones like cortisol in ways that can disrupt the body\xe2\x80\x99s metabolism or the architecture of the brain.'b'The upshot is that children are sometimes permanently undermined. Even many years later, as adults, they are 'b'more likely to suffer'b' heart disease, obesity, diabetes and other physical ailments. They are also more likely to struggle in school, have short tempers and tangle with the law.'b'The crucial period seems to be from conception through early childhood. After that, the brain is less pliable and has trouble being remolded.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou can modify behavior later, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t rewire disrupted brain circuits,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Jack P. Shonkoff, a Harvard pediatrician who has been a leader in this field. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re beginning to get a pretty compelling biological model of why kids who have experienced adversity have trouble learning.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This new research addresses an uncomfortable truth: Poverty is difficult to overcome partly because of self-destructive behaviors. Children from poor homes often shine, but others may skip school, abuse narcotics, break the law, and have trouble settling down in a marriage and a job. Then their children may replicate this pattern.'b'Liberals sometimes ignore these self-destructive pathologies. Conservatives sometimes rely on them to blame poverty on the poor.'b'The research suggests that the roots of impairment and underachievement are biologically embedded, but preventable. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the biology of social class disparities,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Shonkoff said. \xe2\x80\x9cEarly experiences are literally built into our bodies.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The implication is that the most cost-effective window to bring about change isn\xe2\x80\x99t high school or even kindergarten \xe2\x80\x94 although much greater efforts are needed in schools as well \xe2\x80\x94 but in the early years of life, or even before birth.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cProtecting young children from adversity is a promising, science-based strategy to address many of the most persistent and costly problems facing contemporary society, including limited educational achievement, diminished economic productivity, criminality, and disparities in health,\xe2\x80\x9d the pediatrics academy said in its policy statement.'b'One successful example of early intervention is home visitation by childcare experts, like those from the 'b'Nurse-Family Partnership'b'. This organization sends nurses to visit poor, vulnerable women who are pregnant for the first time. The nurse warns against smoking and alcohol and drug abuse, and later encourages breast-feeding and good nutrition, while coaxing mothers to cuddle their children and read to them. This program continues until the child is 2.'b'At age 6, studies have found, these children are only one-third as likely to have behavioral or intellectual problems as others who weren\xe2\x80\x99t enrolled. At age 15, the children are less than half as likely to have been arrested.'b'Evidence of the importance of early experiences has been mounting like snowflakes in a blizzard. For example, several studies examined Dutch men and women who had been in utero during a brief famine at the end of World War II. Decades later, those \xe2\x80\x9cfamine babies\xe2\x80\x9d had 'b'more trouble concentrating'b' and more heart disease than those born before or after.'b'Other scholars examined children who had been badly neglected in Romanian orphanages. Those who spent more time in the orphanages 'b'had shorter telomeres'b', a change in chromosomes that\xe2\x80\x99s a marker of accelerated aging. Their brain scans also looked different.'b'The science is still accumulating. But a compelling message from biology is that if we want to chip away at poverty and improve educational and health outcomes, we have to start earlier. For many children, damage has been suffered before the first day of school.'b'As Frederick Douglass noted, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'MANCHESTER, N.H.'b'RICK SANTORUM was locking down the youth vote.'b'The man who fondly recalls nuns rapping his knuckles with rulers did some verbal knuckle-rapping of his own on Thursday with students at a forum in Concord hosted by New England College.'b'Not satisfied with mentioning homosexuality in the same breath as bestiality and pedophilia, as he did in 2003, Santorum tried to win over the kids by equating homosexuality with polygamy.'b'Even for Santorum, it was a masterpiece of antediluvian abrasiveness \xe2\x80\x94 slapping gays and Mormons at the same time.'b'When 17-year-old Rhiannon Pyle, visiting with her civics class from Newburyport, Mass., pressed Santorum on how he could believe that all men are created equal and still object to two men in love marrying, he began nonsensically frothing.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo if everybody has the right to be happy, so if you\xe2\x80\x99re not happy unless you\xe2\x80\x99re married to five other people, is that O.K.?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what about three men?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The grating Santorum was their worst nightmare of a bad teacher. He merely got booed; he\xe2\x80\x99s lucky the kids didn\xe2\x80\x99t TP his car or soap the windows.'b'In a campaign where W. is an unmentionable, Santorum is an unexpected revival of Bushian uncompassionate conservatism.'b'He got more scattered boos on Friday at a library in Keene and a private high school in Dublin. In Keene, he was asked if he would protect gay rights, since gays are \xe2\x80\x9cchildren of God\xe2\x80\x9d too.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cServing in the military is not an unalienable right, it\xe2\x80\x99s a privilege, you\xe2\x80\x99re selected,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the candidate, who wants to restore \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d He also called marriage \xe2\x80\x9ca privilege, not a right,\xe2\x80\x9d for the purpose is procreation.'b'Rick Perry baits gays because it\xe2\x80\x99s good politics; Santorum sincerely means it. His political philosophy is infused with his \xc3\xbcber-Catholicism but lacks humanity.'b'At the Dublin event, 16-year-old Jessica Scharf asked Santorum how her handicapped brother could be cared for without help from the federal government. He replied, as The Times\xe2\x80\x99s Katharine Q. Seelye reported, that he and his wife \xe2\x80\x9cbear the cost\xe2\x80\x9d of a handicapped daughter; he said family, friends, neighbors and the church could help, and that caring for someone would knit them closer. Scharf told Seelye later that such a group was not equipped to handle her brother, who has multiple handicaps.'b'New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s feisty voters don\xe2\x80\x99t seem as enraptured with Santorum\xe2\x80\x99s rigid conservatism and sweater vests as evangelical voters in Iowa were.

Bush.'b'Remember him? Not long ago, he was president. For eight turbulent years. But you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know it from listening to the Republican candidates who are vying to evict his Democratic successor and reclaim the White House for their party. On the subject of the way the country was governed \xe2\x80\x94 and how it fared \xe2\x80\x94 when they last ruled that particular roost, they\xe2\x80\x99re almost consistently mum.'b'They seldom mention Bush positively. They seldom mention Bush negatively. They also never mention the Bush before Bush \xe2\x80\x94 the other slice of bread in the Clinton sandwich \xe2\x80\x94 and have thus turned the father and the son almost wholly into ghosts.'b'You\xe2\x80\x99d think Ronald Reagan, who is invoked incessantly, was the last Republican president, and you\xe2\x80\x99d think he was not only a flawless chief executive but a sinless adherent to current Republican dogma. We\xe2\x80\x99ll come back to that.'b'But after Reagan there were of course two additional Republicans over an aggregate 12 years \xe2\x80\x94 more than half of the last 23. The candidates almost never hark back to that.'b'They travel across a curiously Bush-denuded oratorical landscape. And that says a lot about the party\xe2\x80\x99s binds, fudges and fibs, along with the narrow ideological bandwidth it now occupies.'b'Santorum brought up the second Bush \xe2\x80\x94 the 43rd president, or \xe2\x80\x9c43,\xe2\x80\x9d as Republicans call him \xe2\x80\x94 during the final days of his Iowa campaign and only in passing, accusing Obama of excessive environmental protection by saying that 43 had a more reasonable approach.'b'Other Republican aspirants bring him up even less than that. Newt Gingrich glides past 43 but fusses over Bill Clinton as if he were a schoolboy crush. Knocking Obama for insufficient bipartisanship, Gingrich recently 'b'noted'b' that Clinton was expert at \xe2\x80\x9clittle courtesies\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca thousand small things,\xe2\x80\x9d like a \xe2\x80\x9cphone call on a birthday.\xe2\x80\x9d No roses?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe understood,\xe2\x80\x9d blushed Gingrich, who once shut down the government in a fit of pique with Clinton and pushed for his impeachment. For Gingrich, grudges are apparently like wives. He moves nimbly past them.'b'Gingrich can\xe2\x80\x99t discuss 43 because his own call for an assertive foreign policy and tax cuts sounds a lot like 43\xe2\x80\x99s presidency, which landed the country in a giant fiscal hole, proving that significantly diminished revenue without substantially trimmed entitlements don\xe2\x80\x99t do a budget any favors, especially when there are wars in the equation as well.'b'That presidency is a cautionary tale for successors, who aren\xe2\x80\x99t learning proper caution from it. They\xe2\x80\x99re still adamant about low taxes despite being vague about entitlement reform, which carries the risk of alienating important constituencies. So they simply eliminate 43 from the narrative, a bit of creative editing that helps them pin the mind-boggling level of federal debt overwhelmingly on Obama.'b'That debt has indeed risen at a terrifying pace over the last three years, but for reasons that have a great deal to do with ... George W. Bush. The perpetuation of 'b'his'b' tax cuts, the continuation of 'b'his'b' new prescription drug benefit, the management of 'b'his'b' wars and the interest payments on debt that 'b'he'b' accumulated account for a crucial share of the additional sum Obama has amassed. And while the details of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s stimulus spending and bailouts can and should be seriously questioned, the need for action stemmed largely from a severe economic downturn that began under 43.'b'FOR real, brave fiscal responsibility, Republicans should refer to and lionize the 41st president, the other George Bush. Much of his record, including his decision to exit Iraq after removing Saddam Hussein from Kuwait, shimmers in retrospect.'b'At great political cost, he allowed a tax increase appropriate to the fiscal circumstances. More than a few economists believe that it set the stage for the boom of the Clinton years. But 41\xe2\x80\x99s budgetary approach is less likely to draw attention from present-day Republicans than 43\xe2\x80\x99s. It runs counter to the party\xe2\x80\x99s anti-tax obsessions. It\xe2\x80\x99s anathema.'b'Can you even imagine one of the candidates crowing about his likeness to 41? To any sane audience and at any healthy national moment, that would be a major point in the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s favor. The Romney who governed Massachusetts really does resemble him. Like 41, he\xe2\x80\x99s a moneyed moderate not intrinsically interested in messy social issues.'b'But last month, when 41 'b'came close'b' to endorsing Romney in remarks to a Texas reporter, neither Romney nor his aides made a particularly big deal of it. The party they inhabit has taken an emphatic rightward lurch since 41\xe2\x80\x99s days.'b'Its candidates talk instead about Reagan, Reagan and Reagan, name-checked on Tuesday by three of the six candidates who gave speeches following the Iowa caucuses.'b'With striking frequency and trademark self-congratulation, Gingrich casts himself as a crucial ally of Reagan in the 1980s. Ron Paul goes back to the 1970s, 'b'trumpeting'b' that he was a Reagan supporter long before it was fashionable.'b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s only because Reagan governed nearly a quarter-century ago, is gone now and has become the stuff of myth as much as reality that these admirers can embrace him so unreservedly.'b'As one prominent party strategist laughingly reminded me this week, Reagan allowed a dozen tax increases by some counts and measures; put Sandra Day O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, an eventual disappointment to conservatives, on the Supreme Court; and signed the Simpson-Mazzoli immigration reform act, which gave 'b'amnesty'b' to three million illegal immigrants. The liberal in Obama must be green with envy.'b'Time warps memory. And politics is funny: not on center stage but most definitely in the wings, echoes of Bush are audible in this election. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s chief strategist, Stuart Stevens, worked on George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s 2000 campaign. So did Joe Allbaugh, who is managing Rick Perry\xe2\x80\x99s presidential bid.'b'And in Florida, where the late January primary could be the very last gasp for the anyone-but-Mitt brigade if Romney performs as well in New Hampshire and South Carolina as polls last week augured, there\xe2\x80\x99s a Bush whose blessing would actually be a political gift: Jeb.'b'He\xe2\x80\x99s not expected to put his finger on the scale. In fact, he\xe2\x80\x99s thought to be entertaining his own presidential run in 2016, if Obama wins a second term and there\xe2\x80\x99s no Republican incumbent in the picture.'b'That could be fascinating. How do you downplay your connection to the last two Republicans in the White House when your surname and theirs are the same four-letter word?'b'Cairo'b'SOMEDAY I\xe2\x80\x99d love to create a journalism course based on covering the uprising in Egypt, now approaching its first anniversary. Lesson No. 1 would be the following: Whenever you see elephants flying, shut up and take notes. The Egyptian uprising is the equivalent of elephants flying. No one predicted it, and no one had seen this before. If you didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it coming, what makes you think you know where it\xe2\x80\x99s going? That\xe2\x80\x99s why the smartest thing now is to just shut up and take notes.'b'If you do, the first thing you\xe2\x80\x99ll write is that the Islamist parties \xe2\x80\x94 the Muslim Brotherhood and the Salafist Al Nour Party \xe2\x80\x94 just crushed the secular liberals, who actually sparked the rebellion here, in the free Egyptian parliamentary elections, winning some 65 percent of the seats. To not be worried about the theocratic, antipluralistic, anti-women\xe2\x80\x99s-rights, xenophobic strands in these Islamist parties is to be recklessly na\xc3\xafve. But to assume that the Islamists will not be impacted, or moderated, by the responsibilities of power, by the contending new power centers here and by the priority of the public for jobs and clean government is to miss the dynamism of Egyptian politics today.'b'Come with me to Cairo\xe2\x80\x99s dirt-poor Shubra el-Khema neighborhood and the dilapidated Omar Abdel Aziz School, where I watched the last round of voting on Wednesday at a women-only voting center. We were guided by Amr Hassan, a 22-year-old commerce student from the \xe2\x80\x99hood \xe2\x80\x94 a secular youth, who fought to topple the Hosni Mubarak regime in Tahrir Square last year.'b'Here is what was so striking: virtually all the women we interviewed after the voting \xe2\x80\x94 all of whom were veiled, some with only slits for their eyes \xe2\x80\x94 said that they had voted for either the Muslim Brotherhood or the Salafists. But almost none said they had voted that way for religious reasons.'b'Many said they voted for Islamists because they were neighbors, people they knew, while secular liberal candidates had never once visited. Some illiterate elderly women confided that they could not read the ballot and just voted where their kids told them to. But practically all of them said they had voted for the Muslim Brotherhood or Salafist candidates because they expected them to deliver better, more honest government \xe2\x80\x94 not more mosques or liquor bans.'b'Here are some quotes from Egyptian women on why they voted Islamist: \xe2\x80\x9cI love the Muslim Brotherhood; they are the only honest ones. ... I want good education and clean air to breathe. ... We need proper medical care. ... I want my kids to be properly educated. They can\xe2\x80\x99t find any jobs. ... The Muslim Brotherhood is not just an Islamist party. It is going to help solve all the problems of the country. ... We have to get the youth working and to raise salaries. Education here is only getting worse. ... My biggest fear is lack of security. We sit in our homes \xe2\x80\x94 afraid. You are afraid your son won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to go back and forth to school without being kidnapped.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Meanwhile, when I asked our young guide Hassan, the revolutionary, whom he had voted for, he said that he wrote on his ballot \xe2\x80\x9cDown with the SCAF\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the acronym for the Egyptian military council now running the country. He spat out his disgust with the fact that while secular youth like him toppled Mubarak, the Islamist parties were winning the elections and the army generals \xe2\x80\x94 who abandoned Mubarak to save themselves \xe2\x80\x94 were still in power!'b'And there you have Egypt today \xe2\x80\x94 a four-way power struggle between the army, the rising Islamist parties, the smaller liberal parties and the secular youth of Tahrir Square. 'b'All'b' of them will have a say in how this story plays out. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to see a new Egyptian government with new thoughts,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hassan. \xe2\x80\x9cI am ready to go back into Tahrir Square if I have to.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Indeed, everyone feels more empowered now. The army has its guns and now runs the country; both the Islamists and the liberals have won electoral mandates; and the secular youth from Tahrir feel empowered by the street \xe2\x80\x94 by their now proven ability to mobilize and to fight whenever they see things going awry. Even the silent majority here, called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Party of the Couch,\xe2\x80\x9d feels more empowered, having just voted in high numbers in an election where the votes actually got counted.'b'My favorite election story was told to me by an international observer, who asked not to be identified. His voting station had just closed and as the polling workers were loading up the box filled with votes onto a bus to be taken to a central counting station, an Egyptian woman, who had just voted, ran over to them and shouted: \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, never leave that box alone. This is our future. Go and make sure they put it in the right place.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That box and all the hopes stuffed into it by so many average Egyptians is surely necessary for a new beginning here. But it is not sufficient. The country needs a leader \xe2\x80\x94 there is still a huge vacuum at the top \xe2\x80\x94 who can take all those votes, all those hopes, and meld them into a strategy to create the jobs, schooling, justice and security that all Egyptians clearly crave. If that happens, those ballot boxes really will have delivered a different future for Egypt. Until then, I am just taking notes.'b'Nice, France'b'ON Wednesday, America\xe2\x80\x99s detention camp at Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay will have been open for 10 years. For seven of them, I was held there without explanation or charge. During that time my daughters grew up without me. They were toddlers when I was imprisoned, and were never allowed to visit or speak to me by phone. Most of their letters were returned as \xe2\x80\x9cundeliverable,\xe2\x80\x9d and the few that I received were so thoroughly and thoughtlessly censored that their messages of love and support were lost.'b'Some American politicians say that people at Guant\xc3\xa1namo are terrorists, but I have never been a terrorist. Had I been brought before a court when I was seized, my children\xe2\x80\x99s lives would not have been torn apart, and my family would not have been thrown into poverty. It was only after the United States Supreme Court 'b'ordered the government'b' to defend its actions before a federal judge that I was finally able to clear my name and be with them again.'b'I left Algeria in 1990 to work abroad. In 1997 my family and I moved to Bosnia and Herzegovina at the request of my employer, the Red Crescent Society of the United Arab Emirates. I served in the Sarajevo office as director of humanitarian aid for children who had lost relatives to violence during the Balkan conflicts. In 1998, I became a Bosnian citizen. We had a good life, but all of that changed after 9/11.'b'When I arrived at work on the morning of Oct. 19, 2001, an intelligence officer was waiting for me. He asked me to accompany him to answer questions. I did so, voluntarily \xe2\x80\x94 but afterward I was told that I could not go home. The United States had demanded that local authorities arrest me and five other men. News reports at the time said the United States believed that I was plotting to blow up its embassy in Sarajevo. I had never \xe2\x80\x94 for a second \xe2\x80\x94 considered this.'b'The fact that the United States had made a mistake was clear from the beginning. Bosnia\xe2\x80\x99s highest court investigated the American claim, found that there was no evidence against me and ordered my release. But instead, the moment I was released American agents seized me and the five others. We were tied up like animals and flown to Guant\xc3\xa1namo, the American naval base in Cuba. I arrived on Jan. 20, 2002.'b'I still had faith in American justice. I believed my captors would quickly realize their mistake and let me go. But when I would not give the interrogators the answers they wanted \xe2\x80\x94 how could I, when I had done nothing wrong? \xe2\x80\x94 they became more and more brutal. I was kept awake for many days straight. I was forced to remain in painful positions for hours at a time. These are things I do not want to write about; I want only to forget.'b'I went on a hunger strike for two years because no one would tell me why I was being imprisoned. Twice each day my captors would shove a tube up my nose, down my throat and into my stomach so they could pour food into me. It was excruciating, but I was innocent and so I kept up my protest.'b'In 2008, my demand for a fair legal process went all the way to America\xe2\x80\x99s highest court. In a 'b'decision'b' that bears my name, the Supreme Court declared that \xe2\x80\x9cthe laws and Constitution are designed to survive, and remain in force, in extraordinary times.\xe2\x80\x9d It ruled that prisoners like me, no matter how serious the accusations, have a right to a day in court. The Supreme Court recognized a basic truth: the government makes mistakes. And the court said that because \xe2\x80\x9cthe consequence of error may be detention of persons for the duration of hostilities that may last a generation or more, this is a risk too significant to ignore.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Five months later, Judge Richard J. Leon, of the Federal District Court in Washington, reviewed all of the reasons offered to justify my imprisonment, including secret information I never saw or heard. The government abandoned its claim of an embassy bomb plot just before the judge could hear it. After the hearing, he 'b'ordered the government'b' to free me and four other men who had been arrested in Bosnia.'b'I will never forget sitting with the four other men in a squalid room at Guant\xc3\xa1namo, listening over a fuzzy speaker as Judge Leon read his decision in a Washington courtroom. He implored the government not to appeal his ruling, because \xe2\x80\x9cseven years of waiting for our legal system to give them an answer to a question so important is, in my judgment, more than plenty.\xe2\x80\x9d I was freed, at last, on May 15, 2009.'b'Today, I live in Provence with my wife and children. France has given us a home, and a new start. I have experienced the pleasure of reacquainting myself with my daughters and, in August 2010, the joy of welcoming a new son, Yousef. I am learning to drive, attending vocational training and rebuilding my life. I hope to work again serving others, but so far the fact that I spent seven and a half years as a Guant\xc3\xa1namo prisoner has meant that only a few human rights organizations have seriously considered hiring me. I do not like to think of Guant\xc3\xa1namo. The memories are filled with pain. But I share my story because 171 men remain there. Among them is Belkacem Bensayah, who was seized in Bosnia and sent to Guant\xc3\xa1namo with me.'b'About 90 prisoners have been cleared for transfer out of Guant\xc3\xa1namo. Some of them are from countries like Syria or China \xe2\x80\x94 where they would face torture if sent home \xe2\x80\x94 or Yemen, which the United States considers unstable. And so they sit as captives, with no end in sight \xe2\x80\x94 not because they are dangerous, not because they attacked America, but because the stigma of Guant\xc3\xa1namo means they have no place to go, and America will not give a home to even one of them.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m told that my Supreme Court case is now read in law schools. Perhaps one day that will give me satisfaction, but so long as Guant\xc3\xa1namo stays open and innocent men remain there, my thoughts will be with those left behind in that place of suffering and injustice.'b'IN the five days since his almost-victory in the Iowa caucuses, Rick Santorum\xe2\x80\x99s critics have tried out an unusual line of attack against the former Pennsylvania senator. Not content with the many targets that Santorum\xe2\x80\x99s record presents, they\xe2\x80\x99ve gone after the way he and his wife, Karen, handled the premature delivery and death of their fourth child, Gabriel, in 1996.'b'At 19 weeks of pregnancy, Gabriel was found to have a potentially fatal fetal abnormality. After a risky intrauterine surgery, Karen Santorum came down with an infection that ended up triggering labor. The baby lived for just two hours, and after his death the couple took his body home overnight \xe2\x80\x94 so that their children could \xe2\x80\x9cabsorb and understand that they had a brother,\xe2\x80\x9d Santorum said later \xe2\x80\x94 before burying him the following day.'b'This tragedy was old news until Santorum\xe2\x80\x99s Iowa surprise, at which point various commentators began to bring it up as evidence of his extremism and hypocrisy. Alan Colmes, Fox News\xe2\x80\x99s token liberal, cited Santorum\xe2\x80\x99s decision to take his son\xe2\x80\x99s body home as one of the crazier of all the \xe2\x80\x9ccrazy things he\xe2\x80\x99s said and done,\xe2\x80\x9d and The Washington Post\xe2\x80\x99s Eugene Robinson 'b'presented it'b' as evidence that Santorum isn\xe2\x80\x99t just \xe2\x80\x9ca little weird, he\xe2\x80\x99s really weird.\xe2\x80\x9d A number of left-wing 'b'Web sites'b', meanwhile, asserted that the antibiotics Santorum\xe2\x80\x99s wife had taken induced delivery before the fetus could survive outside the womb, which they argued was tantamount to the kind of late-term abortion Santorum famously opposes.'b'Neither attack made much sense. Weirdness is in the eye of the beholder, but as Commentary\xe2\x80\x99s Pete Wehner 'b'pointed out'b', at least one major pregnancy Web site advises parents of stillborn children to do roughly what the Santorums did. (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is important for your family members to spend time with the baby. This will help them come to terms with their loss.\xe2\x80\x9d) Meanwhile, the antibiotics Karen Santorum took probably 'b'did not directly induce her labor'b'. And even if they had, most pro-life worldviews \xe2\x80\x94 Santorum\xe2\x80\x99s Catholic faith included \xe2\x80\x94 make a clear moral distinction between medical interventions that directly kill a fetus and efforts to save the mother\xe2\x80\x99s life that indirectly lead to fetal death.'b'But if the attacks on the Santorums\xe2\x80\x99 personal choices were incoherent (so incoherent, in fact, that both Colmes and Robinson soon backtracked), they were also entirely characteristic of our moment. This is the second consecutive election cycle in which a Republican politician has endured a bizarre obstetrics-related controversy; last time, we had the various conspiracy theories surrounding Sarah Palin\xe2\x80\x99s pregnancy and her Down syndrome son.'b'In a sense, one could say that these kinds of invasive debates become inevitable once the traditional zone of privacy around public figures collapses. But it would be more accurate to say that the zone of privacy has collapsed precisely because of the deep moral divisions that these kinds of controversies reveal.'b'Privacy is a luxury of moral consensus. Nobody would have thought to politicize the premature birth and death of John F. Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s son Patrick, because abortion wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a polarizing issue in the America of 1963. But if a white politician in the Jim Crow South had married a black woman, the relationship would inevitably have been seen as a political gesture as well a personal decision.'b'Today, we are less divided over race, but more divided over sex and reproduction. In a country that cannot agree whether fetuses are human beings, even questions like how to mourn and bury a miscarried child are inevitably freighted with ideological significance. Likewise, in a country where the majority of Down syndrome fetuses are aborted, the mere act of carrying a child with a genetic disorder to term \xe2\x80\x94 as both the Palins and the Santorums, whose daughter Bella has Trisomy 18, have done \xe2\x80\x94 feels like a political statement.'b'The same pattern holds with respect to politicians and their marriage vows. In an era that had a clear and stable understanding of marriage, it was easier to treat politicians\xe2\x80\x99 adulteries as a private matter between a husband and a wife. But hypocrisy is the tribute that vice pays to virtue, and a society that can\xe2\x80\x99t agree on the definition of sexual virtue inevitably takes a stronger interest in whether a politician actually lives up to the definition of marriage he defends.'b'When Palin wove special needs children into her 2008 speeches, or when Santorum featured his daughter Bella in a campaign 'b'video'b', they were implicitly acknowledging these personal-is-political realities. Likewise Mitt Romney, who 'b'ran an ad'b' highlighting his 42-year marriage at the height of the twice-divorced Newt Gingrich\xe2\x80\x99s surge in the polls.'b'But by turning their personal choices to political ends, politicians lose the right to complain when those same personal lives are subject to partisan critiques. They can and should contest these critiques, but they can\xe2\x80\x99t complain about them. In a culture as divided about fundamental issues as our own, the kind of weird attacks that Rick Santorum is enduring come with the vocation he has chosen.'b'In the closing days of last year, the Obama administration announced multibillion-dollar arms sales packages to Iraq and Saudi Arabia, including advanced fighter jets, tanks, helicopters and an array of smaller weapons.'b'A case can be made for these two packages. The Pentagon needs to strengthen strategic partnerships in the region and fortify allies \xe2\x80\x94 and oil producers \xe2\x80\x94 vulnerable to Iranian pressure. These sales help create jobs at home and offset the dollar drain from oil imports. Still, we are uneasy about the timing and the terms. In its haste to complete these deals, the White House may have forfeited leverage it needs to nudge both governments toward less destructive policies.'b'With United States troops now out of Iraq, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki is spurning Washington\xe2\x80\x99s repeated pleas for national reconciliation and power sharing, endangering Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s democracy and stability. In his latest move, Mr. Maliki, a Shiite, has grabbed full control of the country\xe2\x80\x99s key security forces \xe2\x80\x94 and empowered Shiite militants \xe2\x80\x94 angering Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s Sunni Arabs and Kurds and moderate Shiites.'b'This seems an odd moment to sell him $11 billion of American-made military equipment, including fighter jets, battle tanks, cannons and armored personnel carriers \xe2\x80\x94 the same kind of weapons that Saddam Hussein once used against Iraqi Kurds and Shiites. Before closing the deal, Washington should have sought firm guarantees that Mr. Maliki would do a lot more to share power and resources \xe2\x80\x94 and drop his threat to walk away from the American-brokered power-sharing arrangement with the more inclusive Iraqiya bloc, winner of the most seats in the 2010 elections.'b'Washington should also have bargained harder with the Saudis before signing off on $30 billion of advanced F-15 jet fighters as part of a multiyear $60 billion arms deal. The idea is to strengthen Saudi competence and confidence against Iran, which poses a serious threat to all of its neighbors. That threat is more likely to come from terrorism and subversion than from Iran\xe2\x80\x99s sanctions-weakened air force, and the best-known use of Saudi troops abroad recently was to help suppress democracy demonstrations in Bahrain.'b'There are ways to mitigate these dangers. The fighter jets and some of the other sophisticated weapons are not scheduled for delivery until several years from now. And the pilots flying them will require training in the United States. If it appears that American-made weapons are being misused against domestic political opponents, deliveries can and should be held up and training programs suspended.'b'That kind of leverage is available to the United States in all foreign military sales contracts, although Washington rarely applies it. But this country\xe2\x80\x99s strategic interests must trump any sales strategy.'b'Mr. Maliki\xe2\x80\x99s provocations are weakening Iraq and making it more vulnerable to Iranian arm-twisting. Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s royal rulers need to address domestic discontent with democratic reforms. They should remember the lesson of the former shah of Iran, who spent lavishly on American weapons but lost his throne to domestic revolution. So should Washington.'b'Along with their shameful campaign to curb the collective bargaining rights of public sector workers in Wisconsin and Ohio last year, Republicans in statehouses around the country are taking aim at private sector unions.'b'Twenty-two states, mainly in the South and the West, have long had \xe2\x80\x9cright to work\xe2\x80\x9d laws forbidding contracts that require workers to pay union dues. After a decade in which business has ignored the issue, Republicans in 'b'more than 10 states'b' over the last year have begun pushing similar laws. Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s Legislature is expected to approve the antiunion legislation as early as next month.'b'Many Republican leaders are adopting model legislation proposed by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a national corporate-financed conservative organization that is also assisting the Republican push to require voter identification cards to suppress the vote of minorities, young people and other constituencies that tend to favor the Democratic Party.'b'There is little doubt that politics is also behind the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 push for right-to-work laws: they see an opportunity to further weaken unions, which are far more likely to support Democrats \xe2\x80\x94 as well as health care reform and a higher minimum wage \xe2\x80\x94 by slashing their funding and their donating power.'b'The G.O.P. and its allies, like the Chamber of Commerce and brethren organizations, are trotting out the charge that unions reduce economic growth and jobs.'b'It stands to reason that a union will reduce a company\xe2\x80\x99s profits somewhat, by obtaining a higher share for workers. But over the last three decades, economists have found that unionization has a minimal impact on growth and employment in an entire state or country. In fact, six of the 10 states with the highest unemployment have right-to-work laws. North Carolina, a right-to-work state, has a private sector unionization rate of 1.8 percent, the lowest in the nation. It also has the 'b'sixth highest'b' unemployment rate: 10 percent.'b'Unionized workers earn more and get more generous benefits. In 2010, wages of workers in unionized manufacturing companies in Indiana were 16 percent higher than in nonunion plants. 'b'One study'b' concluded that the decline in unionization since the 1970s is responsible for one-fifth to one-third of the growth in inequality in this country. Voters, unionized or not, should recognize the new \xe2\x80\x9cright to work\xe2\x80\x9d push for what it is: bad economics and cynical politics.'b'Blacksburg, Va.'b'IN the wake of widespread violence during the New York City blackout of 1977, a newspaper columnist quipped that just one flick of a light switch separated civilization from primordial chaos.'b'Leaving the hyperbole aside, artificial illumination has arguably been the greatest symbol of modern progress. By making nighttime infinitely more inviting, street lighting \xe2\x80\x94 gas lamps beginning in the early 1800s followed by electric lights toward the end of the century \xe2\x80\x94 drastically expanded the boundaries of everyday life to include hours once shrouded in darkness. Today, any number of metropolitan areas in the United States and abroad, bathed in the glare of neon and mercury vapor, bill themselves as 24-hour cities, open both for business and pleasure.'b'So it is all the more remarkable that, in what appears to be a spreading trend, dozens of cities and towns across America \xe2\x80\x94 from California and Oregon to Maine \xe2\x80\x94 are contemplating significantly reducing the number of street lamps to lower their hefty electric bills. In some communities, utility companies have already torn posts from the ground. Faced with several million dollars in unpaid bills, Highland Park, Mich., has lost two-thirds of its lamps, whereas officials in Rockford, Ill., have extinguished as many as 2,300, or 16 percent of all the city\xe2\x80\x99s streetlights.'b'Municipal officials, mindful of the winter darkness enveloping residential neighborhoods, have vainly tried to relieve public anxiety. Denials that crime rates will rise are met with skepticism by the public, as are programs to encourage homeowners to install private security lamps or to \xe2\x80\x9cadopt a light\xe2\x80\x9d for a monthly fee. Street lighting is now at risk of being restricted, as it was in earlier ages, to residences and neighborhoods able to afford it.'b'To be sure, night, our oldest terror, no longer poses the perils, both real and imaginary, that it once did. Before the Industrial Revolution, darkness conjured the worst properties in man, nature and the cosmos \xe2\x80\x94 brigands, witches and rapacious beasts were thought to lurk everywhere. \xe2\x80\x9cThe night is no man\xe2\x80\x99s friend,\xe2\x80\x9d warned a French adage.'b'Our ancestors coped by relying upon locks, weapons and prayer. Dogs were also highly prized \xe2\x80\x94 ones, in the words of a 16th-century writer, that were \xe2\x80\x9cbig, hairy, with a big head, big legs, big loins and a lot of courage.\xe2\x80\x9d When treading outdoors, ordinary folk displayed a rough-hewn resourcefulness \xe2\x80\x94 traveling by moonlight in small parties, wearing light-colored clothing and avoiding the dead of night (midnight to 3 a.m.), when demons freely prowled. Beginning at an early age, individuals committed to memory an intimate map of their environs, including every ditch, pond and graveyard (a favorite haunt of ghosts).'b'Darkness, however, was not inevitably a source of foreboding, affording instead unparalleled privacy and personal freedom. Opportunities for behavior forbidden by church and state expanded and intensified. As a consequence, early street lamps provoked sporadic complaints. Emerson observed, \xe2\x80\x9cAs gas-light is found to be the best nocturnal police, so the universe protects itself by pitiless publicity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But there was never any question that 19th-century communities welcomed lamps, which in conjunction with police forces, posed a powerful deterrent to lawlessness. Another benefit lay in the numerous pedestrians drawn by their inviting glow, whose very presence helped to discourage crime.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs safe and agreeable to walk out in the evening as by day-light,\xe2\x80\x9d pronounced a New Yorker in 1853.'b'Certainly, public anxiety over the recent removal of lamps should not be minimized. No longer are there witches and wolves to fear, but research strongly suggests, as one might expect, the critical value of street lighting as a hindrance to crime and serious accidents. (One reason for the full-scale removal of the metal posts in Highland Park was a fear that they might be stolen.)'b'Indeed, efforts to eliminate street lighting represent a rare instance in modern history in which a technology of longstanding benefit has been restricted, if not completely discarded.'b'Although some environmentalists with legitimate concerns about light pollution might welcome their removal, a preferable solution, as most recognize, lies in the utilization of lamps whose light, rather than being diffused into the atmosphere, is concentrated downward to the benefit of motorists and pedestrians. Lamps equipped with solar panels or photocell timers offer alternatives that a few communities are exploring to cut costs. After citizens of Concord, Mass., recently rebelled over the threatened loss of more than 500 lamp posts, the town retrofitted 8,200, rendering them more energy efficient and \xe2\x80\x9cdark-sky friendly\xe2\x80\x9d at a projected annual savings of nearly $300,000.'b'Financial costs and public safety, however, are not the only issues. Without the benefit of street lighting, towns and cities, after sunset, will be diminished as communities. Families will be more apt to \xe2\x80\x9ccocoon\xe2\x80\x9d at home, rather than visit friends or attend sporting and cultural events. And, too, our appreciation for night itself will suffer. Evenings can be best enjoyed if they remain inviting and safe, whether for neighborhood gatherings, walking Fido or gazing at the heavens \xe2\x80\x94 all with less chance of losing your wallet or stumbling into a ditch.'b'AS public editor, I begin the New Year with a growing appreciation for the challenge The New York Times faces in maintaining its leadership in American journalism. I want to revisit five issues here, all requiring keen judgment on the part of the paper.'b''b'The presidential campaign:'b' For Times journalists and their peers elsewhere, this quadrennial event is an adrenaline rush that requires sober oversight by senior editors to ensure that balance, fairness and accuracy survive the scramble to compete.'b''b'In a Dec. 4 column,'b' I wrote about journalists\xe2\x80\x99 reflex to impose their own narrative on a race, a dynamic that can eclipse what candidates are actually saying. Well, as last week\xe2\x80\x99s Iowa caucuses demonstrated, the Republican nomination contest steadfastly resists any coherent narrative.'b'Early in the campaign, The Times decided to remain low key in its coverage of 'b'Ron Paul,'b' the libertarian Texas congressman, and 'b'Rick Santorum,'b' the former Pennsylvania senator. Their strong showings on Tuesday, following the serial derailments of other contenders, showed just how hard it is for the paper to read the plotline of this contest.'b'In its coverage of Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s results, The Times moved quickly to set a new narrative: 'b'New Hampshire might not be so important now'b' (a premise that undercuts Mitt Romney, who hopes New Hampshire is important); 'b'this will be a long campaign'b' (Mr. Romney, hoping to lock things down in January, is dinged again); 'b'Rick Santorum is the new rising star'b' (or, I wonder, is he the next whack-a-mole victim?).'b'The premises of the emerging Times narrative are defensible, to be sure, but the nomination battle so far is teaching journalists a lesson: Be humble, because nobody knows what comes next.'b''b'The Times\xe2\x80\x99s coverage of itself:'b' I said at the top that maintaining leadership in American journalism is a challenge for The Times. Part of that challenge is the exceptional volume and frequency of campaign coverage by newer competitors like Politico.'b'There is a rising tide of well-financed news organizations that, like The Times, are competing not only for readers but for advertisers in the digital arena. One of those is Reuters, which in late December 'b'reported on the lucrative exit package'b' for Janet L. Robinson, the Times Company\xe2\x80\x99s departing chief executive.'b'Reuters said that Ms. Robinson would get not only a $4.5 million consulting fee, which The Times had previously reported, but would also be eligible to receive $10.9 million in pension benefits.'b'To its credit, 'b'The Times did report that'b' before Ms. Robinson\xe2\x80\x99s exit was announced, the Times chairman, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., had called a meeting with her in which he \xe2\x80\x9craised the issue of installing a different type of leadership at the company\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 information that seemed to indicate she was being forced out.'b'A recent spate of news about the company, however, dictates a more in-depth effort to report on how economics and competition are affecting The Times. In addition to the sudden departure of its C.E.O., the latter half of the year 'b'saw the company paying back its $250 million debt to Carlos Slim Hel\xc3\xba,'b' the Mexican magnate; 'b'the retirement at 56 of its top digital strategist,'b' Martin A. Nisenholtz; 'b'the $143 million sale of its regional newspaper group'b'; and 'b'a sharp 25 percent increase'b' in the retail price of the Monday-Saturday paper.'b'But what really makes reporting on itself imperative is that The Times so aggressively covers its peers. For example,'b' in a Dec. 13 story'b' on the departure of The Los Angeles Times\xe2\x80\x99s editor, Russ Stanton, The Times paraphrased anonymous sources saying that Mr. Stanton \xe2\x80\x9cdid not have reporters\xe2\x80\x99 best interests in mind.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Stanton angrily disputed this and told me he thought it simply wrong to allow anonymous sources to levy such an attack.'b''b'Bruce Headlam,'b' the editor who heads the New York Times media desk, said the paper accurately reflected the sentiment in the Los Angeles newsroom. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least 10 current and former employees told her this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, referring to the reporter, Amy Chozick, and added, \xe2\x80\x9cWe also obeyed our own rules about negative anonymous quotes \xe2\x80\x94 we didn\xe2\x80\x99t use them. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t preclude us from summarizing what we were hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'My view is that, in most newsrooms, it is not hard to find staffers willing to criticize the boss anonymously. It is important to hold the line against publishing such anonymous attacks.'b''b'The European debt crisis:'b' Last August, 'b'I said the paper\xe2\x80\x99s hefty investment'b' in the Wall Street-centric DealBook blog would have been better allocated to covering the devastating developments in the euro zone. To give credit (no pun intended) where it is due, the paper went all out to cover the crisis as it crescendoed in November and December.'b''b'In a Dec. 21 story,'b' The Times reported that the European Central Bank\xe2\x80\x99s decision to pump $640 billion into banks could be a \xe2\x80\x9cturning point.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'In a separate column,'b' Floyd Norris predicted the central bank\xe2\x80\x99s action \xe2\x80\x9cmay be enough to stem the European crisis for at least a few years, and go a long way to recapitalizing banks in the process.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Larry Ingrassia'b', the business editor, promises more \xe2\x80\x9canalytical pieces about where things are headed,\xe2\x80\x9d and I applaud that.'b''b'Natural gas:'b' I wrote 'b'a couple'b' of 'b'critical pieces'b' in July about The Times\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDrilling Down\xe2\x80\x9d'b' series, but as 2012 unfolds I see a problem with the newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s broader coverage of shale gas, which is becoming a major energy and environment story line.'b'The paper writes about shale gas on the business desk, the national desk and the metro desk. In some articles, the emphasis is on the huge economic potential; in others, the focus is on the environmental threat posed by the drilling process known as fracking. The coverage seems fragmented and at times contradictory. What\xe2\x80\x99s the big picture?'b''b'Dean Baquet,'b' the managing editor, told me The Times \xe2\x80\x9ccould probably better coordinate on the issue\xe2\x80\x9d in 2012 and should have an editor to \xe2\x80\x9cmake sure everybody knows what everybody else is doing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Drone wars and beyond:'b' Kudos to The Times here. 'b'I urged the paper last year'b' to press the Obama administration to reveal the legal rationale for targeted drone attacks, particularly in the case of 'b'Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen killed'b' in Yemen.'b''b'On Dec. 20, the newspaper sued to force the Justice Department to disclose its reasoning.'b' This was a worthy step, demonstrating Times leadership and the indispensable role of a free press. And it comes at a time when technology is simultaneously transforming the secret conduct of war, not to mention the landscape where The Times must compete to survive.'b'Bremen, Germany'b'I LEFT 'b'Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay'b' much as I had arrived almost five years earlier \xe2\x80\x94 shackled hand-to-waist, waist-to-ankles, and ankles to a bolt on the airplane floor. My ears and eyes were goggled, my head hooded, and even though I was the only detainee on the flight this time, I was drugged and guarded by at least 10 soldiers. This time though, my jumpsuit was American denim rather than Guant\xc3\xa1namo orange. I later learned that my C-17 military flight from Guant\xc3\xa1namo to Ramstein Air Base in my home country, Germany, cost more than $1 million.'b'When we landed, the American officers unshackled me before they handed me over to a delegation of German officials. The American officer offered to re-shackle my wrists with a fresh, plastic pair. But the commanding German officer strongly refused: \xe2\x80\x9cHe has committed no crime; here, he is a free man.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I was not a strong secondary school student in Bremen, but I remember learning that after 'b'World War II'b', the Americans insisted on a trial for war criminals at Nuremberg, and that event helped turn Germany into a democratic country. Strange, I thought, as I stood on the tarmac watching the Germans teach the Americans a basic lesson about the rule of law.'b'How did I arrive at this point? This Wednesday is the 10th anniversary of the opening of the detention camp at the American naval base at Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay, Cuba. I am not a terrorist. I have never been a member of 'b'Al Qaeda'b' or supported them. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even understand their ideas. I am the son of Turkish immigrants who came to Germany in search of work. My father has worked for years in a Mercedes factory. In 2001, when I was 18, I married a devout Turkish woman and wanted to learn more about Islam and to lead a better life. I did not have much money. Some of the elders in my town suggested I travel to Pakistan to learn to study the Koran with a religious group there.'b'I made my plans just before 9/11. I was 19 then and was na\xc3\xafve and did not think war in Afghanistan would have anything to do with Pakistan or my trip there. So I went ahead with my trip.'b'I was in Pakistan, on a public bus on my way to the airport to return to Germany when the police stopped the bus I was riding in. I was the only non-Pakistani on the bus \xe2\x80\x94 some people joke that my reddish hair makes me look Irish \xe2\x80\x94 so the police asked me to step off to look at my papers and ask some questions. German journalists told me the same thing happened to them. I was not a journalist, but a tourist, I explained. The police detained me but promised they would soon let me go to the airport. After a few days, the Pakistanis turned me over to American officials. At this point, I was relieved to be in American hands; Americans, I thought, would treat me fairly.'b'I later learned the United States paid a $3,000 bounty for me. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it at the time, but apparently the United States distributed thousands of fliers all over Afghanistan, promising that people who turned over 'b'Taliban'b' or Qaeda suspects would, in the words of one flier, get \xe2\x80\x9cenough money to take care of your family, your village, your tribe for the rest of your life.\xe2\x80\x9d A great number of men wound up in Guant\xc3\xa1namo as a result.'b'I was taken to Kandahar, in Afghanistan, where American interrogators asked me the same questions for several weeks: Where is Osama bin Laden? Was I with Al Qaeda? No, I told them, I was not with Al Qaeda. No, I had no idea where bin Laden was. I begged the interrogators to please call Germany and find out who I was. During their interrogations, they dunked my head under water and punched me in the stomach; they don\xe2\x80\x99t call this 'b'waterboarding'b' but it amounts to the same thing. I was sure I would drown.'b'At one point, I was chained to the ceiling of a building and hung by my hands for days. A doctor sometimes checked if I was O.K.; then I would be strung up again. The pain was unbearable.'b'After about two months in Kandahar, I was transferred to Guant\xc3\xa1namo. There were more beatings, endless solitary confinement, freezing temperatures and extreme heat, days of forced sleeplessness. The interrogations continued always with the same questions. I told my story over and over \xe2\x80\x94 my name, my family, why I was in Pakistan. Nothing I said satisfied them. I realized my interrogators were not interested in the truth.'b'Despite all this, I looked for ways to feel human. I have always loved animals. I started hiding a piece of bread from my meals and feeding the iguanas that came to the fence. When officials discovered this, I was punished with 30 days in isolation and darkness.'b'I remained confused on basic questions: why was I here? With all its money and intelligence, the United States could not honestly believe I was Al Qaeda, could they?'b'After two and a half years at Guant\xc3\xa1namo, in 2004, I was brought before what officials called a Combatant Status Review Tribunal, at which a military officer said I was an \xe2\x80\x9cenemy combatant\xe2\x80\x9d because a German friend had engaged in a suicide bombing in 2003 \xe2\x80\x94 after I was already at Guant\xc3\xa1namo. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe my friend had done anything so crazy but, if he had, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about it.'b'A couple of weeks later, I was told I had a visit from a lawyer. They took me to a special cell and in walked an American law professor, 'b'Baher Azmy'b'. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe he was a real lawyer at first; interrogators often lied to us and tried to trick us. But Mr. Azmy had a note written in Turkish which he had gotten from my mother, and that made me trust him. (My mother found a lawyer in my hometown in Germany who heard that lawyers at the Center for Constitutional Rights represented Guant\xc3\xa1namo detainees; the center assigned Mr. Azmy my case.) He did not believe the evidence against me and quickly discovered that my \xe2\x80\x9csuicide bomber\xe2\x80\x9d friend was, in fact, alive and well in Germany.'b'Mr. Azmy, my mother and my German lawyer helped pressure the German government to secure my release. Recently, Mr. Azmy made public a number of American and German intelligence documents from 2002 to 2004 that showed both countries suspected I was innocent. One of the documents said American military guards thought I was dangerous because I had prayed during the American national anthem.'b'Now, five years after my release, I am trying to put my terrible memories behind me. I have remarried and have a beautiful baby daughter. Still, it is hard not to think about my time at Guant\xc3\xa1namo and to wonder how it is possible that a democratic government can detain people in intolerable conditions and without a fair trial.'b'A REVOLUTION in cognitive neuroscience is changing the kinds of experiments that scientists conduct, the kinds of questions economists ask and, increasingly, the ways that architects, landscape architects and urban designers shape our built environment.'b'This revolution reveals that thought is less transparent to the thinker than it appears and that the mind is less rational than we believe and more associative than we know. Many of the associations we make emerge from the fact that we live inside bodies, in a concrete world, and we tend to think in metaphors grounded in that embodiment.'b'This metaphorical, embodied quality shapes how we relate to abstract concepts, emotions and human activity. Across cultures, \xe2\x80\x9cimportant\xe2\x80\x9d is big and \xe2\x80\x9cunimportant\xe2\x80\x9d is small, just as your caretakers were once much larger than you. Sometimes your head is \xe2\x80\x9cin the clouds.\xe2\x80\x9d You approach a task \xe2\x80\x9cstep by step.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some architects are catching on to human cognition\xe2\x80\x99s embodied nature. A few are especially intrigued by metaphors that express bodily experience in the world.'b'Take the visual metaphor of a tree as shelter. Most people live around, use and look at trees. Children climb them. People gather under them. Nearly everyone at some point uses one to escape the sun.'b'Recently, architects have deployed tree metaphors in many different settings. At the 'b'Kanagawa Institute of Technology'b' in Japan, Junya Ishigami created an elegant \xe2\x80\x9cforest\xe2\x80\x9d out of slender, white-enameled metal saplings that congregate in clusters and open into clearings of vocational work spaces. In Seville, Spain, a German architect, J\xc3\xbcrgen Mayer H., gave definition and shade to the city\xe2\x80\x99s Plaza de la Encarnaci\xc3\xb3n with his 'b'Metropol Parasol'b', a lilting, waffled construction of laminated timber.'b'Such projects follow earlier, very different tree-inspired buildings, like Toyo Ito\xe2\x80\x99s well-known 'b'Tod\xe2\x80\x99s'b', a retail store in Tokyo, and the 'b'Mediath\xc3\xa8que media library'b', an exhibition space and cinema in Sendai, Japan, which is so well supported by irregular, hollowed-out, sinuous \xe2\x80\x9ctrunks\xe2\x80\x9d (housing elevators and staircases) that it survived the enormous earthquake last March.'b'Why should tree metaphors appeal to architects? Why should they be useful, even good, for people? In the Seville project, tree imagery helps construct a distinctive public place that offers shelter and areas to congregate. As under spreading trees, the boundaries defining these spaces are permeable; easy to enter and exit, they offer nature\xe2\x80\x99s spatial freedom yet help people to feel more firmly rooted where they are. And tree metaphors, deployed architecturally, simultaneously lament nature\xe2\x80\x99s absence and symbolically insert its presence.'b'Tree metaphors also refer to the experience of living in a body on earth. Trees are static, stable objects. Someone connected to a community is \xe2\x80\x9crooted\xe2\x80\x9d there; a psychologically sturdy friend\xe2\x80\x99s feet are firmly \xe2\x80\x9cplanted\xe2\x80\x9d on the ground. We use trees to describe human bodies and souls: the area from our neck to pelvis is our \xe2\x80\x9ctrunk\xe2\x80\x9d; someone reliable is \xe2\x80\x9csolid as an oak\xe2\x80\x9d; someone exploring a new area of inquiry is \xe2\x80\x9cbranching out.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Buildings aren\xe2\x80\x99t nature, of course. Tree metaphors like the branching-out facade of Mr. Ito\xe2\x80\x99s Tod\xe2\x80\x99s surprise people. But because the surprise comes along with the implied reassurance of structural integrity (they\xe2\x80\x99re trees, after all), it prompts us to focus on the built environment, perhaps to reconsider its role in our everyday lives.'b'Architects may also like tree metaphors because a tree\xe2\x80\x99s overall structure is regular, while its fine-grained composition, its tangles of branches, are irregular, an arrangement conducive to the kind of design experimentation offered by new digital technologies.'b'But the design opportunities that tree metaphors present fail to explain their appearance in such a diverse range of buildings. Trees are familiar. Tree metaphors allow for an architectural inventiveness that stretches people without estranging them.'b'Trees are just one of the growing number of embodied metaphors used in contemporary architecture: Zaha Hadid builds 'b'riverlike spaces'b', while the Japanese firm Sanaa offers up a habitable mountainscape of a 'b'student center'b' at the \xc3\x89cole Polytechnique F\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9rale in Lausanne, Switzerland.'b'How many designers are clued in to the ongoing cognitive revolution and its potential for the built environment is unclear. But this collection of architects and projects herald more than just another stylistic or pyrotechnic, technology-driven trend. They point toward how the built environment could \xe2\x80\x94 and should \xe2\x80\x94 be radically reconceptualized around the fundamental workings of the human mind. We need, and are ever more in a position to create, a richer built environment, grounded in the way people actually experience the world around them.'b'Pusan, South Korea'b''b'KIM JONG-UN'b' can count himself lucky that his first birthday in power falls today, on a Sunday, obviating the need for a new national holiday to be created at an awkward time. But the ease with which the new \xe2\x80\x9csupreme leader\xe2\x80\x9d has taken over 'b'North Korea'b' has little to do with luck. For one thing, the propaganda apparatus did its job well. We now know why Kim Jong-un was such a peripheral figure on the evening news until his father\xe2\x80\x99s death: so that North Koreans\xe2\x80\x99 first long look at the pampered young man would be at the rarest of times \xe2\x80\x94 a time when he was suffering more than anyone.'b'More important, though, is the fact that his succession makes perfect sense in North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s ethno-nationalist personality cult. People who value racial purity always consider some bloodlines purer than others, and in \xe2\x80\x9cthe Kim Il-sung race,\xe2\x80\x9d as North Koreans call themselves, no bloodline is purer than the eternal president\xe2\x80\x99s. Kim Jong-un\xe2\x80\x99s increasingly obvious efforts to copy his revered grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s appearance and mannerisms (right down to his'b' signature'b') are naturally meant to show that \xe2\x80\x94 as a Korean saying goes \xe2\x80\x94 blood doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lie.'b'Membership in the great family is also thought to provide greater access to the elders\xe2\x80\x99 wisdom. This makes the time Kim Jong-un spent away in a Swiss school especially problematic, but the propaganda apparatus may be planning to ignore that part of his life altogether. (The latest reports suggest that he is now being credited with having written, at the age of 16, a treatise on his grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s thought, presumably while in Pyongyang, the capital.) In any case, the notion that army generals or any other important faction would object to Kim Jong-un\xe2\x80\x99s takeover was an improbable one to begin with; no North Korean could oppose the hereditary succession without being opposed to the state itself. Such an attitude is unlikely to be held by anyone in the ruling elite.'b'Unfortunately, the West seems determined to continue paying as little attention to North Korean ideology as possible. In the past few weeks the country\xe2\x80\x99s propaganda has been quoted more for comic relief than anything else. (A few over-literal readings of its flowery imagery have made it seem even more bizarre than it is.) Meanwhile the race-thinking pervading the official rhetoric has been ignored, as has the imperial-Japanese provenance of so much of it, like the talk in recent weeks of defending Kim Jong-un with \xe2\x80\x9chuman bombs\xe2\x80\x9d if necessary.'b'Most of the news media around the world continue viewing North Korea as it does not view itself, namely as a Communist state. The result has been a lot of old-school Kremlinological fuss about the power hierarchy. Several reporters have asked for my opinion on whether Kim Jong-un\xe2\x80\x99s main string-puller will be his uncle, Jang Song-taek, or Vice Marshal Ri Yong-ho, though no one has yet been able to explain to me why the question matters. After all, there is no evidence of significant disagreement inside the ruling elite in regard to any issue.'b'By Communist standards, the North Korean masses would have to judge both the government\xe2\x80\x99s economic performance and the succession in the harshest possible terms. It is because they judge them by very different standards that Kim Jong-un was able to take over so effortlessly while promising to budge \xe2\x80\x9cnot an inch\xe2\x80\x9d from his father\xe2\x80\x99s line. We should therefore not make too much of the fraudulence of all that on-screen wailing. Just because North Korean TV never films anything before rehearsing all spontaneity out of it does not mean the average citizen was unmoved. By ultra-nationalist, militarist criteria, which have more to do with North Koreans\xe2\x80\x99 perception of where the country stands in the world than material living conditions, the Dear Leader did a very good job indeed: the Korean Central News Agency may well be correct in saying he made the country virtually impregnable.'b'That very boast, however, makes things harder for 'b'Kim Jong-il'b'\xe2\x80\x99s successor. Though he appears secure inside the elite, the state as a whole must continue showing the masses that it is worthy of its beloved founder. If nuclear armament is to be seen as a closed victorious chapter, the new leader must approach the final tasks in his grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s to-do list, as\xc2\xa0impossible as they may seem from an outsider\xe2\x80\x99s perspective:\xc2\xa0drastic economic growth and national reunification. Perhaps we can discount the rumor \xe2\x80\x94 reported in 2010 \xe2\x80\x94 that internal Workers\xe2\x80\x99 Party memorandums have described unification as a requisite for prosperity, because in the latest official New Year\xe2\x80\x99s editorial, at least, reunification is thought possible in the near future only if the enemy \xe2\x80\x9cdares to infringe upon our dignity and sovereignty.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Even so, there is no reason to assume that the government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in economic matters will reduce tension on the peninsula. Judging from the stale voluntarism espoused in North Korea this month \xe2\x80\x94 the same old calls to emulate this or that heroic factory, to make better use of available resources and so on \xe2\x80\x94 Kim Jong-un will not be advocating any significant reforms. Whether North Korea continues muddling along on Chinese life support, or grows fast enough to start resembling South Korea circa 1980, the military-first government must still justify its separate existence alongside the rival state.'b'How can it do this, except through more displays of military strength and superiority? When the new leadership vaunts its adherence to the old leadership\xe2\x80\x99s policies, it is merely trying to make a virtue out of necessity.'b'Shanghai'b'FROM the outside, China often appears to be a highly centralized monolith. Unlike Europe\xe2\x80\x99s cities, which have been able to preserve a certain identity and cultural distinctiveness despite the homogenizing forces of globalization, most Chinese cities suffer from a drab uniformity.'b'But China is more like Europe than it seems. Indeed, when it comes to economics, China is more a thin political union composed of semiautonomous cities \xe2\x80\x94 some with as many inhabitants as a European country \xe2\x80\x94 than an all-powerful centralized government that uniformly imposes its will on the whole country.'b'And competition among these huge cities is an important reason for China\xe2\x80\x99s economic dynamism. The similar look of China\xe2\x80\x99s megacities masks a rivalry as fierce as that among European countries.'b'China\xe2\x80\x99s urban economic boom began in the late 1970s as an experiment with market reforms in China\xe2\x80\x99s coastal cities. Shenzhen, the first \xe2\x80\x9cspecial economic zone,\xe2\x80\x9d has grown from a small fishing village in 1979 into a booming metropolis of 10 million today. Many other cities, from Guangzhou to Tianjin, soon followed the path of market reforms.'b'Today, cities vie ruthlessly for competitive advantage using tax breaks and other incentives that draw foreign and domestic investors. Smaller cities specialize in particular products, while larger ones flaunt their educational capacity and cultural appeal. It has led to the most rapid urban \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic miracle\xe2\x80\x9d in history.'b'But the \xe2\x80\x9cmiracle\xe2\x80\x9d has had an undesirable side effect: It led to a huge gap between rich and poor, primarily between urban and rural areas. The vast rural population \xe2\x80\x94 54 percent of China\xe2\x80\x99s 1.3 billion people \xe2\x80\x94 is equivalent to the whole population of Europe. And most are stuck in destitute conditions. The main reason is the hukou (household registration) system that limits migration into cities, as well as other policies that have long favored urban over rural development.'b'More competition among cities is essential to eliminate the income gap. Over the past decade the central government has given leeway to different cities to experiment with alternative methods of addressing the urban-rural wealth gap.'b'The most widely discussed experiment is the \xe2\x80\x9cChongqing model,\xe2\x80\x9d headed by Bo Xilai, a party secretary and rising political star. Chongqing, an enormous municipality with a population of 33 million and a land area the size of Austria, is often called China\xe2\x80\x99s biggest city. But in fact 23 million of its inhabitants are registered as farmers. More than 8 million farmers have already migrated to the municipality\xe2\x80\x99s more urban areas to work, with a million per year expected to migrate there over the next decade. Chongqing has responded by embarking on a huge subsidized housing project, designed to eventually house 30 to 40 percent of the city\xe2\x80\x99s population.'b'Chongqing has also improved the lot of farmers by loosening the hukou system. Today, farmers can choose to register as \xe2\x80\x9curban\xe2\x80\x9d and receive equal rights to education, health care and pensions after three years, on the condition that they give up the rural registration and the right to use a small plot of land.'b'While Chongqing\xe2\x80\x99s model is the most influential, there is an alternative. Chengdu, Sichuan\xe2\x80\x99s largest municipality, with a population of 14 million \xe2\x80\x94 half of them rural residents \xe2\x80\x94 is less heavy-handed. It is the only city in China to enjoy high economic growth while also reducing the income gap between urban and rural residents over the past decade.'b'Chengdu has focused on improving the surrounding countryside, rather than encouraging large-scale migration to the city. The government has shifted 30 percent of its resources to its rural areas and encouraged development zones that allow rural residents to earn higher salaries and to reap the educational, cultural and medical benefits of urban life.'b'I recently visited a development zone composed of small firms that export fiery Sichuan chili sauces. Most farmers rented their land and worked in the development zone, but those who wanted to stay on their plots were allowed to. So far, one-third of the area\xe2\x80\x99s farmland has been converted into larger-scale agricultural operations that have increased efficiency.'b'More than 90 percent of the municipality\xe2\x80\x99s rural residents are now covered by a medical plan, and the government has introduced a more comprehensive pension scheme. Rural schools have been upgraded to the point that their facilities now surpass those in some of Chengdu\xe2\x80\x99s urban schools, and teachers from rural areas are sent to the city for training.'b'Empowering rural residents by providing more job opportunities and better welfare raises their purchasing power, helping China boost domestic consumption. And in 2012, Chengdu is likely to become the first big Chinese municipality to wipe out the legal distinction between its urban and rural residents, allowing rural people to move to the city if they choose.'b'Chengdu\xe2\x80\x99s success has been driven by a comprehensive, long-term effort involving consultation and participation from the bottom up, as well as a clear property rights scheme. By contrast, Chongqing has relied on state power and the dislocation of millions to achieve similar results. If Chengdu\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgentle\xe2\x80\x9d model proves to be more effective at reducing the income gap, it can set a model for the rest of the country, just as Shenzhen set a model for market reforms.'b'There are fundamental differences, of course: Chengdu\xe2\x80\x99s land is more fertile and its weather more temperate, compared to Chongqing\xe2\x80\x99s harsh terrain and sweltering summers. Life is slower in Chengdu; even the chili is milder. What succeeds in one place may fail elsewhere.'b'Ultimately, the central government will decide what works and what doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. And that\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad thing; it encourages local variation and internal competition.'b'European leaders ought to take note. Central authorities should have the power not just to punish \xe2\x80\x9closers\xe2\x80\x9d as Europe has done in the case of Greece, but to reward \xe2\x80\x9cwinners\xe2\x80\x9d that set a good example for the rest of the union.'b'STANFORD, Calif.'b'OVER the last three years, as I delved into the world of American nuclear weapons, I felt increasingly as though I had stepped into a time warp. Despite the nearly total rearrangement of the international security landscape since the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991, the rise of Islamic terrorism and the spread of nuclear materials and technology to volatile nations like Pakistan, North Korea and Iran, the Defense Department remains enthralled by cold war nuclear strategies and practices.'b'Barack Obama took office determined to change that. He has made progress on many fronts. Last week, he outlined a new, no-frills defense strategy, downsizing conventional forces. He now needs to double down on his commitment to refashion nuclear forces. He should trim the American nuclear arsenal by two-thirds to bring it down to a sensible size, order the Pentagon to scale back nuclear war-fighting plans so they are relevant to contemporary threats, remove most American intercontinental, land-based missiles from high alert and drop the quaint notion that a fleet of aging B-52 bombers can effectively deliver nuclear weapons to distant targets.'b'This agenda is not only desirable, it is doable without undercutting American security. It would save tens of billions of dollars a year, a relatively small amount by Pentagon standards, but every billion counts as Leon E. Panetta, the defense secretary, trims his budget. And the steps can safely be taken without requiring reciprocal moves by Russia that must be codified in a treaty.'b'For the last few months, the Obama administration has been conducting a classified review of the doctrines and operations that determine the shape and potential uses of America\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear armaments. If the president pushes back against the defenders of the old order at the Pentagon and other redoubts of the nuclear priesthood, he can preserve American security while making the United States a more credible leader on one of today\xe2\x80\x99s most critical issues \xe2\x80\x94 containing the spread of nuclear weapons. Like a chain smoker asking others to give up cigarettes, the United States, with its bloated arsenal, sounds hypocritical when it puts pressure on other nations to cut weapons and stop producing bomb-grade highly enriched uranium, the key ingredient of a crude nuclear weapon.'b'American actions alone won\xe2\x80\x99t end the proliferation danger, but American leadership is essential to any hope of containing the threat.'b'Sam Nunn, the former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and anything but a dove over the years, rightly warns that the spread of weapons and the means to make them may soon reach a combustible stage where New York, Washington, Moscow, Tokyo or London is at risk of a nuclear terrorist attack.'b'Mr. Nunn and other keepers of America\xe2\x80\x99s cold-war armory, George P. Shultz and Henry A. Kissinger, former Republican secretaries of state, and William J. Perry, a former Democratic defense secretary, have banded together in recent years to press, among other things, for cutting nuclear forces, de-alerting missiles and, ultimately, eliminating nuclear arms. Mr. Obama has embraced their aims and welcomed them to the Oval Office. Their high-powered, bipartisan alliance, if adroitly employed by the White House, ought to provide some political cover as Mr. Obama reshapes nuclear policy while running for a second term.'b'There is no national security rationale for maintaining an arsenal of some 5,000 warheads, with nearly 2,000 arms ready to use on short notice and the rest in reserve. We don\xe2\x80\x99t need thousands of warheads, or even hundreds, to counter threats from countries like Iran or North Korea.'b'The only conceivable use of so many weapons would be a full-scale nuclear war with Russia, which has more warheads than the United States. But two decades after the collapse of the Soviet Union, even Vladimir V. Putin, with his authoritarian bent, is not about to put Russia on a collision course with the United States that leads to nuclear war. China, equally unlikely to escalate tensions to the nuclear brink, probably has fewer than 400 warheads and a policy to use them only in self-defense. Pakistan has roughly 100, North Korea fewer than 10 and Iran, so far, zero.'b'The United States could live quite securely with fewer than 1,500 warheads, half in reserve. Defenders of the nuclear faith claim we need 5,000 weapons as a hedge against warheads that may become defective over time. But an elaborate Energy Department program to maintain and refurbish warheads, the 'b'Stockpile Stewardship Program'b', has proved highly effective.'b'Another oft-cited reason for increasing our arsenal is that the Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear war-fighting plans still call for striking hundreds of targets in Russia and China, as well as dozens of sites in a number of other publicly unidentified nations \xe2\x80\x94 presumably Iran, North Korea and Syria \xe2\x80\x94 considered potentially hostile to the United States and eager to possess unconventional weapons.'b'Washington\xe2\x80\x99s current nuclear war plans remain far too outsize to deal with any plausible attack on America. Mr. Obama could remove some nations from the hit list, starting with China, and tell his generals to limit the number of targets in the countries that remain.'b'The oversize American nuclear arsenal features an equally outdated reliance on long-distance bombers. The days when lumbering B-52 bombers could play a central role in delivering nuclear weapons \xe2\x80\x94 memorably spoofed in Stanley Kubrick\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cDr. Strangelove\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 ended decades ago. Mr. Obama should ground the bombers and depend on land- and sea-based missiles.'b'The high-alert status of America\xe2\x80\x99s intercontinental ballistic missiles is another anachronism. There are few circumstances that might require the United States to quickly launch nuclear-tipped missiles, and missiles on high alert are an invitation to an accident, or impulsive action. In the first year of his presidency, Mr. Obama outlined an ambitious nuclear weapons agenda. Absent new action, Washington will remain frozen in a costly cold war posture.'b''b'Ladies and gentlemen, during this evening\xe2\x80\x99s performance, flash photography and video recording are strictly prohibited.

In Florida, the Palm Beach Opera set up a tweet section for a performance of \xe2\x80\x9cMadama Butterfly.\xe2\x80\x9d Last month, The Public Theater in New York said via Twitter: \xe2\x80\x9cWe think we may be the first of the large theaters to do some Tweet Seats, don\xe2\x80\x99t know about smaller theaters.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'So what\xe2\x80\x99s the deal with tweeting and texting in theaters?

They could scroll along during the show, the way CNN and Fox News Channel have been running distracting viewer tweets across the bottom of the TV screen during presidential debates.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s plenty to learn via the thumbs of socially aware theatergoers. For example, according to actual postings during a concert featuring works of Mozart, furnished by the Cincinnati Symphony, withak53 wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cMusic hall looks a lot prettier from the top balcony.\xe2\x80\x9d And hippielunatic tweeted: \xe2\x80\x9cstar spangled banner always chokes me up a bit in music hall.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It was in the film \xe2\x80\x9cTrains, Planes and Automobiles\xe2\x80\x9d that Steve Martin said to John Candy, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, everything isn\xe2\x80\x99t an anecdote.\xe2\x80\x9d He advised, \xe2\x80\x9cHave a point.

Perhaps the real goal of frightened theater managers is not so much to enhance the experience for the majority, for whom Mozart works just fine without tweets from the balcony, but to make the time go faster for those who barely tolerate the arts but may have purchased a ticket as, say, a favor to their companion.

He uses parsnips instead of potatoes and a whole bottle of wine, which is probably why I like it.'b'The Supreme Court has not banned capital punishment, as it should, but it has long held that the death penalty is unconstitutional if randomly imposed on a handful of people. An important new study based on capital cases in Connecticut provides powerful evidence that death sentences are haphazardly meted out, with virtually no connection to the heinousness of the crime.'b'A number of 'b'studies'b' in the last three decades have shown that black defendants are more likely to be sentenced to death if their victim is white rather than black. But defenders of capital punishment often respond to those studies by arguing that the \xe2\x80\x9cworst of the worst\xe2\x80\x9d are sentenced to death because their crimes are the most egregious.'b'The Connecticut 'b'study'b', conducted by John Donohue, a Stanford law professor, completely dispels this erroneous reasoning. It analyzed all murder cases in Connecticut over a 34-year period and found that inmates on death row are indistinguishable from equally violent offenders who escape that penalty. It shows that the process in Connecticut \xe2\x80\x94 similar to those in other death-penalty states \xe2\x80\x94 is utterly arbitrary and discriminatory.'b'From 1973, when Connecticut passed a death penalty law, to 2007, 4,686 murders were committed in the state. Of those, 205 were death-eligible cases (capital murders that include the killing of a police officer, murder for hire, murder-rape and murder committed during a kidnapping) that resulted in some kind of conviction, either through a plea bargain or conviction at trial. The arbitrariness started at the charging level: nearly a third of these death-eligible cases were not charged as capital offenses as they could have been, but as lesser crimes. Sixty-six defendants were convicted of capital murder, 29 went to a hearing for a death sentence, nine death sentences were sustained and one person was executed.'b'Why was this small group of defendants singled out for death? Did their crimes make them more deserving of execution than all the others?'b'To get answers, Professor Donohue designed an \xe2\x80\x9cegregiousness\xe2\x80\x9d ratings system to compare all 205 cases. It considered four factors: victim suffering (like duration of pain); victim characteristics (like age, vulnerability); defendant\xe2\x80\x99s culpability (motive, intoxication or premeditation); and the number of victims. He enlisted students from two law schools to rate each case (based on fact summaries without revealing the case\xe2\x80\x99s outcome or the race of the defendant or victim) on a scale from 1 to 3 (most egregious) for each of the four factors. The raters also gave each case an overall subjective assessment of egregiousness, from 1 (low) to 5 (high), to ensure that more general reactions could be captured.'b'The egregiousness scores for those charged with capital murder and those who were not were virtually identical; the nature of the crime bore almost no relationship to how the case came out. Among the 29 who had a death penalty hearing, there is no clear difference in the level of egregiousness for the 17 who got life without parole and the 12 sentenced to death (three eventually had their sentences vacated for various reasons). Among the 32 most awful cases on the four-factor egregiousness scale, only one resulted in a death sentence.'b'Rather than punish the worst criminals, the Connecticut system, Professor Donohue found, operates with \xe2\x80\x9carbitrariness and discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d The racial effect is very evident (minority defendants with white victims were far more likely to be sentenced to death than others), as is geographic disparity. In the city of Waterbury, a death-eligible killer was at least seven times as likely to be sentenced to death as in the rest of the state.'b'In 1972, the Supreme Court in 'b'Furman v. Georgia'b' struck down state death-penalty laws that lacked guidelines on how the penalty should be applied. It found that with only 15 percent of death-eligible murder convictions in Georgia leading to a death sentence, imposition of the penalty was \xe2\x80\x9cfreakishly\xe2\x80\x9d rare \xe2\x80\x94 and therefore arbitrary and unconstitutional. The rate in the Donohue study is far more extreme at 4.4 percent.'b'The court also said in Furman that a death-penalty system must have a \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningful basis for distinguishing the few cases in which it is imposed from the many cases in which it is not.\xe2\x80\x9d Clearly, Connecticut\xe2\x80\x99s system fails this requirement. Because it\xe2\x80\x99s a small state, Professor Donohue was able to conduct a comprehensive study of every capital murder case with a conviction. But Connecticut\xe2\x80\x99s lessons also apply to bigger states, like California, Texas and Ohio, where prosecutors even in neighboring counties use drastically different factors to impose the death penalty.'b'In 2011, the number of new death sentences imposed in the United States 'b' fell'b' by 25 percent to 78, the lowest number since capital punishment was reinstated in 1976. This \xe2\x80\x9cfreakishly\xe2\x80\x9d rare application \xe2\x80\x94 among the thousands of murder cases a year \xe2\x80\x94 is strong evidence that every state system is arbitrary and capricious. The death penalty in Connecticut is clearly unconstitutional, barbaric and should be abolished, as it should be everywhere.\xc2\xa0'b''b''b'Robert Jay Lifton, Steven Pinker and readers discuss violence in this and other eras.'b''b'The Letter'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'I have been studying violent events for several decades, so I was deeply interested in Steven Pinker\xe2\x80\x99s new book, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Better Angels of Our Nature,\xe2\x80\x9d which claims that violence has long been declining and that this may be our most peaceful era in our species\xe2\x80\x99 existence. Dr. Pinker argues that, over centuries, human beings have become less prone to kill and engage in torture and other cruel and sadistic behavior.'b'I have not experienced the 20th and 21st centuries that way. My work has taken me to Auschwitz and Hiroshima, and I have come to see these two dreadful events as largely defining our era.'b'Our subsequent development not only in nuclear but also chemical and biological weapons, and our pollution of the planet with our wastes, suggest further directions of mass killing and dying.'b'The deaths over the last two centuries reflect a revolution in the technology of killing. During the 20th century we saw the emergence of extreme forms of numbed technological violence, in which unprecedented, virtually unlimited numbers of people could be killed. Those who did the killing could be completely separated, geographically and psychologically, from their victims.'b'Millions of people were also killed during the 20th century in more old-fashioned, low-tech ways during genocides, induced famines and wars.'b'There is a terrible paradox here. Dr. Pinker and others may be quite right in claiming that for most people alive today, life is less violent than it has been in previous centuries. But never have human beings been in as much danger of destroying ourselves collectively, of endangering the future of our species.'b'We are not helpless about our fate. There could not be a more crucial moment to draw upon our gradual taming of individual violence, along with our growing awareness of the grotesque consequences of numbed technological violence, to achieve lasting forms of what can be called peace.'b'ROBERT JAY LIFTON'b' New York, Jan. 3, 2012'b''b''b'The writer is a psychiatrist and the author of, most recently, \xe2\x80\x9cWitness to an Extreme Century: A Memoir.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b''b''b'Readers React'b''b'Robert Jay Lifton has profoundly illuminated the human dimension of the 20th century\xe2\x80\x99s most destructive events.

While the world has seen some horrific mass killings, the global rate of death from genocide has plummeted over the decades, and may now be at an all-time low.'b'Estimates of the carnage wreaked by the swords, pikes and arrows of earlier centuries (and by the machetes of the past one) show that remote-control technologies are not necessary for high-volume killing.'b'As fellow students of the human mind, Dr. Lifton and I might agree that the causes of violence lie not so much in the machinery of killing as in the psychology of killers: in the balance between tribalism, vengeance, sadism, amoral predation and toxic ideologies on the one hand, and compassion, self-control, fairness and reason on the other.'b'The fact that the balance can change (and, I argue, has changed) over time is perhaps the firmest ground for another shared conviction: that we are not helpless about our fate.'b'STEVEN PINKER'b' Cambridge, Mass., Jan. 4, 2012'b''b''b'The writer is a professor of psychology at Harvard and the author of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'Steven Pinker and Robert Jay Lifton may be talking at cross-purposes.'b'Dr. Pinker may be correct that the actual number of killings has declined over the centuries, which implies that any given person today stands less of a chance of dying violently than just a few centuries ago.

The lethal technologies of Hiroshima and Auschwitz have vastly improved since the mid-20th century. Nuclear weapons can be made in various sizes, can continue to proliferate to other countries and possibly terrorist groups, and now enable us to do what in the past only God could do: destroy the world.'b'This capacity for killing in numbers nothing short of the infinite cannot be adequately grasped by statistics concerning past war-making and killing.'b'Nor can we simply say, as Dr. Pinker does, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe causes of violence lie not so much in the machinery of killing as in the psychology of killers.\xe2\x80\x9d Rather, I would point to the dynamic of mind and technology, in which the technology creates a psychological attraction to ultimate power and protection from painful feelings associated with more direct forms of killing.'b'People who construct nuclear weapons or plan their possible use do not have to be angry. They need only be socialized to the ideology of nuclear necessity, whether for \xe2\x80\x9cnational security\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdeterrence\xe2\x80\x9d or other plausible purposes.'b'Of course there has been more to the 20th and 21st centuries than Auschwitz and Hiroshima.

Indeed, much protest over the years has sought to do that, whether as 1960s and 1980s opposition to war and weaponry or today\xe2\x80\x99s Occupy movement. We would do well to channel more of this protest into combating all violence, but especially the numbed technological variety.'b'ROBERT JAY LIFTON'b' New York, Jan. 5, 2012'b''b'HAITI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t always the \xe2\x80\x9cpoorest nation in the Western hemisphere,\xe2\x80\x9d though it\xe2\x80\x99s almost impossible to read about the country today without coming across that phrase. In the two years since the earthquake that devastated it, Haiti has experienced political conflict and its first ever cholera epidemic; hundreds of thousands of the displaced are still living in makeshift tents strewn like dusty flags by the sides of highways. It is easy to forget that, for most of the 19th century, Haiti was a site of agricultural innovation, productivity and economic success.'b'In the wake of the earthquake, many have talked about the need to lay foundations for a better future. To do that, Haiti should look to the past, and the system of small farms and the decentralized economy that once provided Haitians with dignity, autonomy and wealth.'b'The slave revolution that ended with Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s creation in 1804 led to what the sociologist Jean Casimir dubbed a \xe2\x80\x9ccounter-plantation\xe2\x80\x9d system. As slaves, the islanders had harvested and processed sugar cane, but fed themselves by cultivating their own tiny gardens, for which they developed sophisticated techniques of inter-cropping \xe2\x80\x94 a kind of sustainable agriculture that involved planting a variety of crops close together. Once free, Haitians drew on that knowledge to raise livestock and grow fruits, root vegetables and even coffee for export to the global market. In establishing their own small farms, they forestalled any possibility of a return to the large plantations that had defined the days of slavery.'b'This system of agricultural self-reliance provided a better quality of life than that of African descendants anywhere else in the Americas. The country attracted many immigrants, including thousands of African-Americans. And though the United States government didn\xe2\x80\x99t officially recognize Haiti until 1862, American businessmen eagerly traded with the island nation.'b'Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s economy was decentralized, organized around 11 largely autonomous regions, each with its own port. There was plenty of conflict in the country, largely over control of the central government, and heavy taxes on exports, as well as the power of foreign merchants, sapped the profits of farmers. Yet the regional economies thrived, and a decentralized political and military system assured many Haitians a great deal of control over their destiny.'b'In the 20th century, however, this system came under increasing pressure. Outsiders, along with many in the Haitian elite, saw small farms as a barrier to progress. When the United States occupied Haiti, from 1915 to 1934, it worked to centralize the economy in Port-au-Prince. It pushed through a re-writing of the Haitian Constitution to allow foreigners to own land, which the country\xe2\x80\x99s founders had banned for fear of re-enslavement, and worked to replace small farms with large plantations owned by foreign corporations. Many farmers saw their land expropriated.'b'In the teens, when the countryside erupted in a revolt against the occupation and the use of forced labor to build roads, the United States created a newly centralized gendarmerie to suppress the insurrection. Violence and economic decline in the countryside forced many Haitians to flee to the cities or to plantations in neighboring Cuba and the Dominican Republic. In the years since, the countryside has continued to experience environmental and economic degradation as well as exodus, while the big cities, especially Port-au-Prince, have become overcrowded. Today, about half of Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s food is imported.'b'The flow of ideas and money to Haiti that followed the earthquake provides an opportunity to restore the system of small farms that was a pillar of Haitian society after independence. Michel Martelly, Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s new president, has talked of the need to decentralize the economy, and nongovernmental organizations have begun projects to help farmers. But far more can be done.'b'Municipal governments should construct properly equipped marketplaces for the women who sell rural produce. The Haitian state should develop trade policies aimed at protecting the agricultural sector, and take the lead in fixing roads and ports, confronting deforestation and improving systems of water management. Foreign organizations working in the country can help simply by making it a policy to buy food and other goods from local producers.'b'The return on the investment in the rural economy would be self-reliance, the alleviation of dangerous overcrowding in cities and, most important, a path toward ending Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s now chronic problems of malnutrition and food insecurity. As Haitians look to rebuild in 2012, the best blueprints will come from their own proud and vibrant history.'b'Beijing'b'NOT long ago, I was stuck in a dead-end job near Greenwich, Conn.

That is more than can be said for the handling of many corporations in the United States that have 'b'harmed their consumers'b' and remain unpunished.'b'We live in grim times, but fortune favors the bold. So if you are reading this from some occupied encampment, a soul-crushing cubicle, your parents\xe2\x80\x99 basement or anywhere else in America really, maybe you should consider paying me a visit.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ll buy you a duck.'b'The Interim Haiti Recovery Commission was one of Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s great hopes after the earthquake, a Haitian-led international partnership that would finally summon the money, will and organizational intelligence to build the country back better than before. But if you visit the commission\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Web site'b' today, on the eve of the second anniversary of the Jan. 12 disaster, this is what you see:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPlease kindly note that the mandate of the I.H.R.C. expired on October 21, 2011. Pending a decision of the Haitian Parliament regarding the future of the institution, a team is currently dealing with day-to-day business. The (re)submission of project proposals remains closed until further notice.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'President Michel Martelly has so far failed to get Parliament\xe2\x80\x99s approval to extend the mandate.'b'Led by former President Bill Clinton and Jean-Max Bellerive, Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s former prime minister, the commission was given an 18-month mission to oversee an ambitious array of rebuilding projects. It took too long to get organized and former President Ren\xc3\xa9 Pr\xc3\xa9val was more of a hindrance than a partner. A list of approved projects fills 256 pages, though few are finished or fully financed.'b'Still, Haitians have seen real progress in the last two years. About half of the 10 million cubic feet of quake debris has been removed from Port-au-Prince and other areas. More people have access to clean water in the capital than before the quake. With investment from a Korean garment maker, an industrial park is being built in the northeast, with the promise of 20,000 jobs.'b'The commission still has a critical role to play, organizing projects, bolstering accountability and transparency, and working to give international donors the confidence to follow through on their pledges. Only about half of the $4.6 billion promised for 2010 and 2011 has been received and spent.'b'A United Nations analysis showed that while many nations have been generous, particularly the United States, Brazil, Canada, Spain and France, almost all the money has gone to nongovernmental organizations and private contractors. To build Haitian capacity, that will have to change, and the commission can help \xe2\x80\x94 by giving guidance to Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s ministries and monitoring their efforts.'b'President Martelly is a more engaged leader than his predecessor. In the fall, he announced a plan to house 30,000 residents of six tent cities with rental subsidies and new construction. More than a half-million Haitians remain in camps and it is not clear if he will take on powerful landowners to free up the land needed for rebuilding. He needs to abandon his focus on building an army. What Haiti needs is a professional, accountable police force.'b'Other governments and institutions are pressing on. Last month the World Bank approved a $255 million plan to build houses, train teachers and feed schoolchildren. The grant includes $50 million in agricultural projects. A nongovernmental organization, Partners in Health, plans to open a teaching hospital in the countryside. The Inter-American Development Bank has gathered about $150 million in a five-year, $500 million plan that will build and repair hundreds of schools and train thousands of teachers to bring free public education to all Haitian schoolchildren.'b'The Haitian government badly needs a national strategy for creating permanent housing and jobs, to resettle people out of Port-au-Prince. The coming year should be one in which Haitians begin to take control of their rebuilding, with continued outside help.'b'Chantell and Michael Sackett\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'case'b' against the Environmental Protection Agency before the Supreme Court on Monday might appear to be David versus Goliath. But those supporting the Sacketts with friend-of-the-court briefs are 'b'corporate Goliaths'b' like General Electric and real estate developers eager to weaken the E.P.A.\xe2\x80\x99s ability to protect wetlands and waterways under the federal Clean Water Act.'b'The Sacketts owned a small lot about 500 feet from Idaho\xe2\x80\x99s pristine 'b'Priest Lake'b'. They filled part of it with dirt and rock in preparing to build a house. The E.P.A. determined that the lot is federally protected wetland so the Sacketts needed a permit to do the work, which they did not seek. The agency ordered the couple to remove the fill because pollutants were being discharged.'b'The E.P.A. can issue compliance orders directing violators to get a permit and remedy any damage they caused. But to enforce an order, the agency has to sue in federal court; it does not have power to take action against a violator on its own. The Sacketts in their 'b'brief'b' say they had no reason to believe their lot was covered by the Clean Water Act, though there is 'b'evidence'b' to the contrary. They argue that lack of judicial review of the compliance order violated their due process rights, though they could have challenged the order through the agency\xe2\x80\x99s administrative process \xe2\x80\x94 and could have gotten 'b'a permit'b' after the E.P.A. told them they needed one.'b'Almost every federal court that has considered the issue found that the law does not allow \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial review of compliance orders until the E.P.A. brings an enforcement action,\xe2\x80\x9d as the Ninth Circuit appeals court said in ruling against the Sacketts. The court 'b'explained'b' that this process allows the agency \xe2\x80\x9cto act to address environmental problems quickly and without becoming immediately entangled in litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d Allowing challenges to E.P.A. orders before they are enforced would give landowners the ability to delay in correcting the harm they caused. Compliance orders are useful because they allow the agency to press landowners to negotiate about mitigating harms.'b'This case goes far beyond the Sacketts\xe2\x80\x99 right to fill in their lot without a permit. If the Supreme Court allows them to seek pre-enforcement review, it will be handing a big victory to corporations and developers who want to evade the requirements of the Clean Water Act.'b'In Iowa, the Republican presidential contenders tried to outdo one another in attacking reproductive rights as they sought the support of caucusgoers from the religious right. In New Hampshire, where voters are less socially conservative, the candidates have focused more on economic issues.'b'But the message from Iowa was crystal clear: Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, Ron Paul, Jon Huntsman Jr., Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry all stand ready to restrict a woman\xe2\x80\x99s right to make her own childbearing decisions and deny essential health care to millions of women.'b'The Republican field is united in its determination to overturn Roe v. Wade; to appoint Supreme Court justices supportive of that goal; and to end government payments to Planned Parenthood for family planning services, cancer screening and other vital health services provided to low-income women. The candidates also want to reinstate the global gag rule that barred family planning groups abroad receiving federal money from even talking about abortion.'b'There are a few differences among the candidates. Only Mr. Gingrich has called for punishing judges who make abortion rulings not to his liking. Mr. Romney and Mr. Huntsman refused to sign the 'b'Susan B. Anthony'b' pledge to appoint antiabortion cabinet members, among other things. Mr. Huntsman opposed the \xe2\x80\x9cpersonhood\xe2\x80\x9d initiative in Mississippi that would have given human fertilized eggs the legal rights and protections that apply to people, and outlawed abortion as well as some of the most widely used forms of contraception and in vitro fertilization. Mississippi voters resoundingly rejected the measure in November as going too far.'b'Mr. Romney denied supporting the measure once it was defeated. But before the vote, in an interview with Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor and a Fox News personality, he created a different impression. When asked whether as Massachusetts governor he would have supported a constitutional amendment establishing that life begins at conception, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This fall, the Republican nominee probably will not be trumpeting this extreme agenda in trying to appeal to moderate women voters, a key constituency in the general election. But voters should not be fooled. The assault on women\xe2\x80\x99s reproductive health is a central part of the Republican agenda. It is not too early for Democrats to point that out.'b'This year, more than 2.7 million of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s commuters will have to pay an additional $550 in taxes, thanks to Congress. For those driving, however, not to worry. Commuting tax benefits only get better for them, while the deal for those who take trains or buses will get worse.'b'That is not only unfair, but it will also encourage people to commute by car (think of that one worker in the S.U.V.) and discourage riders from taking public transit. The result will almost certainly be more traffic nightmares and more carbon emissions. And these problems can only grow worse if Congress fails to fix this particular bit of the tax code, quickly and permanently.'b'For the last two years, employees enjoyed a pretax commuter benefit of up to $230 a month to cover their spending on parking or public transit. That equal treatment ended on Dec. 31, and the tax benefit is now $240 a month for parking but only $125 a month for public transit.'b'Businesses have also enjoyed a tax break from this commuter benefit. In 2010, participating transit riders across the country saved their bosses about $300 million in payroll taxes. Now, these companies, including about 15,000 in New York State, will have to pay more in taxes.'b'Senator Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Representative Jim McGovern, a Democrat from Massachusetts, are now making a strong pitch to keep equal benefits for all participating commuters. Anything less from Congress sends the wrong message \xe2\x80\x94 that transit riders deserve to pay more taxes than drivers.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Where the Real Jobs Are'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 2):'b'TransCanada has been constructing and operating natural gas and oil pipelines for more than 60 years.

On one sideline, her friends tell me that after a few years of hyperactive globetrotting what she really needs is to put her feet up and dictate another volume of her memoirs while nagging Chelsea to deliver grandchildren. (\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s tired; she needs some time off,\xe2\x80\x9d her husband 'b'told ABC'b'.) At the other extreme, a couple of Democratic consultants, Patrick Caddell and Douglas Schoen, propose to draft her right now as the 2012 Democratic presidential candidate, whether she likes it or not. (\xe2\x80\x9cNot only is Mrs. Clinton better positioned to win in 2012 than Mr. Obama, but she is better positioned to govern if she does,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'they wrote 'b'in The Wall Street Journal.) Other helpful devotees have noticed that Brown University is looking for a new president, or have imagined her creating a clone of the Clinton Global Initiative focused on empowering women. Or maybe Ruth Bader Ginsburg will decide to put 'b'her'b' feet up, opening a seat on the Supreme Court.'b'The right choice is none of the above.'b'Hillary Clinton is 64 years old, with a Calvinist work ethic, the stamina of an Olympian, an E.Q. to match her I.Q., and the political instincts of a Clinton. She has an impressive empathic ability \xe2\x80\x94 invaluable in politics or statecraft \xe2\x80\x94 to imagine how the world looks to an ally or adversary. She listens, and she learns from her mistakes. She was a perfectly plausible president four years ago, and that was before she demonstrated her gifts as a diplomatic snake-charmer. (Never mind Pakistan and Libya, I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the Obama White House.) She is, 'b'says Gallup'b', the most admired woman in America for the 10th year in a row, laps ahead of, in order, Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, Sarah Palin and Condoleezza Rice; her approval rating of 'b'64 percent'b' is the highest of any political figure in the country.'b'So it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to hang up the big ambition. And a lot of us would be deeply disappointed in her if she did. This would be none of our business if she had taken the off-ramp after her time as first lady. (Nobody is thinking very hard about what\xe2\x80\x99s next for Laura Bush.) But she moved on to the Senate, to a near-miss presidential campaign, and to a credible term as secretary of state. She raised our expectations.'b'The proposal to draft her in place of President Obama this year is preposterous. It exaggerates his vulnerability and discounts Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty. But the idea that she should replace Joe Biden as Obama\xe2\x80\x99s running mate in 2012 is something else. It has been kicking around on the blogs for 'b'more than a year'b' without getting any traction, mainly because it has been authoritatively, emphatically dismissed by 'b'Hillary'b', 'b'Biden'b' and 'b'Team Obama'b'.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s time to take it seriously.'b'I know the arguments against this scenario, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get to those. But the arguments in favor are as simple as one-two-three. One: it does more to guarantee Obama\xe2\x80\x99s re-election than anything else the Democrats can do. Two: it improves the chances that, come next January, he will not be a lame duck with a gridlocked Congress but a rejuvenated president with a mandate and a Congress that may be a little less forbidding. Three: it makes Hillary the party\xe2\x80\x99s heir apparent in 2016. If she sits out politics for the next four years, other Democrats (yes, Governor Cuomo, we see your hand up) will fill the void.'b'She would bring to this year\xe2\x80\x99s campaign a missing warmth and some of the voltage that has dissipated as Obama moved from campaigning to governing. What excites is not just the prospect of having a woman a heartbeat \xe2\x80\x94 and four years \xe2\x80\x94 away from the presidency, although she certainly embodies the aspirations of many women. It\xe2\x80\x99s the possibility that the first woman at the top would have qualifications so manifest that her first-ness was a secondary consideration.'b'The biggest obstacle to this scenario is, of course, President Obama, reinforced by the people around him. The Obamas have long regarded the Clintons as representing the tawdry side of politics: the deal-cutting, the calculating, the endless schmoozing, the permanent campaign \xe2\x80\x94 in short, the things that this professorial president could have used more of in his first term. The Clintons \xe2\x80\x94 Bill, at least \xe2\x80\x94 have tended to see Obama as politically na\xc3\xafve, steeped in youthful arrogance, a loner, happier to be right than successful. The mistrust may have abated a little, as Hillary has proved herself the most faithful of allies. And Bill has been a pretty disciplined defender of this administration, though his endorsements tend to come with a helping of paternalistic (and public) advice. But the Obamas and Clintons remain a marriage of convenience.'b'The Obama inner circle believes the president doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need Hillary to win a second term. Just now, when the Republican field looks like a bug-spattered windshield and the most likely nominee strikes many in his own party as an empty suit, that confidence is understandable. But Democrats should not get too cocky. Mitt Romney, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve argued before, 'b'has a case'b' to make to voters and the resources to make it. In Iowa, exploiting the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s laissez-faire ruling on campaign spending, he brought down Newt Gingrich with an \xe2\x80\x9cindependent\xe2\x80\x9d attack machine of considerable firepower.'b'Moreover, even if Obama can win without Hillary, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to be said for running up the score. If she can do in 2012 what Obama did in 2008 \xe2\x80\x94 animate that feeling of historic possibility \xe2\x80\x94 the pair can lift some House and Senate candidates along with them. One reason Republicans did so well in the 2010 Congressional elections is that they overcame the gender gap and carried women voters 51 to 49. Those voters will flock back to Hillary, the more so if the Republican ticket is locked into a culture-war agenda. So, by the way, will Hispanic voters, securing such endangered states as Florida, New Mexico, Nevada and Colorado.'b'Vice President Clinton would be a formidable asset in governing as well as campaigning, both as a political calculator and as an emissary to Capitol Hill. She has, to put it mildly, an ability to navigate the world of powerful, problematic men.'b'In the event that Obama has the good sense (or, if the economy fails to perk up, the sense of desperation) to offer her the vice president\xe2\x80\x99s slot, some of her closest friends will implore her to decline. They will tell her that it means tarnishing her reputation by playing the second\xe2\x80\x99s traditional role of campaign attack dog. But that needn\xe2\x80\x99t be the case. Like Romney, the Democrats can outsource to a super-PAC the wet work that used to be the job of the running mate, letting Hillary stick to the high road. And whatever her friends say, there\xe2\x80\x99s no way the dutiful Methodist schoolgirl would turn down an I-need-you from the president.'b'THAT leaves the delicate question of ditching Joe Biden. He is not a dazzling campaigner, and \xe2\x80\x94 five years Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s senior \xe2\x80\x94 he is not Obama\xe2\x80\x99s successor. But he is a loyal and accomplished public servant who deserves to be treated with honor.'b'A political scientist I know proposes the following choreography: In the late winter or early spring, Hillary steps down as secretary of state to rest and write that book. The president assigns Biden \xe2\x80\x94 the former chairman of Senate Foreign Relations \xe2\x80\x94 to add State to his portfolio, making him the most powerful vice president in history. Come the party convention in September, Obama swallows his considerable pride and invites a refreshed Hillary to join the ticket. Biden keeps State. The musicians play \xe2\x80\x9cHappy Days Are Here Again\xe2\x80\x9d as if they really mean it.'b'Of course, this is more exciting if it\xe2\x80\x99s a surprise, and now I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoiled it. Sorry. But not as sorry as I\xe2\x80\x99ll be if \xe2\x80\x94 as I fear \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s just a fantasy.'b''b''b'Navigating the sidewalks of New York City can be as challenging as any rushing sport, like football or rugby. \xc2\xa0But when your opponents are walking while text messaging, their field of view is impaired, and this can render a three-block walk to Starbucks somewhere between infuriating and life-threatening.'b'While there\xe2\x80\x99s little\xc2\xa0current data about the number of people injured while texting, more than 1,000 pedestrians visited emergency rooms in 2008 after they were injured while using a cellphone to talk or text.

What hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been as widely noted, however, is that Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s picture of himself as a believer in a level playing field is just as fictional. Where is the evidence that he or his party cares at all about equality of opportunity?'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk for a minute about the actual state of the playing field.'b'Americans are much more likely than citizens of other nations to believe that they live in a meritocracy. But this self-image is a fantasy: as a 'b'report'b' in The Times last week pointed out, America actually stands out as the advanced country in which it matters most who your parents were, the country in which those born on one of society\xe2\x80\x99s lower rungs have the least chance of climbing to the top or even to the middle.'b'And if you ask why America is more class-bound in practice than the rest of the Western world, a large part of the reason is that our government falls down on the job of creating equal opportunity.'b'The failure starts early: in America, the holes in the social safety net mean that both low-income mothers and their children are all too likely to suffer from poor nutrition and receive inadequate health care. It continues once children reach school age, where they encounter a system in which the affluent send their kids to good, well-financed public schools or, if they choose, to private schools, while less-advantaged children get a far worse education.'b'Once they reach college age, those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds are far less likely to go to college \xe2\x80\x94 and vastly less likely to go to a top-tier school \xe2\x80\x94 than those luckier in their parentage. At the most selective, \xe2\x80\x9cTier 1\xe2\x80\x9d schools, 74 percent of the entering class comes from the quarter of households that have the highest \xe2\x80\x9csocioeconomic status\xe2\x80\x9d; only 3 percent comes from the bottom quarter.'b'And if children from our society\xe2\x80\x99s lower rungs do manage to make it into a good college, the lack of financial support makes them far more likely to drop out than the children of the affluent, even if they have as much or more native ability. One long-term study by the Department of Education found that students with high test scores but low-income parents were less likely to complete college than students with low scores but affluent parents \xe2\x80\x94 loosely speaking, that smart poor kids are less likely than dumb rich kids to get a degree.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder, then, that Horatio Alger stories, tales of poor kids who make good, are much less common in reality than they are in legend \xe2\x80\x94 and much less common in America than they are in Canada or Europe. Which brings me back to those, like Mr. Romney, who claim to believe in equality of opportunity. Where is the evidence for that claim?'b'Think about it: someone who really wanted equal opportunity would be very concerned about the inequality of our current system. He would support more nutritional aid for low-income mothers-to-be and young children. He would try to improve the quality of public schools. He would support aid to low-income college students. And he would support what every other advanced country has, a universal health care system, so that nobody need worry about untreated illness or crushing medical bills.'b'If Mr. Romney has come out for any of these things, I\xe2\x80\x99ve missed it. And the Congressional wing of his party seems determined to make upward mobility even harder. For example, Republicans have tried to slash funds for the Women, Infants and Children program, which helps provide adequate nutrition to low-income mothers and their children; they have demanded cuts in Pell grants, which are designed to help lower-income students afford college.'b'And they have, of course, pledged to repeal a health reform that, for all its imperfections, would finally give Americans the guaranteed care that everyone else in the advanced world takes for granted.'b'So where is the evidence that Mr. Romney or his party actually believes in equal opportunity? Judging by their actions, they seem to prefer a society in which your station in life is largely determined by that of your parents \xe2\x80\x94 and in which the children of the very rich get to inherit their estates tax-free.

Many polls suggest that a majority of college professors and national journalists vote Democratic. The movie, TV, music and publishing industries are dominated by liberals.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not because recent events have disproved the liberal worldview. On the contrary, we\xe2\x80\x99re still recovering from a financial crisis caused, in large measure, by Wall Street excess. Corporate profits are zooming while worker salaries are flat.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not because liberalism\xe2\x80\x99s opponents are going from strength to strength. The Republican Party is unpopular and sometimes embarrassing.'b'Given the circumstances, this should be a golden age of liberalism. Yet the percentage of Americans who call themselves liberals is either flat or in decline. There are now two conservatives in this country for every liberal. Over the past 40 years, liberalism has been astonishingly incapable at expanding its market share.'b'The most important explanation is what you might call the Instrument Problem. Americans may agree with liberal diagnoses, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t trust the instrument the Democrats use to solve problems. They don\xe2\x80\x99t trust the federal government.'b'A few decades ago they did, but now they don\xe2\x80\x99t. Roughly 10 percent of Americans trust government to do the right thing most of the time, according to an October New York Times, CBS News poll.'b'Why don\xe2\x80\x99t Americans trust their government? It\xe2\x80\x99s not because they dislike individual programs like Medicare. It\xe2\x80\x99s more likely because they think the whole system is rigged. Or to put it in the economists\xe2\x80\x99 language, they believe the government has been captured by rent-seekers.'b'This is the disease that corrodes government at all times and in all places. As George F. Will 'b'wrote in a column'b' in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s Washington Post, as government grows, interest groups accumulate, seeking to capture its power and money.'b'Some of these rent-seeking groups are corporate types. Will notes that the federal government delivers sugar subsidies that benefit a few rich providers while imposing costs on millions of consumers.'b'Other rent-seeking groups are dispersed across the political spectrum. The tax code has been tweaked 4,428 times in the past 10 years, to the benefit of interests of left, right and center.'b'Others exercise their power transparently and democratically. As Will notes, in 2009, the net worth of households headed by senior citizens was 47 times the net worth of households led by people under 35. Yet seniors use their voting power to protect programs that redistribute even more money from the young to the old and affluent.'b'You would think that liberals would have a special incentive to root out rent-seeking. Yet this has not been a major priority. There is no Steve Jobs figure in American liberalism insisting that the designers keep government simple, elegant and user-friendly. Sailors scrub their ships. Farmers clear weeds. Democrats have not spent a lot of time scraping barnacles off the state.'b'Worse, in an attempt to match Republican rhetoric, Democratic politicians are perpetually soiling the name of government for the sake of short-term gain. How many times have you heard Democrats from Carter to Obama running against Washington, accusing it of being insular, shortsighted, corrupt and petty? If the surgeon himself thinks his tools are rancid, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you?'b'In the past few weeks, the Obama administration has begun his presidential campaign by picking a series of small fights with the Republican-led House over things like recess appointments. These vicious squabbles may help Obama in the short term by making him look better than Republicans in Congress. But they will only further discredit Washington over the long run.'b'Life is unfair. Republican venality unintentionally reinforces the conservative argument that government is corrupt. Democratic venality undermines the Democratic argument that Washington can be trusted to do good.'b'Liberalism has not expanded because it has not had a Martin Luther, a leader committed to stripping away the corruptions, complexities and indulgences that have grown up over the years.'b'If you\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive some outside advice, President Obama might consider running for re-election as Luther. It\xe2\x80\x99s not enough to pick a series of small squabbles and then win as the least ugly man in the room. He might run as someone who believes in government but sees how much it needs to be cleansed and purified.'b'Make the tax code simple. Make job training simple. Make Medicare simple. Every week choose a rent-seeker to hold up for ridicule and renunciation. Change the Congressional rules. Simplify the legal thickets that undermine responsibility.'b'If Democrats can\xe2\x80\x99t restore Americans\xe2\x80\x99 trust in government, it really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what problems they identify and what plans they propose. No one will believe in the instrument they rely on for solutions.'b'Today, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to say some nice things about BP and some not so nice things about the lawyers who are suing BP. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t spill your coffee.'b'As horrific as 'b'the Deepwater Horizon accident'b' was in April 2010 \xe2\x80\x94 killing 11 rig employees, while 'b'pouring millions of gallons of oil'b' into the Gulf of Mexico \xe2\x80\x94 BP has performed quite admirably in its aftermath. It has spared no expense in cleaning up the oil. 'b'It has set aside $1 billion'b' to restore the environment and coastal ecosystem. It underwrote an advertising campaign to lure tourists back to the Gulf Coast. Today, less than two years after the spill, the beaches are sparkling, most fishermen are working and many of the hotels are full.'b'At the urging of President Obama, BP also agreed to 'b'set up a $20 billion fund'b' to compensate anyone who could show that they\xe2\x80\x99d been economically harmed by the accident. Ken Feinberg, the former administrator of the Sept. 11 victim compensation fund, was put in charge of the 'b'Gulf Coast Claims Facility'b', as it was named. Feinberg has since paid out $6.3 billion to nearly 200,000 claimants. 'b'Daniel Becnel'b', a lawyer who has settled thousands of claims, says that his clients often receive more money from Feinberg than they would have if they had gone to court. \xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done a better job than Feinberg did,\xe2\x80\x9d says Becnel.'b'To put it another way, the Gulf Coast Claims Facility has been a remarkably effective alternative to the cumbersome way damages are usually meted out after a corporate accident: through the tort system. Compare it, for instance, with 'b'the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster'b' in Alaska, which took nearly two decades of court battles for the plaintiffs to finally get around $1.3 billion.'b'Indeed, the whole point of the Gulf Coast fund is to keep cases out of court; in return for compensation, the claimants have to agree not to sue for further damages. There is much that is right with this approach. Victims don\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait years \xe2\x80\x94 or decades \xe2\x80\x94 to get their money. The uncertainty of litigation is eliminated. The victims get monetary damages, just as they would if they won a court case, but without the expense of a lawsuit. They also pay less in legal fees. And if they don\xe2\x80\x99t like what is being offered, well, they can still sue. It is, as they say, a win-win.'b'Except, it turns out, for a certain group of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 lawyers who, despite the relative ease of using the claims facility, is insisting on pursuing litigation against BP. They say they have more than 100,000 cases, though none are for big money, like the injured workers\xe2\x80\x99 cases; Feinberg has even settled most of those. For months, these lawyers have been preparing for a \xe2\x80\x9c'b'liability trial'b',\xe2\x80\x9d currently set for late February.'b'However that trial turns out, it\xe2\x80\x99s largely pointless: BP has already conceded liability, which it has backed with $20 billion. The lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 motive can\xe2\x80\x99t be to get more money than that; it\xe2\x80\x99s far more than any court would ever award. Punitive damages can\xe2\x80\x99t be the reason either: federal law prevents most of the claimants from getting punitive damages. No, there is only one reason this litigation is taking place. The lawyers want the kind of big fees that only come with big lawsuits. Yet Feinberg\xe2\x80\x99s approach is proving so popular with claimants that many of their cases are evaporating.'b'So here\xe2\x80\x99s what they did. They went to the federal judge handling the BP litigation and asked him to establish a \xe2\x80\x9creserve\xe2\x80\x9d that would be made up of 6 percent of any future claims settled by Feinberg. (They also want 4 percent from any damages Alabama and Louisiana get.) The judge, Carl Barbier \xe2\x80\x94 a former plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 lawyer himself \xe2\x80\x94 agreed to do so without even holding a hearing. Eventually, some or all of that reserve would be used to pay the lawyers. That\xe2\x80\x99s right: They are trying to 'b'grab fees from clients'b' they\xe2\x80\x99ve never represented. Amazing. (Judge Barbier 'b'recently backed away a bit'b' from his ruling and is allowing both sides to file briefs that are due on Thursday.)'b'When I asked how they could possibly justify this fee grab, I was told that their lawsuit was the main reason Feinberg was willing to be so generous with BP\xe2\x80\x99s money. But 'b'Tony Buzbee'b', another lawyer who has settled many claims through the fund, blew a gasket when I told him that. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have not done one thing so far that has benefited my clients,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy clients have chosen not to be a part of their litigation. Why in the world should they have to pay them?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a good question. The Gulf Coast Claims Facility has the potential to serve as a model for handling future industrial accidents. It has proved that it can compensate victims quickly and fairly without the ordeal and cost of litigation. But, for that to happen, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just companies that have to put aside their greed. So do the lawyers.'b'IN 2010, the Chicago Public Schools 'b'declined to hire'b' Darrell Langdon for a job as a boiler-room engineer, because he had been convicted of possessing a half-gram of cocaine in 1985, a felony for which he received probation. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter that Mr. Langdon, a single parent of two sons, had been clean since 1988 and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t run into further trouble with the law. Only after The Chicago Tribune wrote about his case did the school system 'b'reverse its decision'b' and offer him the job.'b'A stunning number of young people are arrested for crimes in this country, and those crimes can haunt them for the rest of their lives. In 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s Crime Commission found that about half of American males could expect to be arrested for a nontraffic offense some time in their lives, mostly in their late teens and early 20s. An 'b'article'b' just published in the journal Pediatrics shows how the arrest rate has grown \xe2\x80\x94 by age 23, 'b'30 percent'b' of Americans have been arrested, compared with 22 percent in 1967. The increase reflects in part the considerable growth in arrests for 'b'drug offenses'b' and domestic violence.'b'The impact of these arrests is felt for years. The ubiquity of criminal-background checks and the efficiency of information technology in maintaining those records and making them widely available, have meant that millions of Americans \xe2\x80\x94 even those who served probation or parole but were never incarcerated \xe2\x80\x94 continue to pay a price long after the crime. In November the American Bar Association 'b'released a database'b' identifying more than 38,000 punitive 'b'provisions'b' that apply to people convicted of crimes, pertaining to everything from public housing to welfare assistance to occupational licenses. More than two-thirds of the states allow hiring and professional-licensing decisions to be made on the basis of an arrest alone.'b'Employers understandably want to protect their employees and customers from risk. Yet at the same time, there is a growing public interest in facilitating job opportunities for those who have stayed crime-free for a reasonable period of time. The weak economy and a rethinking of the logic of mass incarceration \xe2\x80\x94 driven in large part by budget pressures \xe2\x80\x94 have also brought attention to the situations of ex-offenders like Mr. Langdon, who face the collateral consequences of conviction long after their involvement with the criminal justice system has ended. Federal authorities are beginning to pay attention. Last April, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. urged state attorneys general to review laws and policies \xe2\x80\x9cto determine whether those that impose burdens on individuals convicted of crimes without increasing public safety should be eliminated.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It is well established that the risk of recidivism drops steadily with time, but there is still the question of how long is long enough. By looking at data for more than 88,000 people who had their first arrest in New York State in 1980, and tracking their subsequent criminal histories over the next 25 years, we estimate the \xe2\x80\x9credemption time\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the time it takes for an individual\xe2\x80\x99s likelihood of being arrested to be close to that of individuals with no criminal records \xe2\x80\x94 to be about 10 to 13 years. We also found that about 30 percent of the first-time offenders in 1980 were never arrested again, in New York or anywhere else.'b'Employers could apply their own judgments around those estimates, but the real problem is the state and local rules \xe2\x80\x94 often embedded in statutes \xe2\x80\x94 that restrict employment or licensing for the rest of the individual\xe2\x80\x99s life. In New York, former offenders can be forever denied licenses for certain jobs, ranging from beer distributor to real estate broker. Such \xe2\x80\x9cforever rules\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 which fall heavily on minorities, who are particularly likely to be arrested \xe2\x80\x94 are inherently unfair.'b'We propose that the \xe2\x80\x9cforever rules\xe2\x80\x9d be replaced by rules that provide for the expiration of a criminal record. We believe it is unreasonable for someone to be hounded by a single arrest or conviction that happened more than 20 years earlier \xe2\x80\x94 and for many kinds of crimes, the records should be sealed even sooner. The state, as well as private employers, should face a heavy burden to demonstrate the need for any rule that imposes consequences on someone who has remained crime-free decades after a single offense. Yes, there are legitimate exceptions for high-security positions in law enforcement and national security \xe2\x80\x94 and there can be exemptions in particular cases; banks cannot afford to hire someone convicted of financial fraud.'b'A number of states have placed limits on the availability of stale criminal records. Under a law that will take effect in May, Massachusetts will limit employers\xe2\x80\x99 access to information about convictions to 5 years for misdemeanors and 10 years for felonies. And the new law will protect employers from due-diligence liability suits if someone they hire in accord with these restrictions commits a further offense.'b'Policies that encourage employers to hire people who made a mistake in the past but have since rebuilt their lives would not only help those people, but also our economy and our society. With unemployment so high, we need to make it easier, not harder, for people to find jobs. And by embracing the principle that having paid the price for crime, there should be a limit on the time they are made to suffer, we would be giving true meaning to the ideals of rehabilitation and redemption.'b'The more Mitt Romney pretends to empathize with the millions of Americans who are struggling in this economy, the less he seems to understand their despair. And the rest of the Republican field seems to have no more insight into the concerns of most voters than he does.'b'Mr. Romney claims his background as a businessman provides him with an understanding of the economy and the ability to fix it. His opponents \xe2\x80\x94 particularly Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Ron Paul and Rick Perry \xe2\x80\x94 say their political experience provides the same advantage. In truth, none have offered anything but tired or extremist economic prescriptions, providing little evidence that they can relate to those at the middle or bottom of the ladder.'b'The problem with Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s pitch is the kind of businessman he was: specifically, a buyer of flailing companies who squeezed out the inefficiencies (often known as employees) and then sold or merged them for a hefty profit. More than a fifth of them later went bankrupt, 'b'The Wall Street Journal reported'b' on Monday. This kind of leveraged capitalism, which first caught fire in the 1980s, is one of the reasons for the growth in the income gap, tipping the wealth in the economy toward the people at the top.'b'Mr. Romney doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like to talk about the precise nature of his business experience. Instead, he prefers to claim his occupation as a leveraged buyout king actually benefited ordinary workers, even casting himself as one of them. \xe2\x80\x9cI know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to worry whether you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get fired,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'Mr. Romney said'b', astonishingly, on Sunday. \xe2\x80\x9cThere were a couple of times I wondered whether I was going to get a pink slip.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Romney, the son of privilege and power, has never known personal economic fear, and 'b'said later'b' that he was referring to his early days at Bain Capital, the investment firm he would later run.'b'He has, however, been responsible for issuing many a pink slip while leading Bain. The firm bought Dade International, a medical supplier, and collected eight times its investment but laid off 1,700 workers, 'b'The New York Times has reported'b'. 'b'Reuters reported'b' last week that a steel mill in Kansas City, Mo., was shuttered less than a decade after Bain bought it, and its 750 laid-off workers got no severance pay.'b'Mr. Romney dismisses these layoffs, and thousands more, as the cost of capitalism. He claims that, over all, Bain\xe2\x80\x99s investments produced a net gain of 100,000 jobs. But his campaign and his former firm have refused to provide any documentation for that number, showing exactly how many people were laid off and how many hired as a result of Bain\xe2\x80\x99s investments during his period there. The claim cannot be taken seriously until he does so.'b'Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Perry have sharply criticized Mr. Romney for his buyout work, but some of those attacks ring hollow. Mr. Gingrich himself was on an advisory board for Forstmann Little, another private equity firm with a business model similar to Bain\xe2\x80\x99s. Mr. Perry simply seems opportunistic. He 'b'criticized Mr. Romney'b' for ruthlessly practicing modern-day capitalism a day after he called Mr. Obama \xe2\x80\x9ca socialist.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Santorum have avoided talking about their own financial histories, having become multimillionaires by peddling their influence to big corporations after leaving Congressional office. For voters worried about the economy, neither a past record of buyouts nor lobbying should inspire any confidence.'b'The 'b'Arab League'b' is failing the Syrian people. President Bashar al-Assad of Syria grudgingly agreed to the league\xe2\x80\x99s peace plan last month, but his brutal 10-month crackdown against mostly peaceful protesters shows no signs of easing. To have any chance of stopping the bloodshed, the league \xe2\x80\x94 backed by the international community \xe2\x80\x94 needs to get tougher with the butcher in Damascus.'b'We always suspected that the manipulative Mr. Assad would pay only lip service to the plan. He promised to end the violence, withdraw troops from residential areas and talk to the opposition. He also agreed to allow the league to monitor progress. But Syrian activists say that in the two weeks since 100 or so monitors arrived, at least 400 more civilians have been killed, in addition to the 5,000 dead already counted by the United Nations.'b'Independent accounts are hard to come by because Syria also reneged on its promise to allow greater news media access. Still, the reports are credible enough to unnerve many Arabs; last week, the Arab Parliament, which advises the league, questioned whether the monitoring mission should be abandoned since Mr. Assad seemed clearly to be using it as cover for further repression.'b'Yet the Arab League\xe2\x80\x99s official response has been pathetically weak. Meeting in Cairo on Sunday, Prime Minister Sheik Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani of Qatar, the chairman of the league\xe2\x80\x99s committee on Syria, and other officials did little more than 'b'plead with Mr. Assad to end the bloodshed'b' and let the monitors operate freely.'b'This won\xe2\x80\x99t work. The only meaningful course is for the Arab League to enforce the 'b'economic sanctions it approved in November'b'. These include a freeze on Syrian government assets in Arab countries and a ban on transactions with Syria\xe2\x80\x99s central bank.'b'In addition, Arab League members should insist that the United Nations Security Council \xe2\x80\x94 stymied for months by Mr. Assad\xe2\x80\x99s enablers, Russia and China \xe2\x80\x94 condemn his behavior and impose tough sanctions of its own that would also bring pressure to bear on his allies. And they should lean on Turkey, which promised sanctions against Damascus, to follow through.'b'League officials have agreed to continue the monitoring mission (at least until they reassess later this month) and boost its size. There is also talk of United Nations-led training for monitors, who are very inexperienced.'b'In theory, these are good ideas. But they assume that Mr. Assad is not playing for time and playing the Arab League for a fool as he clearly is. People across the Arab world are horrified by the bloody events in Syria and fears of broader war. Their leaders and the major powers must do all they can to peacefully stop the violence.'b'Senator Robert Menendez\xe2\x80\x99s decision to 'b'hold up President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s nomination'b' of Patty Shwartz, a well-regarded federal magistrate judge, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, has the unsavory flavor of political revenge.'b'Judge Shwartz served for 14 years as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey, including two stints as chief of the criminal division in the United States attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office, before becoming a magistrate in 2003. The American Bar Association, which examined her credentials, rated her \xe2\x80\x9cunanimously well qualified,\xe2\x80\x9d the highest possible grade. She has been hailed as a stellar choice for the appellate court by the state\xe2\x80\x99s other Democratic senator, Frank Lautenberg, and by its legal and judicial communities.'b'The only naysayer is Mr. Menendez, and, at the moment, his is the only vote that matters. Observing archaic Senate protocol, Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Judiciary Committee chairman, will not schedule a hearing on a judicial nominee until home-state senators return a blue-colored form with their recommendation. Judge Shwartz was nominated in October, but Mr. Menendez has not returned his \xe2\x80\x9cblue slip\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the only time a Democrat has tried to block one of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s judicial choices.'b'In legal circles, Mr. Menendez\xe2\x80\x99s action has sparked speculation that he is blocking Judge Shwartz to get back at her companion of two decades, James Nobile. Mr. Nobile was in charge of the public corruption unit in New Jersey under Chris Christie, the current governor who was the United States attorney for New Jersey at the time, when his office issued a subpoena against Mr. Menendez in connection with a corruption investigation at the close of his 2006 election battle.'b'Mr. Menendez claims that his opposition to Judge Shwartz was based on \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive\xe2\x80\x9d concerns about her knowledge of constitutional law. His action sends a chilling message to prosecutors pursuing possible corruption by powerful politicians: Beware of future payback against friends or relatives. Mr. Menendez owes Judge Shwartz\xe2\x80\x99s nomination a serious second look.'b'Gov. Christine Gregoire of Washington 'b'showed her admirable political evolution'b' last week when 'b'she urged her state to legalize same-sex marriage'b'. Eight years ago, she was wary, saying the state was not \xe2\x80\x9cready to support\xe2\x80\x9d such historic change. Four years ago, she said she would \xe2\x80\x9cleave it to the churches to make that call.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Last Wednesday, 'b'Governor Gregoire'b' 'b'described how she had turned around'b': \xe2\x80\x9cI came to realize the religions can decide what they want to do, but it is not O.K. for the state to discriminate.\xe2\x80\x9d She put her fist over her heart, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s right here that frees me up to do this.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Opponents of same-sex marriage pointed out that the governor is not running for re-election and could make what they consider a risk-free proposal. Aside from the marriage issue, Ms. Gregoire has built a strong record for gay and lesbian rights in her two terms, signing a ban on discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment and housing and an extensive domestic partnership law in 2009. A referendum to repeal the domestic partnership law was quickly put on the ballot by the opposition. Voters rejected the repeal 53 to 47 percent.'b'Opponents vow another referendum if the Democratic-led Legislature passes a marriage-equality law. The governor has promised to fight to have the state join six others and the District of Columbia where same-sex marriage is a legal right. There is reason to hope that the public\xe2\x80\x99s views have evolved along with the governor\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cSome say domestic partnerships are the same as marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a version of the discriminatory \xe2\x80\x98separate but equal\xe2\x80\x99 argument.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A charge of \xe2\x80\x9cpious baloney\xe2\x80\x9d from the king of sanctimonious salami: that was the taste of Debate Weekend, during which Newt Gingrich of all people called out Mitt Romney for larded self-aggrandizement. Takes one lunchmeat to know another.'b'Gingrich was responding to Romney\xe2\x80\x99s continued claims of having elected to spend minimal time in politics. Romney spent minimal time in politics because he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t elected: not to the United States Senate in 1994, when he challenged Ted Kennedy, and not to the presidency in 2008, when he lost the Republican nomination to John McCain.'b'In the second of the weekend\xe2\x80\x99s two debates, he actually claimed that he had counted on a Kennedy victory but wanted to give the liberal lion a good scare.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was happy that he had to take a mortgage out on his house to ultimately defeat me,\xe2\x80\x9d boasted Romney, minting a new definition of success. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t whether you win or lose. It\xe2\x80\x99s whether you eat into your opponent\xe2\x80\x99s real-estate portfolio.'b'Gingrich had his own moments of odd grandstanding. One came in the weekend\xe2\x80\x99s first debate, when he explained his opposition to same-sex weddings. The \xe2\x80\x9csacrament of marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be cheapened. He himself has paid that sacrament greater tribute than any of his current rivals, availing himself of it three times. Inexplicably, he left that part out.'b'The Republicans faced off twice in 12 hours, the political equivalent of a \xe2\x80\x9cLaw &amp; Order\xe2\x80\x9d marathon, minus the climactic justice. No one was carted off to the big house, only because hypocrisy isn\xe2\x80\x99t criminal. Like the previous 1,286 debates, the latest two brought some clarity to the race for the party\xe2\x80\x99s presidential nomination, and had moments of wild diversion to boot.'b'But they also provided a sadly vivid illustration of why Americans are so cynical about their politics and politicians, whose most striking quality may be the velocity with which they run away from who they really are and what they\xe2\x80\x99ve really said and done.'b'Santorum, perhaps belatedly 'b'worried'b' that his contempt for gay men and lesbians might not play as well in New Hampshire as in Iowa, professed on Sunday that he would love a homosexual son no less than a heterosexual one.'b'I have to assume he means a pitying, pray-for-your-tortured-soul kind of love, which in any case wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t compensate for all he\xe2\x80\x99s done to make sure that such a son \xe2\x80\x94 or anyone else growing up gay \xe2\x80\x94 is indeed tortured. Over time Santorum has'b' brought up 'b'bestiality, incest and polygamy as reference points in discussing homosexuality; voiced support for sodomy statutes that criminalize homosexual intimacy; and 'b'said'b' that a child would be better served by a father in prison than by, say, two mothers without so much as a parking ticket.'b'His record doesn\xe2\x80\x99t square in the least with his pledge on Sunday to make sure \xe2\x80\x9cevery person in America, gay or straight, is treated with respect and dignity.\xe2\x80\x9d But nothing melts a presidential aspirant\xe2\x80\x99s frigid heart like the need to broaden his base.'b'Romney used the most recent debates to rail anew against \xe2\x80\x9cObamacare,\xe2\x80\x9d which he audaciously goes out of his way to bring up. His response to similarities between it and the health care reform he championed in Massachusetts is to ratchet up his outrage, apparently on the theory that emotion fogs fact. No one intones \xe2\x80\x9cObamacare\xe2\x80\x9d as venomously as he.'b'He just won\xe2\x80\x99t own up \xe2\x80\x94 not to his long-held political ambitions, though they make him no different from most rivals, and not even to his wealth, which also isn\xe2\x80\x99t unheard of in politics.'b'After Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s debate, he told New Hampshire voters that he, too, had known the dread of a pink slip. On Monday, he'b' talked 'b'of having begun his consulting career \xe2\x80\x9cat the entry level.\xe2\x80\x9d If this Everyman act is some strategic pushback against fresh 'b'scrutiny'b' of his enrichment at Bain Capital, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t working. It only makes him look phony.'b'Most troubling was his attack on Jon Huntsman for working in the Obama administration as opposed to agitating for its overthrow. Huntsman signed on at the start, before Obama had shown what kind of leader he would be, and that\xe2\x80\x99s an inherently awful decision only if a president or anyone else from an opposing party is supposed to be denied cooperation automatically and deprived all benefit of the doubt.'b'Besides which, can\xe2\x80\x99t a person exert more influence on the inside than out? And must he agree with a country\xe2\x80\x99s leader on all matters to take on a specific assignment? Huntsman correctly pointed out that by that reasoning, his two sons in the United States Navy should hasten ashore. President Obama, after all, is their commander in chief.'b'Romney got along fine with the Democrats who dominated the Massachusetts Legislature when he was governor. Deservedly, he brags about that. Then he turns partisan hellcat, hissing at any appeasement. I find that hard to digest.

But the Supreme Court upheld 'b'a narrow exception'b' to this free speech tenet in 1978, letting the 'b'Federal Communications Commission'b' ban \xe2\x80\x9cindecent but not obscene\xe2\x80\x9d material from radio and television because it said broadcast media were pervasive and accessible to children.'b'In 'b'F.C.C. v. Fox'b' Television Stations, which 'b'the court heard on Tuesday'b', the justices should overturn the 1978 ruling and apply the same First Amendment principles to all media. If the court refuses to go that far, it should at least uphold the 'b'decision'b' by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that the F.C.C.\xe2\x80\x99s indecency policy is \xe2\x80\x9cunconstitutional because it is impermissibly vague\xe2\x80\x9d and must be revised to give reliable notice about what can be broadcast.'b'A revolution in communications has taken away the grounds for treating radio and television differently. As Justice Samuel Alito Jr. 'b'said'b' in court on Tuesday, \xe2\x80\x9cBroadcast TV is living on borrowed time,\xe2\x80\x9d with cable and wireless communications being so widespread. Technology, like the V-chip in TVs and digital converter boxes, allows parents to block programs inappropriate for children.'b'The F.C.C.\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'policy'b' prohibits indecent material and profane speech between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Violations may result in substantial monetary fines, loss of a broadcast license and other sanctions.'b'The agency has applied this policy so inconsistently that, as a 'b'brief'b' for ABC Inc. and others argued, \xe2\x80\x9cbroadcasters have no way to know what material the commission will deem indecent.\xe2\x80\x9d The F.C.C.\xe2\x80\x99s recent decisions, the brief said, are \xe2\x80\x9ca wilderness of confusion,\xe2\x80\x9d and fail to give fair notice of what is banned, as the law requires.'b'Since the \xe2\x80\x9978 ruling, the F.C.C. has 'b'dramatically expanded'b' its conception of indecency, even though the court said it had not decided that \xe2\x80\x9can occasional expletive\xe2\x80\x9d could be restricted. In 2004, the agency began enforcing its policy against even a single vulgarity uttered during a broadcast.'b'Justice Antonin Scalia said on Tuesday that \xe2\x80\x9cthe government is entitled to insist upon a certain modicum of decency.\xe2\x80\x9d But the revolution in communications has wiped out the basis for any special indecency restrictions by the F.C.C. The court should end the anomalous treatment of radio and television. If it does not overturn the 1978 decision, it must require the F.C.C. to rewrite the vague and subjective restrictions that chill protected speech.'b'Last week, the 'b'Food and Drug Administration took a small step'b' toward reducing the routine use of antibiotics in livestock, a practice that creates drug-resistant pathogens and threatens the effectiveness of some antibiotics in human medicine. 'b'It restricted the use'b' of a class of antibiotics called cephalosporins. Because they require a prescription, farm veterinarians use them less than other antibiotics, like penicillin.'b'While the move is important, it is far from sufficient. In 2008, the F.D.A. proposed to tightly limit the use of cephalosporins, but this new rule falls well short of that, thanks to intense lobbying by farm and pharmaceutical industries. The new rule will ban the injection of the antibiotics into chicken eggs and halt the practice of giving large, sustained doses to cattle and pigs. But it still allows widespread use in animals like rabbits and ducks, and veterinarians will still be able to use the drugs in ways not specifically approved by the F.D.A.'b'The agency needs to deal squarely and swiftly with the threat posed by agricultural antibiotics. The sea of drugs on farms creates a perfect environment for the evolution of pathogens resistant to antibiotics, which have been found in humans with increasing frequency. And new studies show that drug-resistant germs persist even in the soil and groundwater of farms that have given up antibiotic use. It\xe2\x80\x99s time for the F.D.A. to consider the public\xe2\x80\x99s health as carefully as it considers the interests of intensive agriculture and pharmaceutical companies.'b'Charter schools, which receive public money but are subject to fewer state regulations, are operating in 40 states. A growing body of research shows that charter schools generally perform no better than traditional schools and are often worse as measured by student test data. This is particularly true of online charter schools, which educate more than 200,000 full-time students and are spreading quickly across the country.'b'The need for closer scrutiny of these schools by state officials is underscored in a report published last week by the 'b'National Education Policy Center'b', a research center at the University of Colorado in Boulder. The study found that only 27 percent of privately managed online schools achieved adequate yearly progress on standardized tests, as defined by the federal government, in the 2010 school year as opposed to 52 percent of privately managed brick-and-mortar charter schools.'b''b'A recent investigation by The Times'b' focusing partly on 'b'K12 Inc.'b', one of the biggest online learning companies, and on Pennsylvania, which allows full-time online students, found that some high school teachers complained of managing too many online students. The overall picture was one of low student achievement and high turnover rates. These complaints are similar to those made about the for-profit college industry, which has been criticized for recruiting students who have no hope of graduating.'b'Despite lower operating costs, the online companies in some states collect nearly as much money as brick-and-mortar charter schools. In Pennsylvania, for example, the per-student cost for online charter schools was about $10,000. By all indications, taxpayers are getting very little for their money. 'b'A study'b' released last spring by Stanford University\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Center for Research on Education Outcomes'b' found that students in eight Pennsylvania online schools performed far worse in math and science than their traditional school counterparts.'b'Online programs that supplement traditional schooling have a place on the menu of education options. But there is growing evidence that full-time online schools may be inappropriate for a great majority of students and need to be monitored closely in states that allow them.'b'Cambridge, Mass.'b'IN the 10 years since the Guant\xc3\xa1namo detention camp opened, the anguished debate over whether to shutter the facility \xe2\x80\x94 or make it permanent \xe2\x80\x94 has obscured a deeper failure that dates back more than a century and implicates all Americans: namely, our continued occupation of Guant\xc3\xa1namo itself. It is past time to return this imperialist enclave to Cuba.'b'From the moment the United States government forced Cuba to lease the Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay naval base to us, in June 1901, the American presence there has been more than a thorn in Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s side. It has served to remind the world of America\xe2\x80\x99s long history of interventionist militarism. Few gestures would have as salutary an effect on the stultifying impasse in American-Cuban relations as handing over this coveted piece of land.'b'The circumstances by which the United States came to occupy Guant\xc3\xa1namo are as troubling as its past decade of activity there. In April 1898, American forces intervened in Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s three-year-old struggle for independence when it was all but won, thus transforming the Cuban War of Independence into what Americans are still wont to call the Spanish-American War. American officials then excluded the Cuban Army from the armistice and denied Cuba a seat at the Paris peace conference. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is so much natural anger and grief throughout the island,\xe2\x80\x9d the Cuban general M\xc3\xa1ximo G\xc3\xb3mez remarked in January 1899, after the peace treaty was signed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the people haven\xe2\x80\x99t really been able to celebrate the triumph of the end of their former rulers\xe2\x80\x99 power.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Curiously, the United States\xe2\x80\x99 declaration of war on Spain included the assurance that America did not seek \xe2\x80\x9csovereignty, jurisdiction, or control\xe2\x80\x9d over Cuba and intended \xe2\x80\x9cto leave the government and control of the island to its people.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But after the war, strategic imperatives took precedence over Cuban independence. The United States wanted dominion over Cuba, along with naval bases from which to exercise it.'b'Enter Gen. Leonard Wood, whom President William McKinley had named military governor of Cuba, bearing provisions that became known as the Platt Amendment. Two were particularly odious: one guaranteed the United States the right to intervene at will in Cuban affairs; the other provided for the sale or lease of naval stations. Juan Gualberto G\xc3\xb3mez, a leading delegate to the Cuban Constitutional Convention, said the amendment would render Cubans \xe2\x80\x9ca vassal people.\xe2\x80\x9d Foreshadowing the Cuban Missile Crisis, he presciently warned that foreign bases on Cuban soil would only draw Cuba \xe2\x80\x9cinto conflict not of our own making and in which we have no stake.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But it was an offer Cuba could not refuse, as Wood informed the delegates. The alternative to the amendment was continued occupation. The Cubans got the message. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is, of course, little or no real independence left Cuba under the Platt Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d Wood remarked to McKinley\xe2\x80\x99s successor, Theodore Roosevelt, in October 1901, soon after the Platt Amendment was incorporated into the Cuban Constitution. \xe2\x80\x9cThe more sensible Cubans realize this and feel that the only consistent thing now is to seek annexation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But with Platt in place, who needed annexation? Over the next two decades, the United States repeatedly dispatched Marines based at Guant\xc3\xa1namo to protect its interests in Cuba and block land redistribution. Between 1900 and 1920, some 44,000 Americans flocked to Cuba, boosting capital investment on the island to just over $1 billion from roughly $80 million and prompting one journalist to remark that \xe2\x80\x9clittle by little, the whole island is passing into the hands of American citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'How did this look from Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s perspective? Well, imagine that at the end of the American Revolution the French had decided to remain here. Imagine that the French had refused to allow Washington and his army to attend the armistice at Yorktown. Imagine that they had denied the Continental Congress a seat at the Treaty of Paris, prohibited expropriation of Tory property, occupied New York Harbor, dispatched troops to quash Shays\xe2\x80\x99 and other rebellions and then immigrated to the colonies in droves, snatching up the most valuable land.'b'Such is the context in which the United States came to occupy Guant\xc3\xa1namo. It is a history excluded from American textbooks and neglected in the debates over terrorism, international law and the reach of executive power. But it is a history known in Cuba (where it motivated the 1959 revolution) and throughout Latin America. It explains why Guant\xc3\xa1namo remains a glaring symbol of hypocrisy around the world. We need not even speak of the last decade.'b'If President Obama were to acknowledge this history and initiate the process of returning Guant\xc3\xa1namo to Cuba, he could begin to put the mistakes of the last 10 years behind us, not to mention fulfill a campaign pledge. (Given Congressional intransigence, there might be no better way to close the detention camp than to turn over the rest of the naval base along with it.) It would rectify an age-old grievance and lay the groundwork for new relations with Cuba and other countries in the Western Hemisphere and around the globe. Finally, it would send an unmistakable message that integrity, self-scrutiny and candor are not evidence of weakness, but indispensable attributes of leadership in an ever changing world. Surely there would be no fitter way to observe today\xe2\x80\x99s grim anniversary than to stand up for the principles Guant\xc3\xa1namo has undermined for over a century.'b'Cairo'b'With the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood and the even more puritanical Salafist Al Nour Party having stunned both themselves and Egyptians by garnering more than 60 percent of the seats in Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s parliamentary elections, we\xe2\x80\x99re about to see a unique lab test for the Middle East: What happens when political Islam has to wrestle with modernity and globalization without oil?'b'Islamist movements have long dominated Iran and Saudi Arabia. Both the ayatollahs in Iran and the Wahhabi Salafists in Saudi Arabia, though, were able to have their ideology and the fruits of modernity, too, because they had vast oil wealth to buy off any contradictions. Saudi Arabia could underutilize its women and impose strict religious mores on its society, banks and schools. Iran\xe2\x80\x99s clerics could snub the world, pursue nuclearization and impose heavy political and religious restrictions. And both could still offer their people improved living standards, because they had oil.'b'Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s Islamist parties will not have that luxury. They will have to open up to the world, and they seem to be realizing that. Egypt is a net importer of oil. It also imports 40 percent of its food. And tourism constitutes one-tenth of its gross domestic product. With unemployment rampant and the Egyptian pound eroding, Egypt will probably need assistance from the International Monetary Fund, a major injection of foreign investment and a big upgrade in modern education to provide jobs for all those youths who organized last year\xe2\x80\x99s rebellion. Egypt needs to be integrated with the world.'b'The Muslim Brotherhood, whose party is called Freedom and Justice, draws a lot of support from the middle classes and small businesses. The Salafist Al Nour Party is dominated by religious sheiks and the rural and urban poor.'b'Essam el-Erian, the vice chairman of the Muslim Brotherhood\xe2\x80\x99s party, told me: \xe2\x80\x9cWe hope that we can pull the Salafists \xe2\x80\x94 not that they pull us \xe2\x80\x94 and that both of us will be pulled by the people\xe2\x80\x99s needs.\xe2\x80\x9d He made very clear that while both Freedom and Justice and Al Nour are Islamist parties, they are very different, and they may not join hands in power: \xe2\x80\x9cAs a political group, they are newcomers, and I hope all can wait to discover the difference between Al Nour and Freedom and Justice.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'On the peace treaty with Israel, Erian said: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the commitment of the state \xe2\x80\x94 not any group or party \xe2\x80\x94 and we have said we are respecting the commitments of the Egyptian state from the past.\xe2\x80\x9d Ultimately, he added, relations with Israel will be determined by how it treats the Palestinians.'b'But generally speaking, he said, Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s economic plight \xe2\x80\x9cis pushing us to be concerned about our own affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Muhammad Khairat el-Shater, the vice chairman of the Muslim Brotherhood and its economic guru, made clear to me over strawberry juice at his home that his organization intends to lean into the world. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is no longer a matter of choice whether one can be with or against globalization,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a reality. From our perspective, we favor the widest possible engagement with globalization through win-win situations.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Nader Bakkar, a spokesman for Al Nour, insisted that his party would move cautiously. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are the guardians of Shariah,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me, referring to Islamic law, \xe2\x80\x9cand we want people to be with us on the same principles, but we have an open door to all the intellectuals in all fields.\xe2\x80\x9d He said his party\xe2\x80\x99s economic model was Brazil. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t like the theocratic model,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cI can promise you that we will not be another dictatorship, and the Egyptian people will not give us a chance to be another dictatorship.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In November, Hazem Salah Abu Ismail, an independent Salafist cleric and presidential candidate, was asked by an interviewer how, as president, he would react to a woman wearing a bikini on the beach? \xe2\x80\x9cShe would be arrested,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'The Al Nour Party quickly said he was not speaking for it. Agence France-Presse quoted another spokesman for Al Nour, Muhammad Nour, as also dismissing fears raised in the news media that the Salafists might ban alcohol, a staple of Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s tourist hotels. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe 20,000 out of 80 million Egyptians drink alcohol,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cForty million don\xe2\x80\x99t have sanitary water. Do you think that, in Parliament, I\xe2\x80\x99ll busy myself with people who don\xe2\x80\x99t have water, or people who get drunk?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What to make of all this? Egyptian Islamists have some big decisions. It has been easy to maintain a high degree of ideological purity all these years they\xe2\x80\x99ve been out of power. But their sudden rise to the top of Egyptian politics coincides with the free fall of Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s economy. And as soon as Parliament is seated on Jan. 23, Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s Islamists will have the biggest responsibility for fixing that economy \xe2\x80\x94 'b'without oil'b'. (A similar drama is playing out in Tunisia.)'b'They don\xe2\x80\x99t want to blow this chance to lead, yet they want to be true to their Islamic roots, yet they know their supporters elected them to deliver clean government, education and jobs, not mosques. It will be fascinating to watch them deal with these tugs and pulls. Where they come out will have a huge impact on the future of political Islam in this region.'b'Berkeley, Calif.'b'THROUGH the National Institutes of Health, American taxpayers have long supported research directed at understanding and treating human disease. Since 2009, the results of that research have been available free of charge on the National Library of Medicine\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Web site'b', allowing the public (patients and physicians, students and teachers) to read about the discoveries their tax dollars paid for.'b'But a bill introduced in the House of Representatives last month threatens to cripple this site. 'b'The Research Works Act'b' would forbid the N.I.H. to require, as it now does, that its grantees provide copies of the papers they publish in peer-reviewed journals to the library. If the bill passes, to read the results of federally funded research, most Americans would have to buy access to individual articles at a cost of $15 or $30 apiece. In other words, taxpayers who already paid for the research would have to pay again to read the results.'b'This is the latest salvo in a continuing battle between the publishers of biomedical research journals like Cell, Science and The New England Journal of Medicine, which are seeking to protect a valuable franchise, and researchers, librarians and patient advocacy groups seeking to provide open access to publicly funded research.'b'The bill is backed by the powerful Association of American Publishers and sponsored by Representatives Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, and Darrell Issa, a Republican from California. The publishers argue that they add value to the finished product, and that requiring them to provide free access to journal articles within a year of publication denies them their fair compensation. After all, they claim, while the research may be publicly funded, the journals are not.'b'But in fact, the journals receive billions of dollars in subscription payments derived largely from public funds. The value they say they add lies primarily in peer review, the process through which works are assessed for validity and significance before publication. But while the journals manage that process, it is carried out almost entirely by\xc2\xa0researchers who volunteer their time.\xc2\xa0 Scientists are expected to participate in peer review as part of their employment, and thus the publicly funded salaries most of them draw through universities or research organizations are yet another way in which taxpayers already subsidize the publishing process.'b'Rather than rolling back public access, Congress should move to enshrine a simple principle in United States law: if taxpayers paid for it, they own it. This is already the case for scientific papers published by researchers at the N.I.H. campus in Bethesda, Md., whose work, as government employees, has been explicitly excluded from copyright protection since 1976. It would be easy to extend this coverage to all works funded by the federal government.'b'But it is not just Congress that should act. For too long scientists, libraries and research institutions have supported the publishing status quo out of a combination of tradition and convenience. But the latest effort to overturn the N.I.H.\xe2\x80\x99s public access policy should dispel any remaining illusions that commercial publishers are serving the interests of the scientific community and public.'b'Researchers should cut off commercial journals\xe2\x80\x99 supply of papers by publishing exclusively in one of the many \xe2\x80\x9copen-access\xe2\x80\x9d journals that are perfectly capable of managing peer review (like those published by the Public Library of Science, which I co-founded). Libraries should cut off their supply of money by canceling subscriptions. And most important, the N.I.H., universities and other public and private agencies that sponsor academic research should make it clear that fulfilling their mission requires that their researchers\xe2\x80\x99 scholarly output be freely available to the public at the moment of publication.'b'These steps would not only accomplish an important public good \xe2\x80\x94 unlimited access to the latest scientific and medical findings \xe2\x80\x94 but they would also send a powerful sign of gratitude to the taxpayers, on whose continued support our research depends.'b'Where the Iowa caucuses illuminated the dark essence of social conservatism, 'b'the New Hampshire primary'b' was a journey into the dingy, cramped quarters of the right wing\xe2\x80\x99s economic policies.'b'The Republicans ritually denounced President Obama as hostile to capitalism, disdainful of individual enterprise and lacking in ideas for reviving the economy. All they had to offer were economic ideas that not only are inadequate for that purpose but were instrumental in creating the nation\xe2\x80\x99s current economic problems.'b'In a flailing effort to address the pain of the middle class, the Republicans repeated familiar charges that Mr. Obama advocates a redistribution of wealth. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas outright called him a socialist. Newt Gingrich tried to focus national anger about income inequality with a faux populist assault on Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s participation in the frenzied world of leveraged buyouts.'b'It was all exactly backward. Americans are angry about income redistribution \xe2\x80\x94 from the middle class to the tiny sliver at the top, not from the top down. Leveraged buyouts were only one factor in the growth of the income gap. Also to blame was a host of benighted economic policies advocated by Republicans for the last 30 years.'b'This fight will continue in South Carolina on Jan. 21. Mr. Romney did not win the New Hampshire primary by enough to knock out his rivals because Representative Ron Paul and Rick Santorum were never expected to win and Jon Huntsman Jr. did surprisingly well.'b'The candidates\xe2\x80\x99 economic arguments were disturbingly disconnected from economic reality. They spoke of government spending as if it were the sole cause of the federal budget deficit and cutting it the sole solution. In reality, it was tax cuts for the wealthy, an assault on social programs and a deregulatory zeal that allowed a recklessness that led to near economic collapse.'b'The solution is policies that promote growth and help the middle class, not what the Republican hopefuls want. Mr. Obama said it well on Monday night: \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t go back to this brand of you\xe2\x80\x99re-on-your-own economics.\xe2\x80\x9d You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell that by listening to Mr. Romney prattle about a merit-based economy and call for lowering taxes and cutting spending.'b'Like some others, Mr. Gingrich talked about income inequality, but it was a tactical move. A \xe2\x80\x9csuper PAC\xe2\x80\x9d that supports him plans to run a documentary this weekend, 'b'with the help of a casino billionaire'b' of all people, that paints Mr. Romney as a rapacious corporate raider for his leadership of the leveraged buyout firm Bain Capital. The message is that those buyouts were to blame for income inequality. Those buyouts were not the only cause of income inequality, and certainly not the Great Recession.'b'Economic growth and rising productivity are needed for broadly shared prosperity, but rising living standards require policies that ensure regular increases in the minimum wage, which peaked in 1968; greater investment in the social safety net; full employment as a government priority; progressive taxation; and effective financial regulation to avoid overgrowth followed by collapse.'b'These kinds of policies dominated from the late-1940s to the 1970s, a time of broadly shared prosperity and a strong middle class. Those policies were then systematically reversed, income inequality began to explode and productivity growth slowed. Tax cuts for the rich and assaults on programs for the poor and middle class worsened inequality during the years of George W. Bush.'b'The answer is not more of the same failed policies. The solution is to revive the successful ones, along with policies to stimulate the economy and stop foreclosures. Mr. Obama understands this. The Republican hopefuls are deluding themselves and trying to delude the voters.'b'MANCHESTER, N.H.'b'As chief executive of Bain Capital, Mitt Romney was all about cold analysis and hot profits.'b'He took a rare personal interest in one of his investments: the Lifelike Company, which produced My Twinn dolls, fashioned to look like the little girls who owned them.'b'As Mark Maremont reported in The Wall Street Journal on Monday, Romney invested $2.1 million in 1996 for a stake in the company; the idea was brought to him by a Lifelike partner who was a friend from Brigham Young University and Harvard Business School.'b'Romney, who accuses President Obama of \xe2\x80\x9ccrony capitalism\xe2\x80\x9d on the Solyndra deal, introduced his brother-in-law to Lifelike officials, who dutifully hired the relative and promoted him to vice president with an annual salary of $100,000.'b'Romney\xe2\x80\x99s Bain colleagues, according to The Journal, were dubious from the start and, indeed, the brother-in-law was fired and the company failed, despite a personal loan from Romney.'b'But I\xe2\x80\x99m beginning to suspect that before the factory shut down, Mitt requested his own customized doll.'b'He has clearly brought a My Twinn on the trail \xe2\x80\x94 a plastic replica of a candidate who\xe2\x80\x99s often described as a plastic replica: white teeth, gelled hair, windowpane shirt, Tommy Bahama jeans.'b'(\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t vote for a Ken doll,\xe2\x80\x9d a Bradford, N.H., resident, Jason Reid, adamantly told me at the Bradford Market the other night.)'b'Romney may have been a pampered prince of Detroit and a leveraged buyout king of Boston, the elite of the elite in the Mormon Church, in the financial world and in the political world.'b'But Mitt\xe2\x80\x99s My Twinn has a hardscrabble background, struggling from the bottom up, fearing pink slips, sweating losing jobs and somehow, late in life, letting himself get talked into a presidential run.'b'Romney may have been a Wall Street predator, looter and vulture gnawing at the carcasses of companies and plotting a White House bid in diapers to finish what his dad started, as his Republican rivals have portrayed him. \xe2\x80\x9cMake a profit,\xe2\x80\x9d a younger Romney laughingly says in the attack film financed by supporters of Newt Gingrich. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what it\xe2\x80\x99s all about, right?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But Mitt\xe2\x80\x99s My Twinn is Just Like You.'b'Romney may be a shape-shifting opportunist full of \xe2\x80\x9cpious baloney,\xe2\x80\x9d as Gingrich, a crazed Chuckie doll, asserts.'b'But Mitt\xe2\x80\x99s My Twinn is humble, sincere and salt of the earth.'b'With many worried that America is in decline, a prospective race between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney is being caricatured here as \xe2\x80\x9cSaul Alinsky versus Gordon Gekko,\xe2\x80\x9d as Don Baer, a former senior Clinton White House adviser, put it.'b'And the ones painting Romney as a ruthless Gekko, complete with a 1980s-era slicked-back mane, are Republicans.'b'Romney had planned to campaign against Obama in the fall by defending free enterprise. But now he finds himself having to do it in the Republican nominating contests.'b'His G.O.P. rivals are not only trashing President Obama as a socialist, they\xe2\x80\x99ve become socialists themselves in a last desperate \xe2\x80\x94 and vain \xe2\x80\x94 attempt to bring down the front-runner, whose less-than-scintillating persona inspired one Democrat to note about Republican voters: \xe2\x80\x9cThe dog won\xe2\x80\x99t eat the dog food.\xe2\x80\x9d Romney\xe2\x80\x99s competitors have been running around New Hampshire and South Carolina trashing Romney for doing what Republicans do: throwing people out of work and making money.'b'To the giddy delight of Democrats, Romney\xe2\x80\x99s rivals here have softened him up for Obama by making the case that Bain is the symbol of the central problem with the American economy: corporate profits are sky-high while companies aren\xe2\x80\x99t hiring much.'b'Michael Kranish and Scott Helman, the authors of a new biography, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Real Romney,\xe2\x80\x9d tell this story: During the 1968 Republican primary, after George Romney made his notorious remark about getting \xe2\x80\x9cthe greatest brainwashing that anybody can get\xe2\x80\x9d on Vietnam, The Detroit News, ordinarily a supporter, blasted his \xe2\x80\x9cblurt and retreat habits\xe2\x80\x9d and urged him to get out of the race.'b'Although Mitt has studied his dad\xe2\x80\x99s mistakes in that race carefully, he seems to be inexorably repeating some of them.'b'He won Tuesday night, denouncing his rivals\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cbitter politics of envy,\xe2\x80\x9d but he had a \xe2\x80\x9cblurt and retreat\xe2\x80\x9d week in New Hampshire that didn\xe2\x80\x99t augur well for the fall.'b'Though he was referring to getting rid of insurance companies that were not providing adequate care, his \xe2\x80\x9cI like to be able to fire people who provide services to me\xe2\x80\x9d crack was a chuckleheaded move that played into the hands of foes.'b'And his inept attempts to paint himself as an Average Joe who somehow backed into the presidential arena earned him relentless mocking.'b'But, as the authors of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Real Romney\xe2\x80\x9d report, Mitt once told a church friend that Romneys were built to swim upstream.

Inefficient plans like these contribute to the low employment rate of people with disabilities: less than a third are employed.'b'Mr. Daus\xe2\x80\x99s proposal also disregards tourists, for whom home pickup is not an option. They would be exposed to the elements for an undetermined period of time, waiting for taxis to find them.'b'In a society that guarantees equality, we must go the extra mile to ensure opportunities for all, even when it isn\xe2\x80\x99t economically efficient, especially for essentials like access to transportation.'b'CAROL GLAZER'b' Pres., Natl.

The new taxi legislation announced by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg last month that would put 2,000 wheelchair-accessible cabs on the streets will not only benefit wheelchair users but also aging baby boomers and returning veterans. If London can run a 100 percent accessible fleet, so can New York City.'b'Mr. Daus says \xe2\x80\x9cmany disabled riders would far prefer home pickup to an uncertain wait on a corner in bad weather\xe2\x80\x9d; he is out of touch with a population that has been working to secure the same rights for street hails that able-bodied citizens have.'b'The city tried a dispatch system, as he notes, and it failed miserably. Mr. Daus now wants the city to go back into the dispatch business when it can simply require new taxis to be accessible.'b'The new legislation will not force taxpayers to \xe2\x80\x9cfoot the bill\xe2\x80\x9d but will save them hundreds of millions by reducing demand for Access-a-Ride, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\xe2\x80\x99s $462 million-a-year, $50-a-ride cost to taxpayers. Benefits-related travel made by people in wheelchairs sponsored by the Department of Veterans Affairs and Medicaid could be made at far less expense by accessible taxi than by ambulette.'b'Mr. Daus\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide meaningful service to people with disabilities is the reason a lawsuit and legislation were required.'b'JAMES WEISMAN'b' Sr. V.P. and General Counsel'b' United Spinal Association'b' East Elmhurst, Queens, Jan. 5, 2012'b''b''b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Matthew W. Daus doesn\xe2\x80\x99t recognize that handicap-accessible cabs provide usable transportation to people with various types of disabilities, not only to wheelchair-bound people. A more accessible fleet of taxis will facilitate easier transit for the elderly, people affected by arthritis, muscle and joint illnesses, and injuries, people with strollers and so on.'b'More important, a \xe2\x80\x9ccentralized taxi-dispatch system for disabled riders\xe2\x80\x9d assumes that disabled people only travel alone, and that they need taxis only for planned situations.

Incentives should help emerging industries develop and grow, not forever subsidize them, which is why the ethanol industry willingly gave up the blender\xe2\x80\x99s tax credit at the end of last year.'b'As you suggest, the expiration of the blenders\xe2\x80\x99 credit is an opportunity to take a hard look at the hidden costs of our continued dependence on gasoline, nearly two-thirds of which is derived from foreign oil.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ve spent trillions of dollars importing oil, financing corruption, political adversaries and outright enemies for access to this oil. Congress must end the needless subsidies to Big Oil and focus its attention on expanding access to renewable-energy technologies, like ethanol, which are proved to make America stronger and less reliant on oil as our primary transportation fuel source.'b'CHRIS THORNE'b'\nWashington, Jan. 9, 2012'b''b''b'The writer is public affairs director of Growth Energy, an ethanol trade association. 'b''b'Los Angeles'b'THE immigration crisis that has roiled American politics for decades has faded into history. Illegal immigration is shrinking to a trickle, if that, and will likely never return to the peak levels of 2000. Just as important, immigrants who arrived in the 1990s and settled here are assimilating in remarkable and unexpected ways.'b'Taken together, these developments, and the demographic future they foreshadow, require bold changes in our approach to both legal and illegal immigration. Put simply, we must shift from an immigration policy, with its emphasis on keeping newcomers out, to an immigrant policy, with an emphasis on encouraging migrants and their children to integrate into our social fabric. \xe2\x80\x9cShow me your papers\xe2\x80\x9d should be replaced with \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome to English class.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Restrictionists, including those driving much of the debate on the Republican primary trail, still talk as if nothing has changed. But the numbers are stark: the total number of immigrants, legal and illegal, arriving in the 2000s grew at half the rate of the 1990s, according to the Census Bureau.'b'The most startling evidence of the falloff is the effective disappearance of illegal border crossers from Mexico, with some experts estimating the 'b'net number of new Mexicans'b' settling in the United States at zero. The size of the illegal-immigrant population peaked in 2007, with about 58 percent of it of Mexican origin, according to the Pew Hispanic Center; since 2008, that population has shrunk by roughly 200,000 a year. Illegal immigrants from Asia and other parts of the globe have similarly dwindled in numbers.'b'This new equilibrium is here to stay, in large part because 'b'Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s birthrate is plunging'b'. In 1970 a Mexican woman, on average, gave birth to 6.8 babies, and when they entered their 20s, millions journeyed north for work. Today the country\xe2\x80\x99s birthrate \xe2\x80\x94 at 2.1 \xe2\x80\x94 is approaching that of the United States. That portends a shrinking pool of young adults to meet Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s future labor needs, and less competition for jobs at home.'b'If the number of immigrants is declining, what about that other nativist bugbear, assimilation? There\xe2\x80\x99s little doubt that immigrants\xe2\x80\x99 potential as economic contributors turns on their ability to assimilate. Fortunately, recent studies by John Pitkin, Julie Park and me show that immigrant parents and children, especially Latinos, are making extraordinary strides in assimilating.'b'Today, barely a third of adult immigrants have a high-school diploma. But the children of Latino immigrants have always outperformed their parents in educational achievement. By 2030 we expect 80 percent of their children who arrived in the 1990s before age 10 to have completed high school and 18 percent to have a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree.'b'But it is immigrants\xe2\x80\x99 success in becoming homeowners \xe2\x80\x94 often overlooked in immigration debates \xe2\x80\x94 that is the truest mark of their desire to adopt America as home. Consider Latinos. Among those in the wave of 1990s immigrants, just 20 percent owned a home in 2000. We expect that percentage to rise to 69 percent \xe2\x80\x94 and 74 percent for all immigrants \xe2\x80\x94 by 2030, well above the historical average for all Americans.'b'Who will be selling these homes to these immigrants? The 78 million native-born baby boomers looking to downsize as their children grow up and leave home. Fortunately for them, both immigrants and their children will be there to buy their homes, putting money into baby-boomer pockets and helping to shore up future housing prices.'b'Indeed, with millions of people retiring every year, America\xe2\x80\x99s immigrants and their children are crucial to future economic growth: economists forecast labor-force growth to drop below 1 percent later this decade because of retiring baby boomers.'b'Immigrants\xe2\x80\x99 extraordinary progress in assimilating would be faster if federal and state policies encouraged it. Unfortunately, they don\xe2\x80\x99t. This year, the Department of Homeland Security plans to spend a measly $18 million \xe2\x80\x94 far less than a tenth of 1 percent of its budget \xe2\x80\x94 on helping immigrants assimilate. Meanwhile, states with large immigrant populations are cutting the budgets of community and state colleges, precisely where immigrant students predominantly enroll.'b'How do we change course and begin treating immigrants as a vast, untapped human resource? The answer goes to the heart of shifting from an immigration policy to an immigrant policy.'b'For starters, the billions of dollars spent on border enforcement should be gradually redirected to replenishing and boosting the education budget, particularly the Pell grant program for low-income students. Some money could be channeled to nonprofits like ImmigrationWorks and Welcoming America, which are at the forefront of helping migrants assimilate.'b'Second, the Departments of Labor, Commerce and Education need to play a greater role in immigration policy. Yes, as long as there remains a terrorist threat from abroad, the Department of Homeland Security should have an immigration component. But immigration policy is all about cultivating needed workers. That means helping immigrants and their children graduate from high school and college. It means that no migrant should have to stand in line for an English class. It means assistance in developing migrants\xe2\x80\x99 job skills to better compete in an increasingly information- and knowledge-based economy.'b'Thanks to our huge foreign-born population (12 percent of the total), America can remain the world\xe2\x80\x99s richest and most powerful nation for decades. Shaping an immigrant policy that focuses on developing the talents of our migrants and their children is the surest way to realize this goal.'b'IN 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant signed a mining law to spur the development of the West by giving hard-rock mining precedence over other uses of federal land. But the law has long since outlived its purpose, and its environmental consequences have been severe.'b'Mining claims for copper, gold, uranium and other minerals cover millions of those acres, and the law, now 140 years old, makes it nearly impossible to block extraction, no matter how serious the potential consequences. Soaring metal prices are now driving new mine proposals across the West.'b'Oregon\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Chetco River'b' is one example. The river\xe2\x80\x99s gin-clear waters teem with wild trout and salmon, including giant Chinook salmon tipping scales at more than 60 pounds. In 1988, Congress designated the Chetco a national wild and scenic river \xe2\x80\x9cto be protected for the benefit of present and future generations.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But the river is now threatened by proposals to mine gold along almost half of its approximately 55-mile length. Suction dredges would vacuum up the river bottom searching for gold, muddying water and disrupting clean gravel that salmon need to spawn. Despite the Chetco\xe2\x80\x99s rich fishery and status as a wild and scenic river, the United States Forest Service is virtually powerless to stop the mining because of the 1872 law.'b'As 'b'Michael P. Dombeck'b', a former chief of the Forest Service, explained to a Senate committee in 2008, \xe2\x80\x9cit is nearly impossible to prohibit mining under the current framework of the 1872 mining law, no matter how serious the impacts might be.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Under the law, mining companies \xe2\x80\x94 not the government \xe2\x80\x94 decide whether and where to file their claims on public land. (National parks, monuments and wilderness areas are excluded.) Federal agencies review the plans, but they are approved as a matter of course. Mining companies pledge to protect rivers threatened by their operations. But the industry\xe2\x80\x99s track record hardly inspires confidence.'b'The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that headwater streams in 40 percent of Western watersheds are polluted by mining. A scientific review in 2006 of 25 modern Western mines by the environmental group Earthworks found that more than three-fourths resulted in water contamination. Over all, the E.P.A. has estimated that it will cost $20 billion to $54 billion to clean up abandoned mine sites.'b'As fisheries scientists, we are deeply concerned about the impact mining has had on our nation\xe2\x80\x99s dwindling fisheries and the inadequacy of the 1872 law to regulate modern mining. In contrast to the pick-and-shovel operations of a century ago, most modern mines are large-scale operations that use toxic chemicals to extract metals from the ore, and they generate vast amounts of mine waste. After these mines close, treating the polluted water in perpetuity is often necessary.'b'At Oregon\xe2\x80\x99s Formosa mine, for instance, toxic metal-laden drainage from mines is contaminating 18 miles of prime salmon habitat. In Montana, the Zortman Landusky Mine has polluted a dozen streams with arsenic, selenium and other harmful metals. The acidic runoff will continue for centuries.'b'Last year, the Kensington mine in Alaska was permitted to dispose of toxic mine waste directly into a freshwater lake, decimating its native fish population. The Rock Creek and Montanore mines are proposing to tunnel under the Cabinet Mountains Wilderness in Montana. Scientists predict that these mines will deplete flows in wilderness streams, including essential habitat for the region\xe2\x80\x99s threatened bull trout.'b'At the request of members of the Oregon Congressional delegation, the Forest Service proposed to withdraw a portion of the Chetco River temporarily from the jurisdiction of the 1872 mining law while seeking additional protection. This type of stopgap effort highlights the need for a comprehensive overhaul of the archaic law.'b'In a 2010 paper published in the journal Fisheries, we recommended important mining policy changes. Federal land managers must have discretion to balance mining with other land uses, and say \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d to mine proposals when necessary. No mines should be approved that can result in perpetual water pollution. There should be clear environmental standards, requirements to restore fish and wildlife habitat to pre-mining conditions and sufficient reclamation bonds to cover the full cost of cleanup. A dedicated source of funding should be established to pay for cleanup of the thousands of abandoned mines that continue to pollute our streams.'b'The mining industry has powerful friends in Washington, however, and nothing has come of our proposals or of other reform efforts. Now Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, is pushing a measure that would require mining companies to pay a royalty equal to what other industries have been paying for decades, provide safeguards for clean water and give communities and agencies a say about where mining is permitted.'b'The bill merits broad bipartisan support. It is unwise to let this 140-year-old law continue to operate at the expense of clean water, healthy fisheries, public lands and taxpayer dollars. America\xe2\x80\x99s mining law must be brought into the 21st century.'b'I am feeling totally cheated.

This is all about each state finding its own, unique answer to its own special health care issue. Romneycare, Mitt explains, was right for Massachusetts because the state was faced with the choice of requiring everyone to have health insurance or continuing \xe2\x80\x9cto allow people without insurance to go to the hospital and get free care, paid for by the government, paid for by the taxpayers.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This shows you how different the situation in each state is, since it is well known that in other parts of the country, sick and uninsured people do not go to hospitals but instead are encouraged to present themselves to the nearest local nail salon.'b''b'What do the Republicans have against Europe?'b''b'All the candidates in the Republican primaries seem obsessed with the idea that the United States is in danger of becoming like Europe, which would be the worst thing imaginable.

The hitch: the main factor was the recession that left millions of Americans unemployed, uninsured, short of income, and unable or unwilling to spend money on health care.'b'Optimists hope that most of the decreased spending came about by eliminating care that was not really medically necessary. Pessimists fear that many low-income people are forgoing care they need, increasing the likelihood that they will eventually become sicker and require costly hospitalization. They may both be right.'b''b'The data show'b' that total health care spending by public and private sources, including households, rose by 3.8 percent in 2009 and 3.9 percent in 2010. Spending slowed for hospital care, physician services, nursing homes, home care and especially prescription drugs, as consumers increasingly chose cheaper generics.'b'Growth in spending by both Medicare and Medicaid actually slowed in 2010 compared with 2009, even though the federal government ramped up its share of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s total health care spending while private businesses reduced their share.'b'Out-of-pocket spending by consumers rose in 2010 compared with 2009, as many workers paid higher premiums, deductibles and co-payments or lost their insurance coverage. But out-of-pocket spending still grew more slowly than the annual average between 2000 and 2008, probably because consumers decided to spend less on health care.'b'So far, the health care reform law has had little impact on total spending even though some of its provisions, like prescription drug rebates for Medicare beneficiaries, have already kicked in.'b'The real impact will come in 2014 when there will be an expansion of Medicaid and a new federal subsidy program for low- and middle-income Americans.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s too early to know whether the trend of slower growth will persist after the economy improves.

So I light it, for the warmth, for the light, for the company, so that when I go outside there will be that burgee of smoke blowing from the chimney.'b'Watching the fire, I think sometimes about two terrifying rooms in the Iowa farmhouse where my dad grew up. One was the coal room for the furnace, the other the cob room for the kitchen cookstove. When I first saw them, both had been antiquated by oil and electricity. The coal room had a darkness that the eye couldn\xe2\x80\x99t penetrate. Next door, the cobs had settled into a heap that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been disturbed in years. I can\xe2\x80\x99t say what frightened me, unless it was a glimpse into an abandoned way of living.'b'I think of it now because when I light the woodstove, I realize that I am burning time. Handling the split logs, I notice their straightness or their irregularities. But when I feed them into the woodstove, I get one last, end-on glimpse of their tree rings. It\xe2\x80\x99s like feeding chapters of a biological chronicle into the fire one by one.

Then the teacher decides to quit. What should you do?'b'The correct answer? Panic!'b'Well, not exactly. But 'b'a landmark new research paper'b' underscores that the difference between a strong teacher and a weak teacher lasts a lifetime. Having a good fourth-grade teacher makes a student 1.25 percent more likely to go to college, the research suggests, and 1.25 percent less likely to get pregnant as a teenager. Each of the students will go on as an adult to earn, on average, $25,000 more over a lifetime \xe2\x80\x94 or about $700,000 in gains for an average size class \xe2\x80\x94 all attributable to that ace teacher back in the fourth grade. That\xe2\x80\x99s right: A great teacher is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to each year\xe2\x80\x99s students, just in the extra income they will earn.'b'The study, by economists at Harvard and Columbia universities, finds that if a great teacher is leaving, parents should hold bake sales or pass the hat around in hopes of collectively offering the teacher as much as a $100,000 bonus to stay for an extra year. Sure, that\xe2\x80\x99s implausible \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 but their children would gain a benefit that far exceeds even that sum.'b'Conversely, a very poor teacher has the same effect as a pupil missing 40 percent of the school year. We don\xe2\x80\x99t allow that kind of truancy, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear why we should put up with such poor teaching. In fact, the study shows that parents should pay a bad teacher $100,000 to retire (assuming the replacement is of average quality) because a weak teacher holds children back so much.'b'Our faltering education system may be the most important long-term threat to America\xe2\x80\x99s economy and national well-being, so it\xe2\x80\x99s frustrating that the presidential campaign is mostly ignoring the issue.

Or, to put it another way, fewer bad teachers. The obvious policy solution is more pay for good teachers, more dismissals for weak teachers.'b'One of the paradoxes of the school reform debate is that teachers\xe2\x80\x99 unions have resisted a focus on teacher quality; instead, they emphasize that the home is the foremost influence and that teachers can only do so much.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s all true, and ('b'as I\xe2\x80\x99ve often written'b') we need an array of other antipoverty measures as well, especially early childhood programs. But the evidence is now overwhelming that even in a grim high-poverty school, some teachers have far more impact on their students than those in the classroom next door. Three consecutive years of data from student tests \xe2\x80\x94 the \xe2\x80\x9cvalue added\xe2\x80\x9d between student scores at the beginning and end of each year \xe2\x80\x94 reveal a great deal about whether a teacher is working out, the researchers found.'b'This study, by Raj Chetty and John N. Friedman of Harvard University and Jonah E. Rockoff of Columbia University, was influential because it involved a huge database of one million students followed from fourth grade to adulthood.'b''b'The blog of the Albert Shanker Institute'b', endowed by the 'b'American Federation of Teachers'b', praised the study as \xe2\x80\x9cone of the most dense, important and interesting analyses on this topic in a very long time\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 although it cautioned against policy conclusions (of the kind that I\xe2\x80\x99m reaching).'b'What shone through the study was the variation among teachers. Great teachers not only raised test scores significantly \xe2\x80\x94 an effect that mostly faded within a few years \xe2\x80\x94 but also left their students with better life outcomes. A great teacher (defined as one better than 84 percent of peers) for a single year between fourth and eighth grades resulted in students earning almost 1 percent more at age 28.'b'Suppose that the bottom 5 percent of teachers could be replaced by teachers of average quality. The three economists found that each student in the classroom would have extra cumulative lifetime earnings of more than $52,000. That\xe2\x80\x99s more than $1.4 million in gains for the classroom.'b'Some Republicans worry that a federal role in education smacks of socialism. On the contrary, schools represent a tough-minded business investment in our economic future. And, increasingly, we\xe2\x80\x99re getting solid evidence of what reforms may help: teacher evaluations based on student performance, higher pay and prestige for good teachers, dismissals for weak teachers.'b'That, and not most of the fireworks that passes for politics these days, is the debate we should be having on a national stage.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'A Shrinking Military Budget May Take Neighbors With It'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Next War\xe2\x80\x9d series, front page, Jan. 7) overstates the importance of Pentagon research and development spending in spurring technological innovation.

Now, as the 18th-largest economy in the world and a thoroughly democratized nation, Taiwan is still perceived by some in Washington as a potential bargaining chip in crafting a new relationship with China. This is a mistake.'b'It is true that Taiwan\xe2\x80\x99s status is the only dispute today that is likely to drag America and China into war. Similarly, a democratic Taiwan worries \xe2\x80\x9crealist\xe2\x80\x9d strategic thinkers who fear the consequences if it declares independence. But since 2008, when Taiwan began to stabilize its once volatile relations with China, it has become an even greater asset for the United States \xe2\x80\x94 and an inspiration for democratizing forces in mainland China.'b'After years of saber-rattling in Beijing and Taipei\xe2\x80\x99s drive for independence, President Ma Ying-jeou\xe2\x80\x99s May 2008 declaration of \xe2\x80\x9cno unification, no independence, and no use of force\xe2\x80\x9d calmed all sides. Taiwan and China have since engaged in numerous de facto government-to-government talks and greatly expanded people-to-people exchanges. With $130 billion worth of trade and seven million visits annually across the Taiwan Strait, the impact on both societies could be enormous.'b'Indeed, as China and Taiwan have grown ever more economically integrated, Taiwan has also become a model for China\xe2\x80\x99s future. No longer perceived as a menace to China\xe2\x80\x99s national unity, Taiwan\xe2\x80\x99s value as an example for China began to emerge, particularly when it came to market reforms, popular culture and press freedom. And this new model arrived at a fortuitous juncture.'b'After 1949, Communist China\xe2\x80\x99s first 30 years were engulfed in revolutionary fervor, internal power struggles and poverty. Its second 30 years witnessed rapid economic growth, which catapulted the country to the second largest economy in the world. The third stage, which may well last another 30 years, given China\xe2\x80\x99s huge size, is most likely to be marked by a race between popular demands for participation in the political process and the Communist Party\xe2\x80\x99s response to these demands.'b'This is a bumpy path Taiwan has trod. In the past three decades, Taiwan has discarded authoritarianism and moved from martial law to the rule of law, experiencing impressive economic growth and political liberalization. Authoritarian China now finds itself uncomfortably strained as inland provinces are struggling for economic growth while urban areas are boldly stretching out to explore the boundaries of political control, forcing the Communist Party to experiment with limited reforms.'b'Herein lies Taiwan\xe2\x80\x99s new value. While China\xe2\x80\x99s economic influence on Taiwan is growing, many in China find Taiwan\xe2\x80\x99s experience with democratization, warts and all, instructive. Long resentful of prevalent corruption at home, they have watched Taiwan tackle corruption within its government, even at the highest levels. They have seen how successfully Taiwan combined modernity with Chinese traditions. And they have observed how Taiwan\xe2\x80\x99s people freely express their will through noisy public discussion and regular elections. Last month, debates among Taiwan\xe2\x80\x99s presidential candidates were even carried by social media inside China.'b'Taiwan will of course need to resolve its internal political disagreements. After all, some in Taiwan are not yet convinced that a push for independence would be misguided. However, such a move would court disaster, incur disfavor with the international community, and seriously undermine Taiwan\xe2\x80\x99s newfound attraction to many Chinese people as a democratic model.'b'The winner of Taiwan\xe2\x80\x99s presidential election on Jan. 14 should therefore strive to forge a new domestic consensus between opposing camps on the island\xe2\x80\x99s political relationship with China while ensuring Taiwan a more dignified place in world politics commensurate with the contributions it can make.'b'Long locked in indignant isolation but enormously proud of their democratic achievements, Taiwan\xe2\x80\x99s people must now accept that democracy endows them with greater responsibility for regional stability. They could start by playing a more constructive role in the evolving American-Chinese relationship by becoming an interlocutor on issues that affect all three parties, like disputes over the South China Sea.'b'All of this will require innovative thinking and skillful management. If either side or the United States mishandles the relationship by attempting a diplomatic or even military shortcut, it could spell disaster for all parties. But if China and Taiwan establish a sufficient degree of mutual trust, Taiwan can remain an indispensable ally for the United States and a model for China\xe2\x80\x99s future.'b'Lafayette, La.'b'WHAT will life be like for the wives of Roman Catholic priests?'b'On Sunday, the Vatican announced the creation of the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter, a special division of the Roman Catholic Church that former Episcopal congregations and priests \xe2\x80\x94 including, notably, married priests \xe2\x80\x94 can enter together en masse. The Vatican has stressed that the allowance for married priests is merely an exception (like similar dispensations made in the past by the Vatican) and by no means a permanent condition of the priesthood. If a priest is single when he enters the ordinariate, he may not marry, nor may a married priest, in the event of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s death, remarry.'b'Nonetheless, the Roman Catholic Church is prepared to house married priests in numbers perhaps not seen since the years before 1123, when the First Lateran Council adopted canon 21, prohibiting clerical marriage.'b'Now as then, the church\xe2\x80\x99s critics and defenders are rehashing arguments about the implications of having married priests in an institution that is otherwise wary of them. But in the midst of these debates, we should pause to ponder the environment that the priests\xe2\x80\x99 wives might expect to encounter. After all, the status of the priest\xe2\x80\x99s wife is perhaps even more strange and unsettling than that of her ordained Catholic husband.'b'While the early Christian church praised priestly chastity, it did not promulgate decisive legislation mandating priestly celibacy until the reform movement of the 11th century. At that point, the foremost purpose of priestly celibacy was to clearly distinguish and separate the priests from the laity, to elevate the status of the clergy. In this scheme, the mere presence of the priest\xe2\x80\x99s wife confounded that goal, and thus she incurred the suspicion, and quite often the loathing, of parishioners and church reformers. You can\xe2\x80\x99t help wondering what feelings she will inspire today.'b'By the time of the First Lateran Council, the priest\xe2\x80\x99s wife had become a symbol of wantonness and defilement. The reason was that during this period the nature of the host consecrated at Mass received greater theological scrutiny. Medieval theologians were in the process of determining that bread and wine, at the moment of consecration in the hands of an ordained priest at the altar, truly became the body and blood of Jesus Christ. The priest who handled the body and blood of Christ should therefore be uncontaminated lest he defile the sacred corpus.'b'The priest\xe2\x80\x99s wife was an obvious danger. Her wanton desire, suggested the 11th-century monk Peter Damian, threatened the efficacy of consecration. He chastised priests\xe2\x80\x99 wives as \xe2\x80\x9cfurious vipers who out of ardor of impatient lust decapitate Christ, the head of clerics,\xe2\x80\x9d with their lovers. According to the historian Dyan Elliott, priests\xe2\x80\x99 wives were perceived as raping the altar, a perpetration not only of the priest but also of the whole Christian community.'b'The priest\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear family was also seen as a risk to the stability of the church. His children represented a threat to laypersons, who feared that their endowments might be absorbed into the hands of the priest\xe2\x80\x99s offspring to create a rival clerical dynasty. A celibate priest would thus ensure donations from the neighboring landed aristocracy. Furthermore, the priest\xe2\x80\x99s wife was often accused, along with her children, of draining the church\xe2\x80\x99s resources with her extravagance and frivolity. Pope Leo IX attempted to remedy this problem in the 11th century by decreeing that the wives and children of priests must serve in his residence at the Lateran Palace in Rome.'b'Given this history, I caution the clerical wife to be on guard as she enters her role as a sacerdotal attach\xc3\xa9. Her position is an anomalous one and, as the Vatican has repeatedly insisted, one that will not receive permanent welcome in the church. That said, for the time being, it will be prudent for the Vatican to honor the dignity of the wives and children of its freshly ordained married priests. And here, I suggest, a real conversation about the continuation of priestly celibacy might begin.'b'Until then, priests\xe2\x80\x99 wives should beware a religious tradition that views them, in the words of Damian, as \xe2\x80\x9cthe clerics\xe2\x80\x99 charmers, devil\xe2\x80\x99s choice tidbits, expellers from paradise, virus of minds, sword of soul, wolfbane to drinkers, poison to companions, material of sinning, occasion of death ... the female chambers of the ancient enemy, of hoopoes, of screech owls, of night owls, of she-wolves, of blood suckers.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There are two questions concerning Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s service at the private equity firm Bain Capital. The narrower question is: Did Bain help ailing companies and add value to the economy or did it plunder dying firms? The larger question is: Does Romney\xe2\x80\x99s success in business tell us anything about whether he would be a successful president?'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s tackle the bigger question here.'b'At first blush, business success would seem to be good preparation for political success. A C.E.O. learns to set priorities, manage organizations and hone analytic skills. But these traits are more transferable to being a mayor, which is more administrative, than to being president.'b'Moreover, for every Michael Bloomberg who successfully moves from business to politics, there is a Jon Corzine, Donald Rumsfeld, Donald Regan, Meg Whitman or Carly Fiorina \xe2\x80\x94 former executives who were either unsuccessful in political office or who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get elected in the first place. If you look back over history, you see that while business success can sensitize a politician to the realities other executives face, there\xe2\x80\x99s little correlation between business success and political success.'b'The traits that actually correlate with successful presidencies have deeper roots.'b'First, successful presidents tend to be emotionally secure. They have none of the social resentments and desperate needs that plagued men like Richard Nixon. Instead they were raised, often in an aristocratic family, with a sense that they were the natural leaders of the nation. They were infused, often at an elite prep school, with a sense of obligation and responsibility to perform public service.'b'Whether it is a George Washington, a Franklin or Theodore Roosevelt or a John F. Kennedy, this sort of president enters the White House with ease and confidence, is relatively unscathed by the criticism of the crowd, is able to separate the mask he must wear for public display from the real honest self he knows himself to be.'b'This sense of emotional security can also be found in great military leaders, like Dwight Eisenhower, and in serenely successful movie stars, like Ronald Reagan.'b'Second, great presidents tend to have superb political judgment. In his essay on this subject, Isaiah Berlin defines political judgment as \xe2\x80\x9ca capacity for integrating a vast amalgam of constantly changing, multicolored, evanescent perpetually overlapping data.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A president with political judgment has a subtle feel for the texture of his circumstance. He has a feel for where opportunities lie, what will go together and what will never go together. This implicit knowledge is developed slowly in people like Harry Truman or Lyndon Johnson who have spent decades as political insiders and who have a rich repertoire of experiences to draw on.'b'It also comes from voracious social contact. It comes to leaders who have a compulsive desire to be around people and who can harvest from a million social encounters a sense of what people want and can deliver.'b'Third, great leaders have often experienced crushing personal setbacks. This experience, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s depression or F.D.R.\xe2\x80\x99s polio, not only gives them a sense of sympathy for those who are suffering, but a personal contact with frailty. They are resilient when things go wrong. They know how dependent they are on others, how prone they are to overconfidence. They are both modest, because they have felt weakness, and aggressive, because they know how hard it is to change anything.'b'Finally, great leaders tend to have an instrumental mentality. They do not feel the office is about them. They are just God\xe2\x80\x99s temporary instrument in service of a larger cause. Lincoln felt he was God\xe2\x80\x99s instrument in preserving the union. F.D.R. felt he was an instrument to help the common man and defeat fascism.'b'This sense of being an instrument gives them an organizing purpose. It gives them a longer perspective, so they don\xe2\x80\x99t get distracted by ephemera. It means their administration marches in one direction, even though it is flexible and willing to accept incremental gains along the way.'b'In sum, great presidents are often aristocrats and experienced political insiders. They experience great setbacks. They feel the presence of God\xe2\x80\x99s hand on their every move.'b'Unfortunately, we\xe2\x80\x99re not allowed to talk about these things openly these days. We disdain elitism, political experience and explicit God-talk. Great failure is considered \xe2\x80\x9cbaggage\xe2\x80\x9d in today\xe2\x80\x99s campaign lingo.'b'Today\xe2\x80\x99s candidates have to invent bogus story lines to explain their qualifications to be president \xe2\x80\x94 that they are innocent outsiders or business whizzes. In reality, Romney\xe2\x80\x99s Bain success is largely irrelevant to the question of whether he could be a good president. The real question is whether he has picked up traits like emotional security, political judgment and an instrumental mind-set from his upbringing and the deeper experiences of life.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ll learn more about that as he confronts brutal attacks that now besiege him.'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd greed \xe2\x80\x94 you mark my words \xe2\x80\x94 will not only save Teldar Paper, but that other malfunctioning corporation called the U.S.A.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'That\xe2\x80\x99s how the fictional Gordon Gekko finished his famous \xe2\x80\x9cGreed is good\xe2\x80\x9d speech in the 1987 film \xe2\x80\x9cWall Street.\xe2\x80\x9d In the movie, Gekko got his comeuppance. But in real life, Gekkoism triumphed, and policy based on the notion that greed is good is a major reason why income has grown so much more rapidly for the richest 1 percent than for the middle class.'b'Today, however, let\xe2\x80\x99s focus on the rest of that sentence, which compares America to a corporation. This, too, is an idea that has been widely accepted. And it\xe2\x80\x99s the main plank of Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s case that he should be president: In effect, he is asserting that what we need to fix our ailing economy is someone who has been successful in business.'b'In so doing, he has, of course, invited close scrutiny of his business career. And it turns out that there is at least a whiff of Gordon Gekko in his time at Bain Capital, a private equity firm; he was a buyer and seller of businesses, often to the detriment of their employees, rather than someone who ran companies for the long haul. (Also, when will he release his tax returns?) Nor has he helped his credibility by making untenable claims about his role as a \xe2\x80\x9cjob creator.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But there\xe2\x80\x99s a deeper problem in the whole notion that what this nation needs is a successful businessman as president: America is not, in fact, a corporation. Making good economic policy isn\xe2\x80\x99t at all like maximizing corporate profits. And businessmen \xe2\x80\x94 even great businessmen \xe2\x80\x94 do not, in general, have any special insights into what it takes to achieve economic recovery.'b'Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t a national economy like a corporation? For one thing, there\xe2\x80\x99s no simple bottom line. For another, the economy is vastly more complex than even the largest private company.'b'Most relevant for our current situation, however, is the point that even giant corporations sell the great bulk of what they produce to other people, not to their own employees \xe2\x80\x94 whereas even small countries sell most of what they produce to themselves, and big countries like America are overwhelmingly their own main customers.'b'Yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s a global economy. But six out of seven American workers are employed in service industries, which are largely insulated from international competition, and even our manufacturers sell much of their production to the domestic market.'b'And the fact that we mostly sell to ourselves makes an enormous difference when you think about policy.'b'Consider what happens when a business engages in ruthless cost-cutting. From the point of view of the firm\xe2\x80\x99s owners (though not its workers), the more costs that are cut, the better. Any dollars taken off the cost side of the balance sheet are added to the bottom line.'b'But the story is very different when a government slashes spending in the face of a depressed economy. Look at Greece, Spain, and Ireland, all of which have adopted harsh austerity policies. In each case, unemployment soared, because cuts in government spending mainly hit domestic producers. And, in each case, the reduction in budget deficits was much less than expected, because tax receipts fell as output and employment collapsed.'b'Now, to be fair, being a career politician isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily a better preparation for managing economic policy than being a businessman. But Mr. Romney is the one claiming that his career makes him especially suited for the presidency. Did I mention that the last businessman to live in the White House was a guy named Herbert Hoover? (Unless you count former President George W. Bush.)'b'And there\xe2\x80\x99s also the question of whether Mr. Romney understands the difference between running a business and managing an economy.'b'Like many observers, I was somewhat startled by his latest defense of his record at Bain \xe2\x80\x94 namely, that he did the same thing the Obama administration did when it bailed out the auto industry, laying off workers in the process. One might think that Mr. Romney would rather not talk about a highly successful policy that just about everyone in the Republican Party, including him, denounced at the time.'b'But what really struck me was how Mr. Romney characterized President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s actions: \xe2\x80\x9cHe did it to try to save the business.\xe2\x80\x9d No, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t; he did it to save the industry, and thereby to save jobs that would otherwise have been lost, deepening America\xe2\x80\x99s slump. Does Mr. Romney understand the distinction?'b'America certainly needs better economic policies than it has right now \xe2\x80\x94 and while most of the blame for poor policies belongs to Republicans and their scorched-earth opposition to anything constructive, the president has made some important mistakes. But we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get better policies if the man sitting in the Oval Office next year sees his job as being that of engineering a leveraged buyout of America Inc.'b'With tensions rising over Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program,\xc2\xa0'b'the Obama administration has now warned'b' the country\xe2\x80\x99s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, that Iran\xe2\x80\x99s threat to close the Strait of Hormuz would provoke an American response. Earlier this week, international monitors confirmed that Iran has begun enriching uranium at a new underground plant. The United States and\xc2\xa0 Europe are tightening sanctions to choke off Iranian oil revenues. On Wednesday, 'b'an Iranian nuclear scientist died'b' in a bomb attack en route to work, and a government newspaper signaled that 'b'the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps might retaliate'b'.'b'Many officials, experts and commentators increasingly expect some kind of military confrontation. No one should want to see Iran, with its contempt for international law, acquire a nuclear weapon. But a military strike on the nuclear facilities would be a disaster.'b'We don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether any mix of sanctions and inducements could persuade Tehran to abandon its nuclear ambitions. There is another option besides force: negotiations with the United States and other major powers over curbing Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program in exchange for ending sanctions and diplomatic isolation. Iran\xe2\x80\x99s fractured leadership so far has not committed to serious talks, but President Obama and his allies have not paid enough attention to that alternative.'b'The United Nations Security Council demanded that Iran stop enriching uranium more than five years ago. Iran claims it only wants access to nuclear technology for electricity and other peaceful purposes. But that excuse is hollow. The major powers have said that power generation would be guaranteed if Iran abandons its weapons ambitions. Instead, Iran is still enriching uranium and mastering other technologies that would allow it 'b'to build a nuclear weapon'b'. According to 'b'the latest report from United Nations inspectors'b', Iran has created computer models of nuclear explosions, conducted experiments on nuclear triggers and completed advanced research on a warhead that could be delivered by a medium-range missile.'b'An accelerating covert campaign of assassinations, bombings, cyberattacks and defections \xe2\x80\x94 carried out mainly by Israel, 'b'according to The Times'b' \xe2\x80\x94 is slowing the program, but whether that is enough is unclear.'b'Economic pressure could be more effective if the United Nations Security Council ratcheted up its existing sanctions. A new round has been delayed by opposition from Russia and China. The United States and Europe have been imposing their own penalties, and 'b'Tehran\xe2\x80\x99s recent threat to shut the Strait of Hormuz'b', gateway to one-fifth of the world\xe2\x80\x99s oil trade, is an obvious sign of its growing economic desperation.'b'A new United States law that would penalize foreign companies that do business with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s central bank \xe2\x80\x94 which they must do to buy Iranian oil \xe2\x80\x94 and an oil embargo that European Union foreign ministers plan to approve on Jan. 23 could have an even bigger impact. The Obama administration and European officials seem likely to phase in these sanctions in a way that limits the damage to the world economy. 'b'On Thursday, Japan pledged to buy less Iranian oil'b', China and South Korea were looking for alternative suppliers, and India\xe2\x80\x99s intent was unclear. Tehran is more likely to respond if all the major importers apply pressure together.'b'The Americans and Europeans are working with Turkey to set up a new round of negotiations with Iran in Istanbul. The Iranians need to know that the economic pressure will not let up until they stop the nuclear program.'b'In the 'b'case'b' of Cheryl Perich, a teacher fired by a church-run school, 'b'the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday'b' that the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s protection of religious freedom bars her from suing the church under federal workplace discrimination law.'b'Ms. Perich had gotten sick and missed a term of teaching. When the school asked her to resign, she refused and threatened to sue. The school fired her, saying church policy required that it resolve the dispute internally. She sued for retaliation.'b'For the first time, the court found that a \xe2\x80\x9cministerial exception\xe2\x80\x9d to employment discrimination laws applied to her as a church employee, who had \xe2\x80\x9ca role in conveying the church\xe2\x80\x99s message and carrying out its mission.\xe2\x80\x9d In his opinion for the unanimous court, Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. seems to minimize the scope of the ruling by avoiding \xe2\x80\x9ca rigid formula for deciding when an employee qualifies as a minister\xe2\x80\x9d and by not saying how the exception would apply in other circumstances.'b'Although the court does not provide much guidance on how to proceed in future lawsuits against churches as employers, the ruling has broad sweep. It abandons the court\xe2\x80\x99s longtime practice of 'b'balancing'b' the interest in the free exercise of religion against important government interests, like protection against workplace bias or retaliation. With a balancing test, courts consider whether a general law, if applied to a religious institution, would inhibit its freedom more broadly than justified and, in those circumstances, courts could exempt the church.'b'In her 'b'brief'b', Ms. Perich warned that expanding the ministerial exception to include workers like her would allow a religious organization, for example, to retaliate against a teacher for reporting sexual abuse of a student to the government.'b'The chief justice dismissed that argument as one of an unwarranted \xe2\x80\x9cparade of horribles,\xe2\x80\x9d but his opinion provides no indication of how the teacher could fight back. While a footnote says the ministerial exception does not bar courts from considering cases like Ms. Perich\xe2\x80\x99s, the exception\xe2\x80\x99s categorical nature is powerful. The court rejected the plea of the government to include only those with \xe2\x80\x9cexclusively religious functions\xe2\x80\x9d and does not limit the exception to ministers, priests, rabbis or other religious leaders.'b'Ms. Perich spent most of her time teaching nonreligious subjects with about a sixth of her time on religion classes, so the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit 'b'concluded'b' that she was not a ministerial worker and that she could sue. In overturning that decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the question could not be \xe2\x80\x9cresolved by a stopwatch\xe2\x80\x9d and that Ms. Perich\xe2\x80\x99s limited teaching about religion helped qualify her as a minister.'b'The court\xe2\x80\x99s conception of the ministerial role is more encompassing than it has been defined by state and federal appellate courts. Its sweeping deference to churches does not serve them or society wisely.'b'With federal campaigns already knee-deep in a new era of laissez-faire money, the Republican National Committee has brazenly proposed the ultimate step \xe2\x80\x94 that the 105-year-old ban on direct corporation contributions to candidates and parties be scrapped as unconstitutional.'b'The Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s misguided 'b'Citizens United decision'b' did damage enough to fair elections by freeing corporations to make unlimited donations to supposedly independent campaign expenditure groups. But the court said nothing about the basic 1907 reform law \xe2\x80\x94 enacted after the robber baron scandals \xe2\x80\x94 that bans corporate donors from wooing candidates directly with largess.'b'The R.N.C., in a brief filed in federal court in Virginia, would effectively spike that law by freeing candidates to solicit what could amount to a million-dollar-plus donation from any corporation seeking clout. The result would dash the anticorruption restrictions on candidates\xe2\x80\x99 money seeking under 'b'the McCain-Feingold law'b', inviting a blizzard of money and favors directly between donors and politicians.'b'Republicans argue that the logic of Citizens United points toward scrapping the ban on direct corporate giving. This was the muddled reasoning of a federal district judge who overreached last year from the Supreme Court decision. The R.N.C. aimed to keep that possibility alive in the current appeal by filing a brief in opposition to the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s defense of corporate restrictions.'b'Crucial to the R.N.C. position is having its own coffers keep pace with the new boom in corporate donations to \xe2\x80\x9cindependent\xe2\x80\x9d so-called super PACs unleashed by Citizens United that do the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 dirty work. \xe2\x80\x9cTraditional political parties and candidate committees are in danger of having their voices drowned out,\xe2\x80\x9d the R.N.C. wailed.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA symphony must be like the world,\xe2\x80\x9d advised Gustav Mahler, who composed nine symphonies across a brilliant career. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must contain everything.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Little could Mahler, a century gone from the modern world, have anticipated the horrific intrusion of an incessant cellphone ring near the end of his ethereal 90-minute masterpiece, the Ninth.

He stopped the orchestra and turned, 'b'one witness said'b', and sternly asked the offender: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you finished?\xe2\x80\x9d The rage in the hall was general, according to bloggers who were there. \xe2\x80\x9cKick him out!\xe2\x80\x9d came a shout from one music lover. \xe2\x80\x9cA thousand dollar fine!\xe2\x80\x9d demanded another.'b'Mr. Gilbert, a native New Yorker certainly used to the world\xe2\x80\x99s run of nuisance, was masterful by all accounts in having the man snuff the phone. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll wait,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, asking warily in behalf of everyone: \xe2\x80\x9cIs it going to go off again?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The conductor was rewarded with rousing applause even before he took up the Adagio once more, marimba-free.

Fiorello H. La Guardia padlocked Times Square burlesque houses and sledge-hammered slot machines. Rudolph W. Giuliani aimed to shutter porn shops and strip joints.'b'Mr. Bloomberg has reportedly retreated from a more aggressive campaign, but his desire for a liquor crackdown recalls the high-minded misadventures of a future president. When Theodore Roosevelt was police commissioner, from 1895 to 1897, he tried to stop the sales of beer, wine and liquor on Sundays in saloons.'b'Men and women, who worked six days a week in that era, were not amused. New York State Sabbath laws already forbade attending sporting events or theater performances, or selling groceries, after 10 a.m. on Sundays; the excise laws also made it illegal to sell alcohol in bars, saloons and taverns all 24 hours of the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Day.'b'New Yorkers in droves defied that particular edict. (Sunday actually marked the barkeep\xe2\x80\x99s biggest sales day.) Saloon owners handed a bribe to precinct cops who forwarded some loot to Tammany politicians, and the city\xe2\x80\x99s thirsty could discreetly slip in the side doors of saloons. For almost 40 years, it was a popular pragmatic compromise.'b'Enter Roosevelt. Fearless and bullheaded, the new commissioner vowed to enforce the law, both to root out bribery in the Police Department and also to reunite families on Sundays. He gave speeches envisioning hard-working men picnicking with wives and children. He anticipated a drop in drunk and disorderly arrests (then the city\xe2\x80\x99s highest arrest category) and a decline in Monday hospital visits. He expected that wages saved from saloons would help feed families and pay the rent. Roosevelt soon encouraged cops to shut down the bars at the stroke of midnight on Saturday.'b'New Yorkers, during that Sahara summer of 1895, fled to Coney Island, then part of a separate city, Brooklyn. \xe2\x80\x9cThe excise law didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother us, and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother the excise law,\xe2\x80\x9d explained a police officer on Surf Avenue. People turned to harsh-tasting medicinal liquor, then sold by druggists. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you walking when you get it,\xe2\x80\x9d observed a Tammany politician. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re afraid if you lay down, you\xe2\x80\x99ll die.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Cartoons depicted Roosevelt as a Puritan in buckle-shoes walking late-night lantern watch to make sure residents were a-bed. He was also accused of being a hypocrite, since the wealthy could afford to drink at home or at private clubs or at hotels, partially exempt from the law. Critics further charged that he was trying to cleanse the city\xe2\x80\x99s vast German and Irish populations of their decadent habits and make them more \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Roosevelt vowed not to back down. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is true I may never be heard of again, but I will have kept my oath of office,\xe2\x80\x9d he once shouted at a crowd of angry Germans at City Hall. Joseph Pulitzer\xe2\x80\x99s newspaper, The New York World, called him a \xe2\x80\x9clittle tin czar.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'During the November elections in 1895, corrupt Tammany Democrats won in a landslide by campaigning against Rooseveltism and dry Sundays. Undaunted, Roosevelt lobbied the Republican-dominated legislature to pass even tougher excise laws. On April 1, 1896, the Raines Law went into effect, expanding the Sunday shut-down hours from midnight Saturday to 5 a.m. Monday, banning \xe2\x80\x9cfree lunch\xe2\x80\x9d counters, and requiring that saloon doors be kept locked and blinds raised to let police peer inside. The law also exempted hotels with 10 rooms, which could serve guests liquor with a meal 24 hours a day, seven days a week.'b'In a New York minute (actually the next few months), more than 1,000 saloons added 10 dinky rooms. Tammany building inspectors didn\xe2\x80\x99t care if some had four-foot-high ceilings or were in former coal bins. \xe2\x80\x9cTen beers and one hard-boiled egg scarcely constitute a meal,\xe2\x80\x9d complained Roosevelt, but local judges disagreed, allowing most anything to pass for food. The playwright Eugene O\xe2\x80\x99Neill once described on a saloon table \xe2\x80\x9can old desiccated ruin of dust-laden bread and mummified ham or cheese which only the drunkest yokel from the sticks\xe2\x80\x9d would ever dream of eating.'b'New York \xe2\x80\x94 already awash in illegal casinos and brothels \xe2\x80\x94 was transformed into the city that never sleeps. These Raines Law saloon-hotels could serve round the clock. Even the Metropolitan Opera added 10 bedrooms to be able to offer late-night wine. And those saloon bedrooms, located a drunken stagger from the bar, provided a haven for prostitutes and a temptation to couples who\xe2\x80\x99d had a few too many drinks. Adding 10,000 cheap beds was bound to loosen the city\xe2\x80\x99s morals.'b'Roosevelt\xe2\x80\x99s liquor crackdown backfired; so did the Raines Law. The city\xe2\x80\x99s spirit of place, what Stephen Crane once dubbed New York\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwild impulse,\xe2\x80\x9d refused to be tamed.'b'Theodore Roosevelt the reformer was deeply proud of his efforts to clean up New York but in his illustrious later days, running for governor, then for vice president, then president, he never won a majority vote in the city. Never take a beer away from a New Yorker.'b'Back in the late-1950s there was a TV show called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Millionaire\xe2\x80\x9d about a mysterious rich man, named John Beresford Tipton, who would anonymously give checks for $1 million to total strangers.'b'Usually, the recipient was a poor schlub who was over the top with joy until it turned out that the money didn\xe2\x80\x99t buy happiness. Clearly, we were all better off in our humble homes, clustered around our 14-inch TVs.'b'I am bringing this up because the current presidential race has demonstrated that a million dollars is nothing \xe2\x80\x94 'b'nothing \xe2\x80\x94 'b' these days. Nothing! A million dollars is what they give you for designing the best pantsuit on a reality TV show.'b'Now, if you want to impress people, you have to be a billionaire, for sure. There are about 400 billionaires in the United States, and, while some of them are famous, like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, many have profiles so low that their own families may not recognize them. Really, it could be the guy living down the block, if your block happened to contain a 30,000-square-foot Tudor with 10 bathrooms.'b'But even the humblest billionaire wants to be on the campaign trail this year. They\xe2\x80\x99re everywhere. Rick Santorum has Foster Friess, a mutual fund manager who likes the fact that Santorum starts the day with 50 push-ups. (\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of energy level that the Republican Party needs right now.\xe2\x80\x9d) Friess has vowed to give Santorum\xe2\x80\x99s super-sized political action committee at least a million. Which certainly is the least he could do for all that exercise.'b'Newt Gingrich\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csuper PAC\xe2\x80\x9d got $5 million from billionaire Sheldon Adelson, a casino owner, in what Adelson\xe2\x80\x99s associates said was an act of friendship. I certainly hope so, since giving money to the Gingrich-for-president effort at this point is like betting that the New York Jets will win the Super Bowl. You would think that a casino owner would know what futile acts of desperation look like.'b'Jon Huntsman\xe2\x80\x99s dad is a billionaire, which didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to help as much as you would think. (Once again: not buying happiness.) Mitt Romney is probably only a quarter-of-a-billionaire, which, in this company, is kind of the equivalent of playing the harmonica for lunch money on the street.'b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to be sure about Mitt\xe2\x80\x99s wealth because he has refused to release his tax returns. This is something every major presidential candidate in recent history has done, but so what? If every major presidential candidate in recent history jumped off the roof, would you expect Mitt to do that? How many other major presidential candidates in recent history came from the business sector? How many drove to Canada with their family dog strapped to the roof of the car? So, really, stop with the sweeping generalizations.'b'Romney does appear to have more billionaire pals than anybody \xe2\x80\x94 10 percent of all the billionaires in the country are already giving money to Mitt, including Sam Zell, Destroyer of Great Newspapers, and John Paulson, a hedge fund operator who made a killing in 2007 by betting against the housing market. Forbes, which put Paulson at No. 17 on its list of richest people in America in 2011, said he had made $4.9 billion in the preceding year.'b'People, how much TV time do you think a person like that could buy if he put his mind to it? Seriously, by September we could be seeing entire networks devoted to nothing but Mitt Romney. Every week, Mitt will solve crimes, save patients with extremely rare diseases, build a house for a deserving family, help Zooey Deschanel with her dating problems and win bids for abandoned storage lockers all around the country.'b'Not that President Obama won\xe2\x80\x99t have enough money to buy a channel of his own, if he wants one. So far, the president is behind Mitt in the billionaire donor sweepstakes, but he is still doing fine, thank you very much. So well, in fact, that a spokesman for the re-election campaign has been forced to denounce the idea that Obama will raise $1 billion. There\xe2\x80\x99s that number again.'b'All these billionaires would not be so worrisome if the Supreme Court had not totally unleashed their donation-making power in the Citizens United case. Gingrich, who 'b'loved'b' that decision, was furious when Mitt\xe2\x80\x99s rich friends chipped in to run anti-Newt ads in Iowa.'b'He declined to acknowledge that the two things had any connection whatsoever.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn fact, this particular approach, I think, has nothing to do with the Citizens United case. It has to do with a bunch of millionaires getting together to run a negative campaign, and Governor Romney refusing to call them off and refusing to be honest about it,\xe2\x80\x9d he told MSNBC.'b'Except for the part where the law that the court overturned had to do with keeping a bunch of millionaires from getting together to run a negative campaign. But, really, if they\xe2\x80\x99re only millionaires, how much harm could they do?'b''b'Last week\xe2\x80\x99s case study'b' in N.C.A.A. injustice took place at the University of North Carolina, where every sport is big time. Today, we move north to a different kind of institution, 'b'St. Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s University'b', a small Jesuit-run school in Philadelphia. With fewer than 5,000 undergraduates, St. Joe\xe2\x80\x99s doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even field a football team, but its little-engine-that-could basketball team has long been a source of pride. During the 2003-4 season, for instance, it went 27-0 in the regular season and made it to the regional final of the N.C.A.A. championship tournament.'b'In 2008, Todd O\xe2\x80\x99Brien, a 7-foot center, transferred from Bucknell, where he had played as a freshman, to St. Joe\xe2\x80\x99s. After sitting out a year, which the N.C.A.A. requires when a player switches schools, he played the next two seasons at St. Joe\xe2\x80\x99s. His coach, 'b'Phil Martelli'b', gave him plenty of playing time in his first year, but in his second year the team struggled, O\xe2\x80\x99Brien played poorly and he wound up mostly on the bench.'b'He also graduated with a major in economics. Yet because of the year he sat out, he still had a year of athletic eligibility left \xe2\x80\x94 and he still wanted to play basketball. The athletic department\xe2\x80\x99s academic advisers suggested that he delay graduation and fill his final year with courses like pottery, O\xe2\x80\x99Brien told me. He had larger ambitions, however. He wanted to get a graduate degree in public administration. St. Joe\xe2\x80\x99s didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a suitable program, but O\xe2\x80\x99Brien found one to his liking at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The basketball coaching staff there was excited to have him join the team for his final season of college basketball.'b'There was one problem, however. Even though O\xe2\x80\x99Brien was a bench warmer, Martelli, O\xe2\x80\x99Brien said, was furious when he found out the player was leaving. 'b'As O\xe2\x80\x99Brien later recounted to Sports Illustrated'b', when he told his coach that he was going to be attending Alabama-Birmingham for graduate school, Martelli responded with an expletive-laced tirade, vowing to block him from finishing his course work, and even threatening to sue him.'b'In a second meeting a few days later, according to O\xe2\x80\x99Brien and his lawyer, Martelli told him that he would either \xe2\x80\x9cbe playing at St. Joe\xe2\x80\x99s next year or not playing anywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d O\xe2\x80\x99Brien had already ascertained that there was no N.C.A.A. impediment to him playing for another school. It has a special rule for athletes like him \xe2\x80\x94 graduate students with remaining eligibility \xe2\x80\x94 allowing them to enroll in another university without having to sit out a year. The rule also states, though, that the player\xe2\x80\x99s previous school has to agree to \xe2\x80\x9crelease\xe2\x80\x9d him. St. Joe\xe2\x80\x99s, clearly acting at Martelli\xe2\x80\x99s behest, refused to sign the necessary paperwork.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s put aside the question of why college athletes usually have to sit out a year when they transfer, even though coaches can switch schools at the drop of a hat. That\xe2\x80\x99s a column for another day. Let\xe2\x80\x99s focus instead on O\xe2\x80\x99Brien\xe2\x80\x99s plight. How can a student who has graduated from one institution be prevented from participating in an extracurricular activity at a different school? How can a miffed coach\xe2\x80\x99s pique control the activities of a student who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even play for him anymore? Can a music teacher who is angry at a violin student prevent him from playing in another school\xe2\x80\x99s orchestra? The very idea is absurd. Why is it any less absurd when the student is an athlete? Why is it any less wrong? Yet that is precisely what the N.C.A.A.\xe2\x80\x99s rules make possible.'b'And which it then reinforces with its own iron fist. Unable to persuade St. Joe\xe2\x80\x99s to change its mind, O\xe2\x80\x99Brien appealed to the N.C.A.A. Did the N.C.A.A., which purports to care about the welfare of its \xe2\x80\x9cstudent-athletes,\xe2\x80\x9d take stern action against St. Joe\xe2\x80\x99s? 'b'Of course not'b'.'b'In response to O\xe2\x80\x99Brien\xe2\x80\x99s appeal, St. Joe\xe2\x80\x99s submitted a letter complaining, among other things, that his transfer was done for \xe2\x80\x9cathletic reasons\xe2\x80\x9d rather than academic ones. Though that clearly is untrue, so what if it had been? Why should his reason matter? Nevertheless, the N.C.A.A. sided with the school. An N.C.A.A. spokeswoman sent me a statement saying, \xe2\x80\x9cSt. Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s opposition was an important factor\xe2\x80\x9d in denying O\xe2\x80\x99Brien\xe2\x80\x99s request. Which only makes sense, since coaches, not athletes, are the N.C.A.A.\xe2\x80\x99s real constituency. (She also said that the N.C.A.A. would review the case again this week.) For its part, St. Joe\xe2\x80\x99s has refused to discuss the situation, citing \xe2\x80\x9cprivacy laws.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In 'b'a column in The Wall Street Journal this week'b', Mark Emmert, the N.C.A.A. president, complained about unnamed critics who were calling for players to be paid \xe2\x80\x94 'b'gee, who could he be referring to?'b' \xe2\x80\x94 and said that the N.C.A.A. had to come up with solutions \xe2\x80\x9cthat reflect our values.\xe2\x80\x9d Its real values are reflected in cases like Todd O\xe2\x80\x99Brien\xe2\x80\x99s. There are a hundred others just like his.'b'Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, a small Catholic school has disgraced itself because it won\xe2\x80\x99t stand up to its bully of a basketball coach.'b'The European Central Bank\xe2\x80\x99s cheap lending to euro-area banks may have briefly stabilized the financial markets. But the respite won\xe2\x80\x99t last. 'b'The decision by Standard &amp; Poor\xe2\x80\x99s'b' on Friday to downgrade the credit ratings of nine euro-zone countries, 'b'including France'b', Italy and Spain, should remind European leaders that their economic strategy based on austerity for all is just not working.'b'After umpteen rescue plans, Europe remains a long way from coming to grips with its mushrooming debt crisis. Greece, which negotiated a second $165 billion bailout plan with its European neighbors in October, is back on the brink of a financial collapse. Even the new technocratic Italian government, appointed in November with strong German backing to execute a policy of fiscal austerity, says it is an illusion to believe the crisis can be overcome through budget cuts alone.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot have success with my policies if the E.U.\xe2\x80\x99s policies don\xe2\x80\x99t change,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prime Minister Mario Monti of Italy in an interview in the German newspaper Die Welt, published on Wednesday.'b'Without a new infusion of financial assistance, Greece could default on a $19 billion bond payment as soon as March 20. But Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Nicolas Sarkozy, the president of France, have warned that Greece will receive additional funds only after it complies with the terms of its agreement. This includes convincing Greece\xe2\x80\x99s private creditors to accept a 50 percent writedown on some $260 billion of debt, and proceeding with draconian budget cuts that have already forced the government to raise tax rates, cut jobs and pensions and slash spending in the middle of a recession.'b'But 'b'debt relief talks have stalled'b', with hedge funds and other investors that bought the debt from French and German banks holding out for better terms. And Greece can hardly take more austerity. Its economy contracted by 5.5 percent last year, after shrinking more than 3 percent year-over-year in 2009 and 2010.'b'The economic implosion is preventing the country from meeting its fiscal commitments by reducing tax revenue and increasing expenditures on automatic programs like unemployment insurance. Despite spending cuts, Greece is likely to have a 9.6 percent budget deficit in 2011, half a percentage point above target.'b'More importantly, austerity is rending Greek society. Unemployment has mushroomed to 18 percent, with enormous social costs like rising homelessness and crime. Imposing further cuts is becoming politically untenable.'b'It is time to shift course. Although Greece is a small economy, Europe is in no shape to withstand the financial fallout of a disorderly Greek default, or its abandoning the euro. Greece is likely to need even more money than it has been promised so far. Economists think the 50 percent writedown may not be enough to return Greek debt to manageable levels. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, Greece and its weak neighbors need Europe\xe2\x80\x99s stronger economies, like Germany, to start spending more to help boost their exports.'b'Germany should realize by now that without growth its beleaguered neighbors will never be able to pay back their debts. Europe\xe2\x80\x99s problems have spiraled so far out of control that no one knows what policy mix will work. What is certain is that a single-minded obsession with austerity will only deepen the crisis.'b'Even after seven years, the photos of Army soldiers abusing detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison are an ugly black mark on the American presence in Iraq. Now there is a new scar on the country\xe2\x80\x99s reputation. 'b'Four Marines were filmed'b' urinating on what appear to be the corpses of three dead Taliban fighters in Afghanistan.'b'The scandal is inflaming anti-American sentiment in Afghanistan, where many people already think Americans disrespect Islam, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come at a worse time. President Obama has just begun to make 'b'tentative progress in starting negotiations with the Taliban'b' ahead of his pledged withdrawal of most American troops by the end of 2014. He needs help from President Hamid Karzai, and the new crisis will not help that troubled relationship.'b'On Thursday, a Taliban spokesman said the video would not derail the talks. If true, that\xe2\x80\x99s good news. But it will certainly complicate them. The video went viral on the Internet this week. It was made last year between March and September, when the Third Battalion, Second Marines was in Helmand Province, a Taliban heartland.'b'There is no question that the Taliban are brutal, including against their own people. The 1,000-man battalion lost seven men during its seven months in Helmand. But the stress of combat cannot excuse desecrating corpses \xe2\x80\x94 not to mention filming it. Such behavior is morally repugnant and suggests a breakdown in discipline.'b'It may be a war crime. 'b'The 1949 Geneva Conventions'b', which regulates armed conflict, prohibits degrading treatment of anyone who falls into enemy hands.'b'American officials and military commanders moved quickly to condemn the behavior and contain the damage. On Thursday, the Pentagon said Defense Secretary Leon Panetta called Mr. Karzai and told him \xe2\x80\x9cthe conduct depicted in the footage is utterly deplorable.\xe2\x80\x9d Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said: \xe2\x80\x9cActions like those are not only illegal but are contrary to the values of a professional military.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'They promised a full investigation by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. By Friday, 'b'the service had identified all four Marines involved'b' and had interviewed two but had not released any names. The investigation must be quick, thorough and transparent. And it must hold any Marines who committed crimes to account.'b'Administration officials and military commanders also must take a close look at what the troops are being taught about the laws of war.'b'With two years left in office, Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced ambitious plans this week 'b'to take on the city\xe2\x80\x99s powerful teachers\xe2\x80\x99 union'b' by pushing for extra pay for the best teachers and making other education reforms.'b'The package, presented in his annual 'b'State of the City'b' address, featured a proposal to increase by $20,000 the salary of any teacher rated \xe2\x80\x9chighly effective\xe2\x80\x9d for two years running by proposed teacher evaluation committees. With possible help from the private sector \xe2\x80\x94 if the teachers\xe2\x80\x99 union won\xe2\x80\x99t go along \xe2\x80\x94 he plans to offer to pay off up to $25,000 in student loans for top graduates who come to the city to teach.'b'Teachers\xe2\x80\x99 unions have traditionally resisted merit pay for individuals instead of entire schools. In this case, 'b'the United Federation of Teachers'b' should meet Mr. Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to help create a fair system for evaluating teachers to be used in providing extra pay as well as to claim more than $60 million in federal education funds that depend on having an evaluation plan in place.'b'Mr. Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s plan to limit pensions for future city employees is also a good move, but it will almost certainly put him at odds with unions for city workers.'b'Likewise, the proposal to increase the minimum wage in the state is a needed change. New York employers now pay the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour. Connecticut has a minimum of $8.25, and Massachusetts is up to $8. Mr. Bloomberg and Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker who has already championed this increase, should push to raise the minimum at least to Connecticut\xe2\x80\x99s level.'b'In response to a string of scandals at the city\xe2\x80\x99s police department, the mayor says he will add staffing for the 'b'Commission to Combat Police Corruption'b', an independent group appointed by the mayor to oversee city police investigations. More help would be a good start, but what that commission really needs is more power. He also plans to push for a state law that would allow children of illegal immigrants to compete for state-sponsored college loans, and he plans environmental improvements, including expanded recycling. It is a long wish list and will require a lot of energy, tact and political muscle.'b'In 2000, just two weeks after her fifth-grade graduation, Karla Mejia woke up with numbness on the right side of her body.

He even went so far as to suggest that such talk shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even be openly entertained. When the interviewer asked, \xe2\x80\x9cAre there no fair questions about the distribution of wealth without it being seen as envy, though?\xe2\x80\x9d Romney responded, \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s fine to talk about those things 'b'in quiet rooms'b' and discussions about tax policy and the like.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In quiet rooms?

That was up 19 percentage points from 2009.'b''b'As The New York Times pointed out'b' in regard to the report, \xe2\x80\x9cconflict between rich and poor now eclipses racial strain and friction between immigrants and the native-born as the greatest source of tension in American society.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And this has nothing to do with envy and everything to do with fairness.'b'Elizabeth Warren, who is now running for the Senate seat that Romney ran for in 1994 and didn\xe2\x80\x99t get, probably rebuts this myth of class warfare best by reframing the discussion in terms of a \xe2\x80\x9csocial contract\xe2\x80\x9d between the rich and the rest of society. At one of her campaign events,'b' she explained'b':'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nobody in this country who got rich on his own. Nobody. You built a factory out there, good for you. But, I want to be clear: you moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for. You hired workers the rest of us paid to educate. You were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory and hire someone to protect against this because of the work the rest of us did. Now look, you built a factory and it turned into something terrific or a great idea. God bless. Keep a big hunk of it. But part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That is the corporate Contract With America: societal symbiosis. We create a society in which smart, hard-working people can be safe and prosper, and they in turn reinvest a fair share of that prosperity back into society for posterity.'b'Everyone benefits.'b'But somewhere along the way this got lost. Greed got good. The rich wanted all of the societal benefits and none of the societal responsibilities. They got addicted to seeing profits go up and taxes go down, by any means necessary, no matter the damage to the individual or the collective. Those Maseratis weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to pay for themselves.'b'And the resulting income inequality helped to stall economic mobility.'b'As 'b'The New York Times reported last week'b', \xe2\x80\x9cmany researchers have reached a conclusion that turns conventional wisdom on its head: Americans enjoy less economic mobility than their peers in Canada and much of Western Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d The Times report speculated that: \xe2\x80\x9cOne reason for the mobility gap may be the depth of American poverty, which leaves poor children starting especially far behind. Another may be the unusually large premiums that American employers pay for college degrees. Since children generally follow their parents\xe2\x80\x99 educational trajectory, that premium increases the importance of family background and stymies people with less schooling.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Indeed, a November report by the Pew Charitable Trusts\xe2\x80\x99 Economic Mobility Project pointed out, \xe2\x80\x9cIn the United States, there is a stronger link between parental education and children\xe2\x80\x99s economic, educational, and socio-emotional outcomes than in any other country investigated.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Pew has found that most children raised at the top of the income spectrum stay there and most raised at the bottom stay at the bottom.'b'An equal opportunity to success is central to this country\xe2\x80\x99s optimistic ethos, but income inequality and corporate greed are making a lie of that most basic American truism. The rich and their handmaidens on the political right have consolidated America\xe2\x80\x99s wealth on the ever-narrowing peak of a steep hill and greased the slope. And they want to cast everyone at the bottom as lazy or jealous, without acknowledging the accident of birth and collusion of policies that helped grant them their perch.'b'Income inequality is a threat to this country and the middle class that made her great. If Romney wants to be president, he needs to understand that.'b'As Alan Krueger, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, 'b'said on Thursday'b', \xe2\x80\x9cI think it is clear that we can\xe2\x80\x99t go back to the type of policies that exacerbated the rise in inequality and threatened economic mobility in the first place if we want an economy that builds the middle class.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Not envy Mr. Romney. Opportunity.'b'ZIMBABWE is fast approaching a dangerous tipping point. Last month, its ailing octogenarian president, Robert Mugabe, angrily defied his critics, calling for early elections in 2012. If a political settlement with Zimbabwe\xe2\x80\x99s security chiefs is not negotiated before the vote, Mr. Mugabe will no doubt rely on them to once again begin a campaign of intimidation and violence, leading to sham elections that could precipitate a regional crisis.'b'To prevent this, the international community \xe2\x80\x94 in concert with African regional organizations \xe2\x80\x94 must push for a deal that allows Mr. Mugabe\xe2\x80\x99s coterie of security men to leave the political scene in a peaceful fashion.'b'Although it is difficult to swallow from a human rights perspective, any deal will have to grant the security chiefs immunity from prosecution and permit them to keep a sizable portion of their wealth.'b'The current power-sharing government between Mr. Mugabe and the opposition prime minister, Morgan Tsvangirai, has brought relative calm and economic stability to Zimbabwe since its formation in early 2009. However, the far from united \xe2\x80\x9cunity government\xe2\x80\x9d has failed to make any meaningful progress on the issue of how to deal with the so-called securocrats. Addressing this thorny question is the key to a peaceful democratic transition in Zimbabwe. \xc2\xa0'b'Over the past decade, the Joint Operations Command \xe2\x80\x94 Zimbabwe\xe2\x80\x99s supreme security council \xe2\x80\x94 has orchestrated violent campaigns to guarantee Mr. Mugabe victory in successive elections, culminating in the 2008 crisis. After the opposition\xe2\x80\x99s initial success in the 2008 elections, the J.O.C. began a brutal campaign of violence that left more than 200 people dead and forced Mr. Tsvangirai to withdraw from the poll. Little has changed since then.'b'Although the power-sharing agreement contained several opaque references to security reform, the only progress has been cosmetic because Mr. Mugabe, his ZANU-PF party, and the J.O.C. continue to unilaterally decide security matters and use security agencies for political purposes.'b'In anticipation of coming elections, the military has reportedly already deployed to rural areas to coerce people to vote for Mr. Mugabe.'b'But a careful balance of carrots and sticks could persuade Mr. Mugabe and the securocrats to accept a deal. Headed by the South African president, Jacob Zuma, the South African Development Community has been negotiating with Zimbabwe on a \xe2\x80\x9croad map\xe2\x80\x9d to free and fair elections.'b'The African Union, the United Nations, the United States and the European Union must pressure Mr. Zuma and the S.A.D.C. not to countenance elections without a deal that ensures the retirement of the securocrats.'b'The prospect of lifting existing targeted sanctions and promises of robust financial assistance would give Mr. Mugabe and his henchmen strong incentives to make a deal. If they remain obstinate, Zimbabwe\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors should consider taking punitive measures, including economic sanctions.'b'As Mr. Mugabe\xe2\x80\x99s health continues to falter and political pressure from neighboring countries increases, many of the security officials surrounding Mr. Mugabe are looking for a safe exit. They oppose a settlement mainly because they fear prosecution and losing access to political patronage networks through which they accrue their wealth.'b'A successful negotiated solution must therefore include two key \xe2\x80\x9csunset clauses\xe2\x80\x9d for the securocrats: immunity from prosecution for political crimes and assurances that they could keep enough of their accumulated wealth to live comfortably for the rest of their lives.'b'With elections this year increasingly likely, the window of opportunity for the international community to prevent another round of bloody elections in Zimbabwe is rapidly closing.'b'Granting amnesty and affluence to egregious human rights abusers may seem like an unpalatable trade-off, but it is the only viable avenue to securing a full and peaceful democratic transition in Zimbabwe.'b'SOLITUDE is out of fashion. Our\xc2\xa0companies, our schools and our culture are in thrall to an idea I call the New Groupthink, which holds that creativity and achievement come from an oddly gregarious place. Most of us now work in teams, in offices without walls, for managers who prize people skills above all. Lone geniuses are out. Collaboration is in.\xc2\xa0'b'But there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem with this view. Research strongly suggests that people are more creative when they enjoy privacy and freedom from interruption. And the most spectacularly creative people in many fields are often introverted, according to studies by the psychologists Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Gregory Feist. They\xe2\x80\x99re extroverted enough to exchange and advance ideas, but see themselves as independent and individualistic. They\xe2\x80\x99re not joiners by nature.'b'One explanation for these findings is that introverts are comfortable working alone \xe2\x80\x94 and solitude is a catalyst to innovation. As the influential psychologist Hans Eysenck observed, introversion fosters creativity by \xe2\x80\x9cconcentrating the mind on the tasks in hand, and preventing the dissipation of energy on social and sexual matters unrelated to work.\xe2\x80\x9d In other words, a person sitting quietly under a tree in the backyard, while everyone else is clinking glasses on the patio, is more likely to have an apple land on his head. (Newton was one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s great introverts: William Wordsworth described him as \xe2\x80\x9cA mind for ever/ Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'Solitude has long been associated with creativity and transcendence. \xe2\x80\x9cWithout great solitude, no serious work is possible,\xe2\x80\x9d Picasso said. A central narrative of many religions is the seeker \xe2\x80\x94 Moses, Jesus, Buddha \xe2\x80\x94 who goes off by himself and brings profound insights back to the community.'b'Culturally, we\xe2\x80\x99re often so dazzled by charisma that we overlook the quiet part of the creative process. Consider Apple. In the wake of Steve Jobs\xe2\x80\x99s death, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a profusion of myths about the company\xe2\x80\x99s success. Most focus on Mr. Jobs\xe2\x80\x99s supernatural magnetism and tend to ignore the other crucial figure in Apple\xe2\x80\x99s creation: a kindly, introverted engineering wizard, Steve Wozniak, who toiled alone on a beloved invention, the personal computer.'b'Rewind to March 1975: Mr. Wozniak believes the world would be a better place if everyone had a user-friendly computer. This seems a distant dream \xe2\x80\x94 most computers are still the size of minivans, and many times as pricey. But Mr. Wozniak meets a simpatico band of engineers that call themselves the Homebrew Computer Club. The Homebrewers are excited about a primitive new machine called the Altair 8800. Mr. Wozniak is inspired, and immediately begins work on his own magical version of a computer. Three months later, he unveils his amazing creation for his friend, Steve Jobs. Mr. Wozniak wants to give his invention away free, but Mr. Jobs persuades him to co-found Apple Computer.'b'The story of Apple\xe2\x80\x99s origin speaks to the power of collaboration. Mr. Wozniak wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been catalyzed by the Altair but for the kindred spirits of Homebrew. And he\xe2\x80\x99d never have started Apple without Mr. Jobs.'b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s also a story of solo spirit. If you look at how Mr. Wozniak got the work done \xe2\x80\x94 the sheer hard work of creating something from nothing \xe2\x80\x94 he did it alone. Late at night, all by himself.'b'Intentionally so. In his memoir, Mr. Wozniak offers this guidance to aspiring inventors:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMost inventors and engineers I\xe2\x80\x99ve met are like me ... they live in their heads. They\xe2\x80\x99re almost like artists. In fact, the very best of them are artists. And artists work best alone .... I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give you some advice that might be hard to take. That advice is: Work alone... Not on a committee. Not on a team.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And yet. The New Groupthink has overtaken our workplaces, our schools and our religious institutions. Anyone who has ever needed noise-canceling headphones in her own office or marked an online calendar with a fake meeting in order to escape yet another real one knows what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about. Virtually all American workers now spend time on teams and some 70 percent inhabit open-plan offices, in which no one has \xe2\x80\x9ca room of one\xe2\x80\x99s own.\xe2\x80\x9d During the last decades, the average amount of space allotted to each employee shrank 300 square feet, from 500 square feet in the 1970s to 200 square feet in 2010.'b'Our schools have also been transformed by the New Groupthink. Today, elementary school classrooms are commonly arranged in pods of desks, the better to foster group learning. Even subjects like math and creative writing are often taught as committee projects. In one fourth-grade classroom I visited in New York City, students engaged in group work were forbidden to ask a question unless every member of the group had the very same question.'b'The New Groupthink also shapes some of our most influential religious institutions. Many mega-churches feature extracurricular groups organized around every conceivable activity, from parenting to skateboarding to real estate, and expect worshipers to join in. They also emphasize a theatrical style of worship \xe2\x80\x94 loving Jesus out loud, for all the congregation to see. \xe2\x80\x9cOften the role of a pastor seems closer to that of church cruise director than to the traditional roles of spiritual friend and counselor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam McHugh, an evangelical pastor and author of \xe2\x80\x9cIntroverts in the Church.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'SOME teamwork is fine and offers a fun, stimulating, useful way to exchange ideas, manage information and build trust.'b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to associate with a group in which each member works autonomously on his piece of the puzzle; it\xe2\x80\x99s another to be corralled into endless meetings or conference calls conducted in offices that afford no respite from the noise and gaze of co-workers. Studies show that open-plan offices make workers hostile, insecure and distracted. They\xe2\x80\x99re also more likely to suffer from high blood pressure, stress, the flu and exhaustion. And people whose work is interrupted make 50 percent more mistakes and take twice as long to finish it.'b'Many introverts seem to know this instinctively, and resist being herded together. Backbone Entertainment, a video game development company in Emeryville, Calif., initially used an open-plan office, but found that its game developers, many of whom were introverts, were unhappy. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was one big warehouse space, with just tables, no walls, and everyone could see each other,\xe2\x80\x9d recalled Mike Mika, the former creative director. \xe2\x80\x9cWe switched over to cubicles and were worried about it \xe2\x80\x94 you\xe2\x80\x99d think in a creative environment that people would hate that. But it turns out they prefer having nooks and crannies they can hide away in and just be away from everybody.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Privacy also makes us productive. In a fascinating study known as the Coding War Games, consultants Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister compared the work of more than 600 computer programmers at 92 companies. They found that people from the same companies performed at roughly the same level \xe2\x80\x94 but that there was an enormous performance gap between organizations. What distinguished programmers at the top-performing companies wasn\xe2\x80\x99t greater experience or better pay. It was how much privacy, personal workspace and freedom from interruption they enjoyed. Sixty-two percent of the best performers said their workspace was sufficiently private compared with only 19 percent of the worst performers. Seventy-six percent of the worst programmers but only 38 percent of the best said that they were often interrupted needlessly.'b'Solitude can even help us learn. According to research on expert performance by the psychologist Anders Ericsson, the best way to master a field is to work on the task that\xe2\x80\x99s most demanding for you personally. And often the best way to do this is alone. Only then, Mr. Ericsson told me, can you \xe2\x80\x9cgo directly to the part that\xe2\x80\x99s challenging to you. If you want to improve, you have to be the one who generates the move. Imagine a group class \xe2\x80\x94 you\xe2\x80\x99re the one generating the move only a small percentage of the time.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Conversely, brainstorming sessions are one of the worst possible ways to stimulate creativity. The brainchild of a charismatic advertising executive named Alex Osborn who believed that groups produced better ideas than individuals, workplace brainstorming sessions came into vogue in the 1950s. \xe2\x80\x9cThe quantitative results of group brainstorming are beyond question,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Osborn wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cOne group produced 45 suggestions for a home-appliance promotion, 56 ideas for a money-raising campaign, 124 ideas on how to sell more blankets.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But decades of research show that individuals almost always perform better than groups in both quality and quantity, and group performance gets worse as group size increases. The \xe2\x80\x9cevidence from science suggests that business people must be insane to use brainstorming groups,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote the organizational psychologist Adrian Furnham. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have talented and motivated people, they should be encouraged to work alone when creativity or efficiency is the highest priority.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The reasons brainstorming fails are instructive for other forms of group work, too. People in groups tend to sit back and let others do the work; they instinctively mimic others\xe2\x80\x99 opinions and lose sight of their own; and, often succumb to peer pressure. The Emory University neuroscientist Gregory Berns found that when we take a stance different from the group\xe2\x80\x99s, we activate the amygdala, a small organ in the brain associated with the fear of rejection. Professor Berns calls this \xe2\x80\x9cthe pain of independence.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The one important exception to this dismal record is electronic brainstorming, where large groups outperform individuals; and the larger the group the better. The protection of the screen mitigates many problems of group work. This is why the Internet has yielded such wondrous collective creations. Marcel Proust called reading a \xe2\x80\x9cmiracle of communication in the midst of solitude,\xe2\x80\x9d and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the Internet is, too. It\xe2\x80\x99s a place where we can be alone together \xe2\x80\x94 and this is precisely what gives it power.'b'MY point is not that man is an island. Life is meaningless without love, trust and friendship.'b'And I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that we abolish teamwork. Indeed, recent studies suggest that influential academic work is increasingly conducted by teams rather than by individuals. (Although teams whose members collaborate remotely, from separate universities, appear to be the most influential of all.) The problems we face in science, economics and many other fields are more complex than ever before, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll need to stand on one another\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders if we can possibly hope to solve them.'b'But even if the problems are different, human nature remains the same. And most humans have two contradictory impulses: we love and need one another, yet we crave privacy and autonomy.'b'To harness the energy that fuels both these drives, we need to move beyond the New Groupthink and embrace a more nuanced approach to creativity and learning. Our offices should encourage casual, cafe-style interactions, but allow people to disappear into personalized, private spaces when they want to be alone. Our schools should teach children to work with others, but also to work on their own for sustained periods of time. And we must recognize that introverts like Steve Wozniak need extra quiet and privacy to do their best work.'b'Before Mr. Wozniak started Apple, he designed calculators at Hewlett-Packard, a job he loved partly because HP made it easy to chat with his colleagues. Every day at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., management wheeled in doughnuts and coffee, and people could socialize and swap ideas. What distinguished these interactions was how low-key they were. For Mr. Wozniak, collaboration meant the ability to share a doughnut and a brainwave with his laid-back, poorly dressed colleagues \xe2\x80\x94 who minded not a whit when he disappeared into his cubicle to get the real work done.'b'IN the fall of 1970 I arrived at Minor White\xe2\x80\x99s house for a live-in workshop. My first task was to organize his photography library. I was mesmerized by the unforgettable images. Photography has had a relatively short history, and I was struck by the fact that most of the practitioners were anonymous and unknown except to a minuscule circle. Unconsciously I must have started to dream of changing that fact, and widening that circle. More than four decades later, this work is the fruition of that dream.'b'The saga began in 1988 when Peter Howe, the picture editor at Life magazine at the time, asked me to photograph the \xe2\x80\x9cgrandes dames of photography,\xe2\x80\x9d influential figures like Berenice Abbott, Barbara Morgan, Louise Dahl-Wolfe and Ruth Bernhard. In the middle of the shootings I began to feel that Mr. Howe was exercising reverse sexism, by excluding the \xe2\x80\x9cold boys,\xe2\x80\x9d and so he gave me a green light to photograph Aaron Siskind, Harry Callahan, Manuel \xc3\x81lvarez Bravo, Andreas Feininger, Alfred Eisenstaedt and others; I was on my way.'b'This project has now taken more than 20 years. Photographers are never satisfied, always wanting more. This is true for the photographers pictured here, and true of me as well \xe2\x80\x94 always hungry for visual experience and for those rare delicacies, those few shots that, out of all the miles of exposed film, are worth printing. And now we need to add those gigabytes of digitally exposed material, and the challenge remains the same. Always easy to snap the shutter, never easy to get an image.'b'Practicing photography for more than 40 years, I have become aware of how seldom a photograph \xe2\x80\x94 a truly successful photograph \xe2\x80\x94 is made. How easy it is to click the shutter, and how nearly impossible to seize something significant through that act. The clicks that have mattered, historically speaking, were so few and far between, even for the masters. I became intrigued with somehow following the trail and breathing the air of those who had been graced with more than one \xe2\x80\x9ckeeper.\xe2\x80\x9d It became a challenge and a quest to meet and make images of the image makers. Many graciously collaborated in the process, while others were less enthused (the attitude is impressed on the film; maybe you can spot them).'b'Princeton, N.J.'b'ECONOMIC 'b'malaise'b' and political sloganeering have contributed to the increasingly loud conversation about the coming crisis of old-age care: the depletion of the 'b'Social Security'b' trust fund, the ever rising cost of 'b'Medicare'b', the end of defined-benefit pensions, the stagnation of 'b'401(k)\xe2\x80\x99s'b'. News accounts suggest that overstretched and insufficient public services are driving adult children \xe2\x80\x9cback\xe2\x80\x9d toward caring for dependent parents.'b'Such accounts often draw on a deeply sentimental view of the past. Once upon a time, the story line goes, family members cared for one another naturally within households, in an organic and unplanned process. But this portrait is too rosy. If we confront what old-age support once looked like \xe2\x80\x94 what actually happened when care was almost fully privatized, when the old depended on their families, without the bureaucratic structures and the (under)paid caregivers we take for granted \xe2\x80\x94 a different picture emerges.'b'For the past decade I have been researching cases of family conflict over old-age care in the decades before Social Security. I have found extraordinary testimony about the intimate management of family care: how the old negotiated with the young for what they called retirement, and the exertions of caregiving at a time when support by relatives was the only sustenance available for the old.'b'In that world, older people could not rely on habit or culture or nature if they wanted their children to support them when they became frail. In an America strongly identified with economic and physical mobility, parents had to offer inducements. Usually, the bait they used was the promise of an inheritance: stay and take care of me and your mother, and someday you will get the house and the farm or the store or the bank account.'b'But of course what was at stake was never just an economic bargain between rational actors. Older people negotiated with the young to receive love, to be cared for with affection, not just self-interest.'b'The bargains that were negotiated were often unstable and easily undone. Life expectancies were considerably lower than they are now, but even so, old age could easily stretch for decades. Of course, disease, injury, disability, 'b'dementia'b', insanity, incontinence \xe2\x80\x94 not to mention sudden death \xe2\x80\x94 were commonplace, too. Wills would be left unwritten, deeds unconveyed, promises unfulfilled, because of the onset of dementia or the meddling of siblings. Or property was conveyed too early, and then the older person would be at the mercy of a child who no longer \xe2\x80\x9ccared\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 or who could not deal with the work of care.'b'Consider one story, drawn from a court case in New Jersey that ended in 1904. George H. Slack had been a carpenter and a contractor in Trenton, living in a house with his wife, their daughter, Ella Rees, and her husband and daughter.'b'According to witnesses, the father\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'syphilis'b' had eroded his capacity to conduct business. He was not insane or incompetent, but he was increasingly deaf and uninterested in the world. According to one son, his father had become \xe2\x80\x9ccranky and hard to get along with, and he would go into the stable and flog the horses until the neighbors would interfere.\xe2\x80\x9d He was \xe2\x80\x9cdrowsy and sleepy all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d He was gluttonous and depressed and didn\xe2\x80\x99t clean himself, the son remembered; the family \xe2\x80\x9chad to force him to wash himself, he was so dirty.\xe2\x80\x9d The other son recalled that Ella had difficulty \xe2\x80\x9cgetting him to change his underwear.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Sometime in 1899 or 1900, Ella and her family moved to a house nearby. One brother claimed that their father had ordered her out of the home, but Ella insisted she had left because she could not take it any longer. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mother was insane,\xe2\x80\x9d she later recalled, \xe2\x80\x9cand I could not get along with her.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What \xe2\x80\x9cinsane\xe2\x80\x9d meant to her is impossible to reconstruct in modern diagnostic terms. But in November 1901, Ella\xe2\x80\x99s mother wandered away from the house. She began to walk north along the Delaware River. Eventually, she was found in the river\xe2\x80\x99s cold water by a trapper. She was taken to a farmhouse where her clothes were dried and she was given something warm to drink. And then she was taken back to Trenton.'b'Ella returned briefly to care for her mother, but on Christmas Eve, Ella\xe2\x80\x99s own daughter became ill, and, as she put it, \xe2\x80\x9cI was called home\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 that is, to her own house. When she left, her father told her that \xe2\x80\x9cyou will move back home with me again.\xe2\x80\x9d But she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Father, the way Ma\xe2\x80\x99s mind is no one can get along with her here, she knows she\xe2\x80\x99s boss, and no one can get along with her, and I cannot come back here.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At that point, Mr. Slack promised his daughter, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you will come home, I will deed my property to you.\xe2\x80\x9d He said his Civil War pension would be enough to live on. But Ella was unswayed. \xe2\x80\x9cI said I wanted them to live and enjoy all they had,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'Though she would not move back in with her parents, even with a promise of property, she did come back two or three times a week to clean house and provide care. But then, in spite of her resolve, her mother \xe2\x80\x9cgot so bad,\xe2\x80\x9d Ella said later, that she had to move back. Finally, in the early summer of 1902, her mother was placed in the Trenton Asylum for the Insane, where she died on Aug. 10, 1902.'b'On the day of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s death, Mr. Slack left his home and moved in with Ella. Two days later, he collapsed in her bathroom. He rallied and called for doctors and for a lawyer to draft deeds that transferred his property to Ella. That done, in two days he was dead.'b'At her father\xe2\x80\x99s funeral, Ella\xe2\x80\x99s brothers asked if she knew about the property their father had left. She said that Pa had told her not to say anything until after the funeral. Her brothers pressed her, and she told them that the property had been left to her. One brother asked her if she \xe2\x80\x9cthought that was right.\xe2\x80\x9d She replied that it was \xe2\x80\x94 because, as she later recounted, \xe2\x80\x9cI had stayed home and sacrificed all my life for them.\xe2\x80\x9d The brother told her \xe2\x80\x9cthen and there\xe2\x80\x9d that he would fight her in court, she later testified.'b'SO much has changed since the early 20th century in the physical, economic and familial lives of older people, as well as in the work lives of their adult children, particularly women. We live in vastly different ways than Mr. Slack\xe2\x80\x99s family did. Our moral and relational expectations have changed as well. Everyone who studies old-age care concludes that family members still do a great deal. Yet the care they offer is typically enmeshed with and dependent on bureaucracies and on the labor of others: home health care attendants, hospital orderlies and 'b'hospice'b' aides, many of whom are recent immigrants. To provide care as a middle- or upper-class family member is ordinarily to manage or help manage the care for a disabled or aging parent, not the work of cleaning bedsheets, helping a parent into a bathtub, changing a diaper.'b'Comparisons between the present and even the not-so-distant past are always awkward and incomplete. Still, stories like that of Ella Rees challenge an easy celebration of family care and household intimacy in an imagined past. When 19th- and early 20th-century family members negotiated with one another around needs and care, the outcomes were only occasionally happy. Their insular world was a very dark world for old-age care, because there was so little support beyond blood relations.'b'Dependency and disability still confront us as facts of life. There is little happiness in the inevitable but unpredictable decline that awaits all of us. And many younger people still experience themselves as trapped by a sense of duty to care for older relatives. Yet few of us are trapped as Ella Rees was. Our traps are different, often of our own making, and incorporate the work of others.'b'We may not love the bureaucracies and the institutions that shape our lives today. But would many of us really want to live in a world without them?'b'AS Egyptians and Tunisians vote to replace ousted despots and the Syrian government teeters on the brink, two old imperial powers are competing to exert their political influence over Arab countries in upheaval. And they are not America and Russia. After years of cold-war competition over the Middle East and North Africa, it is now France and Turkey that are vying for lucrative business ties and the chance to mold a new generation of leaders in lands that they once controlled.'b'This rivalry is nothing new. Since Napoleon invaded Egypt in 1798, France and Turkey have competed for dominance in the Middle East. France\xe2\x80\x99s rise as a Mediterranean power has been an inverse function of Turkish decline around the same sea. As the Ottoman Empire gradually collapsed, France acquired Algeria, Tunisia and, temporarily, Egypt. The French took one final bite from the dying empire by securing control over Syria and Lebanon after World War I.'b'This rivalry subsided in the 20th century, when Turkey became an inward-looking nation state. During the era of decolonization, France lost political control of lands extending from Morocco in the west to Syria in the east. Paris, however, maintained economic and political clout in the region by supporting large French businesses, which established lucrative ties with the region\xe2\x80\x99s rulers. Even Turkey once looked to France as a model: when Mustafa Kemal Ataturk founded modern Turkey in 1923, he championed the French model of hard secularism, which stipulates freedom from religion in government, politics and education.'b'While France has dominated much of the region over the past two centuries, that is now changing. And if Turkey plays its cards right, it could match France\xe2\x80\x99s influence or even become the dominant power in the region.'b'In the last decade, Turkey has witnessed record-breaking economic growth. It is no longer a poor country desperately seeking accession to the European Union. It has a $1.1 trillion economy, a powerful army and aspirations to shape the region in its image. As political turmoil paralyzes North Africa, Syria and Iraq, and economic meltdown devastates much of Mediterranean Europe, Turkey and France have largely been spared. And their growing rivalry is one reason France has objected to Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s bid for European Union membership.'b'Taken together with France\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to create a European-Mediterranean Union, which Nicolas Sarkozy conceived in 2008 as a way to place France at the helm of the Mediterranean world, one thing has become obvious to the Turks: Paris won\xe2\x80\x99t allow Turkey into the European Union or let it become a powerful player in a French-led Mediterranean region.'b'Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s newly activist foreign policy has therefore shifted away from Europe. The ruling Justice and Development Party, known as the A.K.P., is now cultivating ties with former Ottoman lands that were ignored for much of the 20th century. Of the 33 new Turkish diplomatic missions opened in the past decade, 18 are in Muslim and African countries.'b'This has resulted in new commercial and political ties, often at the expense of Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s ties with Europe. In 1999, the European Union accounted for over 56 percent of Turkish trade; in 2011, it was just 41 percent. Over the same period, Islamic countries\xe2\x80\x99 share of Turkish trade climbed to 20 percent from 12 percent.'b'New trade patterns have led to the emergence of a more socially conservative business elite based in central Turkey, which derives strength from trading beyond Europe and is using its new wealth to push for a redefinition of Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s traditional approach to secularism. Since 2002, Ataturk\xe2\x80\x99s French-inspired model has collapsed; the A.K.P. and its allies have instead promoted a softer form of secularism that allows for more religious expression in government, politics and education. This has made the Turkish model appealing to Arab countries, which for the most part regard French-style secularism as anathema.'b'Although both countries once coddled dictators \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Sarkozy allowed Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi to occupy central Paris and pitch a tent near the \xc3\x89lys\xc3\xa9e Palace in 2007, and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan accepted the Qaddafi international prize in 2010 \xe2\x80\x94 Turkey threw its support behind the Arab revolts early on, winning fans across the region.'b'Until it backed Libya\xe2\x80\x99s rebels last year, France had bet on the enduring nature of dictatorships and never forged ties with the democratic forces opposing them; Turkey did so, perhaps unwittingly, by expanding its soft power into Arab countries, building business networks and founding state-of-the-art high schools, run by the Sufi Islam-inspired Gulen movement, to educate the future Arab elite. Now, the Arab Spring is providing Turkey with an unprecedented opportunity to spread its influence further in newly free Arab societies.'b'As France\xe2\x80\x99s business ties with the old secular elite fray, its influence is waning. It remains a military and cultural power, and will continue to attract Arab elites, even Islamist ones, seeking weapons and luxury goods. However, France will find it hard to market its brand of secularism across the region or match Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s grass-roots business networks, especially in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq, where Turkey already has significant clout.'b'EVEN so, the road ahead will be rocky. Turkey ruled the Arab Middle East until World War I, and it must now be careful about how its messages are perceived there. Arabs might be drawn to fellow Muslims, but like the French, the Turks are former imperial masters. Arabs are pressing for democracy, and if Turkey behaves like a new imperial power, this approach will backfire. At a recent conference at Zirve University, a gleaming private school in Gaziantep financed by the local businesses that have made Turkey a regional economic powerhouse, Arab liberals and Islamists from various countries disagreed on most matters but agreed on one thing: that Turkey is welcome in the Middle East but should not dominate it.'b'In September, when Mr. Erdogan landed at Cairo\xe2\x80\x99s new airport terminal (built by Turkish companies), he was warmly met by joyous millions, mobilized by the Muslim Brotherhood. However, he soon upset his pious hosts by preaching about the importance of a secular government that provides freedom of religion, using the Turkish word \xe2\x80\x9claiklik\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 derived from the French word for secularism. In Arabic, this term loosely translates as \xe2\x80\x9cirreligious.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Erdogan\xe2\x80\x99s message may have been partly lost in translation, yet the incident illustrates the limits of Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s influence in countries that are far more socially conservative than it is.'b'Turkey may have the upper hand in soft power, but France has more hard power, as the recent war in Libya and its veto power at the United Nations make clear. And despite Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s phenomenal growth since 2002, the French economy is over twice the size of Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s, and France is still dominant in North Africa.'b'Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s relative stability at a time when the region is in upheaval is attracting investment from less-stable neighbors like Iran, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. Ultimately, political stability and regional clout are Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s hard cash, and its economic growth will depend on both.'b'If Turkey wants to become a true beacon of democracy in the Middle East, its new constitution must provide broader individual rights for the country\xe2\x80\x99s citizens, including the Kurds. It will also need to fulfill Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu\xe2\x80\x99s vision of a \xe2\x80\x9cno problems\xe2\x80\x9d foreign policy. This means moving past the 2010 flotilla episode to rebuild strong ties with Israel and getting along with the Greek Cypriots who live on the southern part of the divided island of Cyprus (Turkish Cypriots control the north). The conflict there has lasted for decades; poorer Turkish Cypriots want a loose federation and the Greek Cypriot majority wants a strong central government.'b'The recent discovery of natural gas off the south coast of Cyprus is a major opportunity. Turkey could rise above the fray by proposing unification of the island in exchange for an agreement to share gas revenues. Such a deal, coupled with improved Turkish-Israeli ties, could facilitate cooperation in extracting even larger gas deposits off Israel\xe2\x80\x99s coast; Turkey is the most logical destination for a pipeline from there to foreign markets.'b'Turkey will rise as a regional power only if it sets a genuine example as a liberal democracy and builds strong ties with all its neighbors. This is Mr. Erdogan\xe2\x80\x99s challenge as he tries to undo Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s legacy.'b'Ever since Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry started criticizing Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s actions at Bain Capital \xe2\x80\x94 and talking about the thousands of people laid off as a result of Bain\xe2\x80\x99s investments \xe2\x80\x94 party leaders have essentially told them to shut up. That response is a pretty good indication of how deeply party elders fear the issue of economic inequality in the campaign to come.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the hell are you doing, Newt?\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'Rudolph Giuliani asked'b' Thursday on Fox News. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is what Saul Alinsky taught Barack Obama, and what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying is part of the reason we\xe2\x80\x99re in so much trouble right now.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Giuliani has one thing right: Republicans are indeed in growing trouble as more voters begin to realize how much the party\xe2\x80\x99s policies \xe2\x80\x94 dismantling regulations, slashing taxes for the rich, weakening unions \xe2\x80\x94 have contributed to inequality and the yawning distance between the middle class and the top end.'b'The more President Obama talks about narrowing that gap, the more his popularity ratings have risen while those of Congress plummet. Two-thirds of Americans now say there is a strong conflict between the rich and the poor, 'b'according to a Pew survey'b' released last week, making it the greatest source of tension in American society.'b'That makes Mr. Romney and his party vulnerable, as he clearly knows. He said on Wednesday that issues of wealth distribution should be discussed only 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cin quiet rooms.\xe2\x80\x9d'b' And he accused the president of using an \xe2\x80\x9cenvy-oriented, attack-oriented\xe2\x80\x9d approach, \xe2\x80\x9centirely inconsistent with the concept of one nation under God.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s image of a country where workers have nothing but admiration for benevolent, job-creating capitalists (and no one is so impolite as to mention jobs destroyed) bears very little relationship to reality. But his suggestion that it is un-American to talk about rising populist resentment is self-serving and hypocritical. Republicans, in particular, have eagerly stoked such resentments against minorities and the poor.'b'That was the essence of the \xe2\x80\x9cSouthern strategy\xe2\x80\x9d that Republicans, beginning with Richard Nixon, used to urge white voters to defect from a Democratic Party that supported civil rights. It continued for decades with attacks on busing, affirmative action, immigration and welfare, and was sounded most recently by Mr. Gingrich, with his attacks on Mr. Obama as \xe2\x80\x9cthe food stamp president.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Fanning resentment of the poor \xe2\x80\x94 and deflecting attention from the relentless Republican defense of the rich \xe2\x80\x94 is also central to the party\xe2\x80\x99s current political strategy. That\xe2\x80\x99s why so many Republican candidates and lawmakers keep 'b'talking so angrily'b' about poor people not paying federal income taxes. That\xe2\x80\x99s how the Tea Party got started in 2009, when Mr. Obama proposed lowering interest rates for homeowners who were behind on their mortgages and conservative activists saw an opportunity to pit the affluent against their struggling neighbors. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why Mr. Romney constantly accuses the president of trying to create \xe2\x80\x9can entitlement society,\xe2\x80\x9d which is simply a variant on Ronald Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s welfare-queen anecdotes.'b'And yet if Democrats dare to point out that 'b'the income gains of the top 1 percent'b' have dwarfed everyone else\xe2\x80\x99s in the last few decades, they are accused of whipping up class envy. Alan Krueger, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, noted'b' in a speech 'b'on Thursday that the median income in the United States had actually declined since 1999, shrinking the middle class while the income of the top 1 percent soared. Such inequality is corrosive. And pointing it out has nothing to do with envy and everything to do with pressing for policies to help America\xe2\x80\x99s struggling middle class.'b'Anyone who criticizes Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s business practices now faces the absurd charge of putting free-market capitalism on trial. No one is trying to end capitalism, but President Obama is calling for more effective regulation to protect consumers. While Republicans attack a supposed \xe2\x80\x9centitlement culture,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama is calling for strengthening a desperately needed safety net. And he is calling for raising taxes on the wealthy, particularly for those on Wall Street and in private equity, to protect that safety net and reduce the deficit.'b'Mr. Romney has based his campaign on his business experience. Americans need to know how that experience was gained, and what values \xe2\x80\x94 if any \xe2\x80\x94 it represents. Class reality has nothing to do with class warfare.'b'As a condition of getting and keeping their jobs, millions of employees in the United States have signed agreements to take any disputes with their employers to arbitration rather than court. Typically, the agreements also prohibit the arbitrator from consolidating similar claims.'b'Why employers like the agreements should be obvious: they pre-empt court challenges on workplace disputes and make it harder for employees to join forces to demand better treatment. As for why employees sign, they have no choice: their jobs require it.'b'The good news is that this is not the end of the story.'b'In a recent ruling, the National Labor Relations Board concluded that employees\xe2\x80\x99 federal right to engage in concerted action trumps any arbitration agreement that bars group claims. It was an impressive defense of employee rights. Employers can still require arbitration, but they must also offer ways for employees to bring collective claims, either in arbitration or in court.'b'Business lobbyists, including the Chamber of Commerce, have denounced the ruling. They say it is an invitation to vast class action lawsuits on issues that could be resolved out of court. That is an exaggeration, intended to deny employees the right \xe2\x80\x94 and the power \xe2\x80\x94 that comes from jointly pressing their concerns.'b'Business groups are likely to appeal the board\xe2\x80\x99s decision to a federal court of appeals. They may try to assert that the board\xe2\x80\x99s decision should not apply in nonunion companies. But since 1935, federal law has given employees the right to join together for better pay and working conditions \xe2\x80\x94 with or without a union.'b'Business groups have also argued that the labor board should follow a ruling last year in which the Supreme Court decided, 5 to 4, that federal law prevents consumers who have signed arbitration agreements from banding together in a single arbitration \xe2\x80\x94 a devastating blow to consumer rights. The labor board has already correctly asserted that the law governing consumers is not the same one that governs employees, and that labor law clearly gives employees the right to jointly pursue workplace grievances, including through litigation.'b'Starting this month, the labor board has three new members. All five members \xe2\x80\x94 three Democrats and two Republicans \xe2\x80\x94 have solid backgrounds in labor law, which bodes well for bridging potential partisan divides. But as the arbitration ruling shows, business groups and their Republican allies will keep pushing back hard against employee rights. Going forward, the key will be for members to remain focused on why the labor law exists.'b'And all Americans would do well to read the law\xe2\x80\x99s preamble, which says that it is the policy of the United States to encourage collective bargaining and to protect \xe2\x80\x9cthe exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection.\xe2\x80\x9d That is good for the country.'b'Last summer the Obama administration announced an overdue change in the way it catches and deports illegal immigrants. The head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, John Morton, said the agency would focus more heavily on deporting convicted criminals and other high-risk offenders, making noncriminals a lower priority.'b'The new strategy did not extend forgiveness or legal status to any illegal immigrants. But it did promise to halt the deportations of many thousands of people \xe2\x80\x94 those with clean records and strong ties to the community and who posed no threat, including the elderly, military veterans, college students and parents of young children. Instead the agency would go after convicted criminals, gang members, those who had repeatedly crossed the border illegally and other undesirables.'b'Friday was supposed to be the day when training of ICE officers in the new policy was finally complete. But there has been a snag: while virtually all of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers and supervisors have received training, the union representing about 7,000 field agents is refusing to let its members attend the sessions. Its intransigence could slow the new strategy for weeks.'b'The union president, Chris Crane, says the strategy is preventing agents from enforcing the law. In October, he told Congress the policy was too confusing for agents to understand and would lead to \xe2\x80\x9cvictimization and death,\xe2\x80\x9d for reasons that were unclear.'b'Mr. Crane has taken his grievances to the hard-right media, complaining to Fox News and Lou Dobbs that his bosses are endangering lives and abdicating their law-enforcement duties. He is conflating all undocumented foreigners with dangerous criminals. But of the nearly 400,000 people ICE deports each year, only a fraction are dangerous criminals; a large proportion are minor offenders or have no records.'b'If the memo is confusing, then Mr. Crane should let his members go to ICE\xe2\x80\x99s one-day training seminars. To us the policy seems like a simple and sensible a way to enhance public safety, conserve law-enforcement resources and lessen the human damage of broken immigration laws. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I see from my officers,\xe2\x80\x9d Chris Shanahan, an ICE officer in New York City, told The Times, \xe2\x80\x9cis that they understand that criminal aliens and national security threats should be taken into custody and removed before a single mother, a pregnant woman or someone with small United States citizen children.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s simple enough.'b'In death, Charles Dickens still keeps his greatest secret to himself \xe2\x80\x94 the essence of his energy. None of the physical relics he left behind betray it. The manuscripts of his novels \xe2\x80\x94 like \xe2\x80\x9cOur Mutual Friend\xe2\x80\x9d at the Morgan Library \xe2\x80\x94 look no more fevered or hectic than the manuscripts left behind by other novelists.'b'The handwritten words on the page, round and legible in blue ink, are the marks of a mind that has already settled itself to composition.'b'Dickens, who was born 200 years ago, wrote a long shelf of novels, 14 in all, not counting \xe2\x80\x9cThe Mystery of Edwin Drood,\xe2\x80\x9d which lay half-finished at his death. They sit plump and bursting with life, spilling over with the chaos of existence itself. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to imagine writers working the way Dickens\xe2\x80\x99s prolific contemporary, Anthony Trollope, did \xe2\x80\x94 steadily, routinely, knocking off his 2,000 words a day until, by the end of his life, he had written 47 novels. But this is not how Dickens wrote.'b'Find the tumultuous heart of your favorite Dickens novel, the place where 19th-century London seems to be seething, smoking, overcrowded, in a state of vulgar contradiction. Then imagine Dickens working in the midst of it \xe2\x80\x94 a small, brisk figure rushing past you on a dark and dirty street. He is lost in a kind of mental ventriloquism, calling up his emotions and studying them. Every night he walked a dozen miles, without which, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI should just explode and perish.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Under the pseudonym Boz, he wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing we enjoy more than a little amateur vagrancy,\xe2\x80\x9d walking through London as though \xe2\x80\x9cthe whole were an unknown region to our wandering mind.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet there was nothing remotely solitary about Dickens. One person who saw him in the highest spirits at a family party wrote that he \xe2\x80\x9chappily sang two or three songs, one the patter song, \xe2\x80\x98The Dog\xe2\x80\x99s Meat Man,\xe2\x80\x99 and gave several successful imitations of the most distinguished actors of the day.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a wonder Dickens didn\xe2\x80\x99t explode and perish long before his death in 1870, at age 58. Quite apart from the act of composing his novels, he was a whirlwind, living a life that is nearly unmatched in its vigor. He had one entire career as a magazine editor, another as an actor and manager of theatrical productions, still another as a philanthropist and social reformer. The record of his private engagements alone \xe2\x80\x94 dinners, outings, peregrinations with his entourage of family and friends \xe2\x80\x94 is exhausting to read. The novels stand out against the backdrop of hundreds of other compositions, all of them written against tight deadlines.'b'Dickens\xe2\x80\x99s energy, which he made no effort to husband until he was nearly dead, was inexplicable. Call it metabolic if you like. Perhaps it was a reaction to the uncertainties of his childhood and the shame of his days as a child laborer, when he knew that as a precocious young entertainer he was already a spectacle well worth observing.'b'He was driven by gargantuan emotions, and the ferocious will needed to keep them in check, to release them in the creation of characters he loved more than some of his children. He could drive himself to anguished tears while writing the death of Little Nell, in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Old Curiosity Shop.\xe2\x80\x9d And yet he could also coldly disown anyone who sided with his wife, Catherine, when they separated, including his namesake son.'b'Even Dickens didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand his energy. He grasped that there was a wildness in him, and so did nearly everyone who knew him. When Dostoevsky met Dickens in 1862 \xe2\x80\x94 a meeting that is hard to imagine \xe2\x80\x94 Dickens explained that there were two people inside him, \xe2\x80\x9cone who feels as he ought to feel and one who feels the opposite.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Out of these two people he constructed his universe of characters, good and evil. Dostoevsky\xe2\x80\x99s comment is laconic and ambiguous. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly two people?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. Dickens\xe2\x80\x99s public readings, which began in 1858, drew tens of thousands of people in England and America. They came not only to see the author himself but also the people who inhabited him \xe2\x80\x94 Scrooge and Pickwick, Micawber and Mrs. Gamp.'b'Those characters, and dozens more, still live with all their old vitality. And though we feel the unevenness of Dickens\xe2\x80\x99s novels more plainly than when they were appearing in monthly parts, it\xe2\x80\x99s easier now to see that the unevenness in most of them is symptomatic of his overpowering energy.'b'The man himself was uneven and could not be beaten into consistency any more than he could beat every one of his novels into perfection. The fact is that Charles Dickens was as Dickensian as the most outrageous of his characters, and he was happy to think so, too. Soon after the publication of \xe2\x80\x9cA Christmas Carol\xe2\x80\x9d in 1843, he wrote of himself to a close friend: \xe2\x80\x9ctwo and thirty years ago, the planet Dick appeared on the horizon. To the great admiration, wonder and delight of all who live, and the unspeakable happiness of mankind.\xe2\x80\x9d Planet Dickens feels as real as it does to us because he stalked the world around him.'b'And when he finally settled at his desk, he was still driving himself through a world of his own invention, peopled by characters waiting, as he said, to come \xe2\x80\x9cready made to the point of the pen.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0'b''b''b'CHARLESTON, S.C.'b'WHAT a choice we\xe2\x80\x99ll have in the fall: one man on a pedestal, another behind a wall.'b'Democrats and independents may have fallen out of love with President Obama, but Republicans and independents can\xe2\x80\x99t fall in love with Mitt Romney.

As I listen to his team \xe2\x80\x94 three young Egyptian professionals volunteering their time \xe2\x80\x94 describe their strategy, this thought occurs to me: I\xe2\x80\x99ve met more new, interesting Egyptians, of all political persuasions, in the last week than I have in the last 30 years. That is no accident. Egypt under Hosni Mubarak was a country where there was only one person to talk to, one person who was empowered to decide. Everyone else was just waiting for Godot. And the conversations were all one way \xe2\x80\x94 from top to bottom.'b'That is not the case anymore. Egyptians are finding their own voices again and rediscovering who their neighbors are. In some ways, they have been shocked. A Muslim Brotherhood leader told me that he was totally surprised when the elections showed how many Salafi Muslims lived in Egypt. When the fundamentalists tell you that they had no idea there were so many superfundamentalists, you can imagine how surprised the liberals were. The Egyptian generals have been stunned at how many unarmed secular youths have been willing to confront troops in the streets to get the army to cede power. There is a certain \xe2\x80\x9cOh-you-live-here-too?\xe2\x80\x9d quality to Egyptian life today.'b'The longer you stay here, though, the more it becomes clear that Egypt has not had a revolution yet. It\xe2\x80\x99s had an uprising. The basic military regime that has ruled Egypt since 1952 is still in charge \xe2\x80\x94 only a military council has replaced the Mubaraks. But this uprising has lifted the heavy lid off this society and let in oxygen. That, plus the recent parliamentary elections, has enabled all these newly emergent people, parties and voices \xe2\x80\x94 from all walks of Egyptian life \xe2\x80\x94 to surface. Whoever becomes Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s next president had better be ready for a two-way conversation with all these emerging forces.'b'But for Egypt to have a democratic revolution \xe2\x80\x94 a real change in the power structure and institutions \xe2\x80\x94 all these newly empowered parties will have to find a way to work together to produce a new constitution and a new president. That will not be easy. The economic and social problems that Egypt has to overcome today are staggering. They will require the whole society to pull together, but the divisions and lack of trust today between the new and old power centers \xe2\x80\x94 the army, the security police, the Tahrir youth, the Islamists, the Christians, the traditionalist silent majority, the secular liberals \xe2\x80\x94 are substantial. This country needs a weekend retreat to get to know itself anew.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder. All the Arab autocrats, like Mubarak, ran their countries the same way \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9clike protection rackets,\xe2\x80\x9d says Daniel Brumberg, the co-director of Democracy and Governance Studies at Georgetown University. Different groups \xe2\x80\x94 ethnic or religious minorities, the business sector, Islamists and secular activists \xe2\x80\x94 were played off against, and \xe2\x80\x9cprotected\xe2\x80\x9d from, each other by the leader who sat atop the pyramid. Everyone was afraid of everyone.'b'The hopeful news is that real politics has broken out here, and some Egyptians are working on building lines of trust across the new power centers. Take Amr Hamzawy, a secular liberal who was just elected to Parliament, which opens on Jan. 23. He and others have begun a quiet discussion with the Islamist parties about how to cooperate on legislation to get Egypt growing again and to show that the new power holders can produce a better Egypt.'b'Speaking of the new Parliament members, Hamzawy said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are just being introduced to each other \xe2\x80\x94 with different stereotypes, and different packages of demands and interests and reservations. But we have a society waiting. We have to deliver. The big challenge is to transcend the polarization of the elections. We will not be able to deliver if we polarize in Parliament. We have to transcend ideological differences. From a strictly liberal perspective, we have around 20 percent. The political Islam camp has about two-thirds. So our job is to work to pull moderates from the political Islam camp to the center. Our challenge is to define that new strategic center for Egypt.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Hamzawy added: \xe2\x80\x9cI am humbled and impressed by the commitment of Egyptians to their country. ... I was running against a Muslim Brotherhood candidate. I had over 800 volunteers, and I did not pay anyone a penny. It is not a passive society anymore. It is a society eager to be in action.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Egyptian politics for the last 50 years has been largely a struggle between the army and the Brotherhood, and both today are suspected of having secret agendas to grab power alone. 'b'I\xe2\x80\x99d keep a wary eye on both of them'b'.'b'But here\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s new: They are not the only ones anymore with plans for Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s future and the energy to push them. Somehow all of these new and old forces have to now find a way to share power to rebuild this country. Egypt has wasted so much of the past 30 years. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have another minute to waste. Or, as the Egyptian journalist Lamees El-Hadidi, who lived through it all, remarked to me, her generation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose \xe2\x80\x9cthe past and the future.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'THE debate over Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s career at Bain Capital, in which several of his Republican rivals sound as if they\xe2\x80\x99re auditioning for a production of \xe2\x80\x9cLes Mis\xc3\xa9rables,\xe2\x80\x9d is at heart a debate about the last 30 years of American capitalism.'b'In the decades after World War II, the United States economy was highly regulated, highly taxed and highly successful. War, tyranny and ideological mania had devastated our competitors, and while Asia stagnated and Europe struggled to rebuild, America grew and grew and grew. It was a golden age for the liberal model of political economy, with a powerful regulatory state presiding over labor-management cooperation and a steadily expanding middle class.'b'But like all golden ages it passed. First in Europe and then in Asia, competitors emerged to challenge the United States\xe2\x80\x99 economic dominance. In this new landscape, the pillars of the postwar economic order began to look like liabilities. Our heavily unionized industries seemed sclerotic, our regulatory system stifling, our tax rates punitive. And so American policy makers, C.E.O.\xe2\x80\x99s and investors responded by changing their priorities \xe2\x80\x94 privileging growth over security, efficiency over equality, and embracing creative destruction on a scale that would have been unthinkable in the America of 1955.'b'In the private sector, this revolution was driven by men like Mitt Romney. As Ben Wallace-Wells put it in a New York magazine 'b'profile'b' last October, Romney has spent his entire career seeking to \xe2\x80\x9cperfect\xe2\x80\x9d the American corporation, stripping \xe2\x80\x9cits inefficiencies until it might function as a perfectly frictionless economic unit.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This process didn\xe2\x80\x99t just involve pillaging companies and throwing their employees out onto the street, as Romney\xe2\x80\x99s more overheated critics charge. While Bain\xe2\x80\x99s record is hard to assess from the outside, one comprehensive 'b'study'b' 'b'cited by Reihan Salam'b' in The Daily suggests that private equity buyouts in general tend to have \xe2\x80\x9conly a modest net impact on employment\xe2\x80\x9d in the companies involved.'b'But neither was Romney the Henry Ford-esque job creator he\xe2\x80\x99s tried to play on the campaign trail. He served his investors, not his employees, and his goal was always to make an uncompetitive company competitive, even if that required cutting paychecks and shuttering plants along the way. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, Bain usually found a way to reap profits even when the overhaul failed and the company went belly-up.'b'In the broadest sense, though, the competitiveness revolution was good for the United States. In the 1970s, there were sound economic reasons to expect that other developed nations would gradually catch up to American living standards and per capita G.D.P. Instead, our rivals got rich, but we stayed richer. As Adam Davidson 'b'noted'b' in last weekend\xe2\x80\x99s Times Magazine, \xe2\x80\x9ceven Europe\xe2\x80\x99s best-performing large country, Germany, is about 20 percent poorer than the U.S. on a per-person basis.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But keeping America\xe2\x80\x99s edge came at a cost. Our economy became more efficient, but also more ruthless and Darwinian. Our G.D.P. kept rising, but the new wealth was less evenly distributed. The revolution delivered growth, but at the expense of stability and certainty. And for many Americans, even the \xe2\x80\x9cmodest net impact\xe2\x80\x9d of private equity buyouts cost them a solid, good-paying job.'b'On the left, and now apparently in Newt Gingrich\xe2\x80\x99s campaign shop, there\xe2\x80\x99s a persistent suggestion that it could have been entirely otherwise \xe2\x80\x94 that the midcentury model could have somehow been sustained, that the private equity \xe2\x80\x9cvultures\xe2\x80\x9d could have been held at bay, and that what worked for the United States when Europe was in ruins and half the world was Marxist-Leninist could have worked in the age of globalization as well.'b'This is a fantasy, unfortunately \xe2\x80\x94 one that belongs to the world of Hollywood endings, where Gordon Gekko is defeated, Blue Star Airlines stays in business and Bud Fox\xe2\x80\x99s dad gets to retire with a solid pension. Indeed, it\xe2\x80\x99s such a fantasy that even Oliver Stone didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite believe in it: In \xe2\x80\x9cWall Street,\xe2\x80\x9d Blue Star was saved from Gekko\xe2\x80\x99s clutches \xe2\x80\x94 and presumably, from the real-life fate of an Eastern Airlines or a Pan Am \xe2\x80\x94 not by a government subsidy or a benevolent Daddy Warbucks, but by a rival buyout specialist.'b'Still, just because the private equity revolution was necessary doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that it was an unmitigated good. And for Mitt Romney to frame criticisms of Bain as just \xe2\x80\x9c'b'the bitter politics of envy'b',\xe2\x80\x9d as he did last week, displays a tone-deafness that could cost him the presidency. No one \xe2\x80\x94 and certainly no politician \xe2\x80\x94 who has profited so immensely from an age of insecurity should ever appear to be lecturing the people who\xe2\x80\x99ve lost out.'b'Instead, Romney needs to prove to anxious voters that he and his party have more to offer them than just Bain capitalism alone. To win the White House, he\xe2\x80\x99ll need to promise not only competition that leads to growth, but growth that leads to broadly shared prosperity. To defend his revolution, he\xe2\x80\x99ll need to show that he\xe2\x80\x99s reckoned with its costs.'b'AMERICANS are often told that in today\xe2\x80\x99s globalized world, we are at a competitive disadvantage because of our lazy monolingualism. \xe2\x80\x9cFor too long, Americans have relied on other countries to speak our language,\xe2\x80\x9d Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said at the Foreign Language Summit in 2010. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to do that in the increasingly complex and interconnected world.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The widespread assumption is that few Americans speak more than one language, compared with citizens of other nations \xe2\x80\x94 and that we have little interest in learning to speak another. But is this true?'b'Since 1980, the United States Census Bureau has asked: \xe2\x80\x9cDoes this person speak a language other than English at home? What is this language? How well does this person speak English?\xe2\x80\x9d The bureau reports that as of 2009, about 20 percent of Americans speak a language other than English at home. This figure is often taken to indicate the number of bilingual speakers in the United States.'b'But a moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection reveals that the bureau\xe2\x80\x99s question about what you speak at home is not equivalent to asking whether you speak more than one language. I have some proficiency in Spanish and was fluent in Mandarin 20 years ago. But when the American Community Survey (an ongoing survey from the Census Bureau) arrived in my mailbox last month, posing that question, I had to answer no, because we speak only English in my home.'b'I know I\xe2\x80\x99m not alone. There are countless Americans who speak languages other than English outside their homes: not just those of us who have learned other languages in school or through living abroad, but also employers who have learned enough Spanish to speak to their employees; workers in hospitals, clinics, courts and retail stores who have picked up parts of another language to make their jobs easier; soldiers back from Iraq or Afghanistan with some competency in Arabic, Pashto or Dari; third-generation kids studying their heritage language in informal schools on weekends; spouses and partners picking up the language of a loved one\xe2\x80\x99s family; enthusiasts learning languages with computer software like Rosetta Stone. None of the above are identified as bilingual by the Census Bureau\xe2\x80\x99s question.'b'Every census in the United States since 1890 (except for one, in 1950) has asked about language characteristics, and its question has always seemed to assume that English is the only language relevant for the aspects of life that take place outside the home. This assumption, though outdated, is somewhat understandable. After all, the bureau\xe2\x80\x99s primary goal in asking this question is not to paint a full and complete portrait of the language proficiencies of Americans but rather to track immigrants\xe2\x80\x99 integration into mainstream American society and to ascertain what services they need, and in what languages. (In October, for instance, the Census Bureau released a list of jurisdictions with large numbers of voters who need voting instructions translated in a language other than English.)'b'Nonetheless, to better map American language abilities, the census should ask the same question that the European Commission asked in its survey in 2006: Can you have a conversation in a language besides your mother tongue? (The answer, incidentally, dented Europe\xe2\x80\x99s reputation as highly multilingual: only 56 percent of the respondents, who tended to be younger and more educated, said they could.) Until the census question is refined, claims about American monolingualism will almost certainly be overstated.'b'The celebrated multilingualism of not just Europe but also the rest of the world may be exaggerated. The hand-wringing about America\xe2\x80\x99s supposed linguistic weakness is often accompanied by the claim that monolinguals make up a small worldwide minority. The Oxford linguist Suzanne Romaine has claimed that bilingualism and multilingualism \xe2\x80\x9care a normal and unremarkable necessity of everyday life for the majority of the world\xe2\x80\x99s population.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But the statistics tell a murkier story. Recently, the Stockholm University linguist Mikael Parkvall sought out data on global bilingualism and ran into problems. The reliable numbers that do exist cover only 15 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s 190-odd countries, and less than one-third of the world\xe2\x80\x99s population. In those countries, Mr. Parkvall calculated (in a study not yet published), the average number of languages spoken either natively or non-natively per person is 1.58. Piecing together the available data for the rest of the world as best he could, he estimated that 80 percent of people on the planet speak 1.69 languages \xe2\x80\x94 not high enough to conclude that the average person is bilingual.'b'Multilinguals may outnumber monolinguals, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear by how much. The average American may be no more monolingual or less multilingual than any other average person elsewhere on the planet. At the very least, we can\xe2\x80\x99t say for sure \xe2\x80\x94 not in any language.'b'WHAT\xe2\x80\x99S the quickest way to a man\xe2\x80\x99s heart? No, not through the chest wall with a knife.'b'According to Mom wisdom, it\xe2\x80\x99s a cozy meal, in a penumbra of pleasure that mingles the fragrant food with the cook. If men are anything like common fruit flies \xe2\x80\x94 and who\xe2\x80\x99s to say they\xe2\x80\x99re not at times; heaven knows women are \xe2\x80\x94 Mom was right.'b'Anyway, that\xe2\x80\x99s the romantic ploy of female fruit flies, for whom a dinner date is the ultimate 'b' rush'b'. And rush it literally is, since they live only about 25 days and can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to be shy. Still, the males need to be in the right mood, and the females are surprisingly picky and manipulative, given their short careers. Did I mention that some fruit flies have come-hither eyes? I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean the dozens of mosaic facets, so evocative of hippie sunglasses, but the zingy psychedelic eye colors lab folk like to breed into them, the better to study mutant genes. As a Cornell grad student, I often stopped by the fetid biology lab to admire the eggplant-blackness of the abdomens, the spiky hairs, the gaudy prisms of the eyes \xe2\x80\x94 some apricot, some teal, some purple, some the brick-red of Ming vases.'b'A favorite of biologists, fruit flies have it all \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99re prowling for mates within 12 hours of birth, they\xe2\x80\x99re easy to raise and they can lay 100 eggs a day. Plus, they share most of our'b' genes'b', including about 70 percent of those we\xe2\x80\x99ve linked to such diseases as\xc2\xa0Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s and Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'Because fruit flies thrive in sultry 80-degree weather, the lab in my graduate student days offered a warm den during those numbing upstate winters when ice clotted in beards and mittens, co-eds exhaled stark white clouds, and the walkways looked like a toboggan run. I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall what experiments were unfolding, only the tiny haunting eyes of the fruit flies, like the captive souls of past lab assistants, and the swooping melody of their Latin name: Drosophila melanogaster, which translates poetically as \xe2\x80\x9cdark-bellied dew sipper.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xc2\xa0 During fruit fly courtship, the male, lured by a full larder, extends one mandolin-like wing and serenades the female, then engages in a style of oral sexual foreplay many humans enjoy. Then he mounts her and copulates for 20 minutes or so. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the sly part. The last male she has sex with will 'b'sire most'b' of her many offspring, and she chooses the father only after lots of romps in the orchard or lab, based on his flair for courtship. \xc2\xa0'b'As with most animals, from squirrels to spiders, the males pursue but the females choose, and even the lowly fruit fly can be choosy.'b'Why the dinner date? Because Live Fast and Die is their mantra, and they need a handy food supply if their large new brood is to survive.'b'I first noticed a similar meal plan among the annual hordes of Japanese beetles that tat rose leaves into doilies. Gardeners often spy the iridescent scarabs perched atop favorite flowers, dining and mating simultaneously. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind if you have sex on the roses,\xe2\x80\x9d I tell them peevishly. \xe2\x80\x9cReally. Knock yourselves out ... I just wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat at the same time!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Of course, the ancient Greeks and Romans, who coined the word \xe2\x80\x9corgy,\xe2\x80\x9d and found that dining lying down leveled the playing field, enjoyed blending sensory delights with equal gusto \xe2\x80\x94 banquets of music, food, dancing, alcohol and sex. Why should fruit flies be any different?'b'We may respond to the same honeyed aromas that make fruit flies amorous, so chemists include them in perfumes. Many a medieval troubadour used a mandolin to serenade his lady, with whom he\xe2\x80\x99d dine and mate. And remember that sexy tavern scene in \xe2\x80\x9cTom Jones,\xe2\x80\x9d in which the hero and a buxom wench devour a carcass with carnal abandon?'b'So, is the human dinner date really just courtship feeding after all, a custom we share with fruit flies, robins and chimpanzees? Yes. But what\xe2\x80\x99s the harm in that? As Cole Porter once put it: \xe2\x80\x9cBirds do it, bees do it, even educated fleas do it ...\xe2\x80\x9d'b'PARIS'b'QUELLE horreur! One of the uglier revelations about President Obama emerging from the Republican primaries is that he is trying to turn the United States into Europe.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe wants us to turn into a 'b'European-style welfare state'b',\xe2\x80\x9d warned Mitt Romney. Countless versions of that horrific vision creep into Romney\xe2\x80\x99s speeches, suggesting that it would \xe2\x80\x9c'b'poison the very spirit of America'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Rick Santorum agrees, fretting that Obama is \xe2\x80\x9c'b'trying to impose'b' some sort of European socialism on the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Who knew?

Imagine:'b''b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a languid morning in Peoria, as a husband and wife are having breakfast. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t want eggs and bacon?\xe2\x80\x9d the wife asks. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, I prefer these croissants,\xe2\x80\x9d the husband replies. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have a lovely je ne sais quoi.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b''b'He dips the croissant into his caf\xc3\xa9 au-lait and chews it with zest. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want to do this evening?\xe2\x80\x9d he asks. \xe2\x80\x9cNow that we\xe2\x80\x99re only working 35 hours a week, we have so much more time.

The Republican candidates unleash these attacks on Obama because so many Americans have in mind a caricature of Europe as an effete, failed socialist system. As Romney puts it: \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Europe isn\xe2\x80\x99t working in Europe.'b' It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to work here.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'(Monsieur Romney is getting his comeuppance. Newt Gingrich has released an attack ad, called \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The French Connection'b',\xe2\x80\x9d showing clips of Romney speaking the language of Paris. The scandalized narrator warns: \xe2\x80\x9cJust like John Kerry, he speaks French!\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'But the basic notion of Europe as a failure is a dangerous misconception. The reality is far more complicated.'b'What is true is that Europe is in an economic mess. Quite aside from the current economic crisis, labor laws are often too rigid, and the effect has been to make companies reluctant to hire in the first place. Unemployment rates therefore are stubbornly high, especially for the young. And Europe\xe2\x80\x99s welfare state has been too generous, creating long-term budget problems as baby boomers retire.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe dirty little secret of European governments was that we lived in a way we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'Sylvie Kauffmann'b', the editorial director of the newspaper Le Monde, told me. \xe2\x80\x9cWe lived beyond our means. We can\xe2\x80\x99t live this lie anymore.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yet Kauffmann also notes that Europeans aren\xe2\x80\x99t questioning the basic European model of safety nets, and are aghast that Americans tolerate the way bad luck sometimes leaves families homeless.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s absurd to dismiss Europe. After all, Norway is richer per capita than the United States. Moreover, according to 'b'figures from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics'b', per-capita G.N.P. in France was 64 percent of the American figure in 1960. That rose to 73 percent by 2010. Zut alors! The socialists gained on us!'b'Meanwhile, they did it without breaking a sweat. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says that employed Americans averaged 1,741 hours at work in 2010. In France, the figure was 1,439 hours.'b'If Europe was as anticapitalist as Americans assume, its companies would be collapsing. But there are 172 European corporations among the Fortune Global 500, compared with just 133 from the United States.'b'Europe gets some important things right. It has addressed energy issues and climate change far more seriously than America has. It now has 'b'more economic mobility than the United States'b', partly because of strong public education systems. America used to have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world; 'b'now France and Britain are both ahead of us'b'.'b'Back in 1960, French life expectancy was just a few months longer than in the United States, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. By 2009, the French were living almost three years longer than we were.'b'So it is worth acknowledging Europe\xe2\x80\x99s labor rigidities and its lethargy in resolving the current economic crisis. Its problems are real.

When The Atlantic two years ago 'b'researched'b' presidents\xe2\x80\x99 wealth and adjusted their estimated net worth to 2010 dollars, it found that eight of the first 10 presidents were worth at least $20 million, and five of those men were worth more than $50 million, at least by the time they left office. George Washington led the pack, with $525 million, much of it courtesy of Martha, a widowed heiress.'b'In the second half of the 19th century, there was a stretch of presidents of humbler means, including Abraham Lincoln.

By then the Clintons were rich enough that Hillary, challenging Obama for the Democratic nomination, was able to lend her campaign $11 million of her own money.'b'The tens of millions it can take for a credible presidential primary campaign favors candidates with money, if only because they have the ability to abandon salaried jobs and stump. When Mike Huckabee 'b'begged off'b' the 2012 presidential race, a lack of accrued wealth was one reason.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf I run, I walk away from a pretty good income," he said, referring to his daily radio and weekly TV shows.'b'MORE important, candidates of means tend to have access to the sorts of rich people who can pump major money into super PACs. The principal one supporting Romney had already raised $12 million by last July.'b'Even many Congressional campaigns have grown drawn out and exorbitant. Is it any wonder, then, that Congress has become a wealthier club? As Eric Lichtblau 'b'reported'b' in The Times recently, the median net worth of a member of Congress appeared to be $913,000 in 2010 and had grown 15 percent over six years. The median net worth for all Americans was about $100,000 and had declined 8 percent.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s no simple relationship between privilege and policy. The Roosevelts and Kennedys, both spectacularly rich families, produced leaders known for their populism and protection of the less fortunate. Nancy Pelosi, a staunch defender of government aid, is thought to be worth as much as $196 million. John Boehner? Just $1.8 million, according to figures from 2010.'b'Wealth in politics makes a certain sense. The same drive, vanity, accomplishment and ingenuity that fuel a successful political career often fuel high earnings beforehand. And those earnings in some instances win voters\xe2\x80\x99 confidence.'b'Paul Friedman, 32, an undecided voter who showed up at Romney\xe2\x80\x99s event in Columbia, said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about jobs, and his businesses are successful, then maybe he\xe2\x80\x99d run the country in a way that brings jobs back.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s Romney\xe2\x80\x99s pitch.'b'But he walks a tightrope, wanting to broadcast his success without seeming out of touch. A wealthy candidate\xe2\x80\x99s aides guard against tone-deaf admissions of privilege while opponents itch to pounce, as the first President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s did in 1992, when he seemed unfamiliar with a grocery store\xe2\x80\x99s electronic price scanner.'b'I doubt many politicians at that stage of the game are spending much time in the checkout line or know the price of milk without seeing it on a briefing paper. But the charade persists. The second President Bush learned from his father\xe2\x80\x99s mistakes and seemed to develop an entire folksy persona in response. He spent vacations clearing brush, and though done on a vast Texas ranch purchased with his considerable wealth, it yielded optics preferable to those of John Kerry windsurfing.'b'Romney recalls the Naugahyde chair in an office past and tweets about breakfast at Subway and a flight on Southwest Airlines. But inevitably he muffs the script. During last Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s debate he said a man shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t run for office if he needed to win to pay the mortgage.'b'It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a $10,000 flub.

Partnering with employers to design industry-specific training is the best way to ensure that workers and communities can participate in America\xe2\x80\x99s manufacturing revival.'b'FRED DEDRICK'b'\nExecutive Director, National Fund for Workforce Solutions'b'\nBoston, Jan. 10, 2012'b''b''b'In the last decade, California has closed 8 of its 11 juvenile facilities and successfully turned responsibility for holding and treating nonviolent offenders over to the counties, where they can have more contact with their families and their chances for a smooth reintegration after release are higher.'b'Gov. Jerry Brown now wants to complete the transformation and phase out the three remaining state facilities that hold 1,100 more serious offenders. The state will have to help the counties develop the very different facilities and expertise for managing violent young offenders.'b'The California juvenile justice system has a long history of abuses. A 2004 court ruling that required the state to improve services and facilities pushed up costs. Beginning in 2007, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger began to downsize the system after the Legislature passed a law barring counties from sending nonviolent youths to state facilities. California did it the right way: providing generous financing to the counties for therapeutically based juvenile offender programs. Spending on the system has dropped by almost half, from nearly $500 million to about $245 million as crime rates dropped over all, and the state has cut its juvenile inmate population from about 10,000 in the mid-1990s to about 1,100 today.'b'Some supporters of the plan worry that certain counties may lack secure facilities to hold juveniles convicted of arson, robbery and other serious crimes and the therapeutic knowhow to succeed with these young people. The state will need to help the counties adopt proven strategies in use in other states and encourage counties to band together to develop secure regional facilities, so long as the emphasis remains on local services.'b'Some critics worry that without a state juvenile system to hold violent offenders, prosecutors will try more young people as adults. The Legislature can prevent this by monitoring and penalizing counties that overprosecute young people and by allowing for extended custody in local facilities of juveniles who commit more serious crimes.'b'For 23 years, 'b'D.C. Central Kitchen'b', the country\xe2\x80\x99s oldest community kitchen providing meals for the poor and homeless, has taken discarded food and marginalized people and found value in both. It\xe2\x80\x99s a nonprofit that gives new meaning to free enterprise.'b'What started with one refrigerator truck has grown into an organization that provides about 5,000 meals a day to homeless shelters, halfway houses and other sites in Washington. Half the staff members are ex-convicts, former addicts or onetime homeless people, who finished the group\xe2\x80\x99s training program and are now prized employees.'b'In 2008, as the economy slid into a downturn, the kitchen employed 60 people and its annual budget was $7.4 million. Today, with the economy still struggling, the staff is twice as big and its budget has grown by almost 50 percent to over $10 million.'b'The growth has come by training people others consider unemployable and creating jobs in its income-producing Fresh Start catering business, for which it pays a decent wage with full benefits. With hunger rising in the recession, the kitchen has expanded to meet greater needs, but its leaders know that the solution to hunger ultimately is putting more people to work. The kitchen sees itself as helping to carry on Martin Luther King Jr.\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Poor People\xe2\x80\x99s Campaign'b' for economic justice, empowering the dispossessed and feeding the hungry, caring for the people in line while helping to shorten it. The kitchen provides sustenance, income, dignity and hope.'b'Washington'b'THE debate over how to handle Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program is notable for its gloom and doom. Many people assume that Israel must choose between letting Iran develop nuclear weapons or attacking before it gets the bomb. But this is a false choice. There is a third option: working toward a nuclear weapons-free zone in the Middle East. And it is more feasible than most assume.'b'Attacking Iran might set its nuclear program back a few years, but it will most likely encourage Iran to aggressively seek \xe2\x80\x94 and probably develop \xe2\x80\x94 nuclear weapons. Slowing Iran down has some value, but the costs are high and the risks even greater. Iran would almost certainly retaliate, leading to all-out war at a time when Israel is still at odds with various Arab countries, and its relations with Turkey are tense.'b'Many hawks who argue for war believe that Iran poses an \xe2\x80\x9cexistential threat\xe2\x80\x9d to Israel. They assume Iran is insensitive to the logic of nuclear deterrence and would be prepared to use nuclear weapons without fear of the consequences (which could include killing millions of Palestinians and the loss of millions of Iranian civilians from an inevitable Israeli retaliation). And even if Israel strikes, Iran is still likely to acquire nuclear weapons eventually and would then be even more inclined to use them.'b'Despite all the talk of an \xe2\x80\x9cexistential threat,\xe2\x80\x9d less than half of Israelis support a strike on Iran. According to our 'b'November poll,'b' carried out in cooperation with the Dahaf Institute in Israel, only 43 percent of Israeli Jews support a military strike on Iran \xe2\x80\x94 even though 90 percent of them think that Iran will eventually acquire nuclear weapons.'b'Most important, when asked whether it would be better for both Israel and Iran to have the bomb, or for neither to have it, 65 percent of Israeli Jews said neither. And a remarkable 64 percent favored the idea of a nuclear-free zone, even when it was explained that this would mean Israel giving up its nuclear weapons.'b'The Israeli public also seems willing to move away from a secretive nuclear policy toward greater openness about Israel\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear facilities. Sixty percent of respondents favored \xe2\x80\x9ca system of full international inspections\xe2\x80\x9d of all nuclear facilities, including Israel\xe2\x80\x99s and Iran\xe2\x80\x99s, as a step toward regional disarmament.'b'If Israel\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program were to become part of the equation, it would be a game-changer. Iran has until now effectively accused the West of employing a double standard because it does not demand Israeli disarmament, earning it many fans across the Arab world.'b'And a nuclear-free zone may be hard for Iran to refuse. Iranian diplomats have said they would be open to an intrusive role for the United Nations if it accepted Iran\xe2\x80\x99s right to enrich uranium for energy production \xe2\x80\x94 not to the higher levels necessary for weapons. And 'b'a 2007 poll'b' by the Program on International Policy Attitudes found that the Iranian people would favor such a deal.'b'We cannot take what Iranian officials say at face value, but an international push for a nuclear-free Middle East would publicly test them. And most Arab leaders would rather not start down the nuclear path \xe2\x80\x94 a real risk if Iran gets the bomb \xe2\x80\x94 and have therefore welcomed the proposal of a nuclear-free zone.'b'Some Israeli officials may also take the idea seriously. As Avner Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s recent book \xe2\x80\x9cThe Worst-Kept Secret\xe2\x80\x9d shows, Israel\xe2\x80\x99s policy of \xe2\x80\x9copacity\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 not acknowledging having nuclear weapons while letting everyone know it does \xe2\x80\x94 has existed since 1969, but is now becoming outdated. Indeed, no one outside Israel today sees any ambiguity about the fact that Israel possesses a large nuclear arsenal.'b'Although Israeli leaders have in the past expressed openness to the idea of a nuclear-free zone, they have always insisted that there must first be peace between Israel and its neighbors.'b'But the stalemate with Iran could actually delay or prevent peace in the region. As the former Israeli spy chief, Meir Dagan, argued earlier this month, Israel\xe2\x80\x99s current stance might actually accelerate Iran\xe2\x80\x99s quest for nuclear weapons and encourage Arab states to follow suit. Moreover, talk of an \xe2\x80\x9cexistential threat\xe2\x80\x9d projects Israel as weak, hurts its morale, and reduces its foreign policy options. This helps explain why three leading Israeli security experts \xe2\x80\x94 the Mossad chief, Tamir Pardo, a former Mossad chief, Efraim Halevy, and a former military chief of staff, Dan Halutz \xe2\x80\x94 all recently declared that a nuclear Iran would not pose an existential threat to Israel.'b'While full elimination of nuclear weapons is improbable without peace, starting the inevitably long and arduous process of negotiations toward that end is vital.'b'Given that Israelis overwhelmingly believe that Iran is on its way to acquiring nuclear weapons and several security experts have begun to question current policy, there is now an opportunity for a genuine debate on the real choices: relying on cold-war-style \xe2\x80\x9cmutual assured destruction\xe2\x80\x9d once Iran develops nuclear weapons or pursuing a path toward a nuclear-weapons-free Middle East, with a chance that Iran \xe2\x80\x94 and Arabs \xe2\x80\x94 will never develop the bomb at all.'b'There should be no illusions that successfully negotiating a path toward regional nuclear disarmament will be easy. But the mere conversation could transform a debate that at present is stuck between two undesirable options: an Iranian bomb or war.'b'Cambridge, Mass.'b'AMERICA remembers the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as a national champion of civil rights. But he was an international icon, too \xe2\x80\x94 and like many icons, his legacy was used for a range of purposes that moved far beyond, and even ran counter to, his famous dream.'b'Indeed, it was King\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have a dream\xe2\x80\x9d'b' speech that sealed his global fame. We\xe2\x80\x99ve all seen photos of the hundreds of thousands marching in 1963 Washington. But thousands also marched that day in London, Tel Aviv and Accra, Ghana.'b'In my home country, Britain, support for the march was overwhelming. Many watched King\xe2\x80\x99s speech live via the newly launched Telstar satellite. In London, demonstrators marched to the American Embassy carrying a banner that read, \xe2\x80\x9cYour fight is our fight.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This was more than just an expression of empathy: that summer, Paul Stephenson, a black community organizer in Bristol, led a boycott of the city\xe2\x80\x99s buses. A charismatic and gifted orator, Mr. Stephenson had been to the Deep South to learn tactics and spoke reverently of King\xe2\x80\x99s Montgomery Bus Boycott.'b'King visited Britain the following year. He accepted invitations abroad, his speechwriter Clarence Jones told me recently, \xe2\x80\x9cto get his message out.\xe2\x80\x9d It seemed to work. King\xe2\x80\x99s sermon at St. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Cathedral was front-page news in the United States, while his meeting with activists led to the formation of the Campaign Against Racial Discrimination, the pre-eminent anti-discrimination group in Britain, fashioned on King\xe2\x80\x99s nonviolent, pro-integration model.'b'Meanwhile, British liberals looked to the American movement as a template for resolving Britain\xe2\x80\x99s immigrant problems. Politicians seeking to introduce civil rights legislation met with King in Britain and traveled to the United States on fact-finding visits. (King wasn\xe2\x80\x99t alone: in 1967 the archbishop of Canterbury even invited the Temptations, in London on tour, to drop into Lambeth Palace so he could get some advice on race relations.)'b'But even as King sought to get his message out, the watching world repackaged that message for other purposes. Mr. Stephenson\xe2\x80\x99s bus boycott was actually a strike by drivers seeking better working conditions rather than a copy of Montgomery\xe2\x80\x99s passenger boycott, and the timing had more to do with the visit of the touring West Indies cricket team than with King\xe2\x80\x99s efforts in Alabama eight years previously.'b'Meanwhile, Communist governments in Eastern Europe celebrated King as the champion of the \xe2\x80\x9cother America,\xe2\x80\x9d the America that had been subjugated by capitalist tyranny. In Italy, the Catholic left portrayed him as a political activist and ignored the fact that he was also a Protestant preacher.'b'And in white-majority countries with racial minorities, from New Zealand to Western Europe, commentators lauded King\xe2\x80\x99s role in the turmoil \xe2\x80\x9cover there,\xe2\x80\x9d while taking comfort that any problems at home, by comparison, could not be too bad. Conservative politicians in Britain hailed King as a nonviolent role model for immigrants who were threatening to fight for their rights (and much better than another popular black American icon and visitor to Britain, Malcolm X).'b'Today, King\xe2\x80\x99s legacy abroad remains profound, and as contested as ever. In Britain, his statue stands above the west entrance to Westminster Abbey, while the American civil rights movement is among the top five most popular history subjects in high schools.'b'But absent from Westminster is a statue of a black British figure, and black British history remains on the sidelines at schools and universities. Looking to King helps us think about racial justice, but he can be used to forget about it, too.'b'Using and abusing King is perhaps inevitable abroad, where he was so well publicized but little understood. Yet it has echoes here in the United States, where he should be known best. Since moving to America this past summer, I have heard the man who marched for jobs and freedom invoked by all sides of the political spectrum. African-American activists seek to honor his legacy by calling for race-based remedies to combat stubborn racial inequality. Conservatives invoke his color-blind ideology to remove those same race-based remedies.'b'At the 'b'dedication of the King memorial'b' on the National Mall last fall, President Obama even used King\xe2\x80\x99s teachings to challenge the current polarization of politics: \xe2\x80\x9cHe calls on us to stand in the other person\xe2\x80\x99s shoes, to see through their eyes, to understand their pain.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As King calls on us today, everyone, it seems, can call on him.'b'Is 'b'Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act'b' still necessary? That provision requires nine states and some counties and towns with histories of severe racial discrimination to get approval from the Justice Department or a court before changing their voting procedures. The question hovers over 'b'three consolidated cases'b' the Supreme Court 'b'heard'b' last week on redistricting for legislative and Congressional seats in Texas, a state governed by Section 5.'b'The cases involve two sets of redistricting maps. One was drawn by the Republican-controlled Legislature. It starkly favored Republicans, even though population growth came from new Hispanic residents, who tend to vote Democratic. Hispanic residents sued, and a federal court in San Antonio drew a second set of maps that created new districts where minorities would be the majority.'b'The procedural issue is whether the San Antonio court\xe2\x80\x99s maps should be used for the state\xe2\x80\x99s April primary if the Texas Legislature does not get approval for its maps from a special court in Washington, or whether Texas can use its maps even without that approval.'b'Although Texas has not raised the constitutionality of Section 5, the facts of these cases help explain why the section is crucial and why the justices must rule in a way that preserves its shield against discrimination. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said last week, \xe2\x80\x9cSection 5 says you can\xe2\x80\x99t draw new maps unless they have been precleared.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Without the Section 5 requirement, the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s maps would have gone into effect immediately. The burden would have been on challengers to prove the maps were unacceptable. When Congress debated reauthorization of the statute in 2006, Republicans contended that Section 5 had served its purpose and that states covered by it should no longer have to prove their good intentions.'b'Democrats prevailed by gathering an enormous amount of 'b'evidence 'b'of continuing discrimination in proposed voting changes, particularly in Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas, all states covered by Section 5. Congress reauthorized Section 5 because it saw the risk that many states would try to circumvent the Voting Rights Act. It concluded that discrimination in voter registration and voting and the dilution of minority votes can still be prevented only through the preclearance process and that there would be more discriminatory efforts without the law\xe2\x80\x99s deterrent force.'b'In 15 states, cutbacks in the voting rights of young and poor voters as well as minorities have been turned into law. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count contested discriminatory redistricting by Texas and other states. In breaching the right to vote, these efforts violate the fundamental civil right. They underscore a continuing need for Section 5.'b'Queens has been harder hit by foreclosures than any other New York borough, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation believes it has found a culprit. Last July, the F.B.I. accused Edul Ahmad, a local broker, of a $50 million mortgage fraud, saying he lured fellow immigrants into subprime mortgages, inflated the values of their properties and concealed his involvement in deals that were ruinous for scores, if not hundreds, of borrowers. Mr. Ahmad pleaded not guilty, and posted $2.5 million bail. Now, according to court papers, as 'b'reported'b' in The Times, he is plea-bargaining with federal prosecutors.'b'Whatever Mr. Ahmad did or did not do, one thing is sure: he did not act alone. The attention Mr. Ahmad has drawn highlights the relative lack of scrutiny of the big banks and their senior executives. Big banks created demand and provided credit for dubious mortgage loans, which they bundled into securities and sold to investors. If not for reckless lending and heedless securitizing, there would have been no mortgage bubble and no mortgage bust \xe2\x80\x94 and, in all probability, no Edul Ahmad.'b'There have been some prominent civil suits with settlements and fines, including the $550 million deal between Goldman Sachs and the Securities and Exchange Commission over the misleading of investors in a mortgage-backed investment. Bank of America, which bought Countrywide Financial in 2008, recently agreed to pay $335 million to settle a lawsuit by the Justice Department over Countrywide\xe2\x80\x99s practice of steering black and Hispanic borrowers to subprime loans while similarly qualified white borrowers got better terms. But such cases have been narrowly focused and rarely name top executives.'b'What is needed is leadership by President Obama on this issue. He should form an interagency task force to investigate and pursue potential civil and criminal wrongdoing by institutions and people whose conduct in the mortgage chain had the greatest economic impact.'b'That would mean focusing on the large banks and their top echelons. The investigators would need to include the departments of Justice and Housing and Urban Development, the S.E.C. and the Internal Revenue Service, as well as bank regulators, with the formal co-operation of the most aggressive state attorneys general. The task force would need a leader with the impulses of a crusading prosecutor.'b'The investigations to date have not had this character. The Goldman Sachs settlement, for instance, was over one security and put the blame on a midlevel banker. When executives have been personally penalized, the fines have been a fraction of the wealth they amassed during the bubble. From 2000 to 2008, Angelo Mozilo, the chief executive of Countrywide, received total compensation estimated at $521.5 million; in 2010, without admitting or denying any wrongdoing, he paid $67.5 million to settle civil fraud charges brought by the S.E.C. The Justice Department, for its part, decided not to pursue a possible criminal case against Mr. Mozilo.'b'Lawsuits by state attorneys general, notably in 'b'Massachusetts'b' and 'b'Nevada'b', may ultimately prove more revealing and helpful to wronged homeowners, because they tend to focus on foreclosure abuses by banks. New York\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, is building a comprehensive investigation of the mortgage chain from the origination and securitization of loans to banks\xe2\x80\x99 foreclosure practices. That may lead to more actors in the system being held accountable for creating the mortgage crisis. Mr. Ahmad is accused of swindling na\xc3\xafve borrowers in Queens. There is more to the mortgage mess than that.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have a dream,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Martin Luther King, in a speech that has lost none of its power to inspire. And some of that dream has come true. When King spoke in the summer of 1963, America was a nation that denied basic rights to millions of its citizens, simply because their skin was the wrong color. Today racism is no longer embedded in law. And while it has by no means been banished from the hearts of men, its grip is far weaker than once it was.'b'To say the obvious: to look at a 'b'photo'b' of President Obama with his cabinet is to see a degree of racial openness \xe2\x80\x94 and openness to women, too \xe2\x80\x94 that would have seemed almost inconceivable in 1963. When we observe Martin Luther King\xe2\x80\x99s Birthday, we have something very real to celebrate: the civil rights movement was one of America\xe2\x80\x99s finest hours, and it made us a nation truer to its own ideals.'b'Yet if King could see America now, I believe that he would be disappointed, and feel that his work was nowhere near done. He dreamed of a nation in which his children \xe2\x80\x9cwill not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\xe2\x80\x9d But what we actually became is a nation that judges people not by the color of their skin \xe2\x80\x94 or at least not as much as in the past \xe2\x80\x94 but by the size of their paychecks. And in America, more than in most other wealthy nations, the size of your paycheck is strongly correlated with the size of your father\xe2\x80\x99s paycheck.'b'Goodbye Jim Crow, hello class system.'b'Economic inequality isn\xe2\x80\x99t inherently a racial issue, and rising inequality would be disturbing even if there weren\xe2\x80\x99t a racial dimension. But American society being what it is, there are racial implications to the way our incomes have been pulling apart. And in any case, King \xe2\x80\x94 who was campaigning for higher wages when he was assassinated \xe2\x80\x94 would surely have considered soaring inequality an evil to be opposed.'b'So, about that racial dimension: In the 1960s it was widely assumed that ending overt discrimination would improve the economic as well as legal status of minority groups. And at first this seemed to be happening. Over the course of the 1960s and 1970s substantial numbers of black families moved into the middle class, and even into the upper middle class; the percentage of black households in the top 20 percent of the income distribution nearly doubled.'b'But around 1980 the relative economic position of blacks in America stopped improving. Why? An important part of the answer, surely, is that circa 1980 income disparities in the United States began to widen dramatically, turning us into a society more unequal than at any time since the 1920s.'b'Think of the income distribution as a ladder, with different people on different rungs. Starting around 1980, the rungs began moving ever farther apart, adversely affecting black economic progress in two ways. First, because many blacks were still on the lower rungs, they were left behind as income at the top of the ladder soared while income near the bottom stagnated. Second, as the rungs moved farther apart, the ladder became harder to climb.'b'The Times recently 'b'reported'b' on a well-established finding that still surprises many Americans when they hear about it: although we still see ourselves as the land of opportunity, we actually have less intergenerational economic mobility than other advanced nations. That is, the chances that someone born into a low-income family will end up with high income, or vice versa, are significantly lower here than in Canada or Europe.'b'And there\xe2\x80\x99s every reason to believe that our low economic mobility has a lot to do with our high level of income inequality.'b'Last week Alan Krueger, chairman of the president\xe2\x80\x99s Council of Economic Advisers, gave an important speech about income inequality, presenting a relationship he dubbed the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Gatsby Curve.\xe2\x80\x9d Highly unequal countries, he showed, have low mobility: the more unequal a society is, the greater the extent to which an individual\xe2\x80\x99s economic status is determined by his or her parents\xe2\x80\x99 status. And as Mr. Krueger pointed out, this relationship suggests that America in the year 2035 will have even less mobility than it has now, that it will be a place in which the economic prospects of children largely reflect the class into which they were born.'b'That is not a development we should meekly accept.'b'Mitt Romney says that we should discuss income inequality, if at all, only in \xe2\x80\x9cquiet rooms.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a time when people said the same thing about racial inequality. Luckily, however, there were people like Martin Luther King who refused to stay quiet. And we should follow their example today. For the fact is that rising inequality threatens to make America a different and worse place \xe2\x80\x94 and we need to reverse that trend to preserve both our values and our dreams.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Big Study Links Good Teachers to Lasting Gain'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 6):'b'This'b' study'b' reiterates what others have found before it: teacher effectiveness, which can be partly evaluated using test score data, has the power to affect the futures of innumerable students, for better or worse.

Overnight, the government had removed what it called the subsidy on fuel, and almost immediately, transport fares exploded and food prices rose astronomically. It used to cost 4,000 naira \xe2\x80\x94 about $25 \xe2\x80\x94 to fill my petrol tank. Then it cost 10,000 naira. When I stopped to buy okpa, a steam-cooked bean dish, from a street hawker, she said it was no longer 50 naira; it was now 100.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBecause of fuel subsidy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A relative who had traveled to her village for the holidays called me to say that she was stranded there, unable to return to her job in Lagos; she could not afford the bus fare, which had doubled in price.'b'Nigeria, one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest exporters of crude oil, does not have adequate refineries and so it imports most of its petrol. The government claims that it pays a subsidy to importers to keep the prices low, and that these companies defraud the government by inflating their costs. Perhaps that is true, but it is a strange reason for raising prices, as though the government is incapable of policing fraud. Politicians have long discussed ending the subsidy, but no one expected it to happen when and how it did. There was something frightening about the abruptness of such a dramatic change, a sense of lurching, a violent uncertainty that captured the general mood in Nigeria.'b'Nigerians, particularly in the heavily Muslim north, live in fear of violence from the 'b'Islamist group Boko Haram'b'. More than a hundred people have been shot to death or killed in bombings in recent weeks. My uncle, who lived most of his adult life in the northern town of Maiduguri, recently moved back east after a Boko Haram bomb exploded mere feet from his bookshop. Now he is struggling to start over, a man past middle age, grasping for hope. I saw him on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day. He said he had only barely been able to afford the rent for a new shop in Awka, our state capital, and now he had to deal with the new price of petrol \xe2\x80\x94 he will have to spend much more on transportation and, since there is hardly ever any electricity, on the generator to power his shop. \xe2\x80\x9cHow will I cope?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.'b'Many government officials argued that the price increase would eventually benefit Nigerians, but they were unable to clearly articulate how. They made economic arguments that were abstract at best and nonsensical at worst. Sometimes the arguments conflicted: on one hand, we were told that the government would go bankrupt if it continued to pay the subsidy, and on the other, we were told that the subsidy would still be spent, this time on \xe2\x80\x9cinfrastructure,\xe2\x80\x9d a vague word if ever there was one. Only yesterday, the government announced it would restore some part of the subsidy.'b'Like many Nigerians, I am infuriated \xe2\x80\x94 and puzzled \xe2\x80\x94 by the actions of a government that appears to be indifferent to if not contemptuous of its people. The idea that in a democracy, the government needs to persuade the majority of its citizens, eludes our leaders, perhaps because of the stubborn legacy of military rule, which ended only in 1998. We civilians, in turn, deeply distrust the government, because of our long experience with corrupt leaders. It is obvious that this price increase, the abruptness of it, the murky justifications for it, the government\xe2\x80\x99s inability to properly engage about it, the destructive consequences it will have for millions in a country where there are few government services, will only further calcify the cynicism of a people who are already very cynical. Yet our leaders did it anyway. The message sent to Nigerians is this: You don\xe2\x80\x99t matter. We don\xe2\x80\x99t value you.'b'Economic arguments are useful, but so are human arguments, which seem alarmingly lost on the Nigerian government. Prices have gone up but salaries remain the same. A driver in Lagos who earns 25,000 naira, about $152 a month, would have had to spend almost three-quarters of his salary on transportation to and from work, and this is before he would have to pay for food and, if he has children, for school fees. In Nigeria we like to say that we can \xe2\x80\x9cmanage,\xe2\x80\x9d but it is almost impossible to see how many people could manage that.'b'We are an oil-producing nation and it is not unreasonable for Nigerians to expect affordable petrol, nor is it unreasonable for Nigerians to expect more from a democratic government. A friend of mine, after calculating how much she would now spend getting to work in Lagos, said, with her eyes alive with rage, \xe2\x80\x9cOur senators make'b' $100,000'b' a month if you count their salaries and allowances. A month! In dollars! They live in government houses and have government cars. And none of them pay for their own petrol.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Barack Obama released his tax records when he ran for president in 2008. So did Richard Nixon in 1968. In fact, so did George Romney in that same campaign.'b'But, in 2012, Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts and onetime chief executive of a private equity firm, is still hedging about whether he will do so.'b'Candidates for the presidency are not legally required to release their tax records, but they generally have for many years now \xe2\x80\x94 because American voters have a right to know how the men and women who want to be president make their money.'b'As recently as last month, Mr. Romney was refusing to make his income tax returns public should he become the nominee, much less allow voters to see them before Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s primary in South Carolina. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t intend to release the tax returns. I don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Romney told Chuck Todd of NBC News in December.'b'But public pressure to release his tax records may finally be getting through to the Republican front-runner. On Monday night, during a debate in South Carolina, Mr. Romney said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf that has been the tradition, I\xe2\x80\x99m not opposed to doing that.\xe2\x80\x9d But, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cTime will tell.\xe2\x80\x9d He also said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll keep that open.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he said he \xe2\x80\x9cprobably\xe2\x80\x9d would do it only if he became the nominee.'b'There is no \xe2\x80\x9cif\xe2\x80\x9d about the tradition. President Obama released eight years\xe2\x80\x99 worth of tax returns when he pursued his party\xe2\x80\x99s nomination four years ago. He has already made public his complete return for 2010, as well as other tax filings since he took office, as presidents of both parties have done for decades.'b'On the Republican side, only Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has been as forthcoming. For years, Governor Perry has routinely made his tax filing public. At least Newt Gingrich has said he plans to release his returns on Thursday.'b'Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on secrecy is impossible to defend now that he appears to be closing in on the nomination and questions have intensified about his personal finances and record as a venture capitalist. The financial disclosure required of presidential candidates is more limited than the detailed information contained in tax returns.'b'It is not too much to ask someone seeking the nation\xe2\x80\x99s highest office to sacrifice some personal privacy to reassure voters that they have no hidden entanglements.'b'And this is not the only place where secrecy has been a problem. Unlike Mr. Obama or John McCain, or George W. Bush in earlier contests, this year\xe2\x80\x99s presidential hopefuls have refused to identify the \xe2\x80\x9cbundlers\xe2\x80\x9d who reel in many hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions for their campaigns, disclosing only those bundlers who are registered lobbyists, as the law requires.'b'Sarah Palin got it right last week when she supported calls for Mr. Romney to release recent tax returns before the South Carolina vote, along with information bearing on his record at Bain Capital, the private equity firm. Mr. Romney also can look to his own father, George. He released a dozen years of tax returns when he ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination in 1968, leading Richard Nixon to follow suit.'b'According to 'b'a survey commissioned'b' by the 'b'American Bankers Association'b' last year, 62 percent of Americans preferred to do their banking online rather than at a branch or ATM. Banks and their online customers also lost more than $2 billion in 2010 because of payment card scams, fraudulent wire transfers and other Internet swindles, according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as reported by The Financial Times.'b'Losses have declined from their peak of $8 billion in 2006, as banks have gotten better at preventing fraud. But criminals aren\xe2\x80\x99t giving up and regulators have decided that current security systems based on passwords, tokens and cookies aren\xe2\x80\x99t strong enough.'b'Starting this month, they want financial institutions to add a new layer that detects unusual patterns of activity \xe2\x80\x94 like a volley of transfers to an account in Russia \xe2\x80\x94 in real time. Too many banks are not yet up to speed with the new guidelines. Regulations limit losses for individual victims of a cyberstrike to $500, forcing the bank to cover the balance. But businesses are not covered, and small companies are especially vulnerable because they move more cash around than individuals and cannot afford high-technology defenses.'b'New malware has been designed to get around the security fixes of recent years. Qakbot, which has been infecting computers since 2009, downloads from infected Web sites and piggy backs on legitimate online transactions to evade the security provided by one-time, changing passwords. The Zeus trojan propagates through spam and is estimated to have infected 3.6 million computers in the United States. It waits for users to log on to their bank accounts and steals their information as they type it. It can even replace the bank\xe2\x80\x99s Web pages with its own on the victim\xe2\x80\x99s browser to entice the user to divulge even more information.'b'If the new guidelines fail to stem the tide of online fraud, regulators have suggested additional possible measures: Banks could require customers to authorize transactions through two devices, like a computer and a phone; they could limit the size or number of transactions allowed; and they could block connection to bank servers from unknown or suspect Internet addresses.'b'Regulators will need to push bankers to improve security, especially at community and regional banks whose systems lag far behind those at large multinational institutions. The safety instructions are guidelines \xe2\x80\x94 not make-or-break rules \xe2\x80\x94 that will figure among many others when regulators evaluate the general safety and soundness of banks\xe2\x80\x99 operations. That may not be enough.'b'The Financial Times reported that a poll of bankers done by a bank technology firm in November suggested that 40 percent of banks weren\xe2\x80\x99t even aware that regulators want them to adopt new measures to detect anomalous online transactions.'b'Suffolk County on Long Island got a new county executive this month, 'b'Steve Bellone'b'. In his inaugural speech, he went down the list of things he intended to do, like fix the county\xe2\x80\x99s budget woes, hold the line on taxes, make government more efficient, create jobs and affordable housing, and invest in \xe2\x80\x9cclean water infrastructure.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'So far, so mundane. It\xe2\x80\x99s what he said in the rest of his speech that was interesting.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor those who are willing to work hard and are looking for a better life,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Bellone said, \xe2\x80\x9cregardless of where you came from \xe2\x80\x94 we want you in Suffolk County.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He told a story about his Irish immigrant grandparents and the tiny apartment in Washington Heights they once shared with his mother, aunts and uncles. He said he had gone back there recently with his mother, in her first visit to the old neighborhood in nearly 50 years, and they were welcomed by a Dominican family. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are stronger together,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Bellone said in remembering that scene.'b'A good share of his speech was devoted to the importance of immigration, a tacit attempt to reverse Suffolk\xe2\x80\x99s reputation as a place riven by anti-immigrant sentiments and violence. That reputation worsened in the two terms of Mr. Bellone\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor, Steve Levy, who became nationally known for his harsh tone and hard line on illegal immigration. That belligerence won Mr. Levy high poll numbers. But it also left him unable to bring the community together when it had to confront the notorious murder of an Ecuadorean man in an attack by local teenagers.'b'Mr. Bellone\xe2\x80\x99s most daunting job is fixing county finances. But many residents were surely relieved and grateful to hear him speak to immigration tensions immediately. Of course, Mr. Levy himself, in an inaugural speech in 2004, spoke of \xe2\x80\x9can island that assures that people named Diaz, Chen, Patel and Ali can live in the same fine neighborhoods as citizens named Smith and Jones.\xe2\x80\x9d Only after he settled in did things go tragically off track.'b'A Federal District Court late last month wisely upheld a 2010 Maryland law that counts prison inmates as residents in their home communities for purposes of redistricting, rather than at the prisons where they are incarcerated.'b'The practice of counting inmates as local \xe2\x80\x9cresidents\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 even though they lack the right to vote \xe2\x80\x94 has been used to inflate the power of mainly rural areas where prisons tend to placed. It undercuts the power of the urban districts where the inmates actually live and where they generally return when they are released.'b'There are about 1.5 million people in prison nationally. Prison-based gerrymandering can easily be used to unfairly shift power from one part of a state to another. In Maryland, this gerrymandering distorted the political landscape. In one county commission district, for example, inmates made up 64 percent of the population. In one state legislative district, nearly a fifth of the population were inmates.'b'The state law was explicitly drafted to advance the interests of minority citizens, who are disproportionately represented among inmates and who stand to lose most when political power is shifted away from their home districts. A small group of voters challenged the law, arguing, in essence, that it was illegal for the state to correct for prisoner-related population distortions.'b'The court rightly dismissed this argument, adding that the state was within its rights to adjust census data for redistricting purposes. This sound ruling should encourage more states to join Maryland, New York, Delaware and California in adopting similar anti-gerrymandering laws.'b'What if 'b'Jamie Dimon'b' is right?'b'What if the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase is not just blowing smoke when he complains that the country \xe2\x80\x94 and, indeed, the world \xe2\x80\x94 has imposed so many new rules on the banking industry, some of them overlapping, others seeming to contradict each other, yet others whose sole purpose seems to be to weigh down the industry, that they threaten to do as much harm as good? Last summer, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, Dimon confronted Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, at a conference 'b'and asked him'b': \xe2\x80\x9cHas anyone bothered to study the cumulative effect of these things?\xe2\x80\x9d Just last week, during JPMorgan\xe2\x80\x99s earnings call with analysts, Dimon complained that Europe\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cregulatory policy, government policy, central bank policy \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s not coordinated. It\xe2\x80\x99s making the situation worse, not better.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Like most nonbankers, I\xe2\x80\x99ve tended to roll my eyes at Dimon\xe2\x80\x99s continuous lamentations. Surely, given all the harm the banks did to the country, regulations aimed at preventing a repeat of the financial crisis struck me as being worth whatever cost they imposed on the industry. And, yes, I admit to a little schadenfreude as well. (To be fair to Dimon, he is not completely opposed to all the new regulations. He just comes across that way when he\xe2\x80\x99s in rant mode.)'b'What has caught me up short recently is the emergence of a new critic of the banking regulations that have been pouring forth from Washington and Europe. Her name is Karen Petrou, and she is the managing partner of 'b'Federal Financial Analytics'b', a consulting firm that, among other things, analyzes bank regulations for clients.'b'Unlike many in the banking industry, Petrou is not ideologically opposed to regulation. For instance, she was a critic of the lack of regulation that allowed so many sleazy subprime mortgage originators to emerge from the precrisis ooze. Yet, now, she\xe2\x80\x99s worried about something different: that the hundreds of new mandates required by the Dodd-Frank law are creating a new kind of risk. She calls it \xe2\x80\x9ccomplexity risk.\xe2\x80\x9d As she put it in a speech she delivered last week in New York: \xe2\x80\x9cIf we don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the cross-cutting effects and inherent contradictions in all of the stringent standards now being written into final form, we risk doing real damage to the sound, stable and \xe2\x80\x94 yes \xe2\x80\x94 profitable financial industry regulators say they support and the economies sorely need.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In 'b'a paper she wrote'b' in November, Petrou laid out a number of examples of new regulatory proposals that were either mind-bogglingly complex or contradictory \xe2\x80\x94 or both. For instance, she told me recently, bank board directors will have 184 more things they will have to acknowledge responsibility for under the latest systemic standards. \xe2\x80\x9cI think boards have to be responsible for what happens at their institutions,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut requiring them to be on the front lines of forward-looking cash flow is ridiculous.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She also points to a contradiction in the way the Too Big to Fail institutions are being dealt with. On the one hand, Dodd-Frank is very clear that if a big bank becomes insolvent, there can be no taxpayer bailout. It must be wound down, just like any other bank. Yet, at the same time, she says, the federal and international regulators are adding a host of special Too Big to Fail capital requirements and rules. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are acting as if these institutions are still too big to fail. The two thrusts are incompatible.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Why does complexity risk matter? One reason is that the more complex the rules are, the greater the likelihood that smart bankers will find ways to game them. Another is that contradictory regulations, however well meaning, simply don\xe2\x80\x99t make the system safer. But the most important reason is that complexity risk is having an effect on business \xe2\x80\x94 and that\xe2\x80\x99s not helping the still-fragile economy.'b'Petrou says that in her own practice she has seen deals fall through \xe2\x80\x94 especially in the mortgage industry \xe2\x80\x94 because nobody can figure out how the new rules will be applied. Given how badly the country needs a revived housing industry, this is nothing short of tragic.'b'In her paper, Petrou offers a series of solutions, revolving around simpler regulations, a reliance on market discipline and transparency. She also calls for the regulators themselves to be held accountable, something that is nowhere to be found in Dodd-Frank, despite their obvious shortcomings in the years leading to the financial crisis.'b'However you feel about banks \xe2\x80\x94 and I know that many people harbor enormous, justifiable anger at what they did \xe2\x80\x94 our economy can\xe2\x80\x99t function without them. And they needed to be regulated. But three years ago, overly complex securities were one of the root causes of the crisis. So why, then, do we have faith that overly complex regulations will prevent the next crisis? Sad but true: they won\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'Sumter, S.C.'b'When I started covering presidential primaries, the best part was getting to know the candidates. We journalists would ride around in vans and buses with them and get an intimate look at what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to endure this soul-destroying process. But the ubiquity of Web cams and tweets has ended that off-the-record culture. As the technology gets more open, the lines of political communications become more closed.'b'Now the best part is meeting the people who come to the rallies. It\xe2\x80\x99s best to get to the events an hour early and treat the waiting crowd like a cocktail party. First, you ask people about the local economy. Then you ask them about their lives (about which they are always interesting). Then you ask them about what they think of the issues and candidates (they generally repeat the banalities they have heard one of us pundits utter on TV the day before).'b'This past weekend in South Carolina I met, among many others, a soldier leaving for Afghanistan who quoted the Book of Revelation from his iPhone, a Vietnam veteran who movingly described the death of his first wife, a textile factory middle manager whose job got sent to El Salvador and a pawnshop manager who supports Ron Paul and said he has clients who buy a new gun every time the government does something they don\xe2\x80\x99t like.'b'I came here wondering how voters would react to the charge that Mitt Romney was a corporate vulture when he ran the private equity firm Bain Capital. I asked dozens of people. They were all familiar with the attacks, thanks to the TV ads. Almost everybody thought the charges were ridiculous, even supporters of Newt Gingrich.'b'A realtor looked at me dismissively: Sometimes deals work, he said, sometimes they don\xe2\x80\x99t. You have to be efficient to survive. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way capitalism works. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s opponents probably would have been smarter to hit him for being a flip-flopper, not a businessman.'b'I was also struck, as in New Hampshire and Iowa, by the mood of this year\xe2\x80\x99s rallies. Republican audiences this year want a restoration. America once had strong values, they believe, but we have gone astray. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go back and rediscover what we had. Heads nod enthusiastically every time a candidate touches this theme.'b'I agree with the sentiment, but it makes for an incredibly backward-looking campaign. I sometimes wonder if the Republican Party has become the receding roar of white America as it pines for a way of life that will never return.'b'The other pleasure of covering campaigns is getting to play American Idol judge, evaluating the political performances.'b'Mitt Romney is never going to be confused for Pericles on the stump. Every sigh and utterance is prescripted, so watching his rallies is like watching the 19,000th performance of the road show of \xe2\x80\x9cCats.\xe2\x80\x9d And he has terrible reaction responses. When somebody else is talking and he means to show agreement, he mugs like someone from a bad silent movie. His wife, Ann, is much warmer and more natural on stage.'b'But Romney\xe2\x80\x99s awkwardness seems to endear him to audiences, because he\xe2\x80\x99s trying so hard. He spends an enormous amount of time after the speeches shaking hands, taking pictures and holding babies. Beads of sweat form on his forehead as he throws himself graciously into the crowds. He also has a nice startle response. When something unexpected happens, his face lights up and you get a burst of happy humanity out of him.'b'Newt Gingrich\xe2\x80\x99s presentations are forceful. He has a genius for pithy formulations and a consistent theme: The solutions to everything are obvious if only the idiots would get out of my way.'b'Ron Paul\xe2\x80\x99s supporters are so grateful. The world was once confusing, but then they read \xe2\x80\x9cEnd the Fed\xe2\x80\x9d and the scales fell from their eyes. Paul himself is fascinating because as some smart person observed (I\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten who), he thinks serially, not causally. The income tax happened 'b'and'b' the Patriot Act happened 'b'and'b' the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, bailed out the banks 'b'and'b' job growth stinks. Paul doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bother with logical links. He just strings events together and assumes causation.'b'I brought my 12-year-old son on this latest trip. My rule is that if a candidate can\xe2\x80\x99t relate well to a 12-year-old, they\xe2\x80\x99ll never win a general election. He approached all the candidates, and they were all wonderful except Gingrich. But that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Gingrich\xe2\x80\x99s fault. My son, whose heroes include John Boehner and Tupac Shakur, picked an argument about gay marriage. Gingrich engaged, but after 10 seconds signaled security to brush my kid away.'b'Rick Perry ran a poor campaign but seems like the guy you\xe2\x80\x99d most want to have a beer with. He took the time to tell my son how important it is to study hard and prepare for whatever you do.'b'Dad really appreciated that one.'b'At debates his opponents sported ties with colors from the flag: blue or, better yet, blistering Republican red.'b'He wore pink.'b'Onstage and on the stump, they bashed Europe and threatened a trade war with China.'b'He burst spontaneously into Mandarin.'b'For a while Jon Huntsman was the brother from another Republican planet, one where climate change is likely and evolution inarguable. Where it isn\xe2\x80\x99t girlie Limbaugh bait to sit, as he did, for a 'b'Vogue profile'b' illustrated with Annie Leibovitz photographs. Where you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to malign the Democratic president as the devil incarnate \xe2\x80\x94 pitchfork, cloven hooves and all.'b'How alien and refreshing he was.'b'And how depressingly he snapped back into line on Monday, exiting the presidential race by surrendering to the earth\xe2\x80\x99s gravity and reverting to its familiar partisan cant.'b'In his 'b'withdrawal speech'b' in Myrtle Beach, S.C., he declared that the need to get rid of President Obama made this \xe2\x80\x9cthe most important election of our lifetime.\xe2\x80\x9d Not so long ago he worked for and 'b'praised'b' that selfsame president.'b'He said that the remaining candidate \xe2\x80\x9cbest equipped to defeat Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x9d was Mitt Romney \xe2\x80\x94 and endorsed him. Just last week, Romney was so \xe2\x80\x9cdetached from the problems that Americans are facing,\xe2\x80\x9d according to Huntsman, that he was \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely unelectable.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He remarked on the country\xe2\x80\x99s need for \xe2\x80\x9cbold and principled leadership.\xe2\x80\x9d Note the \xe2\x80\x9cprincipled\xe2\x80\x9d part. And remember, as Huntsman tries to make you forget, that videos on his Web site and his YouTube channel variously labeled Romney a \xe2\x80\x9cpretzel candidate,\xe2\x80\x9d an expert at the \xe2\x80\x9cbackflip\xe2\x80\x9d and, most florid of all, \xe2\x80\x9ca perfectly lubricated weather vane.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s one slippery inconstancy metaphor.'b'On Monday those videos were suddenly 'b'gone'b', as Michael D. Shear noted on The Times\xe2\x80\x99s political blog. And Huntsman\xe2\x80\x99s defeat was complete, not merely because he lost but because conventional politics \xe2\x80\x94 with all its compromises, hypocrisy and obeisance \xe2\x80\x94 won.'b'Of course former rivals morph into allies all the time. John McCain now makes goo-goo eyes at Romney. Hillary Clinton endures permanent jet lag for Obama.'b'But Huntsman\xe2\x80\x99s endorsement of Romney came much more quickly than it had to and in spite of a distaste for each other that\xe2\x80\x99s particularly intense.'b'Although both grew up wildly privileged, Romney sees Huntsman as someone who leaned too hard on his father, never forging his own private-sector success. And Huntsman\xe2\x80\x99s endorsement of McCain over him during the last Republican primary felt like a deliberate slap.'b'Huntsman 'b'by many accounts'b' seethed when Romney snagged, and benefited mightily from, a job that he was passed over for: the stewardship of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. He squirmed as Romney tacked this way and that in politics. In Huntsman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes he\xe2\x80\x99s a rudderless operator.'b'And in recent weeks Huntsman finally said as much, though he had begun his campaign with a pledge to take the high road and though, on Monday, he implored the remaining Republican candidates to cease \xe2\x80\x9can onslaught of negative and personal attacks not worthy of the American people.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'With Romney, Huntsman had succumbed to the unworthy, getting negative and personal and excising all context in order to slam the front-runner 'b'for saying'b', \xe2\x80\x9cI like being able to fire people.\xe2\x80\x9d The high road dipped into the mud.'b'From the start, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find any traction. He arrived late to a patch of moderate turf already cordoned off by another Mormon scion with very good hair, a very blonde wife and a very large brood of absurdly attractive children. To watch footage and see photographs of the Huntsman girls and then the Romney boys was to enter some cyber-political version of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Brady Bunch.\xe2\x80\x9d The two clans together tipped into wholesomeness overload.'b'Huntsman initially ran to Romney\xe2\x80\x99s left, though he possessed the more consistently conservative record. Even when he pivoted and embraced that, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t summon the gloom and invective that the anyone-but-Mitt crowd craved. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the spleen for it.'b'A sort of cool, bland reason oozed from him, and until the last two weeks a certain political expediency seemed beyond him. Then again his personality and past never got worked over by the Romney operation the way, say, Rick Perry\xe2\x80\x99s and Newt Gingrich\xe2\x80\x99s did. He who never surges never need be squashed.'b'Huntsman is unlikely to land on the 2012 ticket. Does he have 2016 in mind?'b'By getting out before a miserable showing in the South Carolina primary and the exodus of an additional candidate or two, he guaranteed himself more news coverage and a greater air of importance than he might have received afterward.'b'And by hopping without pause on the Romney bandwagon, he hastened his journey back from party outlier to dutiful soldier. Reflecting Monday on his campaign experience, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have seen the very best of America.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice wasn\xe2\x80\x99t persuasive.'b'His mood matched his tie. Both were blue.'b'Ballston Lake, N.Y.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTHE Adirondacks are preserved forever,\xe2\x80\x9d Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller famously boasted after passage of the Adirondack Park Agency ('b'A.P.A.'b') Land Use law of 1973. The A.P.A. law calls for precious natural resources of the park to be preserved and development of its private lands carefully planned to ensure compatibility with the adjacent, publicly owned Forest Preserve, which our state constitution says must be \xe2\x80\x9cforever wild.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Of course, nothing is preserved forever. Protective laws are not self-executing and require spirited people to apply and renew them. Rockefeller\xe2\x80\x99s agency did stand up for the law in the 1970s when massive second-home subdivisions with names like Horizon and Ton-Da-Lay planned for remote forests were stopped. In the late 1980s, Gov. 'b'Mario M. Cuomo'b'\xe2\x80\x99s A.P.A. prevented Patten Corporation from exploiting this magnificent mountain landscape \xe2\x80\x94 which is larger than the state of Massachusetts and larger than Yellowstone, Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Glacier and Olympic national parks combined \xe2\x80\x94 to make a fast buck.'b'Now comes a serious test for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. He, like his predecessors, says the park is a treasure that must be protected. His A.P.A. (the governor names the agency\xe2\x80\x99s chair, and all of its members are either gubernatorial nominations, requiring senate confirmation, or state agency appointments) has been handed the hearing record on the sprawling 'b'Adirondack Club and Resort'b', the largest second-home subdivision application that the A.P.A. has seen in 35 years. During the agency\xe2\x80\x99s January meeting, this Wednesday through Friday in Ray Brook, N.Y., the A.P.A. will decide whether to permit 706 residential units, 332 buildings and 15 miles of new roads, sewer, water and electrical lines spread over 6,235 forested acres with sensitive streams, ponds and wetlands on rugged terrain several miles from 'b'Tupper Lake'b' \xe2\x80\x94 in the very heart of the Adirondack Park.'b'If permitted, the project would stand the 39-year-old A.P.A. law on its head and establish a dangerous precedent for the park\xe2\x80\x99s fragile, remote backcountry. More than three-quarters of the project site lies within 'b'Resource Management'b' \xe2\x80\x94 under the law, the park\xe2\x80\x99s most protected private land zone \xe2\x80\x94 the legislative purpose of which is to \xe2\x80\x9cprotect the delicate physical and biological resources ... and preserve the open spaces that are essential and basic to the unique character of the park.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This project would spread 82 large second homes, including 39 so-called great camps, throughout this zone, with a serious impact on sensitive habitats and wildlife, essentially replacing local hunters and foresters with private driveways and \xe2\x80\x9cNo Trespassing\xe2\x80\x9d signs. A respected conservation biologist, Dr. Michael Klemens, testified at the public hearing last April that \xe2\x80\x9cthe club and resort is classic sprawl on steroids.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt spreads negative ecological impacts out across the landscape,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a train wreck resulting from a process that does not allow for understanding natural systems in the first place.\xe2\x80\x9d A smarter alternative, he said, would develop a complete understanding of the project site and only then plan houses in a more compact design that avoids sensitive areas.'b'In exchange for risking such damage to the Adirondacks, some might expect a tremendous economic return. Yet the applicants have no track record developing land or selling lots inside the Adirondack Park. Nor do they have the money to construct the project on their own. The county Industrial Development Agency is being asked for $36 million in private revenue bonds to fund the infrastructure.'b'During the hearing, the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s marketing and fiscal studies were shown to be incomplete, insubstantial and misleading. Evidence suggested that the resort\xe2\x80\x99s inflated sales projections are founded largely upon the speculative dreams of the applicant. One impartial expert in resort development, David Norden, said during the hearing last June that the market for such a remote project \xe2\x80\x9cis very limited ... and as such the project carries a relatively high risk profile.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis project does not possess the primary characteristics of resorts most likely to succeed as we come out of the recession,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. With sales likely to fall well below projections, tax revenues will also fall well below the mark, Mr. Norden and other experts maintained. Major investments in Big Tupper Ski Area, the most broadly supported aspect of the project, are delayed to its latter phases.'b'Other experts testified that if real estate sales are slow and the project stalls, local residents could be stuck with the operation and maintenance of miles of new roads and sewer lines leading to only a few new homes. Furthermore, the resort\xe2\x80\x99s owners won\xe2\x80\x99t pay taxes directly to the town or school district; they will make payments in lieu of taxes to private bondholders willing to invest in this risky enterprise. The taxing districts will get what\xe2\x80\x99s left over after these payments are made.'b'Since 1892, Adirondack Park has been not only of state and regional importance but also of great national and international significance. The park inspired the national wilderness system and is designated an 'b'International Biosphere Reserve'b'. Standards for building on this scale in the park should be as high as its mountains, and the law says they must be. The Adirondack Club and Resort sets a glaringly low standard, and the A.P.A. should deny it. Only then might we see an alternative that actually makes sense for the park\xe2\x80\x99s environment and marketplace and that concentrates redevelopment where it was intended \xe2\x80\x94 around Big Tupper Ski Area.'b'Will Governor Cuomo, like his father and Nelson Rockefeller, insist that the A.P.A. abide by its law? Or will he risk damaging a park beloved by millions and globally regarded as a model for sustaining people and wild nature?'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'For the first time in more than 60 years, politicians are arguing with great fervor about \xe2\x80\x9cright to work\xe2\x80\x9d laws \xe2\x80\x94 state laws that bar unions and employers from requiring that workers join unions or pay union dues without joining.'b'Currently 22 states have right-to-work laws, and Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s Legislature is now considering passing one, the first in a decade.'b'Beyond the hyperbole of employer and union groups are the two fundamental questions underlying right-to-work laws.'b'Unions ask, \xe2\x80\x9cShould workers who are covered by collective bargaining agreements be permitted to be \xe2\x80\x98free riders\xe2\x80\x99 and receive union protections and benefits without paying for them?\xe2\x80\x9d And employers ask, \xe2\x80\x9cShould workers be compelled to join or pay dues to organizations against their wishes?\xe2\x80\x9d This is nothing less than a clash between the basic free-rider and freedom of association arguments.'b'Right-to-work laws are found in the states with the lowest union membership (such as Texas, Alabama and South Carolina), but it is not clear whether membership is low because there are right-to-work laws and unions are discouraged from organizing, or if there are right-to-work laws because membership is initially low and thus unions lack political clout in these states.'b'Unions argue that right-to-work laws mean less revenues in the form of members\xe2\x80\x99 dues. If it costs them about $1,500 to organize each new member, unions can\xe2\x80\x99t see any return on their organizing investment in right-to-work law states.'b'But employers claim that without right-to-work laws, unions would organize more members, and as wages increase, jobs would be lost.'b'It will not be surprising, as the Republican primaries move to South Carolina and Florida, to hear the candidates energetically promote more right-to-work laws and even a national right-to-work law.'b'GARY CHAISON'b'\nWorcester, Mass., Jan. 17, 2012'b''b''b'The writer is a professor of industrial relations at the Graduate School of Management, Clark University.'b''b''b'\n'b'Editors\xe2\x80\x99 Note: 'b''b''b'We invite readers to respond to this letter for our Sunday Dialogue.

Claire Danes, the show\xe2\x80\x99s incandescent star, was nominated for, and then won, the Golden Globe for best actress in a TV drama series; the show also won for best TV drama. Why do I care? Because I know her character all too well.'b'Not in every sense, of course. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a blond C.I.A. agent, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never hunted down or fallen in love with suspected terrorists. But as fans of the show \xe2\x80\x94 including, it\xe2\x80\x99s said, President Obama \xe2\x80\x94 know, that\xe2\x80\x99s not the only important part of Carrie Mathison, the character played by Ms. Danes. Like me, Carrie has bipolar disorder.'b'My sister Meredith Stiehm is a writer and consulting producer for the show, and she drew on my experience with the disorder to portray Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s character. Not long ago, I retold the tale of my single manic episode to her, sharpening memories of that day in all its colors.'b'It was a painful testament to my sister\xe2\x80\x99s skill that scenes that might have been of just passing interest to other viewers pushed me to tears, because in a real way they carried an uncanny emotional resonance.'b'And yet for all that, I feel the show\xe2\x80\x99s creators, writers and producers, and Ms. Danes, have done us all a public service: perhaps, with the show\xe2\x80\x99s glowing reception, Americans can finally talk openly about bipolar disorder.'b'Meredith\xe2\x80\x99s interest in my condition is not, of course, limited to her work as a writer. After the manic episode landed me in the Johns Hopkins hospital years ago, Meredith stayed with me at home for a week to help me get back to the regular simplicity of sleeping and waking. One of the first things they tell you about the condition is that sleep really is the \xe2\x80\x9cchief nourisher in life\xe2\x80\x99s feast,\xe2\x80\x9d as Macbeth put it. I have a mild case, so sleep, and lithium under the care of a doctor, have helped me stay healthy ever since.'b'My sister knows my back pages well, and while writing the script, she asked me about that spell of several sunny October days. Dormant memories awakened: I was a reporter for The Baltimore Sun, and I was filing stories in the newsroom faster than ever before. It\xe2\x80\x99s strangely fitting that I worked in journalism, which at its best also has its share of frenetic late nights, deadlines and homing in on people. As a reporter at The Sun once said to me, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a manic-depressive business.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I know it. A \xe2\x80\x9chypomanic\xe2\x80\x9d state, which precedes an episode of mania, is in fact an enhanced, alert, productive mood where one can feel exhilarated and immune to life\xe2\x80\x99s dangers. I seemed to see into people\xe2\x80\x99s hearts when I smiled at them. My speech sped up so much few could understand me.'b'I ran around Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s Inner Harbor at high speed, exulting in all my energy. For several days, I woke up at dawn to see the sunrise and take pictures of it. I felt sure something big was going to happen soon in Baltimore and only I could foresee it.'b'Similarly, a haunted Carrie is convinced that a big terrorist attack is looming large. Her furious focus on her quarry under time pressure leads to sleepless nights and reckless risks, behavior that is both symptom and contributing cause of bipolar illness. Her elevated mood cycles higher and higher, and she falls rapturously in love with the married Marine who she thinks is working for Al Qaeda, played with minute precision by 'b'Damian Lewis'b'. Viewers can\xe2\x80\x99t totally dismiss her visions \xe2\x80\x94 but then again, she\xe2\x80\x99s not rational. In the hospital ward, she demands a green pen to write everything down, her voice racing faster and faster. Meredith had bottled my mercurial emotions so exactly it hurt.'b'Bipolar extremes can be truly hard to watch, excruciating even in memory. To see that experience depicted so intensely by Ms. Danes was like peering at a portrait gallery of my own psyche.'b'As I recovered, I found comfort in company. My colleagues could not have been more gracious. But at the end of the show\xe2\x80\x99s first season (spoiler alert), poor Carrie has lost her job and appears left in a lonely place, about to undergo electroconvulsive therapy.'b'However, contrary to widespread belief, electroconvulsive therapy is extremely effective. A family friend, Dr. Leon Rosenberg, a geneticist and former dean of Yale Medical School, has the same malady. As a patient overwhelmed by suicidal depression, he made remarkable progress after electroconvulsive therapy. As a doctor, he 'b'described'b' his own case in a medical journal and discusses his descent and recovery with students.'b'Yes, the show cuts close to home at points, but it gets the lead character\xe2\x80\x99s story right. How rare to see a sparkling and spirited representation of what it\xe2\x80\x99s actually like to walk through life with bipolar disorder. So let a thousand conversations bloom. Secrets held up to light and air lose their power in the public square. Spies know it as keepers, and writers know it as tellers.'b'A few items came across the desk last week that underscore the challenge America faces in making policy toward the Islamist parties that are emerging as the early beneficiaries of the uprisings across the Arab world. The first was a news article about the Jan. 11 meeting in Cairo between Bill Burns, a deputy secretary of state, and Muhammad Morsi, the chairman of the Muslim Brotherhood\xe2\x80\x99s political party, during which Morsi said his party \xe2\x80\x9cbelieves in the importance of U.S.-Egyptian relations,\xe2\x80\x9d but said they \xe2\x80\x9cmust be balanced.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Two days later came a report from the Middle East Media Research Institute, which tracks the Arab media, about recent writings on the Muslim Brotherhood Web site, 'b'Ikhwanonline.com'b'.

One is that the Brotherhood and other Islamists are cleverly hoodwinking the na\xc3\xafve foreigners, feeding them the lines they want to hear. The other is that the Islamists never expected to be dominating Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s new Parliament \xe2\x80\x94 with more responsibility than other parties for completing the country\xe2\x80\x99s democratic transition, constitution-writing and election of a new president \xe2\x80\x94 and they are trying to figure out how to reconcile some of their ideology, with all of their new responsibilities.'b'My view is that both can be \xe2\x80\x94 and are \xe2\x80\x94 true at the same time.'b'In my mind, we all have to guard against lazy happy talk about the rise of the Islamist parties in Egypt (\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve met with them; they all seem reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d) and lazy determinism (\xe2\x80\x9cJust read what they say in Arabic; they clearly have a secret plan to take over Egypt\xe2\x80\x9d).'b'In the happy talk department, please don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me that the rule of Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s Islamist Justice and Development Party, known as the A.K.P., proves that no one has anything to fear about Islamists taking power democratically. There is much I admire in the A.K.P.\xe2\x80\x99s performance. (The recent suggestion by Gov. Rick Perry of Texas that the A.K.P. is a party of \xe2\x80\x9cIslamic terrorists\xe2\x80\x9d is shockingly stupid.) But I will only cite the A.K.P. as a reassuring example of Islam and democracy in harmony after I see it lose an election and vacate power. That is the real test. As The Economist noted about the rule of the A.K.P. in Turkey in its Nov. 26 issue, \xe2\x80\x9cAround 76 journalists are now behind bars\xe2\x80\x9d in Turkey, \xe2\x80\x9cmore than in China, many of them for supposed terrorist crimes. ... The West does not seem to notice the steady deterioration in human rights in Turkey, instead extolling it as a model for the Arab spring.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'American policy needs to be based on the assumption that, like all parties, Islamist parties contain moderates, centrists and hard-liners \xe2\x80\x94 and, in the case of the Muslim Brotherhood, lots of small businessmen. Which wing will dominate as they assume the responsibilities of governing is still an open question.'b'America needs to offer the Islamists firm, quiet (you can easily trigger a nationalist backlash) and patient engagement that says: \xe2\x80\x9cWe believe in free and fair elections, human rights, women\xe2\x80\x99s rights, minority rights, free markets, civilian control of the military, religious tolerance and the Egypt-Israel peace treaty, and we will offer assistance to anyone who respects those principles.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Egypt is not destined to be Iran, but the Muslim Brotherhood is not destined to be the Muslim version of Christian Democrats either. There is an evolution under way \xe2\x80\x94 this is a very plastic moment \xe2\x80\x94 and our best chance of having an effect is to make sure we deal in a principled way with the Islamists (and also, by the way, with Israel, as the Islamists will be watching for any double standard) and with the Egyptian Army. The Egyptian Army is also trying to figure out its role in this new Egypt. It is balancing its desire to protect its economic interests, avoid prosecution for any killings of demonstrators and maintain its status as guardian of Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s secular nationalist tradition. We need the Egyptian Army to play the constructive role that the Turkish Army once played \xe2\x80\x94 as midwife and protector of a gradual democratic transition \xe2\x80\x94 and not become the Pakistani Army, which evolved into a predatory institution dedicated to an aggressive foreign policy to justify its huge budget.'b'In short, the days of dealing with Egypt with one phone call to one man just one time are over. This is going to require really, really, really sophisticated diplomacy with multiple players \xe2\x80\x94 seven days a week.'b'CHARLESTON, S.C.'b'Watching Mitt Romney in the Myrtle Beach debate gave me acid flashbacks to Poppy Bush.'b'Maybe it was when Mittens decorously noted, in front of the raucous, bloodthirsty South Carolina crowd: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I get invited, I\xe2\x80\x99m delighted to be able to go hunting.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Maybe it was Romney sounding all 19th century recounting his sharp right turn on abortion as governor of Massachusetts: \xe2\x80\x9cI penned an op-ed in The Boston Globe and said I am pro-life.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Maybe it was when Rick Santorum pushed the front-runner to justify an attack ad financed by his \xe2\x80\x9csuper PAC\xe2\x80\x9d and Romney gazed at Santorum the way a C.E.O. regards an impudent mailroom clerk. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have plenty of time,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitt instructed him with a tight smile, looking as though he wanted to give him a copy of \xe2\x80\x9cTiffany\xe2\x80\x99s Table Manners for Teenagers.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get there.

Bush senior toured a flag factory and said the Pledge of Allegiance at every campaign stop; Romney parses patriotic songs and his advisers refer to Mormonism as \xe2\x80\x9cthe most American of religions.\xe2\x80\x9d Just as the Ivy League Poppy mocked Michael Dukakis for being a member of the \xe2\x80\x9cHarvard boutique,\xe2\x80\x9d so Harvard grad Romney makes fun of President Obama as an elitist from \xe2\x80\x9cthe Harvard faculty lounge.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s like watching little boys in Topsiders act all gangsta.'b'Bush 41 went from supporting Planned Parenthood to declaring at his first debate with Dukakis that abortion was a crime that might need penalties. Romney went from being a passionate supporter of abortion rights who appeared at a fund-raiser for Planned Parenthood and endorsed the legalization of RU-486 to being \xe2\x80\x9cfirmly pro-life.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What the late Republican Senator Mark Hatfield said of the resentment-stoking, red-meat-throwing H.W. in 1988 could apply to Romney now: \xe2\x80\x9cIf his father were alive, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure his father would see it as a shocking transformation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mitt and Poppy sacrificed authenticity but never inspired Reaganesque passion. When Romney went in and out of his hotel here this week, the Charleston Place, he passed a blue El Dorado Cadillac in the parking lot with a new bumper sticker reading: \xe2\x80\x9cReagan for President.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'On Fox News on Tuesday, Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said that if Romney wants a big victory here Saturday, he will have to \xe2\x80\x9clet his hair down a little bit\xe2\x80\x9d and show his heart. (Does anybody really want to see that?) Many conservatives here don\xe2\x80\x99t trust Romney to stay conservative if he becomes president. What if he began to think it\xe2\x80\x99s his civic duty to cut the deficit by raising taxes, like Poppy? What if he flips back from his flops?'b'Who are these guys at their core?'b'By mixing falsehoods with racial condescension, Newt Gingrich brought a raucous 'b'presidential debate crowd to its feet on Monday night'b' in South Carolina, further cheapening his reputation and that of the state Republican Party.'b'For months, Mr. Gingrich has made racial resentment an integral part of his platform as a conservative challenger to Mitt Romney. He has traversed the country calling President Obama \xe2\x80\x9cthe greatest food-stamp president in American history\xe2\x80\x9d and presenting African-Americans with the great revelation that they should prefer paychecks to federal handouts. When he was called on it at the debate by Juan Williams of Fox News, he took the measure of the crowd and doubled down.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is that more people have been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than any president in American history,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced, to wild cheers. \xe2\x80\x9cI know among the politically correct, you\xe2\x80\x99re not supposed to use facts that are uncomfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d What you\xe2\x80\x99re not supposed to do, actually, is mislead the public.'b'The fact is that Mr. Obama has \xe2\x80\x9cput\xe2\x80\x9d no one on food stamps. People apply for food assistance, known officially as the 'b'Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program'b', or SNAP, because they\xe2\x80\x99re poor or out of work and their families are hungry. The number of people using the program, which is now at a peak, began rising with the recession, in 2007, and continued through four of the toughest years ever faced by the poor and near-poor in modern history. Mr. Obama eased the eligibility requirements as part of his stimulus program, a desperately needed measure that helped struggling families and the economy.'b'Non-Hispanic whites also far outnumber blacks receiving SNAP benefits. As for the notion that these are people who somehow like their dependency, 30 percent of SNAP households have income from work \xe2\x80\x94 a reminder of the brutal impact of the recession on wages.'b'But these are inconvenient details to Mr. Gingrich, who implied that the rise in federal aid was a sad indication of the insufficient work ethic of black Americans.'b'If only they were more willing to be janitors! Asked by Mr. Williams why he has frequently suggested that poor children be employed as school janitors, Mr. Gingrich said his daughter worked as a church janitor at age 13 and liked earning the money and that it would be a good way for poor students to learn the value of work. But, he suggested, Mr. Obama doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want them to work at all because liberal elites prefer to \xe2\x80\x9cmaximize dependency.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t try to follow any kind of logical thread of why the president wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want the jobless rate to decrease; there isn\xe2\x80\x99t one. This trumpet was sounded to feed the prejudice of people who already believe that blacks and other poor people don\xe2\x80\x99t really like to work and to deflect the growing public awareness that the Republican Party\xe2\x80\x99s highest priority is protecting the rich from higher taxes.'b'For these divisive thoughts, Mr. Gingrich earned his ovation and Mr. Williams won a round of boos. Rick Santorum also got in on the game, responding to a question about high rates of black poverty with a lecture on the importance of work, high school graduation and marriage. Unfortunately, he said, the Obama administration refuses to encourage those kinds of good choices.'b'In South Carolina, where a Confederate flag still waves on the front lawn of the State Capitol largely because of the efforts of the state Republican Party, it remains good primary politics to stir up racial animosity and then link it to President Obama. Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Santorum and the crowd that cheered them are following in a long and tawdry tradition, singling out a minority group for lectures while refusing to support policies that help all Americans.'b'Gov. Andrew Cuomo 'b'proposed a $132.5 billion state budget on Tuesday'b' that features two promising ideas: one to ensure that New York will not lose more than $700 million in federal education funds and a second to save taxpayers money by reducing public pension costs.'b''b'His budget'b' would add about $800 million to education financing, with most of that increase aimed at poor school districts, which suffered cuts last year and are especially dependent on state aid. He has also said that the promise depends on local districts and teachers\xe2\x80\x99 unions agreeing to teacher evaluations. That\xe2\x80\x99s crucial because the failure to move forward on evaluation systems means that New York could lose more than $700 million in federal education assistance.'b'A lawsuit by 'b'teachers fighting a statewide evaluation system'b' is in negotiations and a settlement is said to be close. But Mr. Cuomo added a shove, threatening to propose his own evaluation system if they don\xe2\x80\x99t agree within 30 days from Tuesday. He wants school districts to be using these evaluations by January 2013 or they will lose their increase in state money.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo evaluation, no money. Period,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. It is a smart tactic. That threat puts needed pressure on all the parties. There is simply no reason they cannot complete this important task this year.'b'Mr. Cuomo says that his plan would direct 76 percent of the $800 million increase to high-need districts, and that those districts would receive 69 percent of the total $20.3 billion in state school aid. He says he wants to give out $250 million in performance grants, as part of that $800 million, to districts for education innovations. He should make sure that poor districts will have opportunities to win those grants because richer districts are likely to have more resources to devote to crafting their proposals.'b'Mr. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s budget would help cut state pension expenditures, which he said would increase 185 percent from 2009 to 2015 without a change. To curb costs, he offered a new pension plan for future employees, who could choose a 401(k)-type plan after a year of employment. The traditional defined benefit pensions would still be an option, but those benefits might be less generous than the plan for current public workers.'b'The governor\xe2\x80\x99s budget, which must be passed by the Legislature before April 1, is only a framework. But it offers smart ideas that the state needs. Now comes the hard part: getting the Legislature and the unions to go along.'b'On Tuesday, Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware 'b'commuted'b' the death sentence of Robert Gattis to life without parole. In doing so, he said he gave \xe2\x80\x9cgreat weight\xe2\x80\x9d to the careful 'b'decision'b' of the state 'b'board of pardons'b' to recommend that the sentence be commuted, the first such recommendation the board has made since the death penalty was reinstated there in 1974. As a condition of the commutation, which is supported by a long 'b'list'b' of former judges and prosecutors, Mr. Gattis is expected to waive all legal challenges and live out his life in prison.'b'Mr. Gattis killed his girlfriend in 1990 after an angry quarrel. The pardons board wrote that before the murder, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Gattis complained to medical professionals of mental illness and involuntary violent impulses\xe2\x80\x9d from the extreme and continuous sexual abuse he suffered as a child. The governor called this background \xe2\x80\x9camong the most troubling I have encountered.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Gattis\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers failed to submit much of the ample 'b'proof'b' about his mental illness and its devastating effects. The board was able to take full account of that mitigating factor.'b'Even though state law does not require a unanimous jury vote on death, four members of the pardons board were troubled by the jury\xe2\x80\x99s 10-to-2 split on the penalty because they believe such verdicts should be unanimous.'b'Some board members also noted the great disparity in sentences among serious murder cases. The difference in penalties for other murders in domestic disputes and Mr. Gattis\xe2\x80\x99s sentence \xe2\x80\x9coffends a moral sense of proportionality,\xe2\x80\x9d the board said in its recommendation.'b'For one board member, the rationale for life without parole is more basic. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the taking of life is not required as a matter of self-defense,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, \xe2\x80\x9cone cannot ethically or morally take that act.\xe2\x80\x9d Commuting Mr. Gattis\xe2\x80\x99s sentence meets the imperative of justice. Imposing the death penalty in his case, as in any case, would have been grossly unjust.'b'When February comes, we will receive the gift of an extra day because 2012 is a leap year. But that isn\xe2\x80\x99t all the extra time we get this year. On the night of June 30, 'b'there will be one more second in the day'b' \xe2\x80\x94 a leap second.'b'That may not sound like much, but it is a vital second. While the leap year keeps the calendar in order, the leap second keeps the clock in order by closing the gap between time as measured by atomic clocks, which rely on the oscillation frequency in an isotope of cesium, and time as measured by the daily rotation of the Earth. Without inserting a leap-something at some point, the gap between earth time and official time as calibrated by cesium clocks \xe2\x80\x94 stunningly accurate to one second in 100 million years \xe2\x80\x94 would grow and grow, though very slowly.'b'It is all part of the business of keeping chronological accounts straight, a function performed by 'b'the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service'b' in Paris. The curious part is that it\xe2\x80\x99s easier for our temporally obsessed species to deal with a leap day, which comes every four years, than a leap second, which scientists insert whenever the gap between atomic time and solar time adds up to a second. (The last one was added in 2008; 'b'this one was announced'b' only on Jan. 5.)'b'More and more, the systems we depend on depend themselves on hyperaccurate time signals emitted by official sources like the 'b'National Institute of Standards and Technology'b' in Boulder, Colo. And you can\xe2\x80\x99t just toss an extra second into networks that rely on carefully interrelated time signals, like the Internet or GPS satellites, without causing headaches.

Nicotine replacement therapy is intended to jump-start quitting by lessening the physical effects of nicotine withdrawal, and cravings, when they are present. This gives smokers confidence that they can begin living without tobacco.'b'As the study points out, very few smokers use the therapy correctly. Nevertheless, among \xe2\x80\x9cheavy dependent smokers\xe2\x80\x9d in the study, those who got nicotine replacement therapy for more than six weeks plus professional counseling had the lowest long-term relapse rates.'b'By easing the physical effects of quitting, the therapy lets smokers focus on the longer term emotional and behavioral work of adjusting to a smoke-free life.

His remarks, admittedly extreme, must be placed in their immediate context, and then in the context of church teaching from the New Testament through the ancient fathers and councils down to our own day.'b'The Eastern Churches, Catholic and Orthodox, have from the earliest centuries had married priests, not to speak of the Reformation Church clergy from the 16th century to our own day.'b'One medieval churchman\xe2\x80\x99s view does not constitute a \xe2\x80\x9creligious tradition.\xe2\x80\x9d The Vatican II Council and modern-day bishops of Rome have spoken with deep respect for legitimately married priests and their families, while at the same time teaching clearly and firmly that the celibacy of priests and bishops is modeled on the person of Christ and his mission and will find its total fulfillment when he comes to present all of redeemed creation to his heavenly Father.'b'Ms. Ritchey needs to open her history books for a deeper and fuller appreciation of celibacy and marriage, including the marriage of priests. For the church, it is the final state, the eschaton, that measures the now. For priests\xe2\x80\x99 wives, the word is not caution but welcome.'b'(Msgr.) DANIEL S. HAMILTON'b' Lindenhurst, N.Y., Jan. 13, 2012'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'I am a married Catholic priest (formerly Episcopal) with a wife and two children. I will celebrate my 28th anniversary of ordination on Jan. 28. My wife has never encountered anyone in the three parishes in which I have served who thinks she is a \xe2\x80\x9cdevil\xe2\x80\x99s choice tidbit.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She has been respected as my wife, and she has never seen her role other than supporting me as a priest and loving the church I serve and of which she is a member. We both have always understood that my priesthood is an exception and that she is part of that exception.'b'It took centuries for the Catholic Church to fully understand the deep relationship between the priesthood and celibacy, a relationship founded on the celibacy of Jesus himself. But it is the genius of the Catholic Church to see that its pastoral role allows exceptions to that rule in certain historical situations.'b'There is no need for Ms. Ritchey\xe2\x80\x99s shrill warning. We Catholics welcome the Anglican and Episcopal priests, their wives and their children who will enter the Catholic Church within the Ordinariate. For all of these priests and their families, this will be an act of sacrifice in so many ways. But that is what is at the heart of the priesthood and the Catholic faith: sacrifice.'b'(Rev.) RICHARD G. CIPOLLA'b' Norwalk, Conn., Jan. 13, 2012'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Sara Ritchey conjures the words of an 11th-century monk to articulate the prejudice she fears might face wives of newly ordained Episcopal Catholic priests.'b'But for Eastern Rite Ukrainian Catholics, a Vatican-accepted tradition of married priests is nothing new. Indeed, during my grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s funeral service, the priest\xe2\x80\x99s elderly wife was the only one who knew and sang the Old Church Slavonic responses to his lines. Her lovely voice, in alternating complementarity with his, was warmly welcome.'b'DEBRA ROMANICK BALDWIN'b' Irving, Tex., Jan. 13, 2012'b''b'Budapest'b'ON Jan. 2 the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, along with his entourage, surrounded by a large group of police officers, celebrated himself in Budapest\xe2\x80\x99s opera house. He was christening his newly minted 'b'Basic Law'b', which has replaced our Constitution. The document has put an end to the Republic of Hungary and pluralistic democracy, and assuming it remains in force, ensures the rule of the current administration for a long time to come.'b'Guests entered behind a wall of wooden slats draped in black, and left by the rear exit, while 100,000 people 'b'demonstrated'b' out front along Andrassy Boulevard. But state television showed nothing of this. Klubradio, which reported the public criticism, will be silenced next month, stripped of its broadcast frequency.'b'My homeland is beginning to resemble the post-Soviet dictatorships of Central Asia; some are even calling it Orbanistan. A number of young Hungarians are planning to leave, many for Western Europe. Most are the bolder, more talented ones, like their predecessors who left in the fall of 1956, after the communists crushed the Hungarian revolution.'b'The ones who are staying generally talk about what they should do with their modest savings, since the government has already reached into their private pension accounts. The state has appropriated what it can, putting everything under central control, into its own hands.'b'It would be one thing if our economy were doing well. But the 'b'three leading credit rating institutions'b' have put it into the lowest possible category: junk. A junk country, with a junk administration and a junk prime minister.'b'The dismal economic prospects should be enough to dislodge Mr. Orban and his followers, replacing these dilettante court adherents with an administration of technocrats until the next scheduled elections, in 2014. Instead, the country is consumed by a civil cold war between the pseudo-right and the pseudo-left.'b'The main players are the children of mostly small-time rural party cadres, some of them former functionaries in the Communist Party youth group, or in the party itself. From that same fold came two different sides, their politics fueled by different resentments.'b'Rural Hungary, from which Mr. Orban and his conservative Fidesz party draw their base, is alienated by criticism from urban intellectuals, who tend to back the left. Though Mr. Orban and his colleagues might sometimes strive to close the gap like dutiful pupils, more often they are insulted and take satisfaction in fantasies of revenge. Their striving has them standing constantly on tiptoe, eager to identify themselves with the nation and with working people.'b'I myself am a devotee of neither right nor left, but cast my lot with a democracy that allows all to speak, so we can see what kind of people are trying to lead us. Democracy\xe2\x80\x99s main benefit is its protection, guaranteed by law, of the dignity of its citizens from humiliation at the hands of their leaders. It protects the weak from overweening power, and gives them the tools to protect themselves if need be.'b'What gives any society or its leader absolute authority over us? In Hungary, it is the fact that two-thirds of Parliament offers an automatic nod to the wishes of their little leader at every vote.'b'And what does he do with that support? Mr. Orban\xe2\x80\x99s Hungary \xe2\x80\x94 an anti-European member of the European Union, a five-legged lamb \xe2\x80\x94 puts its own sovereignty ahead of its European affiliation, affixing the label \xe2\x80\x9cnational\xe2\x80\x9d to everything, including the sovereignty of its administration.'b'This neo-populist, sometimes neo-fascist intelligentsia clings to the romanticism of the nation-state as its ideological scaffold. National pathos is also good for silencing domestic criticism; my countrymen easily warm to the slogan, \xe2\x80\x9cOne people, one state, one leader.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Orban lost office once, in 2002, and is determined not to lose again. His hardened instinct for power tells him that this is the time to be tough. One year after his 2010 return to office, the Media Authority, which he heads, suspended Klubradio \xe2\x80\x94 our only independent radio station, with hundreds of thousands of listeners \xe2\x80\x94 on a trumped-up pretext. Some of its shows were critical of the government.'b'What is the point of this crafty text he has declared as the new constitution, in which there is no longer any guarantee of intellectual freedoms? It aims to ensure that his rule is as lasting as that of the quasi-fascist Miklos Horthy, from the 1920s to the 1940s, or that of the communist Janos Kadar, who took over after the 1956 revolution and ruled until 1988.'b'But the future is not entirely dark. Any system founded on propaganda and credulity is doomed to collapse sooner or later. I have been a satisfied witness to the fall of two authoritarian regimes, fascism and communism. The end of the third is in sight. Since it is built on falsehoods, its fall will be less than graceful. We might have managed to avoid this disease. At least, I hope, we shall learn from it.'b'During the Republican debate on Monday, Mitt Romney suggested that he might release his 2011 tax return, but only in April. On Tuesday, 'b'he told reporters'b' that his effective tax rate was \xe2\x80\x9cprobably closer to the 15 percent rate than anything.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Romney is clearly hoping that by drawing this process out for another three months, and copping to the low rate early on, he will deflect at least some of the shock about the size of his personal wealth and what a great deal you get from the government if, like Mr. Romney, you make most of your money from investing.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear: despite Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s claim that \xe2\x80\x9c'b'people will want to see the most recent year'b',\xe2\x80\x9d his 2011 taxes would not be enough. Voters have a right to know how presidential aspirants made their money \xe2\x80\x94 not just in the year before the election. That is especially true in Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s case because he says his business success qualifies him to be president.'b'As for that 15 percent rate, it\xe2\x80\x99s all completely legal. Mr. Romney didn\xe2\x80\x99t even need a sharp accountant. If Mr. Romney has done one good thing with his partial disclosure \xe2\x80\x94 although it clearly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t his goal \xe2\x80\x94 he has reminded Americans of the fundamental unfairness of the current tax code and of how determined Mr. Romney and his party are to keep it that way.'b'Currently, the tax code imposes a top rate of 15 percent on investment income \xe2\x80\x94 generally, capital gains and dividends \xe2\x80\x94 that flows overwhelmingly to wealthy taxpayers. In comparison, top rates between 25 percent and 35 percent are applied to the wages and salaries for many working Americans.'b'Worse, an egregious loophole in the law lets private equity partners pay the lower 15 percent rate on much of their income \xe2\x80\x94 known as \xe2\x80\x9ccarried interest\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 even though those earnings are not typically gains from investing their own money, but rather a share of profits from investing someone else\xe2\x80\x99s money.'b'Without seeing Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s tax returns, it is impossible to know how much of his investments \xe2\x80\x94 past and present \xe2\x80\x94 are actually carried interest, though much of his fortune is from his years at the buyout firm Bain Capital, and a significant share of his family\xe2\x80\x99s wealth is still connected to Bain.'b'President Obama has repeatedly, and correctly, called for ending the carried interest loophole. It is morally indefensible because it asserts that the efforts and risks of private equity partners are worthier than those of workers who pay regular tax rates. It also makes no sense. The rationale for keeping the capital gains rate lower than the rate on wages and salaries is to encourage and reward investors for taking risks with their own money. Private equity partners are, by and large, managing other people\xe2\x80\x99s money risk.'b'The controversy over the tax treatment of carried interest is a subset of the larger debate over whether there even should be a preferential rate for capital gains. The answer is no. It is not only excessive, and unjustified, it actually encourages wasteful gamesmanship, by enticing people to engage in tax avoidance schemes to convert ordinary income into capital gains. It also exacerbates inequality and crowds out other ways to foster risk-taking.'b'Mr. Romney has called for keeping the current low rates for capital gains and eliminating capital gains altogether for taxpayers making less than $200,000. That\xe2\x80\x99s an attempt to justify an indefensible tax break for the wealthy by tossing crumbs to others.'b'Mr. Romney does not have to apologize for his wealth. But he cannot keep trying to conceal just how much the tax code has been tilted in his favor.'b''b' 'b''b'SOMETHING historic happened at the 'b'New York Philharmonic'b' on the evening of Jan. 10, about an hour into Mahler\xe2\x80\x99s Ninth Symphony. During the introspective, achingly beautiful fourth movement, an audience member\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'cellphone'b' loudly rang. And rang. And rang again. It was the kind of marimba riff we\xe2\x80\x99ve all heard at some point on the street from a stranger\xe2\x80\x99s phone.'b'From my seat in Row L of the orchestra section, I could see from their body language the horrified discomfort of my fellow audience members. We all wondered whether and how the maestro 'b'Alan Gilbert'b' would react. I noticed that some of the violinists were looking down to the seats in the front rows, trying to find the source of the noise and, by their glares, silence it.'b'I closed my eyes, hoping the sounds of the orchestra would prevail over the obnoxious ringing. Suddenly, in my reverie, there was silence. The orchestra had stopped playing; Mr. Gilbert had halted the performance. He turned from his podium to the offender, who was seated in the front row, and said something to this effect:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to turn it off? Will you do that?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There was some \xe2\x80\x9cdiscussion\xe2\x80\x9d between the conductor and the cellphone owner \xe2\x80\x94 was the offender pleading his case? \xe2\x80\x94 but the dialogue went unheard.'b'From the rear orchestra-level and the upper-tier seats of Avery Fisher Hall, shouts of outrage rained down on the hapless cellphone owner like discordant notes. Some people stood and demanded that he leave the hall. The audience was so enraged that I could have pictured them hauling him from his seat on to the stage, tying him to a stake, setting him alight and stoking the fires with the busted-up wood of cellos and violas \xe2\x80\x94 maybe even wheeling in one of the orchestra\xe2\x80\x99s shiny Steinways for added pyrotechnics.'b'When it seemed as if the \xe2\x80\x9cpower off\xe2\x80\x9d button on the phone had finally been located and put to use, Mr. Gilbert turned to the audience. \xe2\x80\x9cUsually, when there\xe2\x80\x99s a disturbance like this, it\xe2\x80\x99s best to ignore it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut this was so egregious that I could not allow it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'With that, the audience applauded as if Mahler himself, the orchestra\xe2\x80\x99s music director from 1909 to 1911, had suddenly been resurrected onstage. Mr. Gilbert neither smiled nor acknowledged the cheers. Instead he turned to the orchestra, instructing the players to resume, several measures back from the point at which he had stopped the performance. Just before he raised his baton, he turned again to the audience and said, this time with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll start again.\xe2\x80\x9d A few seconds later, the percussionist struck his cymbals and the fourth movement resumed.'b'For the fans of the Philharmonic, this episode was, I think, a defining moment in the career of Mr. Gilbert, who was appointed music director in 2007. Like other longtime concertgoers, I\xe2\x80\x99d had some difficulty embracing Mr. Gilbert. I\xe2\x80\x99m old-fashioned. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking a conductor has to be older and Eastern European, and should arthritically mount that podium with a furrowed brow, brooding over every note.'b'Like many New Yorkers, I define eras of my life by the mayor in office \xe2\x80\x94 but also by the Philharmonic conductor in office. I look back on the Zubin Mehta years, when I first arrived in the city after college, as being filled with glamorous, if sometimes over-the-top, showmanship. The Kurt Masur years were stern, even humorless. He once stormed off the stage when someone kept coughing at the start of a dreary Alban Berg piece, returning after several minutes only to lecture the audience on when it was appropriate, and inappropriate, to cough. Lorin Maazel\xe2\x80\x99s term was often described as lackadaisical to the point of indifference. He would sometimes lean against the railing of the podium and wave the baton without looking at the orchestra or score, as if he were counting out the time to intermission.'b'Mr. Gilbert is different. He\xe2\x80\x99s a youngish 44. He appears healthy, plump and cheerful when he comes from the wings. He is generous in pointing to orchestra members to stand and receive recognition for solo moments they\xe2\x80\x99ve played in a piece. Yes, he lacks that gravity of face and body that I associate with a maestro. (The fact that his mother, the violinist Yoko Takebe, often sits two rows away from him doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help.)'b'But in his calm response to the cellphone mishap, Mr. Gilbert hit all the right notes. At the symphony\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion, after the last note had sounded, he kept his hand and baton raised, willing the audience to be silent \xe2\x80\x94 to let the silence continue to sound in the hall. One person, after several seconds, clapped once, but Mr. Gilbert held him, and everyone else, at bay. He was conducting us. That last silent note sounded long and true.'b'Mr. Gilbert\xe2\x80\x99s brave decision that night, to halt a performance and remedy a problem with firmness and dignity, brought new music to the Philharmonic.'b'We chose to focus our cameras on Detroit out of a gut feeling that this city \xe2\x80\x94 often heralded as the birthplace of the middle class \xe2\x80\x94 may well be a harbinger of things to come for the rest of the country. \xc2\xa0'b'Detroit lost 25 percent of its population between 2000 and 2010, and now, broke, finds itself on the verge of a possible state takeover. Yet visual reminders of a better time both haunt and anoint the residents here. The past is achingly present in Detroit, and the way its citizens interact with the hulking, physical remnants of yesterday is striking.'b'A few years ago, there was a rash of power outages in Detroit, caused by people illegally cutting down live telephone wires to get to the valuable copper coils inside. The Detroit police created a copper theft task force to deter the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cscrappers,\xe2\x80\x9d young men who case old buildings for valuable metals, troll cemeteries to steal copper grave plates and risk their lives to squeeze any last dollar out of the industrial detritus. \xc2\xa0'b'One freezing evening we happened upon the young men in this film, who were illegally dismantling a former Cadillac repair shop. They worked recklessly to tear down the steel beams and copper fasteners. They were in a hurry to make it to the scrap yard before it closed at 10 p.m., sell their spoils and head to the bar. \xc2\xa0'b'Surprisingly, these guys, who all lacked high school diplomas, seemed to have a better understanding of their place in the global food chain than many educated American 20-somethings. The young men regularly checked the fluctuating price of metals before they determined their next scrap hunt, and they had a clear view of where these resources were going and why. They were the cleanup crew in a shaky empire. Somebody\xe2\x80\x99s got to do it. \xc2\xa0'b'One of the men, who had come up from Kentucky to scrap after losing a job in a coal mine, stands out in our minds. Taking a short break from the action, he looked up and said with disgust, \xe2\x80\x9cAll that\xe2\x80\x99s left here are the remnants of what was.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0'b'The next day we went back to check on the progress of their project. The entire building was gone. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0'b''b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'Los Angeles'b'BACK when I was growing up in Detroit, a bumper sticker appeared that read, \xe2\x80\x9cWill the last person out of Michigan please turn out the lights?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It was supposed to be a joke.'b'Now they 'b'are'b' turning out the lights. Cash-strapped 'b'Highland Park, Mich.'b', has not only darkened two-thirds of its streetlamps, but removed them. Detroit is teetering on the brink of 'b'financial takeover'b' by the state. Mayor Dave Bing plans to raze 10,000 empty structures; he also intends to provide full city services only to the more viable neighborhoods. This makes sense when you consider that Detroit has lost a quarter of its population in just the last decade, and around a million inhabitants in my lifetime.'b'Roughly half the attendees at my recent high school reunion now live outside of Detroit. Detroiters tend to chart with pride the success of Detroiters in the wider world (Eminem or Aretha Franklin, say, or a behind-the-scenes success like Jerry Bruckheimer), and at the reunion it was no different. A friend said, \xe2\x80\x9cPretty much everyone who left looks to be doing better than those who stayed.\xe2\x80\x9d Maybe this was so. After all, almost everyone who left the city did so for a job. But many would like to return.'b'Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s troubles are self-evident. What\xe2\x80\x99s harder to understand is what Detroit looks like to its citizens and the members, like myself, of the Detroit diaspora. For us, the city is not a symbol of despair or decay, but a source, believe it or not, of hope.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived all over the country, and the idea that Detroit is somehow different, that what has happened there can\xe2\x80\x99t happen anywhere else, seems faulty at best. Drive the bumpy streets of Los Angeles, wait for a subway in New York or pay income tax in Chicago, and you learn that there are budget problems everywhere. The troubles in Detroit seem worse simply because Detroit has fallen so far.'b'Once the center of American industrial might and economic power, Detroit was, from 1920 to 1950, the country\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'fourth most populous city'b'. It called itself, without irony, the Paris of the Midwest. When I was a kid, my dad worked in steel and then as a Ford buyer, a midlevel job that provided a decent living, free medical care and, of course, cars. My stepfather had been temporarily paralyzed in a kamikaze attack at the end of 'b'World War II'b', but he recovered, put on a suit and went into the steel business. \xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but make money,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must have been like selling drugs today.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The exact causes of Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s decline are still open to debate, but suffice it to say mismanagement within the auto industry, racial strife and bad, often confrontational and sometimes corrupt government played major roles. When General Motors and Chrysler finally succumbed to bankruptcy, it was the result of excessive debt and promises to retirees that could not be met. That may sound like someplace else, but our federal government is running an annual deficit of over a trillion dollars, and will have around $40 trillion in unfunded retiree liabilities. Detroit is not someplace else; it\xe2\x80\x99s America.'b'Are we doomed? Hardly. But to go forward we might do well to look at, well, Detroit. The city simply has no time left to dither or 'b'filibuster'b' or ignore a problem because the solution is unpleasant. If Detroit needs to turn off the lights, they\xe2\x80\x99re going off. If it needs to raze decrepit buildings, it will fire up the bulldozers. This is a city where, once, I met a Ford man who had just turned down a lucrative job with a management consulting company. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t work for a company that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make something,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained.'b'Detroit is a city used to the hard work of creation. It reminds us that necessity is the mother not only of invention, but of hope. And hope is necessary for action.'b'And Detroit is moving forward. There\xe2\x80\x99s a long way to go, but the city\xe2\x80\x99s efforts have already brought an influx of young artists and entrepreneurs drawn by cheap rent and programs that provide start-up capital. A lot of brainpower is being deployed to imagine the Detroit of the future. Crime is down overall. Even the auto business is coming back to life, as witnessed by the excitement at this year\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Detroit auto show'b'.'b'Detroit has been in dire straits before. In 1805, roughly a century before Henry Ford built his first assembly line, a huge fire burned the city to the ground. This gave rise to Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s Latin motto, \xe2\x80\x9cSperamus meliora; resurget cineribus\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cWe hope for better things; it will rise from the ashes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Berkeley, Calif.'b'WE who love the Internet love the fact that so many people contribute to it. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe that skeptics once worried about whether anyone would have anything worthwhile to say online.'b'There is, however, an outdated brand of digital orthodoxy that ought to be retired. In this worldview, the Internet is a never-ending battle of good guys who love freedom against bad guys like old-fashioned Hollywood media moguls. The bad guys want to strengthen copyright law, and make it impossible to post anonymously copied videos and stories.'b'The proposed Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, which is being considered in the House while the Senate looks at a similar bill, is deemed the worst thing ever. Popular sites like 'b'Wikipedia staged a blackout'b' on Wednesday to protest the bills. 'b'Google'b' put a black banner over its name. Nothing quite like that has ever happened before. This is extraordinary, because it shows that belief in the priority of fighting SOPA is so absolute as to trump the stated nonpartisan missions of these sites.'b'The legislation has indeed included draconian remedies in various drafts, so I join my colleagues in criticizing the bills. But our opposition has become so extreme that we are doing more harm than good to our own cause. Those rare tech companies that have come out in support of SOPA are not merely criticized but barred from industry events and subject to boycotts. We, the keepers of the flame of free speech, are banishing people for their speech. The result is a chilling atmosphere, with people afraid to speak their minds.'b'Our melodrama is driven by a vision of an open Internet that has already been distorted, though not by the old industries that fear piracy.'b'For instance, until a year ago, I enjoyed a certain kind of user-generated content very much: I participated in forums in which musicians talked about musical instruments.'b'For years, I was warned that old-fashioned control freaks like media moguls might separate me from my beloved forums. Perhaps a forum would be shut down because it was hosted on some server with pirated content.'b'While acknowledging that this is a possible scenario, a very different factor \xe2\x80\x94 proprietary social networking \xe2\x80\x94 is ending my freedom to participate in the forums I used to love, at least on terms I accept. Like many other forms of contact, the musical conversations are moving into private sites, particularly 'b'Facebook'b'. To continue to participate, I\xe2\x80\x99d have to accept Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy, under which it analyzes me, and is searching for new ways to charge third parties for the use of that analysis.'b'At the moment that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bother me much, because I know a lot of people at Facebook and I know they are decent. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen what happens to companies over time. Who knows who will be using my data in 20 years?'b'You might object that it\xe2\x80\x99s all based on individual choice. That argument ignores the consequences of networks, and the way they function. After a certain point choice is reduced.'b'And it\xe2\x80\x99s not Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s fault! We, the idealists, insisted that information be able to flow freely online, which meant that services relating to information, instead of the information itself, would be the main profit centers. Some businesses do sell content, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t address the business side of everyday user-generated content.'b'The adulation of \xe2\x80\x9cfree content\xe2\x80\x9d inevitably meant that \xe2\x80\x9cadvertising\xe2\x80\x9d would become the biggest business in the open part of the information economy. Furthermore, that system isn\xe2\x80\x99t so welcoming to new competitors. Once networks are established, it is hard to reduce their power. Google\xe2\x80\x99s advertisers, for instance, know what will happen if they move away. The next-highest bidder for each position in Google\xe2\x80\x99s auction-based model for selling ads will inherit that position if the top bidder goes elsewhere. So Google\xe2\x80\x99s advertisers tend to stay put because the consequences of leaving are obvious to them, whereas the opportunities they might gain by leaving are not.'b'The obvious strategy in the fight for a piece of the advertising pie is to close off substantial parts of the Internet so Google doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see it all anymore. That\xe2\x80\x99s how Facebook hopes to make money, by sealing off a huge amount of user-generated information into a separate, non-Google world. Networks lock in their users, whether it is Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s members or Google\xe2\x80\x99s advertisers.'b'This belief in \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d information is blocking future potential paths for the Internet. What if ordinary users routinely earned micropayments for their contributions? If all content were valued instead of only mogul content, perhaps an information economy would elevate success for all. But under the current terms of debate that idea can barely be whispered.'b'To my friends in the \xe2\x80\x9copen\xe2\x80\x9d Internet movement, I have to ask: what did you think would happen? We in Silicon Valley undermined copyright to make commerce become more about services instead of content \xe2\x80\x94 more about our code instead of their files. The inevitable endgame was always that we would lose control of our own personal content, our own files. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t just weakened Hollywood and old-fashioned publishers. We\xe2\x80\x99ve weakened ourselves.'b'For months, it seemed as if Congress would pass an online antipiracy bill, even though its main weapons \xe2\x80\x94 cutting off the financing of pirate Web sites and making them harder to find \xe2\x80\x94 risk censoring legitimate speech and undermining the security of the Internet. But the unmovable corporations behind those bills have run into an unstoppable force: an outcry by Internet companies led by Google and Wikipedia that culminated in 'b'an extraordinary online protest on Wednesday'b'.'b'Lawmakers have begun peeling away from the bills, notably Senators Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican who cosponsored the Senate version, and John Cornyn, the powerful Texas conservative. They dropped out after Wikipedia\xe2\x80\x99s English language site went dark and Google put a black bar on its homepage on Wednesday.'b'The 'b'Protect I.P. Act'b' would have easily passed the Senate last summer if not for a hold placed by Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat of Oregon. The 'b'Stop Online Piracy Act'b', introduced in the House in October, has also lost some of its initial backers. And on Saturday, 'b'the White House released a statement'b' warning that it would \xe2\x80\x9cnot support legislation that reduces freedom of expression, increases cybersecurity risk, or undermines the dynamic, innovative global Internet.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Though we are encouraged by legislators\xe2\x80\x99 newfound caution about the potential consequences of the bills, Congress must keep working on ways to curtail the growing business of foreign rogue Web sites trafficking in counterfeit goods and stolen intellectual property.'b'The Internet industry was pitted against some of the best-honed lobbying groups, including Hollywood and the recording studios, the United States Chamber of Commerce and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. The industry has made a good case that some of the definitions of wrongdoing \xe2\x80\x94 like \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitating\xe2\x80\x9d intellectual property infringement \xe2\x80\x94 were overly broad. They said allowing property rights owners to direct payment companies like Visa and ad networks like Google\xe2\x80\x99s to stop doing business with sites they deemed infringing \xe2\x80\x94 with no penalties if they were proved wrong\xe2\x80\x94 could stymie legitimate online expression.'b'They made the case that the proposal to make infringing Web sites \xe2\x80\x9cdisappear\xe2\x80\x9d from the Internet by forbidding search engines from finding them or redirecting their Web addresses to other Internet domains was easy to get around and could potentially undermine efforts to stop hackers from doing exactly the same thing.'b'The Internet companies now have the responsibility to come up with a workable alternative that gives owners of intellectual property rights better tools to stop piracy by Web sites located in faraway countries. These sites get some 53 billion visits a year, more than Google or Wikipedia. Yet they are outside the grasp of American law.'b'The focus on cutting the financing of online pirates, which features in the House and Senate bills, is the right way to go. Sponsors of both bills have moved to delete, at least temporarily, provisions to make rogue Web sites disappear. The legislation could be further amended to narrow the definition of criminality and clarify that it is only aimed at foreign sites. And it could tighten guarantees of due process. Private parties must first get a court order to block business with a Web site they deem infringing on their copyrights.'b'We are happy that the drive to pass antipiracy legislation has slowed enough that Congress might actually consider all its implications carefully. Lawmakers can now act wisely to create tools that can help combat the scourge of online piracy without excessive collateral damage.'b'CHARLESTON, S.C.'b'This week, Rick Santorum held a town hall meeting on a retired aircraft carrier. It was definitely a more dramatic venue than the last time I saw him, in a nursing home auditorium in New Hampshire.'b'As the candidate made small talk with supporters in the hangar bay of the U.S.S. Yorktown, his staff was frantically trying to fold away some of the empty chairs to make the audience look larger. They shooed the attendees \xe2\x80\x94 who appeared to be mainly a few families with home-schooled children and one woman with a very busy red-white-and-blue hat \xe2\x80\x94 into the middle \xe2\x80\x9cso we can have you guys in the camera shot.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Although the meeting area was cold and smelled vaguely fishy, everyone in the little audience seemed upbeat, even the woman who expressed concern that the federal government was planning to round up local Tea Party members and put them in a FEMA concentration camp \xe2\x80\x9cthat has a razor-wire fence around it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with that at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Santorum, who was looking slightly less chipper than his fans. (The Federal Emergency Management Agency says there is no plan to round up the Tea Party. The agency doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any concentration camps. Just in case you were worried.)'b'But I digress. The point here is that while South Carolina is a very lively state, this primary has been lacking the kind of anything-can-happen excitement that made Iowa one long frostbitten romp. But things could change! Voting on Saturday! And here\xe2\x80\x99s how everybody is doing:'b''b'MITT ROMNEY'b' The South Carolina primary has been one long obsession with Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s extreme richness. This is partly because Newt Gingrich keeps carping on it. Which, to be honest, we have enjoyed very much. But, mainly, it\xe2\x80\x99s because Mitt is so weird and off-putting on the subject. Like the time he told people he was unemployed. And, this week, when he dismissed the fees he earns as a public speaker, which ran to $374,327 in one recent year, as \xe2\x80\x9cnot very much.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'People, what is it with this guy? Mitt was charging around $42,000 a speech. If you were planning to run for president and didn\xe2\x80\x99t need money, would you deliberately pursue a sideline that would put you in the top 1 percent for about 12 hours\xe2\x80\x99 worth of work? And, while we\xe2\x80\x99re at it, if you were that rich and had a very large family to take to Canada, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you hire a plane? What kind of obsession is it that makes a multi-multi-multimillionaire show up for the GoldenTree Asset Management convention for a $68,000 fee? Or drive for 12 hours with the Irish setter strapped to the car roof?'b''b'RON PAUL'b' During the recent South Carolina debate, Paul called for a \xe2\x80\x9cgolden rule in foreign policy,\xe2\x80\x9d in which we would refrain from doing things to other countries we would not like done to us. This triggered cries of outrage from the audience on behalf of the New Exceptionalism, which holds that the United States is the only country with \xe2\x80\x9cdo-to\xe2\x80\x9d rights.'b'But Paul has pretty much written off South Carolina anyway. He\xe2\x80\x99s hoping the race drags on to February and caucus states like Maine and Nevada, where a candidate with a small-but-dedicated following has an advantage. Even if that following appears to be composed largely of slightly abrasive young men with high IQs who smoke and wear hunter caps with ear flaps.'b''b'RICK PERRY'b' You may have heard the rumor that Perry is doing better in his campaign performances lately. Frequently, the words \xe2\x80\x9cdoing better\xe2\x80\x9d are spoken in the same tone used when describing, say, a 97-year-old heart attack victim on a ventilator. Lately, he has been expressing his patriotism by denouncing the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s stern treatment of the Marines who urinated on dead Afghans. At a recent speech in South Carolina, he referred to Washington as a \xe2\x80\x9csuburb.\xe2\x80\x9d But, at this point, really, people have stopped keeping track.'b''b'NEWT GINGRICH'b' Once again in South Carolina, Gingrich is proving that he is the top debater in the field. Truly, if the office of president of the United States involved nothing but debating in front of enthusiastic Republican audiences, he would be far and away the best possible choice. If nominated, Newt promises that he will follow Barack Obama around the country challenging him to a series of three-hour-long \xe2\x80\x9cLincoln-Douglas\xe2\x80\x9d debates. He can already imagine it! I bet you can, too.'b''b'RICK SANTORUM'b' Santorum enjoys spending time with his wife and seven kids, doing 50 push-ups every morning, and pressuring for a recount of the Iowa caucus vote. He also likes sweater vests, talking about his coal-miner grandfather and visiting aircraft carriers to drive home his campaign slogan. Which is \xe2\x80\x9cCourage to Fight for America\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cAlready in Drydock.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When I spoke at Swarthmore College recently, I was startled by one question: Is it immoral for students to seek banking jobs?'b'The corollary question, with Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s business career under attack even by staunch Republicans, is this: Is it unethical to make millions in private equity?'b'My answer to both questions: no.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve been sympathetic to the Occupy Wall Street movement, but, look, finance is not evil. Banking has contributed immensely to modern civilization. By allocating capital to more efficient uses, banking laid the groundwork for the industrial revolution and the information revolution.'b'Likewise, the attacks on private equity seem over the top. Private equity firms like Bain Capital, where Romney worked, aren\xe2\x80\x99t about destroying companies and picking over the carcasses. Rather, the aim is to acquire poorly managed companies, make them more efficient (sometimes by firing people but often by rejiggering the business model) and then resell them at a profit. That\xe2\x80\x99s the merciless, rugged nature of capitalism.'b'Liberals should also be wary of self-selecting out of certain occupations. After Vietnam and revelations of C.I.A. abuses in the 1970s, many university students avoided the military and the intelligence agencies. So slots were filled disproportionately by ideological conservatives in a way that undermined everyone\xe2\x80\x99s interests. We would have been better off if more Swarthmore idealists had become generals and C.I.A. officers \xe2\x80\x94 and we may be better off if some idealists become bankers as well.'b'Now for my caveats.'b'When young people go into finance, I hope that they\xe2\x80\x99ll show judgment, balance and principles instead of their elders\xe2\x80\x99 penchant for greed and rigging the system. Just as Communists managed to destroy Communism, capitalists are discrediting capitalism.'b''b'A Pew Research Center poll in December'b' found that only 50 percent of Americans reacted positively to the term \xe2\x80\x9ccapitalism,\xe2\x80\x9d while 40 percent reacted negatively. Among Americans ages 18 to 29, more had a negative view of capitalism than a positive view, the survey found. Those young Americans actually viewed socialism more positively than capitalism. In other words, America\xe2\x80\x99s grasping capitalists are turning young Americans into socialists.'b''b'The Financial Times recently published a series'b' about \xe2\x80\x9ccapitalism in crisis.\xe2\x80\x9d It noted that the 'b'Edelman Trust Barometer'b', a survey, found that only 46 percent of Americans had confidence in business to do the right thing (and only 25 percent trusted banks).'b'Public skepticism is warranted, in my view. Corporations have vastly overpaid C.E.O.\xe2\x80\x99s, handsomely rewarding not only success but also failure. Banks that helped cause today\xe2\x80\x99s financial mess lobbied successfully for bailouts for themselves; they privatized profits and socialized losses.'b'Meanwhile, more than four million families have lost their homes to foreclosure, according to Zillow.com, a real estate company. Bankers and shareholders found a safety net, but not working-class families. One reason is that the campaign finance system allows financiers to buy access and special favors. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a tycoon, your best investment often is a lobbying firm in Washington to create a tax loophole for you. The last few years have been a showcase not of capitalism itself, but of crony capitalism.'b''b'Romney\xe2\x80\x99s average tax rate'b', which he says is probably about 15 percent, exemplifies the problem. The Romneys benefit because capital gains tax rates have been slashed to just 15 percent, much lower than rates paid on labor income.'b'Then there\xe2\x80\x99s the most egregious tax loophole of all, for \xe2\x80\x9ccarried interest.\xe2\x80\x9d A triumph of lobbying, it allows private equity and hedge fund managers to pretend that their labor income is a capital gain. So they sometimes pay a tax rate of just 15 percent, compared with up to 35 percent for almost everyone else.'b'Granted, young people haven\xe2\x80\x99t been pouring into finance in recent years out of eagerness to reform this rigged system but to milk it. In 2007, on the eve of the financial crisis, 'b'47 percent of Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s graduating class'b' headed for consulting firms and the financial sector \xe2\x80\x94 a huge misallocation of human capital. However well-meaning these new graduates are initially, they often end up caught up in the scramble at the trough.'b'In the postwar years, labor unions became greedy and rewarded themselves with feather-bedding and rigid work rules \xe2\x80\x94 turning much of the public against them. Likewise, Wall Street feather-bedding is tarnishing the public image of banks and business and undermining confidence in capitalism itself.'b'When financiers rig the system, they should remember the warning of John Maynard Keynes: \xe2\x80\x9cThe businessman is only tolerable so long as his gains can be held to bear some relation to what, roughly and in some sense, his activities have contributed to society.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'So university students would be wrong to mock their classmates who choose Citigroup over CARE. Banking and private equity aren\xe2\x80\x99t evil, and I would never urge college students to stay away. Maybe today\xe2\x80\x99s young socialist sympathizers, along with healthy regulation and a loud public outcry, can help rescue capitalism from the crony capitalists.'b'President Obama 'b'has properly rejected'b', at least for now, the Keystone XL oil pipeline that would run from Canada to the Gulf Coast. He rebuffed the demand of House Republicans that the controversial project be decided in haste under an election-year deadline.'b'The foolish requirement that Mr. Obama issue a decision on the pipeline by Feb. 21 \xe2\x80\x94 cynically inserted into the payroll tax bill passed in December \xe2\x80\x94 could never be met given the need for a thorough environmental study before any judgment is made.'b'The president made the right call in accepting the recommendation of the State Department, which has primary jurisdiction over the proposed 1,700-mile pipeline that would cross through ecologically sensitive areas in the Midwest. Mr. Obama said his judgment was based not on the merits but on a timetable that was \xe2\x80\x9crushed and arbitrary.\xe2\x80\x9d He has maintained that a decision on the current proposal could not be made until some time next year. The pipeline sponsor, TransCanada, could submit a proposal to build along another route, but that, too, would require time for a comprehensive environmental review.'b'Republicans intent on scoring campaign points immediately repeated their fallacious cries that \xe2\x80\x9ctens of thousands of jobs\xe2\x80\x9d would be lost by not instantly approving the project. They made no mention of the risks inherent in the project: harm to the Canadian boreal forests and threats to water supplies in the Midwest. Bipartisan opposition to the pipeline has notably been led by Gov. Dave Heineman of Nebraska, a Republican.'b'The extraction and production of tar sands oil in the fields of northern Alberta would also cause far more greenhouse gas emissions than drilling for conventional crude. Lobbyists and House Republicans have tried to sell the project as a reduction in America\xe2\x80\x99s dependence on Middle Eastern oil. But much of the pipeline oil that would be refined on the Gulf Coast would be destined for foreign export.'b'Far more important to the nation\xe2\x80\x99s energy and environmental future is the development of renewable and alternative energy sources. This is the winning case that Mr. Obama should make to voters in rejecting the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 craven indulgence of Big Oil.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'Preventing a Nuclear Iran, Peacefully'b',\xe2\x80\x9d by Shibley Telhami and Steven Kull (Op-Ed, Jan. 16), is a counterproductive exercise that if taken seriously would increase rather than decrease the chances of military conflict.'b'The two ingredients that are most likely to deter Iran from going nuclear are immediate harsh sanctions aimed at the Iranian central bank and its oil sales, and the real threat of a military attack if Iran persists.'b'Any path that leads Iranian leaders to think they can delay or divert such options will encourage them to move forward with their nuclear program. The notion that discussions of a nuclear-free Mideast, a worthy goal in principle, can be accomplished in a short enough time to change Iran\xe2\x80\x99s course is an illusion.'b'Moreover, there is no evidence that Iran is interested in such an achievement since Iranian leaders seem motivated toward achieving regional dominance through a nuclear capability.'b'The more Iran believes that the world is not truly committed to stopping it from going nuclear, the more likely that it will move forward.

And there is no question that education and the economy are intertwined; one can\xe2\x80\x99t be strong if the other is weak. But it is not the case, despite what he asserts, that teachers\xe2\x80\x99 unions resist a focus on teacher quality.'b'As president of the American Federation of Teachers, I know that local unions across the country have embraced an education agenda that includes a laser-like focus on how to improve teaching and learning, starting with a teacher development and evaluation process now being used by many school districts. That framework squarely addresses evaluating teachers, improving teacher practice and removing those who are ineffective.'b'The New Haven public school system was the first to use the process, and as its superintendent, Reginald Mayo, said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe union was pretty adamant that there was no place for incompetence in New Haven.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Upon seeing New Haven\xe2\x80\x99s first-year results, your editorial page 'b'concluded'b', \xe2\x80\x9cThis shows that good teaching can indeed be taught, and that with genuine effort school systems can upgrade the teacher corps in a fairly short period of time.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Sadly, as budgets are still tight and times still tough, we once again hear this myth about the union standing in the way of performance.

The stories about his three marriages have been known for years, but every time he seems to have escaped the wrath of Republican voters, they rise again.'b'On Thursday, they were resurrected by his second wife, Marianne, who 'b'told ABC News'b' that he had sought an \xe2\x80\x9copen marriage\xe2\x80\x9d arrangement in 1999 so that he could have her blessing to conduct an affair while remaining married to her.

At a town-hall-style session in Beaufort, S.C., on Thursday, a former Marine drill instructor took the microphone to call Mr. Gingrich as inspiring as Winston Churchill \xe2\x80\x94 but also to tell him he remained troubled by his \xe2\x80\x9clapses in personal judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d The Marine wondered how Mr. Gingrich could face President Obama in the fall with his past.'b'Mr. Gingrich responded that he knew the issue would dog him through the campaign, but that he and his wife decided \xe2\x80\x9cthe country was worth the pain.\xe2\x80\x9d He told the Marine \xe2\x80\x94 and all voters struggling with the same question \xe2\x80\x94 that the decision was one that \xe2\x80\x9cyou have to make.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s magnanimous of him to be willing to allow voters to decide for themselves on the importance of his moral choices, since he and his party have been so unwilling to allow the public to make its own moral choices.'b'For too many Republicans, it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough that Americans are free to pray in the house of worship of their choice; they want all children to be required to pray in school. They want to impose their own ideas about sexuality and abortion on everyone. And they love to accuse Democrats of being insufficiently pious. ('b'Rick Perry\xe2\x80\x99s exit from the race'b' on Thursday may mean no more ads accusing President Obama of a \xe2\x80\x9cwar on religion\xe2\x80\x9d and liberals of believing faith is a sign of weakness. Or, it may not, depending on how desperate the other candidates get.)'b'When Republican officials then get caught violating one of the Ten Commandments, they make an enormous show of contrition and repentance and ask for the public\xe2\x80\x99s forgiveness. But as the hypocrisy level continues to rise, that forgiveness may become much harder to provide.'b'Washington'b'AT this moment, all over the United States, consumers are buying tickets to games, concerts and other live events under the impression that they have the right to give away, donate or resell the tickets they purchase. They assume that they can do so whenever and with whomever they wish and (as long as they don\xe2\x80\x99t violate the few remaining laws against scalping) at whatever price they choose.'b'But those consumers may be mistaken. In recent years ticket sellers, along with promoters, producers, artists and sports teams, have increasingly taken a new approach to selling tickets. This approach, marketed in the name of innovation, convenience and protecting purchasers, restricts those fundamental freedoms long rightly taken for granted.'b'The practice is so-called paperless ticketing: tickets are purchased by credit card, and to gain entry to an event, the buyer must present the same credit card and a photo ID. You cannot readily give your paperless concert ticket to a friend or sell it to a colleague or buy one for your grandchild to use. In no other format \xe2\x80\x94 traditional paper ticket, printable e-ticket or digital ticket delivered on a smartphone \xe2\x80\x94 are live-event tickets subject to such transfer restraints, and no product other than airline tickets (for which there is a security rationale) involves such restrictions.'b'Ticketmaster, the dominant seller of live-event tickets, and to a lesser extent its much smaller competitor 'b'Veritix'b', both engage in this practice. Ticketmaster says its restrictions on the resale and \xe2\x80\x9cgifting\xe2\x80\x9d of its paperless tickets act as safeguards against various practices: scalping; the bulk purchasing of tickets by automated software bots; and the use of counterfeit, stolen or lost tickets.'b'But in reality, the restrictions represent an effort to control the secondary-ticketing market and stifle competition from independent resellers and resale marketplaces like 'b'StubHub'b', where tickets are often sold for less than face value. ('b'The American Antitrust Institute'b', of which I am president, received a modest contribution, in the form of sponsorship of a conference last year, from an advocacy group financed in part by StubHub.) Paperless tickets bought through Ticketmaster may be resold, for example, only through its own resale 'b'Web site'b', which often prohibits sales below face value, sets maximum sale prices and charges a fee for transfers.'b'The scope of the problem \xe2\x80\x94 how many fans are affected, how much money is involved \xe2\x80\x94 is difficult to quantify. Paperless tickets are estimated to represent only about 1 percent of the well over 100 million live-event tickets sold each year. But in the absence of strong consumer resistance, they are likely to become increasingly common.'b'This week, the American Antitrust Institute is releasing a report on the paperless-ticket market by James D. Hurwitz, an institute fellow and former policy analyst at the Federal Trade Commission. The conclusion: restrictive paperless-ticket practices depart from bedrock market principles by unjustifiably limiting consumer choice and suppressing free competition. They also might violate federal and state antitrust and consumer-protection laws. And they may warrant legislation to protect the market and consumers.'b'As it happens, a number of states are weighing ticket reforms. In 2010, New York became the first state to pass legislation to protect the right of consumers to transfer tickets to others as they see fit. Similar legislation has been introduced in Minnesota, Massachusetts, Connecticut, North Carolina, Florida and New Jersey.'b'We urge reform of these ticketing practices. Specifically, we call on the Federal Trade Commission, along with state attorneys general, consumer-protection agencies and legislators, to investigate the growing threat of restrictive paperless-ticketing practices for live events. Perhaps the threat of an investigation will spur the industry to reform itself.'b'These practices undermine a free, fair, informed and competitive market. Consumers should be enabled to transact with others.'b'Mitt Romney is a rich man, but is Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s character formed by his wealth? Is Romney a spoiled, cosseted character? Has he been corrupted by ease and luxury?'b'The notion is preposterous. All his life, Romney has been a worker and a grinder. He earned two degrees at Harvard simultaneously (in law and business). He built a business. He\xe2\x80\x99s persevered year after year, amid defeat after defeat, to build a political career.'b'Romney\xe2\x80\x99s salient quality is not wealth. It is, for better and worse, his tenacious drive \xe2\x80\x94 the sort of relentlessness that we associate with striving immigrants, not rich scions.'b'Where did this persistence come from? It\xe2\x80\x99s plausible to think that it came from his family history. The philosopher Michael Oakeshott once observed that it takes several generations to make a career. Interests, habits and lore accrue in families and shape those born into them.'b'The Romney family history, which is nicely described in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Real Romney\xe2\x80\x9d by Michael Kranish and Scott Helman, is a story of tenacious work, setbacks and recovery. People who analyze how Mormonism may have shaped Romney generally look to theology. But the Mormon history, the exodus, matters most.'b'Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s great-great-grandfather Miles was a member of the church in Nauvoo, Ill., and spent years building a temple there. Even after Joseph Smith was killed by a mob and most of the Mormons fled, Miles stayed to finish his temple.'b'Then, in 1844, as the great work was being completed, mobs burned it to the ground and forced Miles and his family to head West. Most Mormons made the trek to Salt Lake City, but the Romneys could not afford an ox cart. They were part of a small, malnourished band that took four years of struggle to make it the 1,300 miles west.'b'Mitt\xe2\x80\x99s great-grandfather, also Miles, made the trek starting at age 7. He was married in 1862, but a month after his marriage Brigham Young told him to leave his wife, Hannah, and become a missionary for three years in Britain. Hannah supported herself by taking in other people\xe2\x80\x99s washing.'b'Miles returned in 1867 and bought a two-room house. Young commanded him to take another wife, and Hannah had to prepare the room for the woman who would be her rival. \xe2\x80\x9cI used to walk the floor and shed tears of sorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d she recounted in her own private memoir.'b'Then they were commanded to leave family and friends and build a new settlement in the desert 300 miles south of Salt Lake City. Living at first in primitive huts, they built a community, and Miles prospered. Then came a new command to move 400 miles across the wilderness to settle a desert patch in Arizona.'b'Again the Romneys were thrown back into primeval hardship. Miles, his three wives and their many children lived in a small wooden house and survived on bread, beans and gravy. There, as elsewhere, the locals detested the Mormons for their polygamy, for their religion and for the fact that the Mormons tended to outwork them. The local newspaper said Miles should be hung for polygamy, so two of his wives were sent to hide in cornfields and the mountains of New Mexico.'b'They were compelled to move again. Romney left his family to build a colony in Mexico. It was 1885, and he was living out of a wagon. Hannah led eight children through the Arizona mountains to join him. In Mexico, they lived in a house with a dirt roof, so mud dropped down when it rained. Eventually, all the wives and the 21 children were reunited. Miles and his son Gaskell, Mitt\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather, built a successful community, with brick homes, churches and wealth.'b'George Romney, Mitt\xe2\x80\x99s father, was born in Mexico. But when he was 5, in 1912, Mexican revolutionaries confiscated their property and threw them out. Most of the Romneys fled back to the U.S. Within days, they went from owning a large Mexican ranch to being penniless once again, drifting from California to Idaho to Utah, where again they built a fortune.'b'Mitt Romney can\xe2\x80\x99t talk about his family history on the campaign trail. Mormonism is an uncomfortable subject. But he must have been affected by it.'b'It is a story of relentless effort, of recovery and of being despised (in their eyes) because of their own success. Romney himself experienced none of this hardship, of course, but Jews who didn\xe2\x80\x99t live through the Exodus are still shaped by it.'b'Romney seems to share his family\xe2\x80\x99s remorseless drive to rise \xe2\x80\x94 whether it\xe2\x80\x99s trying to persuade the French to give up wine and join his church, or building a business, or being willing to withstand heaps of abuse in pursuit of the presidency. He may have character flaws, but he does not have the character flaws normally associated with great wealth. His signature is focus and persistence. The wealth issue is a sideshow.'b'Call me peculiar, but I\xe2\x80\x99m actually enjoying the spectacle of Mitt Romney doing the Dance of the Seven Veils \xe2\x80\x94 partly out of voyeurism, of course, but also because it\xe2\x80\x99s about time that we had this discussion.'b'The theme of his dance, for those who haven\xe2\x80\x99t been paying attention, is taxes \xe2\x80\x94 his own taxes. Although disclosure of tax returns is standard practice for political candidates, Mr. Romney has never done so, and, at first, he tried to stonewall the issue even in a presidential race. Then he said that he probably pays only about 15 percent of his income in taxes, and he hinted that he might release his 2011 return.'b'Even then, however, he will face pressure to release previous returns, too \xe2\x80\x94 like his father, who released 12 years of returns back when he made his presidential run. (The elder Romney, by the way, paid 37 percent of his income in taxes).'b'And the public has a right to see the back years: By 2011, with the campaign looming, Mr. Romney may have rearranged his portfolio to minimize awkward issues like his accounts in the Cayman Islands or his use of the justly reviled \xe2\x80\x9ccarried interest\xe2\x80\x9d tax break.'b'But the larger question isn\xe2\x80\x99t what Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s tax returns have to say about Mitt Romney; it\xe2\x80\x99s what they have to say about U.S. tax policy. Is there a good reason why the rich should bear a startlingly light tax burden?'b'For they do. If Mr. Romney is telling the truth about his taxes, he\xe2\x80\x99s actually more or less typical of the very wealthy. Since 1992, the I.R.S. has been releasing income and tax data for the 400 highest-income filers. In 2008, the most recent year available, these filers paid only 18.1 percent of their income in federal income taxes; in 2007, they paid only 16.6 percent. When you bear in mind that the rich pay little either in payroll taxes or in state and local taxes \xe2\x80\x94 major burdens on middle-class families \xe2\x80\x94 this implies that the top 400 filers faced lower taxes than many ordinary workers.'b'The main reason the rich pay so little is that most of their income takes the form of capital gains, which are taxed at a maximum rate of 15 percent, far below the maximum on wages and salaries. So the question is whether capital gains \xe2\x80\x94 three-quarters of which go to the top 1 percent of the income distribution \xe2\x80\x94 warrant such special treatment.'b'Defenders of low taxes on the rich mainly make two arguments: that low taxes on capital gains are a time-honored principle, and that they are needed to promote economic growth and job creation. Both claims are false.'b'When you hear about the low, low taxes of people like Mr. Romney, what you need to know is that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t always thus \xe2\x80\x94 and the days when the superrich paid much higher taxes weren\xe2\x80\x99t that long ago. Back in 1986, Ronald Reagan \xe2\x80\x94 yes, Ronald Reagan \xe2\x80\x94 signed a tax reform equalizing top rates on earned income and capital gains at 28 percent. The rate rose further, to more than 29 percent, during Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s first term.'b'Low capital gains taxes date only from 1997, when Mr. Clinton struck a deal with Republicans in Congress in which he cut taxes on the rich in return for creation of the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Health Insurance Program. And today\xe2\x80\x99s ultralow rates \xe2\x80\x94 the lowest since the days of Herbert Hoover \xe2\x80\x94 date only from 2003, when former President George W. Bush rammed both a tax cut on capital gains and a tax cut on dividends through Congress, something he achieved by exploiting the illusion of triumph in Iraq.'b'Correspondingly, the low-tax status of the very rich is also a recent development. During Mr. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s first term, the top 400 taxpayers paid close to 30 percent of their income in federal taxes, and even after his tax deal they paid substantially more than they have since the 2003 cut.'b'So is it essential that the rich receive such a big tax break? There is a theoretical case for according special treatment to capital gains, but there are also theoretical and practical arguments against such special treatment. In particular, the huge gap between taxes on earned income and taxes on unearned income creates a perverse incentive to arrange one\xe2\x80\x99s affairs so as to make income appear in the \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d category.'b'And the economic record certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support the notion that superlow taxes on the superrich are the key to prosperity. During that first Clinton term, when the very rich paid much higher taxes than they do now, the economy added 11.5 million jobs, dwarfing anything achieved even during the good years of the Bush administration.'b'So Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s tax dance is doing us all a service by highlighting the unwise, unjust and expensive favors being showered on the upper-upper class. At a time when all the self-proclaimed serious people are telling us that the poor and the middle class must suffer in the name of fiscal probity, such low taxes on the very rich are indefensible.'b'The death toll from the brutal 10-month war by President Bashar al-Assad of Syria against his own people is now more than 5,400, according to the United Nations and others. Yet the international community still has not mustered the tough pressure that might force Mr. Assad to stop the killing, or Syria\xe2\x80\x99s Army and business elite to toss him out.'b'For months, 'b'Russia has been blocking'b' the United Nations Security Council from imposing any serious punishments. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin is far more interested 'b'in selling arms to Syria'b' and thwarting democratic forces and their Western backers.'b'On Monday, Russia proposed a shamefully weak resolution that put equal blame on the protesters and the Syrian Army for the violence and made no mention of sanctions. The United States and other members are trying to toughen it up, but we are not optimistic.'b'That means it is up to Arab League ministers who need to recognize that the time for the Syrian dictator to go has long past. With his butchery, Mr. Assad has made clear that there is no compromise or deal to be had \xe2\x80\x94 and he has made clear his contempt for the Arab League\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to broker peace.'b'When they meet this weekend in Cairo, the ministers should agree to pull out their failed monitoring mission and impose the sanctions that they originally approved in November and then suspended, including a freeze on Syrian government assets in Arab countries and a ban on transactions with Syria\xe2\x80\x99s central bank. The league should also insist that the Security Council do the same.'b'The European Union\xe2\x80\x99s oil embargo and an American and European ban on business with Syria\xe2\x80\x99s main commercial bank, in particular, have hit the economy hard. When the European Union meets on Monday, it is expected to place asset freezes and visa bans on 22 more individuals and eight more companies connected to the government. There is little chance of changing Mr. Assad\xe2\x80\x99s mind. But, in time, such pressure could persuade army and business elites to abandon the Assad government.'b'World leaders must keep speaking out against the slaughter as President Obama did on Tuesday 'b'when he met with King Abdullah II of Jordan at the White House'b'. He decried the \xe2\x80\x9cterrible brutality\xe2\x80\x9d in Syria and pledged to redouble efforts to force Mr. Assad out.'b'There is no easy solution. But the international community needs to exert whatever diplomatic and economic pressure it can to make clear to Mr. Assad and his cronies that their time has run out.'b'The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is about to reach a historic achievement. By May, the agency will have 'b'set annual catch limits'b' for every federally managed fish species, more than 500 in all. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, this vital task has been accomplished in a genuinely bipartisan manner. The law requiring annual limits, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, was reauthorized in 2007 with support from President George W. Bush and has been carried out by the Obama administration.'b'This step also brings the country\xe2\x80\x99s eight regional fishery management councils, which are established by the act and frame fishery plans for their waters, into accord with the federal agency. Each council is a coalition of state and federal representatives, fishermen and conservationists. The new limits were produced in partnership with the regional councils, which in the past have sometimes set higher catch limits than scientists at the federal agency deemed sustainable.'b'Not everyone supports the idea of annual catch limits or the way they are set. Some commercial fishermen and fishing coalitions complain that there simply isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough data to judge the size of some fish stocks, much less define overfishing limits, made enforceable with fines or seasonal restrictions.'b'They have accused the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of placing the well-being of fish above the well-being of the fishing industry and sacrificing jobs on the basis of scientific research that is underfinanced and fish counts that are performed infrequently. But conservative catch limits are the only way to keep species like cod from being fished out of existence. Annual limits are the most responsible way to ensure that there will be fish \xe2\x80\x94 and fishing jobs \xe2\x80\x94 in the future.'b'IS it possible for a religious demand for modesty to be about anything other than men controlling women\xe2\x80\x99s bodies? From recent events in Israel, it would certainly seem that it is not.'b'Last month, an innocent, modestly dressed 8-year-old girl, Naama Margolese, living in Beit Shemesh, described being spat on and vilified by religious extremists \xe2\x80\x94 all men \xe2\x80\x94 who believed that she did not dress modestly enough while walking past them to the religious school she attends. And more and more, public buses in Israel are enforcing gender segregation imposed by ultra-Orthodox riders in and near their neighborhoods. Woe to the girl or woman who refuses to move to the back of the bus.'b'This is part of a larger battle being waged in Israel between the ultra-Orthodox and the rest of Israeli society over women\xe2\x80\x99s place in society, over their very right to have a visible presence and to participate in the public sphere.'b'What is behind these deeply disturbing events? We are told that they arise from a religious concern about modesty, that women must be covered and sequestered so that men do not have improper sexual thoughts. It seems, then, that a religious tenet that begins with men\xe2\x80\x99s sexual thoughts ends with men controlling women\xe2\x80\x99s bodies.'b'This is not a problem unique to Judaism. But the Talmud, the basis for Jewish law, offers a perhaps surprising answer: It places the responsibility for controlling men\xe2\x80\x99s licentious thoughts about women squarely on the men.'b'Put more plainly, the Talmud says: It\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'your 'b'problem, sir; not hers.'b'The ultra-Orthodox men in Israel who are exerting control over women claim that they are honoring women. In effect they are saying: We do not treat women as sex objects as you in Western society do. Our women are about more than their bodies, and that is why their bodies must be fully covered.'b'In fact, though, their actions objectify and hyper-sexualize women. Think about it: By saying that all women must hide their bodies, they are saying that every woman is an object who can stir a man\xe2\x80\x99s sexual thoughts. Thus, every woman who passes their field of vision is sized up on the basis of how much of her body is covered. She is not seen as a complete person, only as a potential inducement to sin.'b'Of course, once you judge a female human being only through a man\xe2\x80\x99s sexualized imagination, you can turn even a modest 8-year-old girl into a seductress and a prostitute.'b'At heart, we are talking about a blame-the-victim mentality. It shifts the responsibility of managing a man\xe2\x80\x99s sexual urges from himself to every woman he may or may not encounter. It is a cousin to the mentality behind the claim, \xe2\x80\x9cShe was asking for it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'So the responsibility is now on the women. To protect men from their sexual thoughts, women must remove their femininity from their public presence, ridding themselves of even the smallest evidence of their own sexuality.'b'All of this is done in the name of the Torah and Jewish law.'b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s actually a complete perversion. The Talmud, the foundation of Jewish law, acknowledges that men can be sexually aroused by women and is indeed concerned with sexual thoughts and activity outside of marriage. But it does not tell women that men\xe2\x80\x99s sexual urges are their responsibility. Rather, both the Talmud and the later codes of Jewish law make that demand of men.'b'It is forbidden for a man to gaze sexually at a woman, whether beautiful or ugly, married or unmarried, says the Talmud. Later Talmudic rabbis extended this ban even to \xe2\x80\x9cher smallest finger\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cher brightly colored clothing \xe2\x80\x94 even if they are drying on the wall.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To make these the woman\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility is to demand that Jewish women cover their hands, and that they not dry their clothes in public. No one has ever said this. At least not yet.'b'The Talmud tells the religious man, in effect: If you have a problem, you deal with it. It is the male gaze \xe2\x80\x94 the way men look at women \xe2\x80\x94 that needs to be desexualized, not women in public. The power to make sure men don\xe2\x80\x99t see women as objects of sexual gratification lies within men\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 and only men\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 control.'b'Jewish tradition teaches men and women alike that they should be modest in their dress. But modesty is not defined by, or even primarily about, how much of one\xe2\x80\x99s body is covered. It is about comportment and behavior. It is about recognizing that one need not be the center of attention. It is about embodying the prophet Micah\xe2\x80\x99s call for modesty: learning \xe2\x80\x9cto walk humbly with your God.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Eight-year-old Naama could teach her attackers a thing or two about modesty.'b'The Colorado affiliate of Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. showed admirable understanding, and taught its young members a valuable lesson, 'b'when it said that it welcomes'b' youngsters who were born male but identify as a girl and have a family that \xe2\x80\x9cpresents her as a girl.\xe2\x80\x9d The group clarified its policy after the mother of a 7-year-old was mistakenly told that her child could not join a troop because he has \xe2\x80\x9cboy parts\xe2\x80\x9d and she publicly complained. The Scouts contacted the mother, but the child has not enrolled.'b'Unfortunately, not all Girl Scout troops share the Girl Scouts\xe2\x80\x99 fundamental value of inclusion. Three troops at a Christian school in Louisiana disbanded to protest Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s policy, which is supported by the national Girl Scouts organization.'b'And the controversy erupted again a few days ago thanks to an eight-minute video that was posted on the YouTube channel of Honest Girl Scouts, a group that regularly attacks Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. for abandoning \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional values\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 whatever that is supposed to mean.'b'In the video, a 14-year-old girl scout from California reads a script criticizing Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. for accepting transgender members and calling for a boycott of Girl Scout cookies. The video received 387,000 hits before the group marked the video \xe2\x80\x9cprivate,\xe2\x80\x9d blocking viewing by the general public. A portion of the video 'b'is still available elsewhere on YouTube'b'.'b'Happily, it seems the video\xe2\x80\x99s main effect so far has been to draw wide expressions of support for the Girl Scouts\xe2\x80\x99 policy. The national and Colorado offices of the organization say that they do not expect a drop in sales and that many people may buy more boxes than usual to show they stand with the Girl Scouts and against bigotry. We hope so. And, for the record, our favorite is the Thin Mint.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'For Gingrich, Rival\xe2\x80\x99s Gift and an Ex-Wife\xe2\x80\x99s Sting'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 20):'b'The issue I will focus on is not whether Newt Gingrich had an \xe2\x80\x9copen marriage\xe2\x80\x9d or wanted one, but whether he can take personal responsibility and accountability for his own actions and behavior \xe2\x80\x94 and once again it appears that he cannot.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s ironic that he can wrap himself in the ideal of free speech and at the same time complain about being questioned on his personal conduct.

The international debate on the role of rating agencies has rightly been reignited.'b'PETER BREZOVSZKY'b'\nConsul General of Austria'b'\nNew York, Jan. 16, 2012'b''b''b'Monrovia, Liberia'b'ON Monday, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was inaugurated for a second term. She is often depicted in the press as a postwar leader successfully rebuilding a country destroyed by decades of conflict.\xc2\xa0For her many admirable accomplishments, she recently shared the Nobel Peace Prize. However, unbeknown to many outside Liberia, Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf\xe2\x80\x99s government may now be sowing the seeds of future conflict by handing over huge tracts of land to foreign investors and dispossessing rural Liberians.'b'Between 2006 and 2011, Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf granted more than a third of Liberia\xe2\x80\x99s land to private investors to use for logging, mining and agro-industrial enterprises. Today, more than seven million acres have become forestry and agricultural concessions. In 2009 and 2010, Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf\xe2\x80\x99s government awarded more than 1.6 million acres for palm oil production. The land went to the Malaysian corporation Sime Darby and to Golden Veroleum, a subsidiary of the New York-based 'b'Verdant Fund L.P.'b' These concessions come at a delicate time, as violent local-level land disputes both between and within villages are still widespread throughout Liberia.'b'More than a million people live in the regions where the palm-oil concessions were granted. And roughly 150,000 will be directly affected in the first five years of plantation development. Many could lose access to their homes, farms, cemeteries and sacred sites as well as the forest and water resources they depend on for survival. Yet the government negotiated these deals without consulting those who would bear the greatest burden.'b'In recent months, Sime Darby has begun developing its first 25,000 acres in Grand Cape Mount County in northwestern Liberia. Already, local communities are raising concerns about environmental degradation, desecration of sacred areas and the company\xe2\x80\x99s failure to pay workers promised salaries. They have filed a complaint against Sime Darby before the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, an international certification body.'b'In response, Sime Darby representatives traveled to the area on Jan. 6 and held meetings with villagers. However, according to Liberian newspapers, members of Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf\xe2\x80\x99s government, led by officials from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, disrupted the negotiations and 'b'halted discussions'b' before any resolution was reached.'b'The president then visited the villagers herself. 'b'She told them'b', \xe2\x80\x9cWhen your government and the representatives sign any paper with a foreign country, the communities can\xe2\x80\x99t change it,\xe2\x80\x9d claiming that the Constitution granted the government \xe2\x80\x94 and no one else \xe2\x80\x94 the right to negotiate with foreign investors. She also told villagers that, in their efforts to hold Sime Darby accountable for its human rights transgressions, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are trying to undermine your own government. You can\xe2\x80\x99t do that. If you do so all the foreign investors coming to Liberia will close their businesses and leave, then Liberia will go back to the old days.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Taking legal action to protect one\xe2\x80\x99s home, land and environment from abuse by corporations does not undermine governance; it strengthens state and corporate accountability. By dictating that communities\xe2\x80\x99 only available means of redress is through the state \xe2\x80\x94 which has a less-than-sterling track record of prioritizing rural residents\xe2\x80\x99 rights over foreign business interests \xe2\x80\x94 Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf is obstructing more effective methods of achieving justice.'b'Her administration must change the way it does business. First, she should stop restricting communities from directly engaging with private corporations. Second, rural Liberians should be permitted to use all the legal and advocacy tools at their disposal to safeguard their lands. Third, the government should establish a concession-allocation process that includes informed consent and genuinely engages the rural communities whose land will be affected. A more inclusive and transparent process would serve the government\xe2\x80\x99s interests, because it is likely to reduce future land conflicts.'b'Rural Liberians welcome international investment and they continue to hope, despite decades of evidence to the contrary, that it will bring local development and prosperity. However, they also want to be consulted, compensated for any resulting losses and given the right to determine and manage how their lands and resources are used by investors during the lifetime of the concession.'b'As foreign investment in Liberia and other poor African countries grows, legal empowerment of rural communities is critical. Those affected by development projects must be educated about their legal rights, fully informed about the terms and environmental ramifications of land concessions and encouraged to stand up against unjust corporate practices.'b'Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf clearly takes seriously her responsibility to attract foreign investment. Her government must now become equally serious about placing Liberia\xe2\x80\x99s citizens ahead of corporations and involving them in government decisions that affect their lands and livelihoods.'b'Right now, you are probably asking yourself whether two divorces, a history of adultery and an ex-wife who says you asked for an open marriage would be enough to disqualify a person from becoming president of the United States.'b'O.K., pretend that was what you were asking yourself.'b'Sex was one of the topics very much on the minds of voters as South Carolina prepared to go to the polls on Saturday. Also, there was the big debate, in which Newt Gingrich said that asking about the open marriage thing was \xe2\x80\x9cdespicable.\xe2\x80\x9d That was also when Mitt Romney slipped and referred to health reform in Massachusetts as \xe2\x80\x9cRomneycare,\xe2\x80\x9d which I enjoyed very much.'b'Meanwhile, elsewhere in the campaign, Herman Cain announced that he was endorsing \xe2\x80\x9cthe people\xe2\x80\x9d for president. On behalf of the people, I would like to say that, if elected, we promise to balance the budget, release Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s tax returns and pass a law against driving to Canada with an Irish setter tied to the roof of the car.'b'But about sex. Marianne Gingrich, Wife No. 2, told ABC News in an interview that Newt had called her up while she was visiting her mother, told her he was having an affair, and then proposed\xc2\xa0an open marriage. Newt denied the open marriage part and referred all questions to his two daughters by his other former marriage.'b'This seems like a lot to dump on the daughters. When we the people are president, we are definitely passing a law against requiring children to field media inquiries about their father\xe2\x80\x99s other wives.'b'South Carolina is probably not the ideal state in which to be accused of breaking the matrimonial bonds, then smashing them and jumping up and down on them until they\xe2\x80\x99re just a pile of marital powdery dust. But Newt has framed his sexual history \xe2\x80\x94 the parts he isn\xe2\x80\x99t totally denying \xe2\x80\x94 in terms of a redemption story. (\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had to go to God for forgiveness.\xe2\x80\x9d) Everybody likes a story of the fallen man who rejects his wicked ways and starts a new life. Remember how well George W. Bush did with the one about renouncing alcohol on his 40th birthday? There is, however, a lot of difference between giving up drinking on the eve of middle age and giving up adultery at about the time you\xe2\x80\x99re qualifying for Social Security. Cynics might suggest that Newt didn\xe2\x80\x99t so much reform as poop out.'b'Still, he has several things working in his favor, one of which has got to be the public\xe2\x80\x99s lack of appetite for thinking about Newt Gingrich\xe2\x80\x99s sex life at all.'b'Another is that his hound dog persona is old news. Marianne even told the break-up story to Esquire a while back. That version included the memorable description of how Newt had explained that she was a Jaguar, while he needed a Chevrolet, like his Washington squeeze, Callista.'b'This would appear to be a Newtian version of \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s not you, it\xe2\x80\x99s me.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Conservative Gingrich fans lined up to argue that his bedroom behavior made no difference. Dr. Keith Ablow, a psychiatrist \xe2\x80\x9cand member of the Fox News Medical A-Team\xe2\x80\x9d opined on the Fox Web site that it actually made Newt a better candidate: \xe2\x80\x9cSo, as far as I can tell, judging from the psychological data, we have only one real risk to America from his marital history if Newt Gingrich were to become president: We would need to worry that another nation, perhaps a little younger than ours, would be so taken by Mr. Gingrich that it would seduce him into marrying it and becoming its president.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'O.K.'b'Voters very seldom penalize politicians for sexual misbehavior \xe2\x80\x94 unless it\xe2\x80\x99s of a type that suggests the pol in question is a little ... off. (See: sexting pictures of your underwear, having tickling parties with your young male aides, telling your staff you\xe2\x80\x99re going on a hike and then flying to see your girlfriend in Argentina. Really, when you look back, we have been through a lot.)'b'Beyond the hypocrisy of this sort of behavior from a guy who wants to protect the sanctity of holy matrimony from gay couples, there also seems to be a streak of almost crazed self-absorption that runs through the Newt saga. Who would ditch a spouse of 18 years in a phone call? Shortly after she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis? And, of course, he broke up with his first wife while she was battling cancer. Do you see a theme developing here? This is the same guy who proudly announced \xe2\x80\x9cI think grandiose thoughts\xe2\x80\x9d during the last debate.'b'Campaigning after the ABC News interview broke, Gingrich said: \xe2\x80\x9cCallista and I have a wonderful relationship. We knew we\xe2\x80\x99d get beaten up. We knew we\xe2\x80\x99d get lied about. We knew we\xe2\x80\x99d get smeared. We knew there would be nasty attack ads. And we decided the country was worth the pain.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The country is so grateful for your sacrifice.'b'It took longer than expected, but the Obama administration is finally poised to enact badly needed regulations requiring that the manufacturers of drugs, medical devices and medical supplies disclose all payments they make to doctors or teaching hospitals. The information, which would be posted on a government Web site, will allow patients to decide whether they need to worry about any possible conflicts of interest.'b'Such payments can be for legitimate research and consulting. But there is also a lot of cash being spread around to pay for doctors\xe2\x80\x99 travel and entertainment or for gifts or modest meals for a prescribing doctor\xe2\x80\x99s staff.'b'As Robert Pear 'b'reported'b' in The Times this week, some prominent doctors and researchers receive hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars a year in exchange for providing advice to a company or giving lectures on its behalf. About a quarter of all doctors take some cash payments from drug or device makers and nearly two-thirds accept meals or food gifts. Analysts contend that even seemingly trivial gifts can influence doctors to prescribe expensive drugs that may not be best for a patient\xe2\x80\x99s health or pocketbook.'b'The new rules were championed by Senator Charles Grassley, a Republican, and Senator Herb Kohl, a Democrat, and incorporated into the health care reforms enacted in 2010. The reform law required the Department of Health and Human Services to establish reporting procedures by Oct. 1, 2011, and required manufacturers to start collecting the relevant data by Jan. 1, 2012. The proposed rules were finally issued on Dec. 14 and are subject to comment until Feb. 17, after which they will be revised and issued in final form.'b'The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will publish the disclosure data on a public Web site that the law says must be searchable and understandable so that patients and advocacy groups can see which doctors are being paid and how much. Manufacturers could be fined up to $150,000 a year for failing to report payments and up to $1 million a year for \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d failing to report.'b'The new rules should give a welcome boost to otherwise spotty efforts by some companies, medical centers, scientific journals, states and ethical codes to eliminate, minimize or at least disclose financial interests that might cloud medical judgments. The existence of the Web site could deter some questionable payments. And it could help patients decide which doctors to rely on.'b'When it comes to the question of cleaner streets or cleaner windows on cars parked illegally on those streets, the New York City Council has now sided with the vehicles and their owners.'b'For nearly 25 years, New York\xe2\x80\x99s sanitation workers have slapped a neon yellow sticker \xe2\x80\x94 often along with a $65 ticket \xe2\x80\x94 on any car that blocks street cleaning machines. The stickers are hard to get off, and people complain that the \xe2\x80\x9cstickers of shame\xe2\x80\x9d resist soap and water, even alcohol. This week, the Council, led by 'b'Councilman David Greenfield'b' of Brooklyn, 'b'voted unanimously to get rid of these irritating attachments'b'.'b'But here\xe2\x80\x99s the rub. These embarrassing stickers seem to work. They work better than the tickets alone, which people can tuck quietly into their pockets and pay or contest later. So, Mayor Michael Bloomberg should veto the bill, even though the Council could override it.'b'John Nucatola, the director of the city\xe2\x80\x99s Sanitation Department\xe2\x80\x99s cleaning bureau, has argued that ending the use of stickers would \xe2\x80\x9cgreatly impact community cleanliness.\xe2\x80\x9d The city requires cars to move from one side of the street to the other on a somewhat complicated schedule so that the cleaning machines can sweep by 6,000 miles of curbing every working day.'b'Mr. Nucatola told the Council in November that street cleanliness is now at an all-time high \xe2\x80\x94 scoring 95 out of 100 on the city\xe2\x80\x99s own surveys. There have been new machines, of course. But the stickers also help; the cleanliness rating was only 73 before 1988, when the stickers first appeared. Granted these stickers could be a little easier to scrape off. But they are a useful tool and not, as Councilman Greenfield contends, a \xe2\x80\x9ccruel and unnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d punishment, by those sweeping the city\xe2\x80\x99s streets.'b'In America, a person is presumed innocent until proved guilty. Unless, that is, he plays college sports.'b'When the N.C.A.A. investigates an athlete for breaking its rules, not only is he presumed guilty but his punishment begins before he knows what he\xe2\x80\x99s accused of. He is not told who his accuser is. The N.C.A.A. will delve into the personal relationships of his relatives and demand their bank statements and other private records. And it will hand down its verdict without so much as a hearing. Reputations have been ruined on accusations so flimsy that they would be laughed out of any court in the land. Then again, the N.C.A.A. isn\xe2\x80\x99t a court of law. It\xe2\x80\x99s more powerful.'b'Like most sports fans, I had always assumed that if an athlete was sanctioned by the N.C.A.A., he must have done something wrong. I don\xe2\x80\x99t assume that anymore. Many N.C.A.A. infractions consist of actions that most people would consider perfectly appropriate \xe2\x80\x94 and entirely legal \xe2\x80\x94 but that the N.C.A.A. has chosen to criminalize. Today\xe2\x80\x99s case in point: the ongoing N.C.A.A. harassment \xe2\x80\x94 there is no other word for it \xe2\x80\x94 of 'b'Ryan Boatright'b', a basketball player at the University of Connecticut.'b'Boatright is 19 years old, a freshman guard who was named Mr. Basketball in Illinois during his senior year of high school. He grew up in Aurora, outside of Chicago, one of four children raised by his mother, Tanesha. He clearly sees basketball as his means to a better life.'b'But to get to that better life, whether in the N.B.A. or a European league, he needs to be able to play in college, and, so far, the N.C.A.A. has done its best to prevent that from happening. Before the season began, it informed Connecticut that Boatright was under investigation for accepting \xe2\x80\x9cimproper benefits\xe2\x80\x9d in high school. (That\xe2\x80\x99s right: The N.C.A.A. regulates the behavior of athletes who have not yet joined the N.C.A.A.) Connecticut immediately suspended him from the team; otherwise it risked forfeiting games that Boatright played in. That\xe2\x80\x99s how the system works \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s why I say that players are punished before they even know the charges against them.'b'Sure enough, the N.C.A.A. eventually informed Connecticut that Boatright would be 'b'suspended for six games'b' \xe2\x80\x94 and that he would have to come up with $100 a month to repay the \xe2\x80\x9cimpermissible benefit.\xe2\x80\x9d (I was unable to learn how long the payments will continue, but I hear that it is substantial.)'b'Surely, Boatright must have done something awful to merit that kind of punishment, right? In fact, he did nothing at all. It was his mother who had violated N.C.A.A. rules. Her crime was looking out for her son.'b'Like any parent would, she wanted to visit the schools her son was considering. But under N.C.A.A. rules, the universities recruiting Ryan are only allowed to pay his way, not hers. So she got the money from an old friend, Reggie Rose, an A.A.U. coach in Aurora and the older brother of 'b'Derrick Rose'b', the Chicago Bulls star. Boatright played for Rose during his last two years of high school, but his mother had known Rose well before then. That airfare is the \xe2\x80\x9cimpermissible benefit.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cReggie Rose is not a UConn booster,\xe2\x80\x9d says 'b'Sonny Vaccaro'b', a former Nike marketer who is now a critic of the N.C.A.A. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is not an agent. He has a pre-existing relationship with Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s mother. He was doing what anyone would do: lending a hand. That should be applauded.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Instead, the N.C.A.A. told Tanesha that she should \xe2\x80\x9cstay away\xe2\x80\x9d from Rose \xe2\x80\x94 thus claiming yet another absurd power: the power to dictate who an athlete\xe2\x80\x99s parents can befriend. (Tanesha declined to comment.)'b'And how did the N.C.A.A. find out about Tanesha\xe2\x80\x99s airfare? Get this: The N.C.A.A. heard about it from her ex-boyfriend, a convicted felon who, according to Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s cousin, Jaeh Thomas, had once seen Ryan as \xe2\x80\x9chis big ticket.\xe2\x80\x9d When the relationship turned ugly, he vowed to exact revenge on Tanesha by calling in the N.C.A.A., according to Thomas and Mike McAllister, Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s father. If this were a court proceeding, the ex-boyfriend\xe2\x80\x99s credibility could be challenged and his motives questioned. Instead, in its crazed obsession with its extra-legal rules, the N.C.A.A. is willing to serve the interests of an angry ex-boyfriend who wants to ruin an athlete\xe2\x80\x99s career to get back at his mother. It almost defies belief.'b'Ryan did finally get to play once his suspension ended. His case had been closed. Last Saturday, against Notre Dame, was supposed to be his fourth game back. South Bend is only two-and-a-half hours from Aurora, and more than 400 Aurora residents bought tickets to the game. Ryan was excited at the prospect of playing in front of friends and family. Finally, he thought, his troubles with the N.C.A.A. were over.'b'But he was wrong. What happened next will be the subject of Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s column.'b'In a closely watched case about a redistricting battle in Texas, the Supreme Court on Friday issued 'b'a per curiam opinion'b' that added a further twist in a rushed and messy controversy. 'b'In the unanimous ruling'b', the Supreme Court told a three-judge district court in San Antonio to put aside redistricting plans it created and devise new maps based on those made by the Texas Legislature. And this time, the Supreme Court said, the district court must do a better job of explaining any maps it draws.'b'Democrats need 25 seats to retake the House. As the Supreme Court noted, the census \xe2\x80\x9cshowed an enormous increase in Texas\xe2\x80\x99s population, with over four million new residents,\xe2\x80\x9d giving the state four new House seats. Hispanics, who tend to vote for Democrats, account for almost two-thirds of the growth; Hispanics and African-Americans together account for about three-fourths.'b'But in the Congressional district maps drawn up by the Republican-controlled Texas Legislature, the number of districts in which minorities could elect a candidate of their choice dropped to 10 districts from the current 11, and the number of safe Republican seats rose to 26 from 21. In trying to fix this imbalance, the district court\xe2\x80\x99s plan created three new districts in which minority voters would be the majority, with the Democrats 'b'possibly gaining four seats'b'.'b'The Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s plan has not gone into effect because Texas, as a state covered by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act for its history of voting discrimination, must have its plan precleared by the Justice Department or by a district court in the District of Columbia. The state chose to go to that court, which is expected to rule on its plan next month. This case runs parallel to that one, with plaintiffs claiming that the same Texas plan also violates the Constitution and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits a state from denying or abridging the right to vote \xe2\x80\x9con account of race or color.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At the oral argument, one justice wanted to ignore Section 5, others wanted to limit its impact on the Section 2 lawsuit, others still insisted that Section 5 could not be ignored. The justices chastised the San Antonio court for not showing enough deference to the Texas plan, but there is clear evidence that it embodies what the Justice Department in the Section 5 lawsuit calls \xe2\x80\x9cintentional discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and should not be allowed to prevail.'b'Up with Newt.

That was appreciably higher than both independents and Democrats. And that same month a Gallup poll found that three-quarters of Republicans believe that the news media are too liberal.

The crowd ate it up.'b'In a previous debate on Monday, Gingrich rebuffed a suggestion by Fox News\xe2\x80\x99s Juan Williams, a debate panelist, that blacks might be offended by his notion that they should demand jobs not food stamps, or that poor children lacked a strong work ethic, or that calling Obama the \xe2\x80\x9cfood stamp president\xe2\x80\x9d might be \xe2\x80\x9cintended to belittle the poor and racial minorities.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Gingrich scoffed: \xe2\x80\x9cI know among the politically correct, you\xe2\x80\x99re not supposed to use facts that are uncomfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d More points.

This may work for him in the primaries, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bode well for his party in November.'b'In the year since President Hosni Mubarak was ousted, Egypt has faced many challenges: the military-led government\xe2\x80\x99s brutality against protesters and pro-democracy groups, its resistance to handing power to civilian leaders and the rise of Islamists in the country\xe2\x80\x99s first free elections. Now worsening economic conditions are further sabotaging hopes for a democratic future.'b'The country\xe2\x80\x99s foreign currency reserves 'b'have fallen from a peak of $36 billion to about $10 billion'b' and could run out entirely by March. The currency is under severe pressure, and a steep drop in the exchange rate could bring painful inflation and more social unrest. Youth unemployment is about 25 percent, a dangerous situation where 60 percent of the citizens are 30 and under.'b'Egyptians want jobs, education and a say in governance. Many are justifiably angry about the military\xe2\x80\x99s autocratic control \xe2\x80\x94 and will be angrier still if economic conditions deteriorate further. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t the only ones with a stake in the outcome. Egypt is the fourth-largest economy in the Middle East. Its success, or failure, will have a huge impact on the region and beyond.'b'Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s military rulers are now realizing how big a threat the collapsing economy is \xe2\x80\x94 and they clearly don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be blamed. In May, they rejected a $3.2 billion loan from the 'b'International Monetary Fund'b', saying it would infringe on Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty. They wanted the money, but with no strings attached \xe2\x80\x94 no mandatory reforms or austerity measures, like cutting food and fuel subsidies. Now desperate, they resurrected the loan request this week and 'b'welcomed an I.M.F. delegation'b' to discuss possible components of an economic program. The I.M.F. probably won\xe2\x80\x99t make a decision on that request until March.'b'The fund\xe2\x80\x99s officials say that they do not intend to impose conditions on the loan. But even without conditions, Egypt must make reforms if it wants to spur private business ventures, foreign investment and growth. Such measures can never be sustained without public support.'b'In 'b'a recent interview with Reuters news service'b', the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood\xe2\x80\x99s economic committee, Ashraf Badr el-Din, suggested that the Brotherhood and other main parties are moving toward consensus on managing the economy. If true, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good sign. The United States, the European Union and the gulf states last year promised billions of dollars in assistance to Egypt, but most of it has not materialized as they waited for signs of political stability. If the I.M.F. negotiations over the loan terms succeed, those countries should move quickly on their commitments, including offers to begin free-trade talks with Egypt.'b'Washington and its allies may not have much sway with the military rulers or the newly elected political leaders in the short term, but they have to build long-term relationships with all segments of civil society. Some say Egypt could be one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s top 10 economies in a generation. That\xe2\x80\x99s a goal worth working toward.'b'WITH little fanfare, a dangerous notion has taken hold in progressive policy circles: that the amount of money borrowed by the federal government from Americans to finance its mammoth deficits doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.'b'Debt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter? Really? That\xe2\x80\x99s the most irresponsible fiscal notion since the tax-cutting mania brought on by the advent of 'b'supply-side economics'b'. And it\xe2\x80\x99s particularly problematic right now, as Congress resumes debating whether to extend the payroll-tax reduction or enact other stimulative measures.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s the theory, in its most extreme configuration: To the extent that the government sells its debt to Americans (as opposed to foreigners), those obligations will disappear as aging folks who buy those Treasuries die off.'b'If that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to make much sense, don\xe2\x80\x99t be puzzled \xe2\x80\x94 it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. Government borrowing is still debt that must eventually be paid off, just as we were taught in introductory economics.'b'Failing to repay the debt would mean not only the ugliness of default but also depriving the next generation of whatever savings their parents parked in government bonds.'b'And remember that just a small fraction of Treasuries are owned by individual Americans. Institutions and many foreign entities own the rest and are not about to give up claims that they are owed.'b'The more realistic alternative of continuing to service that debt offers the unattractive eventual prospect of either higher taxes or sharp cutbacks in government programs, or both.'b'That problem is greatly compounded by the fact that the $10 trillion of debt that is held by investors represents only a fraction of the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s obligations and ignores an additional $46 trillion of commitments to 'b'Social Security'b' and 'b'Medicare'b'.'b'Of course every modern economy both tolerates and benefits from some amount of debt. But the United States has been on a binge, brought on by a toxic mix of spending increases and tax cuts that began with the Reagan tax cuts in the 1980s and were later turbocharged by those of President George W. Bush.'b'The figures are stark. In 1975, government debt per household was roughly equal to half of a typical household\xe2\x80\x99s annual income. Today, it\xe2\x80\x99s 1.7 times. Add entitlements, and the obligations would take a mind-boggling nine years of family income to pay off.'b'Even deficit hawks like me recognize that with the economy still barely above stall speed, now is hardly the moment for the government to slam on the fiscal brakes, debt or no debt.'b'So that means there\xe2\x80\x99s no realistic alternative to more debt. But we can reduce the adverse consequences by how we spend this borrowed money. There are two main forms of stimulus: one kind is channeled through tax cuts and then mostly spent, just like a strapped family that puts its monthly expenses onto a credit card. Alternatively, government can direct its resources toward long-term investments that earn a return; think roads and dams but also medical research and education.'b'At the moment, gridlock grips Washington, and about all that Congress has offered is a two-month cut in the 'b'payroll tax'b', which may help shake the economy out of the doldrums but provides little lasting benefit.'b'We could just as effectively throw borrowed hundred-dollar bills out of airplanes. About the only worse approach would be nothing at all.'b'Government\xe2\x80\x99s focus should shift toward investment. To do so, multiple challenges must be overcome.'b'First, unlike every company in America, the government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t keep its books in a way that highlights these important two categories, investment and consumption. As a result, Congress can\xe2\x80\x99t evaluate the long-term impact of its actions.'b'Second, the dark shadow of the 'b'Tea Party movement'b' has made added spending \xe2\x80\x94 the route for most new government investment \xe2\x80\x94 taboo.'b'While public investment may take longer to unleash its positive forces, the case for it is compelling, in part because rising entitlement expenditures have crowded out government\xe2\x80\x99s investment activities.'b'In the early 1950s, government devoted about 1.2 percent of gross domestic product to infrastructure; by 2010, that amount had fallen to just 0.2 percent. Meanwhile, federal spending on research and development dropped from a high of nearly 2 percent in 1964 to 0.9 percent in 2009.'b'By contrast, Franklin D. Roosevelt\xe2\x80\x99s much-praised Works Progress Administration spent the equivalent of at least $1.5 trillion over eight years on projects that in New York City alone ranged from building La Guardia Airport to reroofing the New York Public Library to creating a lasting body of literary and artistic work.'b'I agree that short-term help for the economy combined with long-term deficit reduction is the right direction for budgetary policy.'b'But we also need to make every dollar of debt matter, and therefore we should be directing our efforts to lifting the economy toward programs that provide long-term benefit, not just a short-term burst of caffeinated energy.'b'Should workers be compelled to join unions or pay dues?

The 'b'50 teeth'b', more than any other North American mammal has, are kind of horrifying, but possums may look at us and wonder, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy only 32?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Apparently no one went to the trouble to see if the D-train possum was female, perhaps 'b'pregnant'b'. A female would have a womb as well as a pouch, a combination that can turn out two litters a year.'b'Male or female, our subway possum, no bigger than a house cat, was not aggressive or destructive. His or her snarl when the officials came with a canvas bag was completely justified as self-defense. He or she chose not to feign death, the traditional act of playing possum.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s the opposite of aggression, though the performance does include emitting a putrid fluid from the anal glands. Except for the potential scent assault, the danger posed by the creature was small. The little animal could have simply been left on the train to continue the ride uptown, though someone would have had to break the news to him or her that the B and C, not the D, stop at the 72nd Street entrance to Central Park.'b'Possums are worthy of our attention. Not only do they rarely get rabies, but possums are virtually immune to snake venom. (They 'b'eat rattlesnakes'b'.) Something in their blood detoxifies pit viper venom; the immune effect has been shown to be transferable to mice.'b'Though life is short, usually two years, for the individual possum, the greater possum family has survived for many millions of years. An early version of the possum was among the first mammals that shared the earth with dinosaurs. Possums crossed into North America three million years ago when the Isthmus of Panama closed.'b'They\xe2\x80\x99re still on the move, and the farther north they travel, the closer they stick to human environments. At the northern end of their range, possums are more likely to be found in towns and cities than in the woods \xe2\x80\x94 could be the food in the garbage, could be the human-generated heat. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to be seeing them up close more often.'b'What should you do if you see a possum? Robert Voss, curator in the department of mammalogy at the American Museum of Natural History, said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou should feel yourself blessed for having seen one of the most wonderful animals in North America.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'THE people who invite us to wallow in food seldom remind us to beware.'b'In the pages of their gorgeously illustrated cookbooks or on their delectably edited TV shows, they assemble and plunge headlong into lavish feasts, oohing as they baste, cooing as they carve and swooning over the side dishes. We respond as intended. We hanker and yearn.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s what we don\xe2\x80\x99t see: the yogurt and berries they had for breakfast; the 'b'salads'b' and grilled vegetables they eat on nights off; the portion of each lovingly shot dish that they don\xe2\x80\x99t touch, having satisfied their curiosity or the cameras with a few bites. If they\xe2\x80\x99re fit, they often neglect to mention the exercise involved. If they\xe2\x80\x99re not, they infrequently cop to their health worries or woes.'b'Last week Paula Deen copped. The woman whose 'b'best-known burger recipe'b' uses glazed doughnuts in place of a bun 'b'announced'b' that she has diabetes. It would have been refreshing if the circumstances hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been so self-serving: she was plugging her son Bobby\xe2\x80\x99s new Cooking Channel show, \xe2\x80\x9cNot My Mama\xe2\x80\x99s Meals,\xe2\x80\x9d which is devoted to lower-calorie recipes. And she had recently signed on as a paid pitchwoman for a diabetes drug.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s more, she had waited three long, greasy years since her diagnosis to come out. During that period, she promoted the deep-fried life without acknowledging her firsthand experience of how a person can be burned by it.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s a profound, unsettling act of withholding. But it\xe2\x80\x99s mirrored by many smaller, less calculated, more innocent ones in the world of food celebrities and food celebrators, including those of us who have written orgiastic accounts of sumptuous dinners. Deen\xe2\x80\x99s revelation jolted me in part because people in the business of peddling gastronomic bliss rarely draw such a bold connection between indulgence and its possible wages.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not that the wages are unpredictable or hidden. Every day seems to bring the invention of a new diet, and in a country with tens of millions of obese people, it sometimes seems that half of them are on reality shows, sweating or crying their way up the steep, broccoli-paved road to redemption. We once again have \xe2\x80\x9cjiggle TV,\xe2\x80\x9d only now it refers to the swoop and sway of second chins on a StairMaster.'b'But those programs tend to exist in a penitent universe apart from those that traffic in Southern barbecue, ornately iced cakes and the handiwork of iron-willed chefs. An exception that proves the rule is \xe2\x80\x9cFat Chef,\xe2\x80\x9d a 'b'Food Network show'b' beginning on Thursday. Apart from it, there\xe2\x80\x99s a chasm between revelry and responsibility that makes it all too easy to cast aside caution and dig in. That disconnect carries over to magazine publishing, where epicurean counsel and restrained eating are largely separate genres, and to the sectioning of newspapers, in which kitchen frolicking goes in the dining pages, low-calorie recipes in the health ones. Too much integration of the latter into the former spoils the fun.'b'But they\xe2\x80\x99re integrated behind the scenes. You show me a truly skinny food editor or writer who frequents serious restaurants and \xe2\x80\x94 in two out of three cases \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you someone expert at a brand of knife work that yields infinitesimal bites and an illusion of gluttony where mere grazing occurred. They should be surgeons, these people. I know. Especially during my five years as a restaurant critic, I ate with many of them \xe2\x80\x94 and can assure you that people in the food industry are among the least likely to clean their plates.'b'MANY of the acclaimed chefs whose television appearances, cookbooks or venerated restaurants whet our appetites have only an occasional, formal relationship with the luxuries they hawk. For a forthcoming book, Allison Adato, an editor at People, debriefed some three dozen of them about how they themselves ate.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I asked them what kind of food they cooked at home, it was surprising to me how many said roast chicken and vegetables,\xe2\x80\x9d she told me. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine. And none of them are particularly known for roast chicken.\xe2\x80\x9d She heard a lot as well about high-fiber cereals, egg whites, yogurt smoothies, leafy greens.'b'The research that she recounted to me and the 'b'book'b' itself, \xe2\x80\x9cSmart Chefs Stay Slim,\xe2\x80\x9d to be published by New American Library in April, describe a populous crowd of food professionals who work out diligently to keep the ravages of foie gras at bay.'b'They have private trainers. They play tennis or soccer. They climb rocks or box or do 'b'yoga'b' or bicycle or run. Adato\xe2\x80\x99s book spotlights four chefs and restaurateurs who have run marathons, including Art Smith, who cooked for Oprah Winfrey for 10 years and was once more than 100 pounds above his current weight. It could also have name-checked 'b'Bobby Flay'b', who has run three.'b'Gail Simmons, the host of \xe2\x80\x9cTop Chef: Just Desserts,\xe2\x80\x9d told me that she and her \xe2\x80\x9cTop Chef\xe2\x80\x9d colleagues are all committed exercisers. Padma Lakshmi, she said, will repeatedly scale hotel stairs for quick workouts when they\xe2\x80\x99re taping out of town.'b'They\xe2\x80\x99re careful with eating, too. Before each of three recent seasons, Simmons did a roughly 10-day program of mostly vegetarian meals with a three-day juice cleanse in the middle.'b'She\xe2\x80\x99s not trying to hide that, and in fact mentions her mindful ways in a 'b'memoir'b', \xe2\x80\x9cTalking With My Mouth Full,\xe2\x80\x9d to be published by Hyperion next month. The chefs whom Adato profiled weren\xe2\x80\x99t reticent about their efforts at fitness, either. Readers, though, may be surprised by the magnitude of discipline many of them muster. It just isn\xe2\x80\x99t brought up as often as it could be.'b'And discipline is in order, because some of the upscale victuals they concoct and invariably test aren\xe2\x80\x99t all that much safer than Deen\xe2\x80\x99s grub, the doughnut burger excepted. While Deen has a preponderance of calorie bombs in her playbook and a heavy hand with salt, a given dish of hers can sometimes be lighter than its haute counterpart. An analysis of written recipes that I commissioned from a dietitian suggested that her oven-fried potato wedges, made with mayonnaise, are 328 calories per serving. The chef Thomas Keller\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctasting of potatoes with black truffles,\xe2\x80\x9d made with cream and butter, is 494.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of thing that made me consider some 'b'past put-downs'b' of Deen elitist. After all, she isn\xe2\x80\x99t alone in exhorting people to pig out. She\xe2\x80\x99s just unusually cornmeal-crusted, saucy and bewigged about it.'b'I hope she\xe2\x80\x99ll have plenty of company now, too, as she tells some valuable truths about food and consequences, belated as they are.'b'Washington'b'IN democracies like ours, there have always been deep bonds between the public and its wars. Citizens have historically participated in decisions to take military action, through their elected representatives, helping to ensure broad support for wars and a willingness to share the costs, both human and economic, of enduring them.'b'In America, our Constitution explicitly divided the president\xe2\x80\x99s role as commander in chief in war from Congress\xe2\x80\x99s role in declaring war. Yet these links and this division of labor are now under siege as a result of a technology that our founding fathers never could have imagined.'b'Just 10 years ago, the idea of using armed robots in war was the stuff of Hollywood fantasy. Today, the United States military has 'b'more than 7,000 unmanned aerial systems'b', popularly called drones. There are 12,000 more on the ground. Last year, they carried out hundreds of strikes \xe2\x80\x94 both covert and overt \xe2\x80\x94 in six countries, transforming the way our democracy deliberates and engages in what we used to think of as war.'b'We don\xe2\x80\x99t have a draft anymore; less than 0.5 percent of Americans over 18 serve in the active-duty military. We do not declare war anymore; the last time Congress actually did so was in 1942 \xe2\x80\x94 against Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania. We don\xe2\x80\x99t buy war bonds or pay war taxes anymore. During World War II, 85 million Americans purchased war bonds that brought the government $185 billion; in the last decade, we bought none and instead gave the richest 5 percent of Americans a tax break.'b'And now we possess a technology that removes the last political barriers to war. The strongest appeal of unmanned systems is that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to send someone\xe2\x80\x99s son or daughter into harm\xe2\x80\x99s way. But when politicians can avoid the political consequences of the condolence letter \xe2\x80\x94 and the impact that military casualties have on voters and on the news media \xe2\x80\x94 they no longer treat the previously weighty matters of war and peace the same way.'b'For the first 200 years of American democracy, engaging in combat and bearing risk \xe2\x80\x94 both personal and political \xe2\x80\x94 went hand in hand. In the age of drones, that is no longer the case.'b'Today\xe2\x80\x99s unmanned systems are only the beginning. The original Predator, which went into service in 1995, lacked even GPS and was initially unarmed; newer models can take off and land on their own, and carry smart sensors that can detect a disruption in the dirt a mile below the plane and trace footprints back to an enemy hide-out.'b'There is not a single new manned combat aircraft under research and development at any major Western aerospace company, and the Air Force is training more operators of unmanned aerial systems than fighter and bomber pilots combined. In 2011, unmanned systems carried out strikes from Afghanistan to Yemen. The most notable of these continuing operations is the not-so-covert war in Pakistan, where the United States has carried out more than 300 drone strikes since 2004.'b'Yet this operation has never been debated in Congress; more than seven years after it began, there has not even been a single vote for or against it. This campaign is not carried out by the Air Force; it is being conducted by the C.I.A. This shift affects everything from the strategy that guides it to the individuals who oversee it (civilian political appointees) and the lawyers who advise them (civilians rather than military officers).'b'It also affects how we and our politicians view such operations. President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s decision to send a small, brave Navy Seal team into Pakistan for 40 minutes was described by one of his advisers as \xe2\x80\x9c'b'the gutsiest call of any president in recent history'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet few even talk about the decision to carry out more than 300 drone strikes in the very same country.'b'I do not condemn these strikes; I support most of them. What troubles me, though, is how a new technology is short-circuiting the decision-making process for what used to be the most important choice a democracy could make. Something that would have previously been viewed as a war is simply not being treated like a war.'b'THE change is not limited to covert action. Last spring, America launched airstrikes on Libya as part of a NATO operation to prevent Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s government from massacring civilians. In late March, the White House announced that the American military was handing over combat operations to its European partners and would thereafter play only a supporting role.'b'The distinction was crucial. The operation\xe2\x80\x99s goals quickly evolved from a limited humanitarian intervention into an air war supporting local insurgents\xe2\x80\x99 efforts at regime change. But it had limited public support and no Congressional approval.'b'When the administration was asked to explain why continuing military action would not be a violation of the War Powers Resolution \xe2\x80\x94 a Vietnam-era law that requires notifying Congress of military operations within 48 hours and getting its authorization after 60 days \xe2\x80\x94 the White House argued that American operations did not \xe2\x80\x9cinvolve the presence of U.S. ground troops, U.S. casualties or a serious threat thereof.\xe2\x80\x9d But they did involve something we used to think of as war: blowing up stuff, lots of it.'b''b'Starting on April 23'b', American unmanned systems were deployed over Libya. For the next six months, they carried out at least 146 strikes on their own. They also identified and pinpointed the targets for most of NATO\xe2\x80\x99s manned strike jets. This unmanned operation lasted well past the 60-day deadline of the War Powers Resolution, extending to the very last airstrike that hit Colonel Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s convoy on Oct. 20 and led to his death.'b'Choosing to make the operation unmanned proved critical to initiating it without Congressional authorization and continuing it with minimal public support. On June 21, when NATO\xe2\x80\x99s air war was lagging, an American Navy helicopter was shot down by pro-Qaddafi forces. This previously would have been a disaster, with the risk of an American aircrew being captured or even killed. But the downed helicopter was an unmanned Fire Scout, and the story didn\xe2\x80\x99t even make the newspapers the next day.'b'Congress has not disappeared from all decisions about war, just the ones that matter. The same week that American drones were carrying out their 145th unauthorized airstrike in Libya, the president notified Congress that he had deployed 100 Special Operations troops to a different part of Africa.'b'This small unit was sent to train and advise Ugandan forces battling the cultish Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Resistance Army and was explicitly ordered not to engage in combat. Congress applauded the president for notifying it about this small noncombat mission but did nothing about having its laws ignored in the much larger combat operation in Libya.'b'We must now accept that technologies that remove humans from the battlefield, from 'b'unmanned systems'b' like the Predator to cyberweapons like the Stuxnet computer worm, are becoming the new normal in war.'b'And like it or not, the new standard we\xe2\x80\x99ve established for them is that presidents need to seek approval only for operations that send people into harm\xe2\x80\x99s way \xe2\x80\x94 not for those that involve waging war by other means.'b'WITHOUT any actual political debate, we have set an enormous precedent, blurring the civilian and military roles in war and circumventing the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s mandate for authorizing it. Freeing the executive branch to act as it chooses may be appealing to some now, but many future scenarios will be less clear-cut. And each political party will very likely have a different view, depending on who is in the White House.'b'Unmanned operations are not \xe2\x80\x9ccostless,\xe2\x80\x9d as they are too often described in the news media and government deliberations. Even worthy actions can sometimes have unintended consequences. Faisal Shahzad, the would-be Times Square bomber, was drawn into terrorism by the very Predator strikes in Pakistan meant to stop terrorism.'b'Similarly, C.I.A. drone strikes outside of declared war zones are setting a troubling precedent that we might not want to see followed by the close to 50 other nations that now possess the same unmanned technology \xe2\x80\x94 including China, Russia, Pakistan and Iran.'b'A deep deliberation on war was something the framers of the Constitution sought to build into our system. Yet on Tuesday, when President Obama talks about his wartime accomplishments during the State of the Union address, Congress will have to admit that its role has been reduced to the same part it plays during the president\xe2\x80\x99s big speech. These days, when it comes to authorizing war, Congress generally sits there silently, except for the occasional clapping. And we do the same at home.'b'Last year, I met with senior Pentagon officials to discuss the many tough issues emerging from our growing use of robots in war. One of them asked, \xe2\x80\x9cSo, who then is thinking about all this stuff?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'America\xe2\x80\x99s founding fathers may not have been able to imagine robotic drones, but they did provide an answer. The Constitution did not leave war, no matter how it is waged, to the executive branch alone.'b'In a democracy, it is an issue for all of us.'b'Julia Heiman is the director of the 'b'Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction'b' at Indiana University, Bloomington.

I really didn\xe2\x80\x99t know much about Emilio Sanchez\xe2\x80\x99s work until his foundation donated a number of his drawings to the Kinsey Institute last year. He was an artist who was gay but was in the closet the whole time. His drawings are not overtly sexual but suggestive, and his paintings, which were more public, are more architectural and full of gorgeous light.'b'WHEN George Gershwin\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 arguably the most important piece of American music written in the 20th century \xe2\x80\x94 first opened on Broadway in 1935, the opera\xe2\x80\x99s libretto was littered with a word now shunned as an antiblack slur. The African-American residents of Catfish Row, the only slightly imaginary block in Charleston, S.C., where the opera is set, used it liberally, and so of course did the white characters during their occasional menacing visits.'b'None of the opera\xe2\x80\x99s early critics seemed to notice; whether black reviewer or white, they primarily critiqued \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess\xe2\x80\x9d as a theatrical experience, focusing in particular on the highly original way Gershwin fused blues tonalities, spirituals and other elements of African-American music into a full-length opera. It had never been done before. Some would say it\xe2\x80\x99s never been done since.'b'In the early 1940s, however, during a \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess\xe2\x80\x9d revival \xe2\x80\x94 which turned the opera into a more commercially viable musical, not unlike the current Broadway revival starring Audra McDonald \xe2\x80\x94 a singer named Etta Moten, hired to play Bess, refused to utter the word. Ira Gershwin, George\xe2\x80\x99s brother, who co-wrote the lyrics with DuBose Heyward, revised the line. By 1951, according to Howard Pollack, the author of \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge Gershwin: His Life and Work,\xe2\x80\x9d Ira Gershwin had \xe2\x80\x9ctotally eliminated the word from the text, replacing it with such terms as 'b'tin horns, dummy, low-life, suckers, buzzard,'b' and 'b'baby'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d That year, the producer Goddard Lieberson, who had just recorded \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess\xe2\x80\x9d for Columbia Records, said, \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes, happily, times change, and with the times, ethical values. It seemed proper to eliminate certain words in the lyrics which, in racial terms, had proven offensive.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess\xe2\x80\x9d has always struck me as something of a miracle. A powerful, empathetic portrayal of poor black city dwellers in the South, it was written by three white men, two of whom had spent little time in the South. The one Southerner, Heyward, was a Charleston insurance salesman turned poet who had written a novel, \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy,\xe2\x80\x9d the inspiration for which had come from a news story about a crippled beggar he used to see around town. Heyward spent years pushing Gershwin to collaborate on an opera; once Gershwin agreed, Heyward mailed him lyrics \xe2\x80\x94 the only ones he ever wrote in his life \xe2\x80\x94 that are some of the most sublime ever written. Stephen Sondheim described them as \xe2\x80\x9cthe most beautiful and powerful in our musical theater history.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess\xe2\x80\x9d was also Gershwin\xe2\x80\x99s first opera \xe2\x80\x94 and his last; he was dead within two years, killed by a brain tumor at the age of 38. \xe2\x80\x9cWho remembers Verdi\xe2\x80\x99s first opera?\xe2\x80\x9d says Steven Blier, the musical historian and co-founder of the New York Festival of Song. \xe2\x80\x9cYet Gershwin wrote something that ranks with Puccini in terms of crafting great melodies and great theater.\xe2\x80\x9d Its score contains an astonishing number of songs \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cSummertime,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt Ain\xe2\x80\x99t Necessarily So,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI Got Plenty o\xe2\x80\x99 Nothin\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and at least a half-dozen more \xe2\x80\x94 that are at the very heart of the American popular songbook. \xe2\x80\x9cSummertime\xe2\x80\x9d alone has been recorded more than 25,000 times.'b'But for much of its history, \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess\xe2\x80\x9d has also been something else: a reflection of race relations in America, and a prism through which African-Americans have viewed their own history.'b'When it first opened in the 1930s, the mere fact that it had been written was viewed as a triumph among most black writers and critics. For starters, instead of using white actors in blackface, which was still relatively common, Gershwin cast African-Americans in all the black roles. Though black opera singers were almost unheard of, Gershwin never even considered casting white singers. This alone was viewed as racial progress. For another thing, the music \xe2\x80\x94 African-American music \xe2\x80\x94 was not being used for a vaudeville show, but was employed in the highest of musical arts: opera. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter that the writer of that music was white \xe2\x80\x94 Gershwin even wrote his own spirituals for \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess.\xe2\x80\x9d What mattered was that he had captured something real. Gershwin, said Eva Jessye, who conducted the original \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess\xe2\x80\x9d chorus, \xe2\x80\x9chad written in things that sounded just right, like our people.\xe2\x80\x9d J. Rosamond Johnson, an important black composer, called \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca monument to the cultural aims of Negro art.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When that attitude began to change in the 1940s and 1950s, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just because the libretto contained 'b'that word.'b' The first stirrings of what would become the civil rights movement caused African-Americans to begin to look askance at the characters, to see them as white-inspired stereotypes, and to see the story itself \xe2\x80\x94 with its violence, drug use and subservience to white authority \xe2\x80\x94 as degrading. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a vehicle of shame, sorrow and disgust,\xe2\x80\x9d editorialized The Pittsburgh Courier, an African-American newspaper.'b'Which is not to say it stopped being performed. On the contrary, it was performed constantly. By the mid-1950s, a producer named Robert Breen, along with an associate, Ella Gerber, had largely taken control of \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Breen\xe2\x80\x99s original idea was to bring it to Europe, where he was sure it would be a hit; to that end he created a touring company, whose original cast members included Leontyne Price and Cab Calloway and which was backed by the State Department.'b'Now it was white as well as black Americans who feared the portrayals depicted in \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess,\xe2\x80\x9d especially when the State Department approved a series of performances in the Soviet Union at the height of the cold war. But they needn\xe2\x80\x99t have feared: Europe and the Soviet Union embraced the show in a way that Americans no longer did. Its portrayal of the hard life of African-Americans at the turn of the last century did not incite anti-American propaganda, as many Americans had worried.'b'By the 1960s, \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess\xe2\x80\x9d had become, at best, a mixed blessing for black singers. It was widely scorned among the African-American intelligentsia, who viewed it as an example of Uncle Tomism. And, if it provided steady work for black actors and singers, it was also a trap from which they rarely escaped. \xe2\x80\x9cYou could be ghettoized in \xe2\x80\x98Porgy and Bess,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d says John Miller, who manages opera singers. \xe2\x80\x9cIt became a stigma. Once you sang in it, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get cast in anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'By then, too, Ms. Gerber had taken over the production from Breen \xe2\x80\x94 indeed, the Gershwin estate would not allow a new production to go forward without her participation \xe2\x80\x94 and the production had become outdated, with touches of minstrel show that its cast members found humiliating. Ms. Gerber herself was often condescending toward African-Americans, and the cast bridled at her patronizing attitude. Singing in \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess\xe2\x80\x9d put food on the table, but it had become a distasteful experience.'b'A large part of the reason African-Americans began to embrace \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess\xe2\x80\x9d again in the mid-1970s was simply the passage of time. The life it depicted \xe2\x80\x94 in which black men called white men \xe2\x80\x9cboss\xe2\x80\x9d and white men called black men \xe2\x80\x9cboy\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94 began to recede as African-Americans asserted their rightful place in American society, as the black middle class began to grow, and as black accomplishment became an ordinary part of American life rather than something unique. With shows like \xe2\x80\x9cThe Jeffersons,\xe2\x80\x9d books by Toni Morrison and Alice Walker and plays by LeRoi Jones, the \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess\xe2\x80\x9d characters were part of a richer depiction of African-American life.'b'But a second reason was that \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess\xe2\x80\x9d itself changed. In 1976, as part of the country\xe2\x80\x99s bicentennial celebration, the Houston Grand Opera decide to mount a new production, one that would restore \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess\xe2\x80\x9d as a full-length opera, including music that Gershwin had originally cut to shorten the piece. The producer, Sherwin Goldman, met resistance from the Gershwin estate, and from Ira Gershwin himself. (\xe2\x80\x9cWhy tamper with it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Goldman.) Eventually, though, Goldman not only secured permission, but got the Gershwin family to agree to do it without the involvement of Ella Gerber.'b'The now-tattered reputation of \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess\xe2\x80\x9d made it difficult to find a cast. But in time, a group of young opera singers enlisted, including Donnie Ray Albert as Porgy and Clamma Dale as Bess, both of whom have gone on to have long, distinguished careers in opera. Once the singers were assembled, the young director, Jack O\xe2\x80\x99Brien, and the opera company\xe2\x80\x99s musical director, John DeMain, did something no white director had ever done before: they consulted with the cast on how \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess\xe2\x80\x9d should be played. \xe2\x80\x9cJack and John kept asking us, \xe2\x80\x98How do we feel about doing it this way?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Does this feel right to you?\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d recalls Mr. Albert. Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Brien soon came to see the chorus, which had been minimized in the Breen productions, as the key to \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe choral voices in \xe2\x80\x98Porgy and Bess\xe2\x80\x99 sing a greater percentage of the score than almost any other opera I can think of,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Brien told me. \xe2\x80\x9cThe chorus is the community. They look out for each other because nobody else is going to look out for them.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As the cast members rehearsed this new production, they gradually came to feel ownership of the opera, and with that came feelings of pride in the story they were telling and the songs they were singing. As opening night neared, Clamma Dale approached Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Brien with a request that once would have been unthinkable. At a key moment in the opera \xe2\x80\x94 when Bess is angrily trying to turn away from the cocaine being offered her by the drug dealer Sportin\xe2\x80\x99 Life \xe2\x80\x94 she wanted to restore the original language. After consulting with the cast and the producers, Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Brien agreed. If it is an exaggeration to say that this was the moment that \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess\xe2\x80\x9d was restored to its rightful place in the pantheon of American art, it\xe2\x80\x99s not much of one.'b'After its 1976 run in Houston, the opera played in Washington, on its way to New York. Todd Duncan, Gershwin\xe2\x80\x99s original Porgy, saw it there. Forty years earlier, Mr. Duncan had refused to sing \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess\xe2\x80\x9d in Washington unless the theater where it was being performed was desegregated. (It was, but only temporarily.) When he went backstage to shake the latest Porgy\xe2\x80\x99s hand, he could only marvel at what he had seen. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so black!\xe2\x80\x9d he told Mr. Albert.'b'Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Brien says that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think of \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess\xe2\x80\x9d as African-American music. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s American music,\xe2\x80\x9d he said \xe2\x80\x94 and really, who can disagree? The blues and spirituals that make up the core of \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess,\xe2\x80\x9d written by a white Jewish composer and originating in the African-American community, is music we all embrace. It is part of America\xe2\x80\x99s heritage and a source of American pride. It is unlikely that will ever change, for which we should be thankful.'b'I can\xe2\x80\x99t say I like the current Broadway production; to my mind, \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess\xe2\x80\x9d loses much of its emotional power when it is turned into a musical and stripped of its operatic qualities. The chorus is bare-bones, and the efforts by the current producers to make this version as racially inoffensive as possible seem misguided, given its history.'b'Still, at the matinee performance I saw recently, I sat near several African-American women who were enjoying it immensely. At the intermission, we got to talking and I asked them if they remembered when \xe2\x80\x9cPorgy and Bess\xe2\x80\x9d was viewed as Uncle Tomism.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman sitting in front of me. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was my era. I was part of that.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s different now? I asked.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEverything,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'Last month, the Obama administration issued important 'b'guidance'b' to colleges and universities on how to increase racial diversity on campuses, explaining ways to navigate the narrow legal channel charted by the Supreme Court. The benefits of diversity, the Department of Education said, contribute to \xe2\x80\x9cthe educational, economic and civic life of this nation.\xe2\x80\x9d The administration\xe2\x80\x99s support for such efforts stands in stark contrast to the policy of the George W. Bush administration to 'b'discourage'b' them. That difference has played out between the political parties for decades, as it will in this presidential election.'b'Race-conscious programs in education \xe2\x80\x94 affirmative action in college admissions and voluntary integration of public schools \xe2\x80\x94 have been embattled for more than 40 years. Since the 1970s, the Supreme Court has restricted the approaches available to remedy racial disparities, but has left room for institutions to consider race in achieving certain broader aims.'b'The war has not ended, however, and three notable lawsuits around the country show the continuing controversy. In March, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit will reconsider Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s ban on affirmative action in public university admissions, which a three-judge panel of the court 'b'struck down'b' last summer. By prohibiting race-conscious admissions under the Michigan Constitution, the court said, the ban \xe2\x80\x9creorders the political process in Michigan to place special burdens on minority interests.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the Fifth Circuit, a three-judge panel a year ago 'b'upheld'b' the use of race as a factor in admissions at the University of Texas at Austin. Four-fifths of students there are admitted as graduates in the top 10 percent of their high school classes. But one-fifth are admitted based on individual assessments, including race as a factor, and this program is being challenged. The university is waiting to hear whether the Supreme Court will review that decision.'b'In the Ninth Circuit next month, a three-judge panel will hear an appeal from a district court decision to dismiss a challenge to California\xe2\x80\x99s Proposition 209, which outlawed race-conscious admissions in 1996.'b'Any or all of these cases could end up before the Supreme Court, on which four conservatives have made clear that they would make illegal even narrowly tailored diversity programs. Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. spoke for himself and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito Jr. in 2007 when he 'b'wrote'b' in an opinion, \xe2\x80\x9cThe way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Justice Anthony Kennedy, while no fan of affirmative action, has in past decisions supported some use of race in certain situations. The question is whether he will move further to the right and reject those uses as well.'b'Leaders of universities, corporations and other institutions fear that the conservative majority will overrule 'b'Grutter v. Bollinger'b', the 2003 case that upheld the right of a public law school to consider race in admissions to achieve the benefits of a diverse student body. In endorsing that educational need, Justice Sandra Day O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, writing for the court\xe2\x80\x99s majority, noted that perhaps in 25 years race-conscious policies would no longer be needed.'b'This country is still very far from that goal. The push by Republican politicians and conservative justices to eliminate efforts to ensure diversity on campuses are squarely at odds with America\xe2\x80\x99s racial history. With the court\xe2\x80\x99s makeup likely to change in the next four years, the presidential election could determine how long such crucial efforts will last.'b'The Tucson Unified School District has dismantled its Mexican-American studies program, packed away its offending books, shuttled its students into other classes. It was blackmailed into doing so: keeping the program would have meant losing more than $14 million in state funding. It was a blunt-force victory for the Arizona school superintendent, John Huppenthal, who has spent years crusading against ethnic-studies programs he claims are \xe2\x80\x9cbrainwashing\xe2\x80\x9d children into thinking that Latinos have been victims of white oppression.'b'As a state legislator, he co-wrote a law cracking down on ethnic studies, and as superintendent he decided that Tucson\xe2\x80\x99s district was violating it. School officials in Tucson and elsewhere strenuously disagree, saying he misunderstood and mischaracterized a program that brought much-needed attention to a neglected part of America\xe2\x80\x99s history and culture. They say it engaged students, pushed them to excel, and led to better grades and attendance.'b'But their interpretation collided with that of Mr. Huppenthal, whose law prohibits programs that \xe2\x80\x9cpromote the overthrow of the United States government,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpromote resentment toward a race or class of people\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cadvocate ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d Unless two students win a federal lawsuit arguing that the loss of the program violates their First Amendment rights, Tucson school officials and students are going to have to enrich their curriculum another way.'b'To say that Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s Anglo and Hispanic populations have had multiple points of collision and misunderstanding is putting it mildly. Arizona (the state that also showed some of the most bitter resistance to a federal Martin Luther King holiday) enacted the first in a recent spate of extremist immigration laws and spawned the Minuteman border-vigilante movement.'b'If Mr. Huppenthal wanted to diminish resentment and treat Hispanic students as individuals, he picked a lousy way to do it. His action has Hispanic critics saying they feel their culture is under attack \xe2\x80\x94 and has students in a well-established, well-liked program feeling dejected.'b'For Tucson school officials, this should not mean the end of teaching texts like \xe2\x80\x9cThe Pedagogy of the Oppressed\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cRethinking Columbus.\xe2\x80\x9d It is a challenge to draft a new curriculum whose honesty and excellence all of Tucson\xe2\x80\x99s teachers and students can be proud of.'b'The soothing words of Hungary\xe2\x80\x99s prime minister, Viktor Orban, do little to counter his government\xe2\x80\x99s assaults on the independence of Hungary\xe2\x80\x99s press, judiciary and central bank. Without strong European pressure, Mr. Orban is unlikely to change the new banking, judiciary and media laws.'b'Mr. Orban\xe2\x80\x99s conciliatory tone in an appearance before the European Parliament last week came a day after the European Commission announced it would take Hungary before the European Court of Justice, if necessary, to overturn the laws. Hungary now acknowledges that it needs financial help from Brussels and the International Monetary Fund, which it cannot expect to get without some concessions.'b'Mr. Orban said he would be able \xe2\x80\x9cto rapidly solve\xe2\x80\x9d the issues that the European Union has raised. And in a radio interview on Friday, he said he would drop a controversial plan to merge the central bank with the financial markets regulator, but without providing details. Mr. Orban\xe2\x80\x99s tepid assurances are not enough. He must fully restore the independence of the central bank and the judiciary and stop punishing his media critics.'b'The new Hungarian laws violate European Union rules enshrining institutional checks and balances and individual freedoms. One law permits the government to expand the constitutional court and pack it with political appointees. Another allows the prime minister to appoint key central bank officials. Still another reduces the independence of the country\xe2\x80\x99s data-protection agency.'b'These laws are part of an alarming pattern of efforts to undermine democratic principles. A press law that went into effect last year has been used to intimidate critics of the government. A new electoral law seems designed to favor the ruling party and its allies. A constitution that took effect this month will make it hard for any future government to change the economic and social policies put in place by Mr. Orban\xe2\x80\x99s current majority. Unless Europe compels Mr. Orban to change course, Hungary could become the first former Soviet satellite to lose its hard-won democracy.'b'Unimpressed by Mr. Orban\xe2\x80\x99s facile promises, the majority parties in the European Parliament now want governmental leaders to consider invoking a clause of the E.U. treaty that would strip Hungary of some voting rights if Mr. Orban continued to flout European law. Europe\xe2\x80\x99s powers to nudge Hungary back from authoritarianism are limited. But to its credit, it has begun wielding them.'b'Four lawmakers have been referred to the House Ethics Committee for receiving special mortgage loans from the notorious \xe2\x80\x9cV.I.P.\xe2\x80\x9d program of Countrywide Financial. Ethics rules require members to accept loans only \xe2\x80\x9con terms generally available to the public.\xe2\x80\x9d It should be of great interest for the public, particularly those mired in mortgage trouble, to see if anything comes out of the Congressional investigation.'b'The loans were uncovered in a three-year-long inquiry by Representative Darrell Issa, the Republican chairman of the House oversight committee. He denounced Countrywide\xe2\x80\x99s program as a source of \xe2\x80\x9cbribery\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpublic corruption\xe2\x80\x9d when Democrats seemed to be the beneficiaries of the mortgage company\xe2\x80\x99s largess. Now that three of the four House members referred to the ethics committee are Republicans, Democrats are urging Mr. Issa to keep up the good work.'b'The lawmakers have been identified in news reports as Howard McKeon and Elton Gallegly, both Republicans of California; Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas and the party\xe2\x80\x99s Congressional campaign chairman; and Edolphus Towns, Democrat of New York. All have denied seeking or knowing about the \xe2\x80\x9cFriends of Angelo\xe2\x80\x9d program set up by Angelo Mozilo, former head of Countrywide.'b'Mr. Issa is vowing to press forward with his investigation of the loans, wherever it leads, his office insisted. The public should hope for similar dedication from the Ethics Committee.'b'IF you want to understand how great teachers transform lives, listen to the story of Olly Neal.'b''b'A recent study'b' showed how a great elementary schoolteacher can raise the lifetime earnings of a single class by $700,000. After 'b'I wrote about the study'b', skeptics of school reform wrote me to say: sure, a great teacher can make a difference in the right setting, but not with troubled, surly kids in a high-poverty environment. If you think that, or if you scoff at the statistics, 'b'then listen to Neal'b'.'b'In the late 1950s, Olly Neal was a poor black kid with an attitude. He was one of 13 brothers and sisters in a house with no electricity, and his father was a farmer with a second-grade education. Neal attended a small school for black children \xe2\x80\x94 this was in the segregated South \xe2\x80\x94 and was always mouthing off. He remembers reducing his English teacher, Mildred Grady, to tears.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was not a nice kid,\xe2\x80\x9d he recalls. \xe2\x80\x9cI had a reputation. I was the only one who made her cry.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Neal adds: \xe2\x80\x9cShe would have had good reason to say, \xe2\x80\x98this boy is incorrigible.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'b'A regular shoplifter back then, Neal was caught stealing from the store where he worked part time. He seemed headed for a life in trouble.'b'Carolyn F. Blakely, then a new teacher at the school (who retired last year as the dean of the Honors College 'b'that now bears her name'b' at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff), remembers Neal as an at-risk kid prone to challenge authority. At the time, even teachers in the school called students \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cMiss,\xe2\x80\x9d but Neal disrupted class by addressing her impertinently as \xe2\x80\x9cCarolyn.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To deal with kids like him, Blakely told me, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d go home and stand in front of the mirror and practice being mean.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'One day in 1957, in the fall of his senior year, Neal cut Blakely\xe2\x80\x99s class and wandered in the library, set up by Grady, the English teacher whom he had tormented. Neal wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a reader, but he spotted a book with a risqu\xc3\xa9 cover of a sexy woman.'b'Called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Treasure of Pleasant Valley,\xe2\x80\x9d it was by 'b'Frank Yerby'b', a black author, and it looked appealing. Neal says he thought of checking it out, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want word to get out to any of his classmates that he was reading a novel. That would have been humiliating.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo I stole it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Neal tucked the book under his jacket and took it home \xe2\x80\x94 and loved it. After finishing the book, he sneaked it back into the library. And there, on the shelf, he noticed another novel by Yerby. He stole that one as well.'b'This book was also terrific. And, to Neal\xe2\x80\x99s surprise, when he returned it to the shelf after finishing it, he found yet another by Yerby.'b'Four times this happened, and he caught the book bug. \xe2\x80\x9cReading got to be a thing I liked,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. His trajectory changed, and he later graduated to harder novels, including those by Albert Camus, and he turned to newspapers and magazines as well. He went to college and later to law school.'b'In 1991, Neal was appointed the first black district prosecuting attorney in Arkansas. A few years later, he became a judge, and then an appellate court judge.'b'But there\xe2\x80\x99s more.'b'At a high school reunion, Grady stunned Neal by confiding to him that she had spotted him stealing that first book. Her impulse was to confront him, but then, in a flash of understanding, she realized his embarrassment at being seen checking out a book.'b'So Grady kept quiet. The next Saturday, she told him, she drove 70 miles to Memphis to search the bookshops for another novel by Yerby. Finally, she found one, bought it and put it on the library bookshelf.'b'Twice more, Grady told Neal, she spent her Saturdays trekking to Memphis to buy books by Yerby \xe2\x80\x94 all in hopes of turning around a rude adolescent who had made her cry. She paid for the books out of her own pocket.'b'How can one measure Grady\xe2\x80\x99s impact? Not only in Neal, but in the lives of those around him. His daughter, 'b'Karama'b', earned a doctorate in genetics, taught bioethics at Emory University, and now runs a community development program in Arkansas.'b'The big-hearted Grady, now dead, is a reminder that teachers may have the most important job in America. By all accounts, Grady transformed many other children as well, through more mundane methods.'b'To me, the lesson is that while there are no silver bullets to chip away at poverty or improve national competitiveness, improving the ranks of teachers is part of the answer. That\xe2\x80\x99s especially true for needy kids, who often get the weakest teachers. That should be the civil rights scandal of our time.'b'The implication is that we need rigorous teacher evaluations, more pay for good teachers and more training and weeding-out of poor teachers. The need for more pay is simple. In the 1950s, outstanding women like Grady didn\xe2\x80\x99t have many alternatives, and they became teachers. Grady was black, so she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have many options other than teaching black children in a segregated school.'b'Today, women like Grady often become doctors, lawyers or bankers \xe2\x80\x94 professions with far higher salaries. If we want to recruit and retain the best teachers, we simply have to pay more \xe2\x80\x94 while also more aggressively thinning out those who don\xe2\x80\x99t succeed. It\xe2\x80\x99s worth it.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere are some kids who can\xe2\x80\x99t be reached,\xe2\x80\x9d Neal acknowledges. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there are some that you can reach every now and then.\xe2\x80\x9d As his life attests.'b'THERE are 300 million people in the United States of America. There are millions of political activists, volunteers, organizers and would-be officeholders. There are hundreds of thousands of elected officials. Yet somehow, out of all this multitude, the Republican Party has been unable to find a candidate for the White House in 2012 who inspires anything but weary resignation from its voters.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable is how often this seems to happen. As weak as this year\xe2\x80\x99s Republican field has proved, it\xe2\x80\x99s not that much weaker than a number of recent presidential vintages, from the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 lineups in 1988 and 2004 to the Republican field in 1996. In presidential politics, the great talents (a Clinton, a Reagan) seem to be the exception; a march of Dole-Dukakis-Mondale mediocrity is closer to the rule.'b'The problem, perhaps, is that a successful presidential campaign calls on a trio of talents that only rarely overlap. Being a master politician in a mass democracy, in this sense, is a bit like being a brilliant filmmaker who\xe2\x80\x99s somehow also a great economist, or a Nobel-winning scientist who writes best-selling novels on the side.'b'First, a great politician needs the gift of management. A would-be president has to be the C.E.O. of his or her campaign, with a flair for fund-raising, an eye for talent, and a keen sense of when to micromanage and when to delegate. This is the arm-twisting, organization-building, endorsement-corralling side of presidential politics, and not surprisingly it tends to favor insiders and deal-makers and old Washington hands.'b'But successful insiders and deal-makers are rarely comfortable with the more public, rhetorical, self-advertising side of politics. The great manager is unlikely to be a great persuader, capable of seducing undecided voters with his empathy, or inspiring them with what George H. W. Bush (who lacked it) called \xe2\x80\x9cthe vision thing.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s also unlikely to be a great demagogue, capable of demonizing his enemies and convincing his supporters that they stand at Armageddon and battle for the Lord. The manager can play these roles, but there will always be a hint of irony, a touch of phoniness, a sense that he\xe2\x80\x99d much rather get back to the inside game.'b'Nor do the gifts of persuasion necessarily overlap with the gifts of demagoguery. Quite the reverse: The politician who\xe2\x80\x99s good at reaching out to the unconverted is usually mistrusted by his own base, and the politician whose us-versus-them rhetoric inspires devotion among ideologues rarely finds it easy to pivot to a more transcendent, unifying style. If Jon Huntsman had a little more Sarah Palin in him, for instance, or Palin a bit more Huntsman, one of them might have been the 2012 Republican nominee. But their respective gifts are rarely shared in a single personality.'b'When a politician somehow hits the manager-persuader-demagogue trifecta, he can seem unstoppable. (See Roosevelt, Franklin, and his four terms in office.) But just going two for three is usually enough to create an immensely formidable candidate.'b'Both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, for instance, were great persuaders and great demagogues \xe2\x80\x94 they could woo with high-minded appeals one moment and twist the partisan knife the next \xe2\x80\x94 and that combination more than compensated for their weaknesses as managers. Dwight Eisenhower wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much of a demagogue, but he excelled at playing the unifier in public and at organizational hardball behind closed doors. Richard Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s appeal to voters\xe2\x80\x99 better angels always felt forced, but he could out-organize and out-demonize just about anyone \xe2\x80\x94 at least until his paranoia infected his management style, and undid everything he\xe2\x80\x99d built.'b'The losers of our presidential history, on the other hand, usually have only one gift out of three. They\xe2\x80\x99re good managers, more often than not, whose organizations outlast demagogues and persuaders in the primaries but who can neither rally the base nor inspire the center in the general election. Thus Walter Mondale, victorious over Jesse Jackson and Gary Hart but crushed by Reagan; thus Bob Dole and Michael Dukakis; thus John Kerry in 2004.'b'This is the path that Mitt Romney, managerial to his core, seems to be treading in 2012. The question is what kind of opponent he\xe2\x80\x99ll find waiting in November. In 2008, Barack Obama seemed to have almost F.D.R.-like gifts: He out-managed, out-inspired and out-demagogued both Hillary Clinton and John McCain.'b'But the presidency, unexpectedly, has exposed his limits as a communicator. Now when Obama demonizes, it seems clumsy; when he tries to persuade, it falls on deaf ears. Unlike Reagan and Clinton, the two masters, he seems unable to either bully or inspire.'b'What Obama has left, though, is the same capable, even ruthless organization that helped him over the top last time around. Maybe he\xe2\x80\x99ll rediscover the old 2008 magic as well.

My suspicion is that this whole critique has to do with the fact that I don\xe2\x80\x99t go to a lot of Washington parties. And as a consequence, the Washington press corps maybe just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m in the mix enough with them, and they figure, well, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not spending time with them, I must be cold and aloof.

Newt\xe2\x80\x99s gambit was a calculated way of deflecting attention from a charge by his second wife, Marianne, that the family values he preaches are hypocritical platitudes, given his cheating ways with two wives he divorced when they were ill.'b'Could 2012, remarkably, be a race between two powerful victims yearning to be lonely at the top?'b'A Washington Post-ABC News poll released on Friday found that two-thirds of Americans would consider voting for a third-party presidential candidate, while 48 percent definitely wanted a third party in the race. Now what does that tell you? It tells you that with the campaign about to go into full swing, as the president delivers his State of the Union address next week, voters are still casting about for a leader with a winning message. I can save both parties a lot of money. I am one of those voters, and I can tell you exactly for whom I want to vote \xe2\x80\x94 and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m alone.'b'I want to vote for a candidate who advocates an immediate investment in infrastructure that will create jobs and upgrade America for the 21st century \xe2\x80\x94 ultrafast bandwidth, highways, airports, public schools, mass transit \xe2\x80\x94 and combines that with a long-term plan to fix our fiscal imbalances at the real scale of the problem, a plan that could be phased in as the economy recovers.'b'On the latter point, I am talking about the Bowles-Simpson bipartisan deficit reduction plan \xe2\x80\x94 or something equally serious and with a chance of bipartisan support. President Obama has proposed smart infrastructure investments, but he has not paired them with a credible long-term deficit-reduction plan, and the only chance of passage in Congress is to have both. Mitt Romney is not even close.'b'Christina Romer, the former chairwoman of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Council of Economic Advisers, put it best when she told this newspaper on Dec. 31 that the U.S. \xe2\x80\x9cfaces two daunting economic problems: an unsustainable long-run budget deficit and persistent high unemployment. ... Over the next 20 to 30 years, rising health care costs and the retirement of the baby boomers are projected to cause deficits that make the current one look puny. At the rate we\xe2\x80\x99re going, the United States would almost surely default on its debt one day. ... We already have a blueprint for a bipartisan solution. The Bowles-Simpson commission hashed out a sensible plan of spending cuts, entitlement program reforms and revenue increases that would shave $4 trillion off the deficit over the next decade. It shares the pain of needed deficit reduction, while protecting the most vulnerable and maintaining investments in our future productivity. \xc2\xa0'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut we can\xe2\x80\x99t focus on the deficit alone,\xe2\x80\x9d added Romer. \xe2\x80\x9cPersistent unemployment is destroying the lives and wasting the talents of more than 13 million Americans. Pairing additional strong stimulus with a plan to reduce the deficit would likely pack a particularly powerful punch for confidence and spending.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Second, I want to vote for a candidate who is committed to reforming taxes, and cutting spending, in a fair way. The rich must pay more, but everyone has to pay something. We are all in this together.'b'Third, I want to vote for a candidate who has an inspirational vision, not just a plan to balance the budget. People will sacrifice to make this country great again if they think you have a real plan for American success in the 21st century. And that plan is obvious. We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be about launching one big moon shot anymore. We need to be building a country where everyone in the world wants to come to launch their own moon shot \xe2\x80\x94 their own company, their own start-up \xe2\x80\x94 because we have the best immigration policies, regulations, schools and incentives. We can\xe2\x80\x99t tax or cut our way to prosperity and jobs. We have to invent our way there. We need both more \xe2\x80\x9cMade in America\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cImagined in America.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Finally, I want to vote for a candidate who supports a minimum floor of public financing of presidential, Senate and House campaigns. Money in politics is out of control today. Our Congress has become a forum for legalized bribery. Americans are losing faith in the instruments of government because they think the game is rigged by big money \xe2\x80\x94 and they\xe2\x80\x99re right.'b'Any candidate with that four-part agenda would win \xe2\x80\x94 and so would the country, because he would win 'b'with a mandate'b' to do what needs doing.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe people are so far ahead of the politicians,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg. His polling, he adds, shows that many Americans today \xe2\x80\x9cthink that China, Germany and Brazil have strategies for success, and that we don\xe2\x80\x99t. But they are looking for that. They are looking for a leader who will be really bold.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'People have been misled by months of crazy G.O.P. debates that make the country look so much more divided, small-minded and unwilling to sacrifice to fix our problems than it actually is.\xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99d bet anything that the first candidate who steps out of the cartoonish politics of destruction \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cRomney is just a capitalist vulture. Obama is a Kenyan socialist\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and shocks the public by going radically responsible, radically honest, radically demanding and radically aspirational, along the lines above, will be our next president.'b'I hope it is Obama, because I agree with him on so many other issues. But if it\xe2\x80\x99s Romney, he\xe2\x80\x99d deserve to win. And, if by some miracle, both run that campaign, and the 2012 contest is about two such competing visions, then put every dollar you own in the U.S. stock market. It will go up a gazillion points.'b'Why does an appendectomy in Germany cost roughly a quarter what it costs in the United States? Or an M.R.I. scan cost less than a third as much, on average, in Canada?'b'Americans continue to spend more on health care than patients anywhere else. In 2009, we spent $7,960 per person, twice as much as France, which is known for providing very good health services. And for all that spending, we get very mixed results \xe2\x80\x94 some superb, some average, some inferior \xe2\x80\x94 compared with other advanced nations. Why this is true isn\xe2\x80\x99t easily answered.'b'Health reform is supposed to control costs, but there is no simple avenue of attack. Our aging population has played a role in driving up medical costs, but Germany, Italy and Japan have much bigger percentages of elderly people while spending much less per capita on health care.'b'The spread of health insurance, which shields patients from price sensitivity, has played a role in driving up our spending. But almost all other advanced industrial nations cover virtually everyone, while we leave 50 million uninsured.'b'Administrative costs are high here \xe2\x80\x94 no surprise given the hordes of clerks and accountants needed to deal with insurance paperwork. And technological advances, which are sometimes highly beneficial and sometimes not, often cost a lot more than standard treatments. (Surprisingly, American doctors lag far behind their counterparts abroad in using electronic health records, which can help avoid costly errors and duplications.) Insurance companies\xe2\x80\x99 profits and the high pay of their executives may account for some of the cost differences with other countries, but there is little good data on this.'b'A recent 'b'report'b' from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a 34-member group that includes the most advanced industrial nations, concluded that spending is high here partly because the prices charged by American doctors and hospitals are higher than they are anywhere else.'b'The International Federation of Health Plans, in its 2010 comparative price 'b'report'b', documented just how large the price differential can be for a wide range of services. While it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to get data that is truly comparable from one country to another, the trends show Americans paying a lot more than people in other countries for the same services.'b'Measuring how effectively we spend health care dollars is hugely complicated. But cross-national surveys offer some clues. We\xe2\x80\x99re good at giving patients what they want \xe2\x80\x94 if they ask for it. So Americans can see a specialist or get elective surgery a lot faster than patients in other countries, according to surveys by the Commonwealth Fund. The surveys also show that Americans are more likely than people in other advanced nations to experience medical errors or problems with uncoordinated care, and to forgo care because it\xe2\x80\x99s too expensive.'b'The O.E.C.D. report rates America at or near the top for survival rates in breast and colorectal cancer but slightly below average in cervical cancer. We rank in the middle of the pack in the percentage of heart attack patients who die in the hospital within 30 days of admission. And we have alarmingly high rates of hospital admissions for asthma and uncontrolled diabetes \xe2\x80\x94 an indicator that many patients don\xe2\x80\x99t have good primary care, which can prevent costly hospital stays.'b'Most other advanced countries hold down prices through government regulations. We set prices in Medicare and Medicaid programs. But in private markets, reform has to rely on other means, such as financial incentives for providers to curb costs by coordinating care and improving efficiency. One demonstration program significantly reduced spending by bundling payments to hospitals and doctors to cover all in-patient services connected with heart bypass surgeries.'b'The idea at the heart of the reform law is that such strategies, once proved effective, could be carried out on a large scale \xe2\x80\x94 and eventually bring total spending under control.'b'Los Angeles'b'THE United States has been out of the 'b'space shuttle'b' business for a few months now, but the country is still seriously considering spending billions of dollars to send astronauts back to the 'b'moon'b', to Mars or to a nearby asteroid.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s heartening that the pioneering spirit behind crewed missions into outer space has not been dampened by the nation\xe2\x80\x99s tide of red ink. But with price tags like $50 billion to return astronauts to the moon in the next decade, there\xe2\x80\x99s a strong bang-for-the-buck argument to be made for far less expensive missions headed in the other direction: down into the ocean depths, which remain largely unexplored and unseen by human eyes.'b'The nation\xe2\x80\x99s limited experience with undersea missions has nonetheless shown the great potential for scientific and technological advances and valuable spinoffs that come when public investments are made in bold exploratory ventures.'b'In 1969, an accidental death helped sink the 'b'United States Navy'b'\xe2\x80\x99s Sealab program. A diver\xe2\x80\x99s breathing gear apparently malfunctioned in the dark cold just outside the lab, an astounding 610 feet below the surface. It was a sobering reminder of the inherent risks of making prolonged deep dives. The risks include not only the bends \xe2\x80\x94 the painful and potentially lethal consequence of surfacing too rapidly \xe2\x80\x94 but also breathing exotic gas mixtures (ordinary air becomes toxic beyond certain depths and pressures) and exposure to the frigid temperatures of the deep sea. Conditions underwater can be every bit as hostile as in space.'b'Sealab had been showing the way toward establishing outposts on the ocean floor, albeit in the shadow of 'b'NASA'b'\xe2\x80\x99s space program. The Navy program achieved major breakthroughs that made it possible, for the first time, to house free-swimming divers on the seabed, and at far greater depths than ever thought possible.'b'Unlike conventional divers, who are limited to brief forays from the surface, these aquanauts \xe2\x80\x94 as sea-dwelling divers have been called \xe2\x80\x94 could not only reach greater depths, but they could also stay down for an indefinite period, spending hours at a time in the water instead of minutes, provided they had a pressurized, climate-controlled shelter nearby. The advent of the aquanaut meant that a vast and varied submerged frontier was open to human exploration.'b'While the Navy had an interest in science and exploration, it was mainly concerned with what aquanauts could do for the military, like recovering sunken aircraft, ships or downed submarines.'b'One of the beneficiaries of the Sealab program was the offshore 'b'oil industry'b'. The revolutionary diving methods devised for Sealab emerged just as the industry was moving into deeper waters and needed an expanded underwater work force that could handle both increased depths and longer durations. The industry customized and streamlined its approach so that commercial divers could put in full-day shifts on the seabed without actually having to live down there.'b'The Navy ultimately gave up on Sealab and sea bases, largely because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t suit its military priorities. The program was shelved after the accident in February 1969, a few months shy of the first moon landing. But the Navy continued to use its newfangled diving methods in other operations \xe2\x80\x94 like top-secret missions to spy on the former Soviet Union. This involved housing deep-diving aquanauts on submarines rather than in a stationary base like Sealab.'b'Several dozen science-oriented underwater shelters came and went around the globe, including a few made in the United States. Most were productive but relatively low-budget affairs, as is the United States\xe2\x80\x99 only remaining sea base, which is also the world\xe2\x80\x99s only such base. It\xe2\x80\x99s an otherworldly looking structure called 'b'Aquarius'b', about the size of a city bus, which is owned by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and run by the University of North Carolina, Wilmington. It gets by on less than $3 million a year, compared to, say, the cost of a single shuttle mission, which NASA has estimated to be $450 million (other estimates have been considerably higher). The entire Sealab program cost taxpayers about $20 million; close to $20 billion was spent during the same period to reach the moon.'b'SINCE the early 1990s, Aquarius has been stationed on a coral reef a few miles south of Key Largo, Fla., in water about 60 feet deep. There, it has carried on the legacy of Sealab by serving as a valuable undersea vantage point for scientists. Dozens of scientist-aquanauts have published 300 research papers over the course of about 120 missions, ranging in duration from a few days to a couple of weeks. Examples of the work made possible by these underwater stays include ocean acidification studies and examinations of how herbivore diversity may be manipulated to conserve and restore degrading reefs \xe2\x80\x94 knowledge critical to life on earth.'b'Archaeologists would benefit greatly by having an underwater base of operations. So might commercial interests in search of mineral deposits. And as in space, one line of inquiry may open the door to another.'b'Remotely operated probes, robots, sensors and vehicles, known as R.O.V.\xe2\x80\x99s, also have their place in ocean research, much as they do in space. Such machines can be more cost effective, reach greater depths and keep human beings out of harm\xe2\x80\x99s way. The government\xe2\x80\x99s own 'b'Okeanos Explorer'b', a converted naval surveillance ship, is making impressive use of R.O.V.\xe2\x80\x99s and other devices to churn up reams of data about the seafloor while engaging many scientists in its process of discovery. But sometimes there\xe2\x80\x99s just no substitute for the presence of a sentient human, perhaps no more so than in the dynamic, living realm of \xe2\x80\x9cthe silent world,\xe2\x80\x9d as Jacques Cousteau famously called the sea. Marine scientists who have experienced the aquatic life will tell you: there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like living in the sea to gain a better understanding of it, for much the same reason that Jane Goodall lived in the jungle.'b'Besides accomplishing their intended goals, scientists are able to see and experience the unexpected, at any time of day or night, and new revelations await \xe2\x80\x94 like the discovery of a marine plant or animal that could produce the next wonder drug. In the meantime, getting better acquainted with our home planet, at prices we can afford, is reason enough to continue paying for Aquarius, expand its capability and replicate it elsewhere in the silent world.'b'AS election season rhetoric heats up, so does the demand for aggressive examination of candidates\xe2\x80\x99 claims.'b'This is not new. The \xe2\x80\x9cfact-checking\xe2\x80\x9d movement, shorthand for news organizations\xe2\x80\x99 rebuttal of factual claims, has been building for years.

The current movement has its roots in the late 1980s, a response to aggressive advertising like the Willie Horton ads aimed at Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee in 1988, according to 'b'Bill Adair,'b' editor of PolitiFact.'b'He traces the most recent approach, involving dedicated fact-checking units, to 2003, when 'b'FactCheck.org'b' was created by the 'b'Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.'b''b'The progression, he and others say, stems from a dynamic that is changing the news business. When there were fewer media outlets, Mr. Adair said, journalists acted as gatekeepers to filter some false claims.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf the media heard a cockamamie story, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pass it along without evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow those stories can get passed along in so many ways \xe2\x80\x94 whether it is cable, talk radio, chain e-mails. There are a million different sources. There is no filter.

Often derided as the \xe2\x80\x9che said, she said\xe2\x80\x9d approach, this method entails finding and quoting someone to counter a claim, thereby offering a form of balance but no resolution.

If you are in Iowa covering a speech and you are filing for the Web in 10 minutes, you are not going to have the time or the resources a serious charge will require.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Rieder, though, believes The Times should come back as quickly as possible to rebut false claims that were in a news article, and make sure that rebuttals stay in coverage going forward.'b'I join others who worry that The Times needs to be very careful with this. 'b'Jill Abramson,'b' the executive editor, said that if fact-checking were made a \xe2\x80\x9creflexive element of too many news stories, our readers would find The Times was being tendentious.\xe2\x80\x9d Readers, she added, could come to see The Times \xe2\x80\x9cas a combatant, not as an arbiter of what the facts were.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ubiquitous argument in straight news articles is not the way to go. Checking facts in politics \xe2\x80\x94 and in other subjects \xe2\x80\x94 takes time, resources and great care. Editors and reporters need to identify priorities and exercise judgment: they cannot do everything.'b'For these reasons, I think The Times should broaden the \xe2\x80\x9cFact Check\xe2\x80\x9d sidebars to include issues that arise outside of the debate forum. Regular installments of fact-checking journalism, identified as such, would strengthen the paper\xe2\x80\x99s approach. Links from fact-check items back to the original articles online would help readers connect the dots.'b'I favor rebutting assertions in some routine news articles. But The Times needs to be disciplined about it. The paper\xe2\x80\x99s straight news function remains its most valuable asset, which would be undermined if argument replaced fact-gathering.'b'IN France I live near a little village called Sadillac. It\xe2\x80\x99s no more than a cluster of houses, an old chateau, a church and a graveyard surrounded by a few farms and vineyards. The village probably hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed much since the French Revolution; its population hovers around 100. By the graveyard is a simple obelisk with the names of the 30 or so young men from Sadillac who died in the First World War, 1914-18. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost impossible to imagine the effect on this tiny community of these fatalities over four years. Every year on Nov. 11 at 11 a.m. \xe2\x80\x94 the hour and the day of the 1918 armistice \xe2\x80\x94 villagers gather to participate in a short memorial service around the obelisk.'b'In 2014 it will be a hundred years since the First World War began, and yet its presence in novels, films and television has never been greater \xe2\x80\x94 in \xe2\x80\x9cDownton Abbey,\xe2\x80\x9d on television, in Steven Spielberg\xe2\x80\x99s movie \xe2\x80\x9cWar Horse,\xe2\x80\x9d in a mini-series of Sebastian Faulks\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Birdsong'b'\xe2\x80\x9d and, coming soon, in Tom Stoppard\xe2\x80\x99s adaptation of Ford Madox Ford\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Parade\xe2\x80\x99s End'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The last old soldier or sailor has died and almost all of the witnesses have gone, but the war exerts a tenacious hold on the imagination.'b'For us British, the memories, images and stories of 1914-18 seem to have a persistence and a power that eclipse those of the Second World War. I\xe2\x80\x99m symptomatic of this urge to revisit the conflict: my new novel will be my third with the First World War at its center. When I wrote and directed a movie, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Trench'b',\xe2\x80\x9d about a group of young soldiers in 1916 waiting for the Battle of the Somme to begin, I was obsessed with getting every detail right: every cap-badge worn and cigarette smoked, every meal eaten. It was as if I wanted the absolute verisimilitude to provide an authentic, vicarious experience so the viewer would be in a position to say, \xe2\x80\x9cSo this is what it was like, this is what they went through, how they lived \xe2\x80\x94 and died.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I think this is the key behind the enduring obsession with that war. To our modern sensibilities it defies credulity that for more than four years European armies faced one another in a 500-mile line of trenches, stretching from the Belgian coast to the border of Switzerland. The war was also fought in other arenas \xe2\x80\x94 in Galicia, Italy, the Bosporus, Mesopotamia, East and West Africa, in naval battles on many oceans \xe2\x80\x94 but it is the Western Front and trench warfare that define the war in memory. It was a deadly war of attrition in which millions of soldiers on both sides slogged through the mud of no man\xe2\x80\x99s land to meet their deaths in withering blasts of machine-gun fire and artillery. And at the end of four years and with about nine million troops dead, the two opposing forces were essentially where they were when they started.'b'IN France and Germany, the traumas of the Second World War have to a degree erased memories of the First. But in Britain, where almost a million servicemen died, it\xe2\x80\x99s still images of the trenches of the Western Front that are shown and that resonate on Remembrance Day. One of the reasons for this is, paradoxically, the resonance of the poetry. The poets of the First World War \xe2\x80\x94 Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon, Edmund Blunden, Isaac Rosenberg \xe2\x80\x94 are taught in almost all British schools. I can remember Wilfred Owen\xe2\x80\x99s terrifying poem \xe2\x80\x9cDulce et Decorum Est,\xe2\x80\x9d about a mustard-gas attack, being read aloud to us in the classroom when I was 10 or 11. One boy actually ran outside, he was so overcome and upset. The war poems shaped your earliest perceptions of the First World War and were swiftly buttressed by the familiar images of the trenches and the histories of the futile, costly battles.'b'Intensifying the powerful art was the visual documentation, because it was the first war to be extensively filmed.'b'And finally, there were family stories. One hundred years is not so very long ago. My great-uncle Alexander Boyd was wounded and decorated at the Battle of the Somme. His brother, my grandfather William Boyd, was wounded a year later at Passchendaele, as the Third Battle of Ypres was known. Family legend and anecdote fueled my interest in the war.'b'But there is another deeper, perhaps more profound reason the war continues to preoccupy us. It was a conflict between 19th-century armies equipped with 20th-century weapons \xe2\x80\x94 hence the unprecedented carnage. To put it in an American context: imagine an officer in the United States Army \xe2\x80\x94 in his 50s, say \xe2\x80\x94 on the Argonne front in 1918. As a young soldier he could conceivably have fought, 30 years earlier, in the last of the wars against the Plains Indians in the late 1880s. Yet now he stands surveying a different world. The tactics were 19th century \xe2\x80\x94 advance on the enemy. But the enemy had weapons of mass destruction \xe2\x80\x94 the battlefield was dominated by tanks, machine guns, howitzers, aircraft and poisonous gas. Some 117,000 American servicemen died in the 'b'19 months of United States participation'b' in World War I \xe2\x80\x94 more than twice as many as in Vietnam, nearly 20 times as many as in Iraq and Afghanistan.'b'No society today would accept such a horrendous casualty count. At the beginning of the Battle of the Somme, on July 1, 1916, the British Army suffered 60,000 dead and wounded \xe2\x80\x94 in one day. It was arguably the worst butcher\xe2\x80\x99s bill in military history, of army versus army. There is a very real sense in which the modern world \xe2\x80\x94 our world \xe2\x80\x94 was born between 1914 and 1918. Something changed in human sensibility. Soldiers wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be willing to engage in such slaughter. Toward the end of the First World War, even, tolerance for past norms had begun to end. In 1917, much of the French Army mutinied and refused to attack. They would defend but not attack. The days of cannon fodder were over forever as a result of that war, which is a further reason artists try to re-imagine it constantly.'b'To quote another poem, Philip Larkin\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c'b'MCMXIV'b'\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cNever such innocence again.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'After the First World War, nothing in the world would ever be the same.'b'CAN you trademark the color red?'b'This week a federal appellate court will hear arguments in a 'b'case'b' involving this very question. The issue arises in connection with shoes, specifically, the vivid red soles beneath Christian Louboutin shoes. The high-end designer says four separate styles of Yves Saint Laurent shoes infringe its trademarked sole. All four shoes are red all over \xe2\x80\x94 including the soles.'b'Last summer a 'b'federal court'b' denied Louboutin\xe2\x80\x99s request that YSL be stopped from selling its red shoes pending resolution of Louboutin\xe2\x80\x99s effort to enforce its federally registered Red Sole Mark. (In its opinion, the court said Louboutin\xe2\x80\x99s trademark infringement claim was unlikely to succeed.) Now, the shoedown escalates to the appeals court.'b'The quirky lawsuit dramatizes the law\xe2\x80\x99s ambivalence toward fashion. The law does not protect fashion design, but it does recognize the rights inherent in branding. Louboutin\xe2\x80\x99s claim spotlights the pressure on fashion designers to frame their aesthetic choices as brand identifiers, and the legal contortions that result.'b'Those familiar with high-end fashion associate the red underside of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s shoe with the Louboutin brand. And for good reason: Louboutin has invested plenty in that red sole and successfully linked the sole\xe2\x80\x99s shade with the shoemaker. Since a main purpose of trademark law is to protect one\xe2\x80\x99s investment in reputation, Louboutin\xe2\x80\x99s sole-saving efforts are understandable.'b'But red; it\xe2\x80\x99s a color. An interlocking LV on a Louis Vuitton handbag or a Nike swoosh on a sneaker is one thing, some say. But monopolizing a color ... just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem right.'b'As it turns out, however, the Supreme Court has previously held that a color alone could be a trademark, in a case about a solid green-gold color on pads used in dry cleaning press machines, because the color served to identify the maker of the product \xe2\x80\x94 and had no other function. Thus an important caveat is that if the color is a useful feature in a product \xe2\x80\x94 green for farm equipment or yellow for banana-flavored gum \xe2\x80\x94 it can\xe2\x80\x99t be a trademark, even if it is source-identifying, because excluding competitors from a useful feature would be anti-competitive. Applying this logic, the judge in the Louboutin case suggested that particularly in fashion, a single color could not be a trademark. The judge reasoned that in fashion, color is always \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 meaning that color is a useful aesthetic feature to which all designers should have access.'b'The red elephant in the room is that though it is the artistic and creative core of the fashion industry, design is not protected qua design, but only as a symbol of who created it. Fashion designers find no comfort in the federal copyright statute, which protects authors and creators, but does not extend to \xe2\x80\x9cuseful articles,\xe2\x80\x9d including apparel and shoes.'b'A pending Congressional bill may offer some copyright protection for fashion design, but until then, fashion, unlike other visual media such as film and painting, remains a realm in which copying is perfectly legal \xe2\x80\x94 unless a design is deemed a trademark, that is. The Burberry plaid design, for example, is legally protected because it identifies Burberry, while the design of a dress the plaid may adorn is not, no matter how artful or original. Hence the pressure to frame design features \xe2\x80\x94 like an eye-catching color or a pleasing plaid \xe2\x80\x94 as trademarks.'b'That brings us to the fashion Catch-22 that the red sole throws into relief: Trademark law does not protect design features that are \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional,\xe2\x80\x9d the meaning of which, it turns out, encompasses even aesthetic appeal. But in copyright law it is precisely the utilitarian and non-aesthetic aspect of apparel and shoes that leaves fashion design unprotected from copying. Fashion design is caught between opposing demands and exclusions, and snubbed from both ends.'b'It is unlikely a court will allow Louboutin to monopolize \xe2\x80\x9cred,\xe2\x80\x9d even if all that is claimed is placement on the sole. A trademark claim on the precise \xe2\x80\x9cChinese Red\xe2\x80\x9d that Louboutin uses on its soles might be more palatable, but the company seemingly wants to trademark \xe2\x80\x9cred\xe2\x80\x9d rather than a particular shade of this color. (YSL\xe2\x80\x99s shoes are not the same shade of red as Louboutin\xe2\x80\x99s.) Still, YSL\xe2\x80\x99s red soles are part of a red-all-over shoe design; arguably Louboutin\xe2\x80\x99s soles are recognizable precisely because of the contrast between shoe and sole color.'b'It is time for Congress to address directly the fusion of practicality and beauty that makes fashion such a compelling medium of expression and a profitable creative industry, one that merits its own limited industry-specific protections. Otherwise, colorful as they are, lawsuits like the red sole case are likely to compound the uncertainty that results from the absence of statutory delineation of fashion design protection \xe2\x80\x94 and invite more lawsuits.'b'A SOCIAL revolution began in 'b'Saudi Arabia'b' this month, and it has little if anything to do with the Arab Spring. Women are going to work in lingerie shops.'b'The Ministry of Labor is enforcing a royal decree issued last summer ordering that sales personnel in shops selling garments and other goods, like cosmetics, that are only for women must be female. More than 'b'28,000 women applied'b' for the jobs, the ministry said. Anywhere else in the world, it would not be news that sales assistants in shops selling panties and bras were female. In Saudi Arabia, where women have always been excluded from the public work force, it is a critical breakthrough. This is not just about intimate garments; this is a milestone on the arduous path to employment equality for women in a country where they are systematically excluded from retail activity.'b'Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s economic planners recognize that if women are going to be educated at public expense, as they now are in increasing numbers, they will expect to work and the country will need their economic output. Society has increasingly accepted the idea that women will work outside the home. They have long been employed in medicine and education. Retail commerce, however, has generally remained closed because such work usually requires interaction with men, which is prohibited. The lingerie shops are breaking that taboo.'b'One of the oddest sights in Saudi Arabia is that of fully veiled women, hidden from others by their enveloping garments, going into the Saudi equivalent of Victoria\xe2\x80\x99s Secret stores in the many upscale malls and being greeted and assisted exclusively by male sales clerks, most of whom are from South Asia. This absurd situation so embarrassed many women that they waited until they were out of the country to buy their underwear and nightgowns.'b'The campaign to change the rules began several years ago, and was led by 'b'Reem Asaad'b', a fashion-conscious financial adviser who speaks flawless English and is comfortable with the Western media. It appeared to have 'b'succeeded in 2006'b' when the government ordered that the sales jobs be transferred to women. But social conservatives and the religious establishment objected, arguing that Islam prohibited women from working outside the home and that putting women in retail shops would expose them to the view of any passing stranger. If the sales clerks were female, the shop windows would have to be covered, the opponents said.'b'Shop owners objected, too, saying that no women were trained to do such work. In addition, the 2006 decree failed to address the transportation problem: if women were going to work in those shops, they would need a man to drive them because they are prohibited from driving. Saudi cities have virtually no public transportation. So the decree was never enforced. Ms. Asaad then used Facebook to organize a boycott of the shops, and arranged for some women to be trained in retail work.'b'This time, King Abdullah has put his personal authority behind the new decree. Last year he also installed a new minister of labor, Adel Fakieh, who had embraced the idea of employing women at a supermarket chain owned by his holding company. Under the new rules, the country\xe2\x80\x99s thousands of lingerie and cosmetics shops have until June to replace their male employees with women. The feared religious police, who are really the behavior police, have been ordered to cooperate.'b'King Abdullah generally supported an expansion of opportunities for women, but steps in this direction can\xe2\x80\x99t be traced to any burst of enlightenment within the royal family. They are happening because the kingdom\xe2\x80\x99s women need and want jobs and are learning how to make themselves heard \xe2\x80\x94 and because, in an increasingly expensive country, their husbands often want them to work.'b'Over the coming generation, this is likely to be the farthest-reaching transformation in Saudi society. While women are still constrained by law, religion and custom, more and more are likely to enter the work force. They will be better educated than their predecessors, will marry later and will have fewer children. The range of jobs and professions open to them will expand. The Ministry of Labor is already compiling a list of jobs women will be permitted to hold. It won\xe2\x80\x99t include all jobs \xe2\x80\x94 no female miners or construction workers here \xe2\x80\x94 but it will be a much longer list than in the past, including some positions in law enforcement.'b'These changes will meet entrenched opposition, but the economic and demographic forces behind them seem irresistible. The transition would be easier if women were permitted to drive (the 2011 decree failed to address that issue), but that is bound to come, too \xe2\x80\x94 if not this year, then soon, if only because growing ranks of employed women will build pressure for it. Thousands of Saudi women have driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses issued by other countries; they will be ready when the day comes.'b'Since it was first held 32 years ago, the South Carolina Republican primary has been won by the party\xe2\x80\x99s most electable candidate, the one backed by the Republican establishment and invariably the winner of the nomination. On Saturday, the state veered in an extreme direction, and the outcome spoke poorly for a party that allowed itself to be manipulated by the lowest form of campaigning.'b'Newt Gingrich won the primary by a decisive margin of 12.5 percentage points, and there is no mystery about how he did it. Two-thirds of voters 'b'interviewed in exit polls'b' said they made their decision on the basis of the two South Carolina debates, where Mr. Gingrich 'b'exploited racial resentment'b' and hatred of the news media to connect with furious voters.'b'He was helped by Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s halting answers about his tax returns and his finances, and by Rick Santorum\xe2\x80\x99s tepid campaign, in which he compared himself to 'b'warm porridge'b'. But Mr. Gingrich won this largely on his own. He had a much better sense of the raw, destructive anger at President Obama swirling around a highly conservative and combative state, and he reflected it back to voters everywhere he went.'b'South Carolina has moved sharply rightward since Mr. Obama arrived on the national scene. In 2000, 24 percent of state voters said they were \xe2\x80\x9cvery conservative,\xe2\x80\x9d but that number jumped to 34 percent in 2008. Now it is up to 37 percent, according to exit polls. Two-thirds of Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s voters said they supported the Tea Party, reflecting the election in 2010 of four South Carolina freshmen who are among the most extreme members of the House.'b'In one of the most telling results of the exit polls, most voters said that cutting the federal budget was more important than encouraging job growth. At a time when more than 13 million people remain unemployed, these voters do not want the government to do a thing about it, possibly because it might improve Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s re-election chances.'b'Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s foam-rubber ideology was not built for an electorate this rigid. Mr. Santorum\xe2\x80\x99s profound social conservatism might normally have played well, particularly because two-thirds of primary voters said they were evangelical or born-again Christians, but he appealed only to Republican minds, not hearts.'b'It was Mr. Gingrich who pulled the race into the gutter, where he found considerable support. He repeatedly called Mr. Obama \xe2\x80\x9cthe greatest food-stamp president in American history,\xe2\x80\x9d and lectured a black questioner at Monday\xe2\x80\x99s debate about the amount of federal handouts to blacks, suggesting their work ethic was questionable.'b'On Thursday, in the derisive tones of a radio talk-show host, he said Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s cabinet 'b'looked like Mickey Mouse and Goofy'b'. At that night\xe2\x80\x99s debate, he lashed into the moderator for asking a perfectly reasonable question about his ex-wife\xe2\x80\x99s allegation that he wanted an open marriage, saying it was typical of an \xe2\x80\x9celite media\xe2\x80\x9d that was trying to protect the president by attacking Republicans.'b'That was just what South Carolina voters wanted to hear, the signal that he would not only challenge Mr. Obama but work to bloody him, to destroy his dignity. As one voter 'b'told a reporter'b', \xe2\x80\x9cI think we\xe2\x80\x99ve reached a point where we need someone who\xe2\x80\x99s mean.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'They got that candidate on Saturday. Mr. Gingrich shocked Mr. Romney by making an issue of the jobs he destroyed in his leveraged-buyout firm, and he is clearly prepared to take negative campaigning against Mr. Obama to a new low. In his victory speech, he even descended into Rick Perry territory by accusing the \xe2\x80\x9celite media\xe2\x80\x9d of anti-religion bias. Is that really what Republicans across the country want from their nominee, or is South Carolina, with its history of acute racial tension and contrarianism, simply sending a singular, extreme message?'b'It is still hard to imagine a path to the nomination for a divisive candidate like Mr. Gingrich, let alone one to the White House. If he continues along this muddy road, there is still time for Republicans in upcoming states to repudiate him, and demonstrate that South Carolina has become an aberration rather than a bellwether.'b'Philadelphia'b'THE governor of New York, 'b'Andrew M. Cuomo'b', is sending his state down the same wrongheaded path as other states that are trying to gamble their way out of economic trouble by legalizing commercial casinos.'b'The casinos might create jobs and generate revenue for state coffers, but those gains would come at a cost that casino supporters ignore or play down. Various studies,'b' including research by the economist Earl L. Grinols at Baylor University'b', have shown that casinos produce little to no economic spinoff and in fact divert spending away from surrounding businesses like restaurants, movie theaters and live entertainment. In the worst cases, some problem gamblers spend money that is needed for groceries, rent or child support.'b'More broadly, casinos are nothing more than a regressive tax that extracts wealth from the very citizens who can least afford it. The details of Governor Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s plan \xe2\x80\x94 which requires changing the State Constitution \xe2\x80\x94 remain largely under wraps but will likely follow the blueprints of other states that have allowed casinos at select locations.'b'While those casinos are billed as \xe2\x80\x9cdestination resorts,\xe2\x80\x9d they are really convenience casinos \xe2\x80\x94 typically the size of a big-box retailer \xe2\x80\x94 that rely mainly on repeat gamblers who live in the area. Many are located in rural and working-class towns and cities that cater mainly to low rollers, not James Bond-type jet-setters.'b'A casino in downtown Cleveland is opening this year in a former department store. Steve Wynn wants to build a \xe2\x80\x9clow rise\xe2\x80\x9d casino in Foxborough, Mass., near a shopping center and the New England Patriots\xe2\x80\x99 football stadium. The Sands opened a casino in Pennsylvania in 2009 on the site of a Bethlehem Steel plant.'b'Florida, Illinois, Kentucky and Maine are among the states considering similar moves to raise revenue. It is all part of a broader gambling expansion that includes efforts to legalize Internet gambling at the federal level and in several states. New Jersey wants to legalize sports betting.'b'Thirty years ago, Las Vegas and Atlantic City were the only legal casino destinations in the country. But over the last few decades there has been a steady increase in lottery offerings, riverboat casinos and gambling on Indian reservations. Today, 41 states have some form of casino gambling, and all but 7 have a lottery.'b'Governor Cuomo is correct that New York \xe2\x80\x94 which has a state lottery, casinos on Indian reservations and video lottery terminals at the Aqueduct Racetrack \xe2\x80\x94 is already in the gambling business. Many New Yorkers also travel to Atlantic City, Pennsylvania and Connecticut to gamble. But making gambling even more convenient to residents is not the answer to the state\xe2\x80\x99s budget or unemployment woes. Lawmakers are sworn to protect residents, not make it easier for them to lose money.'b'The economist Paul A. Samuelson described gambling as the \xe2\x80\x9csterile transfer of money or goods between individuals, creating no new money or goods.\xe2\x80\x9d Warren E. Buffett called gambling a \xe2\x80\x9ctax on ignorance.\xe2\x80\x9d Governor Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s father, Mario, himself a former governor, understood the negative impact. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a respectable body of economic thought that holds that casino gambling is actually economically regressive to a state and a community,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote in a 1994 book, \xe2\x80\x9cThe New York Idea.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Indeed, studies show that where casinos are established there is often an increase in crime, bankruptcy, divorce and suicide. A 'b' study last year by the University of Maryland, Baltimore County'b' found that one in every 30 state residents had a gambling problem. Those most at risk for developing gambling addictions are single men between the ages of 18 and 29, either African-American or Latino, with less education and income than the overall population.'b'For New Yorkers, opening casinos closer to home would create new gamblers and prompt many residents to gamble more often, especially low rollers who are more likely to get hooked on slot machines. That has been the case in Pennsylvania, which legalized slots in 2004.'b'At the Parx Casino in Bensalem, Pa., many gamblers come in an average of three to four times a week \xe2\x80\x94 or roughly 150 to 200 times a year, David Jonas, the former president and the chief operating officer of the casino, 'b'said at a gambling conference in 2010'b'.'b'Over all, the number of calls to Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s problem gambling help line jumped by 26 percent in the first quarter of last year, according to the Pennsylvania Council on Compulsive Gambling.'b'New York can expect the same payoff from its bad bet.'b'BOTANISTS long thought the tallest trees on Madagascar all belonged to only three species of the genus Canarium, but two scientists have now determined that there are actually 35 species of the genus there, of which 29 are new to science.'b'To make this startling discovery, Douglas Daly of the New York Botanical Garden and his Malagasy colleague Jeannie Raharimampionona hiked through rainforests for months in 2006 and then toiled in scientific collections to sort out all of the species. Only then did they start the laborious process of formally describing each of the new species in Latin for publication in scientific papers, a requirement for making a new species public.'b'Considering all the work involved, perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder that, despite centuries of research and exploration to create a complete inventory of the world\xe2\x80\x99s plant life, there may be as many as 100,000 plant species that are not yet known to science, waiting to be cataloged \xe2\x80\x94 if we can find and describe them in time.'b'The requirement to use Latin \xe2\x80\x94 which has been in place, officially, since 1908, and in practice since the 18th century \xe2\x80\x94 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make this process any faster. At a time when deforestation, the spread of invasive species and climate change are putting as many as one-third of all plant species at risk of extinction in the next 50 years, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have time for traditions like these. That\xe2\x80\x99s why, as of Jan. 1, the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature no longer compels botanists to provide a 'b'Latin description'b' of a new species. Perhaps even more significant, the code now recognizes publication in online academic journals as equally valid as print publication. Both changes will help to speed up the race to catalog the world\xe2\x80\x99s plant life.'b'No longer will botanists have to write sentences like: \xe2\x80\x9cArbor usque ad 6 m alta. Folia decidua; lamina oblanceolata vel elliptica-oblongata, 2-7 cm longa,\xe2\x80\x9d as I did in 2009, describing a new species from Mexico. Instead, I could simply write that Bourreria motaguensis was a six-meter-tall tree with deciduous leaves that were 2 to 7 centimeters long.'b'Simplifying the process for describing and publishing new species will undoubtedly help, but cataloging all our planet\xe2\x80\x99s plant life will require much more than that. Plants are a vital source of materials and medicine; they are the basis of the food chain; they produce the oxygen we breathe. If a species becomes extinct before it is found \xe2\x80\x94 a phenomenon known as \xe2\x80\x9canonymous extinction\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 there is no way to explore its potential. We must prevent that from happening.'b'That will take concerted efforts to conduct research expeditions to the parts of the tropics that still remain unexplored, to generate financial support for the scientists needed to do the work and to train a new generation of botanists. They will have enough to do without having to memorize Latin declensions.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Fees to Doctors by Drug Makers to Be Disclosed'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 17):'b'The proposed requirement to disclose fees paid by drug and device manufacturers to doctors is on target and long overdue.

CORBETT'b'\nChairman and Chief Executive'b'\nPublic Relations Society of America'b'\nNew York, Jan. 19, 2012'b''b''b''b'At Disney World last week, President Obama announced new executive orders to speed up visas for foreign tourists to the United States. The measure, a priority for the travel industry, was one of several sensible recommendations made in the last year by Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Council on Jobs and Competitiveness'b', a 27-member panel of corporate executives, academics, investors and labor leaders. The White House has carried out 17 others so far.'b'Increasingly, however, the council\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations have resembled not so much expert advice as a corporate wish list. In a 'b'report'b' last October, the council\xe2\x80\x99s sound proposals for job-creating public works projects were 'b'overshadowed'b' by its unfounded claim that antifraud provisions put in place in 2002 in response to Enron are an impediment to growth and hiring, and should be ended.'b'Its latest 'b'report'b', issued last week, went so far in the direction of the Republican political agenda that it was endorsed by House Speaker John Boehner for its emphasis on lower tax rates and less regulation. The report drew the ire of the panel\xe2\x80\x99s two union members, Richard Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and Joseph Hansen, chairman of the Change to Win coalition. After the false premises and false fixes that have dominated the job creation debate, the dispute is healthy.'b'Mr. Trumka wrote a 'b'dissent'b' in which he agreed that the United States has fallen behind other countries in investment in infrastructure, manufacturing, education, job skills and alternative energy. What he rightly objected to was the idea that less regulation, lower corporate tax rates and other demands on the business agenda are the key to restoring competitiveness and creating jobs. \xe2\x80\x9cWithout timely action by government on a large scale,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, \xe2\x80\x9csolutions will continue to elude us as a nation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For example, the report\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations for improving education focused in large part on ensuring that schools meet the needs of corporations. It is important to ensure that Americans have the right skills \xe2\x80\x94 and opportunities to acquire new skills. The urgent and fundamental need, however, is to support, improve and sustain a strong public education system. That means more, not less, federal aid for states and localities to hire and retain teachers and for students to attend college, and for additional services to help poor and disadvantaged children to succeed academically, including meals and health care.'b'It is also crucially important to recognize that unemployment today is not primarily driven by a skills gap \xe2\x80\x94 as the council\xe2\x80\x99s report would lead you to believe \xe2\x80\x94 but by lack of jobs. If all of the'b' job openings'b' in America were filled tomorrow, nearly 10 million of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s 13.1 million unemployed workers would still be out of work. That shortage requires more federal aid to bolster demand, not a focus on a less pressing skills gap.'b'All of this would require more tax revenue, but the report discusses corporate tax reform that would not raise more money and would make it easier for American multinational corporations to avoid United States tax on foreign profits. The report claims the changes are needed to improve competitiveness and create jobs. Mr. Trumka pointed out that such changes could do the opposite, leaving the nation financially unable to meet its challenges, while disadvantaging companies without a foreign presence.'b'At a time when austerity is in vogue, it is also morally indefensible to not ask for more from corporations. This is just the kind of substantive debate that is needed to help ensure that corporate and partisan interests do not define the problems and dictate the solutions.'b'Newt Gingrich\xe2\x80\x99s victory in South Carolina turned on an almost comically broad deception, an inversion of the truth in which the insider whose personal wealth and political experience are entirely creations of Washington becomes the anti-establishment candidate. That it worked speaks poorly of voters who let themselves be manipulated by the lowest form of campaigning, appealing to their anger and prejudices.'b'Speaking on \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Meet the Press'b'\xe2\x80\x9d on Sunday, Mr. Gingrich said he was the only one in the race who understands the level of anger at the \xe2\x80\x9cnational establishment.\xe2\x80\x9d He feels no need to actually define this establishment; it\xe2\x80\x99s simply a blob of elitist others who are trying to tell real Americans \xe2\x80\x9cwhat they\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to think, what they\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to say.\xe2\x80\x9d It is clear, though, that both Barack Obama and Mitt Romney are in it, as are Wall Street, all bureaucrats and most emphatically the national media.'b'Mr. Gingrich is clearly hoping that if he keeps the volume up high on his sputtering and raving at this nebulous group, it will drown out his 'b'lifetime membership'b' in it. For years, he was a lobbyist for Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage company, making more than $1.6 million over eight years. He also cashed in on his influence by selling access to health-care companies and insurers, bringing in $37 million over eight years.'b'But all of this was ignored in South Carolina, where he won by a commanding margin through 'b'exploitation of racial resentment'b' and hatred of the news media. South Carolina has moved sharply rightward since Mr. Obama arrived on the national scene, and Mr. Gingrich had the best sense of the blind, destructive anger at the president. He repeatedly called Mr. Obama \xe2\x80\x9cthe greatest food-stamp president in American history,\xe2\x80\x9d and lectured a black questioner at a debate about the amount of federal handouts to blacks, suggesting their work ethic was questionable.'b'On Thursday, he said Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s cabinet 'b'looked like Mickey Mouse and Goofy'b'. At that night\xe2\x80\x99s debate, he said a perfectly reasonable question about his ex-wife\xe2\x80\x99s allegation that he wanted an open marriage was typical of the \xe2\x80\x9celite media\xe2\x80\x9d trying to protect the president.'b'It is still hard to imagine a path to the nomination for Mr. Gingrich, let alone to the White House. There is still time for Republicans in other states to show that South Carolina was an aberration rather than a bellwether.'b'What is it like to get up at 3 every morning to leave the country to go to school? To walk for miles and wait in long lines at an international crossing, to hustle along by trolley and bus, worrying all the while about missing the 8 a.m. bell? This is the bleary-eyed world of young Mexican-Americans who live in Tijuana and go to school in Chula Vista, Calif., as 'b'described'b' by Patricia Leigh Brown in The Times. These striving students, or \xe2\x80\x9ctransfronterizos,\xe2\x80\x9d are not immigrants but American citizens, lawfully crossing the border to get an education.'b'They are toiling toward the honorable goal of a good education, but some stay below the radar because they are not residents of the school districts they attend. Their parents have been deported or have willingly left the United States; some can\xe2\x80\x99t or won\xe2\x80\x99t pay the out-of-district tuition. It\xe2\x80\x99s possible to say their children are contributing to America\xe2\x80\x99s greatness or stealing from it. Or both.'b'Here is a mirror of America\xe2\x80\x99s battle over immigration \xe2\x80\x94 a battle with itself and its future. Courtesy of some Republican politicians, we are fighting it in the worst way possible, with spasms of anti-immigrant loathing and rigid enforcement schemes.'b'The problem with working so hard to keep people 'b'out, each of whom comes with different circumstances, 'b'is that you fail to tap the restless doggedness of those who want in. When our laws needlessly divide families and 'b'discourage beneficial migration, they drain the ambition and energy that are America\xe2\x80\x99s constantly renewable resource.'b''b''b''b'At a time when border crossings are at historic lows, when illegal immigration is greatly diminished, the story of the transfronterizos is a reminder of the vast potential of smart young people. While our laws and policies focus heavily on punishing first-generation illegal immigrants, we forget that it is in our vital interest to make sure their American children and grandchildren succeed.'b'Just as Americans visit the Old World in search of family roots, tourists are showing up at the Brooklyn Historical Society, in hopes of tracking down their grandparents\xe2\x80\x99 neighborhood ties and old houses \xe2\x80\x94 brownstones in Park Slope, row houses in Bay Ridge \xe2\x80\x94 in the New World. As usual, Walt Whitman anticipated the future: \xe2\x80\x9cThere will come a time here in Brooklyn and all over America, when nothing will be of more interest than authentic reminiscences of the past.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As a native, I figured the air went out of Brooklyn in 1957 when Walter O\xe2\x80\x99Malley hijacked the Brooklyn Dodgers to the country\xe2\x80\x99s other coast. The first night game I saw was also Jackie Robinson\xe2\x80\x99s at Ebbets Field, where Flatbush instantly became a wondrous place, so up-close for experiencing racial integration, in baseball at least. The team\xe2\x80\x99s departure was not the last tectonic change. Feisty blue-collar Brooklyn was equally defined by dozens of breweries, thanks to immigrant artisans and exceptional drinking water. They were eclipsed by homogenized national corporations that left memory thirsting for cold sips of Schaefer at Dodger games.'b'A visit to the 149-year-old historical society makes selfish nostalgia pale. A past exhibition paid tribute to the breweries. And now local high school students have researched and curated a handsome 'b'show'b' that plumbs neighborhood history for the Dodgers and Ebbets field. The society\xe2\x80\x99s current 'b'online show'b' about the Lefferts family\xe2\x80\x99s formative role in the borough across four centuries does not stint in describing how \xe2\x80\x9cthe Leffertses derived much of their wealth from the labor of enslaved people.\xe2\x80\x9d It shows a bill of sale for the family\xe2\x80\x99s purchase of a slave named Isaac for $250 in 1818. That was 129 years before Robinson signed for $10,700 to integrate baseball and play in Flatbush.'b''b'FRANCIS X.

I hope to inspire new discussions about the role of art, social media, underground documentary and creative forms of resistance in our interconnected world.'b'O.K., Mr. President, here\xe2\x80\x99s the plan. Sometime in the next few months you order the Department of Defense to destroy Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear capacity. Yes, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s an election year, and some people will say this is a cynical rally-round-the-flag move on your part, but a nuclear Iran is a problem that just won\xe2\x80\x99t wait.'b'Our pre-emptive strike, designated Operation Yes We Can, will entail bombing the yellowcake-conversion plant at Isfahan, the uranium enrichment facilities at Natanz and Fordo, the heavy-water reactor at Arak, and various centrifuge-manufacturing sites near Natanz and Tehran. True, the Natanz facility is buried under 30 feet of reinforced concrete and surrounded by air defenses, but our new bunker-buster, the 30,000-pound Massive Ordnance Penetrator, will turn the place into bouncing rubble. Fordo is more problematic, built into the side of a mountain, but with enough sorties we can rattle those centrifuges. Excuse me? Does that take care of everything? Um, that we know of.'b'Civilian casualties? Not a big deal, sir, given the uncanny accuracy of our precision-guided missiles. Iran will probably try to score sympathy points by trotting out dead bodies and wailing widows, but the majority of the victims will be the military personnel, engineers, scientists and technicians working at the facilities. Fair game, in other words.'b'Critics will say that these surgical strikes could easily spark a full-blown regional war. They will tell you that the Revolutionary Guard \xe2\x80\x94 not the most predictable bunch \xe2\x80\x94 will lash out against U.S. and allied targets, either directly or through terrorist proxies. And the regime might actually close off the vital oil route through the Strait of Hormuz. Not to worry, Mr. President. We can do much to mitigate these threats. For one thing, we can reassure the Iranian regime that we just want to eliminate their nukes, not overthrow the government \xe2\x80\x94 and of course they will take our word for it, if we can figure out how to convey the message to a country with which we have no formal contacts. Maybe post it on Facebook?'b'To be sure, we could just let the Israelis do the bombing. Their trigger fingers are getting itchier by the day. But they probably can\xe2\x80\x99t do the job thoroughly without us, and we\xe2\x80\x99d get sucked into the aftermath anyway. We might as well do it right and get the credit. Really, sir, what could possibly go wrong?'b'The scenario above is extracted from an 'b'article'b' by Matthew Kroenig in the latest issue of Foreign Affairs. (The particulars are Kroenig\xe2\x80\x99s; the mordant attitude is mine.) Kroenig, an academic who spent a year as a fellow at the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s Defense Department, apparently aspires to the Strangelovian superhawk role occupied in previous decades by the likes of John Bolton and Richard Perle. His former colleagues at Defense were pretty 'b'appalled'b' by his article, which combines the alarmist worst case of the Iranian nuclear threat with the rosiest best case of America\xe2\x80\x99s ability to make things better. (Does this remind you of another pre-emptive war in a country beginning with I?)'b'This scenario represents one pole in a debate that is the most abused foreign policy issue in this presidential campaign year. The opposite pole, also awful to contemplate, is the prospect of living with a nuclear Iran. In that case, the fear of most American experts is not that Iran would decide to incinerate Israel. (Mahmoud Ahmadinejad does a good impression of an evil madman, but Iran is not suicidal.) The more realistic dangers, plenty scary, are that a conventional conflict in that conflict-prone neighborhood would spiral into Armageddon, or that Iran would extend its protective nuclear umbrella over menacing proxies like Hezbollah, or that Arab neighbors would feel obliged to join the nuclear arms race.'b'For now, American policy lives between these poles of attack and acquiescence, in the realm of uncertain calculation and imperfect options. If you want to measure your next president against a hellish dilemma, here\xe2\x80\x99s your chance.'b'In the Republican field we have one candidate ('b'Rick Santorum'b') who is about as close as you can get to the bomb-sooner-rather-than-later extreme, another ('b'Ron Paul'b') who is at the let-Iran-be-Iran extreme, and Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich are 'b'in between'b'. Of particular interest is Romney, who has performed the same rhetorical trick with Iran that he did with health care. That is, he 'b'condemns'b' Obama for doing pretty much what Romney would do.'b'Although much about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s theocracy is murky, a few assumptions are widely accepted by specialists in and out of government.'b'First, for all its denials, the Iranian regime is determined to acquire nuclear weapons, or at least the capacity to make them quickly in the event of an outside threat. Having a nuclear option is seen as a matter of Persian pride and national survival in the face of enemies (namely us) who the Iranians believe are bent on toppling the Islamic state. The nuclear program is popular in Iran, even with many of the opposition figures admired in the West. The actual state of the program is not entirely clear, but the best open-source estimates are that if Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered full-speed-ahead \xe2\x80\x94 which there is no sign he has done \xe2\x80\x94 they could have an actual weapon in a year or so.'b'American policy has been consistent through the Bush and Obama administrations: (1) a declaration that a nuclear Iran is \xe2\x80\x9cunacceptable\xe2\x80\x9d; (2) a combination of sticks (sanctions) and carrots (supplies of nuclear fuel suitable for domestic industrial needs in exchange for forgoing weapons); (3) unfettered international inspections; (4) a refusal to take military options off the table; (5) a concerted effort to restrain Israel from attacking Iran unilaterally \xe2\x80\x94 beyond the Israelis\xe2\x80\x99 presumed campaign to slow Iran\xe2\x80\x99s progress by sabotage and assassination; and (6) a wish that Iran\xe2\x80\x99s hard-liners could be replaced by a more benign regime, tempered by a realization that there is very little we can do to make that happen. This is also the gist of Romney\xe2\x80\x99s Iran playbook, for all his bluster about Obama the appeaser.'b'In practice, Obama\xe2\x80\x99s policy promises to be tougher than Bush\xe2\x80\x99s. Because Obama started out with an offer of direct talks \xe2\x80\x94 which the Iranians foolishly spurned \xe2\x80\x94 world opinion has shifted in our direction. We may now have sufficient global support to enact the one measure that would be genuinely crippling \xe2\x80\x94 a 'b'boycott of Iranian oil'b'. The administration and the Europeans, with help from Saudi Arabia, are working hard to persuade such major Iranian oil customers as Japan and South Korea to switch suppliers. The Iranians take this threat to their economic livelihood seriously enough that people who follow the subject no longer minimize the chance of a naval confrontation in the Strait of Hormuz. It\xe2\x80\x99s not impossible that we will get war with Iran even without bombing its nuclear facilities.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s not the only problem with the current \xe2\x80\x94 let\xe2\x80\x99s call it the Obamney \xe2\x80\x94 approach to Iran.'b'The point of tough sanctions, of course, is to force Iranians to the bargaining table, where we can do a deal that removes the specter of a nuclear-armed Iran. (You can find 'b'some thoughts'b' on what such a deal might entail on my blog.) But the mistrust is so deep, and the election-year pressure to act with manly resolve is so intense, that it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine the administration would feel free to accept an overture from Tehran. Anything short of a humiliating, unilateral Iranian climb-down would be portrayed by the armchair warriors as an Obama surrender. Likewise, if Israel does decide to strike out on its own, Bibi Netanyahu knows that candidate Obama will feel immense pressure to go along.'b'That short-term paradox comes wrapped up in a long-term paradox: an attack on Iran is almost certain to unify the Iranian people around the mullahs and provoke the supreme leader to redouble Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear pursuits, only deeper underground this time, and without international inspectors around. Over at the Pentagon, you sometimes hear it put this way: Bombing Iran is the best way to guarantee exactly what we are trying to prevent.'b'How goes the state of the union? Well, the state of the economy remains terrible. Three years after President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s inauguration and two and a half years since the official end of the recession, unemployment remains painfully high.'b'But there are reasons to think that we\xe2\x80\x99re finally on the (slow) road to better times. And we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be on that road if Mr. Obama had given in to Republican demands that he slash spending, or the Federal Reserve had given in to Republican demands that it tighten money.'b'Why am I letting a bit of optimism break through the clouds? Recent economic data have been a bit better, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve already had several false dawns on that front. More important, there\xe2\x80\x99s evidence that the two great problems at the root of our slump \xe2\x80\x94 the housing bust and excessive private debt \xe2\x80\x94 are finally easing.'b'On housing: as everyone now knows (but oh, the abuse heaped on anyone pointing it out while it was happening!), we had a monstrous housing bubble between 2000 and 2006. Home prices soared, and there was clearly a lot of overbuilding. When the bubble burst, construction \xe2\x80\x94 which had been the economy\xe2\x80\x99s main driver during the alleged \xe2\x80\x9cBush boom\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 plunged.'b'But the bubble began deflating almost six years ago; house prices are back to 2003 levels. And after a protracted slump in housing starts, America now looks seriously underprovided with houses, at least by historical standards.'b'So why aren\xe2\x80\x99t people going out and buying? Because the depressed state of the economy leaves many people who would normally be buying homes either unable to afford them or too worried about job prospects to take the risk.'b'But the economy is depressed, in large part, because of the housing bust, which immediately suggests the possibility of a virtuous circle: an improving economy leads to a surge in home purchases, which leads to more construction, which strengthens the economy further, and so on. And if you squint hard at recent data, it looks as if something like that may be starting: home sales are up, unemployment claims are down, and builders\xe2\x80\x99 confidence is rising.'b'Furthermore, the chances for a virtuous circle have been rising, because we\xe2\x80\x99ve made significant progress on the debt front.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s not what you hear in public debate, of course, where all the focus is on rising government debt. But anyone who has looked seriously at how we got into this slump knows that private debt, especially household debt, was the real culprit: it was the explosion of household debt during the Bush years that set the stage for the crisis. And the good news is that this private debt has declined in dollar terms, and declined substantially as a percentage of G.D.P., since the end of 2008.'b'There are, of course, still big risks \xe2\x80\x94 above all, the risk that trouble in Europe could derail our own incipient recovery. And thereby hangs a tale \xe2\x80\x94 a tale told by a recent report from the McKinsey Global Institute.'b'The 'b'report'b' tracks progress on \xe2\x80\x9cdeleveraging,\xe2\x80\x9d the process of bringing down excessive debt levels. It documents substantial progress in the United States, which it contrasts with failure to make progress in Europe. And while the report doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say this explicitly, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear why Europe is doing worse than we are: it\xe2\x80\x99s because European policy makers have been afraid of the wrong things.'b'In particular, the European Central Bank has been worrying about inflation \xe2\x80\x94 even raising interest rates during 2011, only to reverse course later in the year \xe2\x80\x94 rather than worrying about how to sustain economic recovery. And fiscal austerity, which is supposed to limit the increase in government debt, has depressed the economy, making it impossible to achieve urgently needed reductions in private debt. The end result is that for all their moralizing about the evils of borrowing, the Europeans aren\xe2\x80\x99t making any progress against excessive debt \xe2\x80\x94 whereas we are.'b'Back to the U.S. situation: my guarded optimism should not be taken as a statement that all is well. We have already suffered enormous, unnecessary damage because of an inadequate response to the slump. We have failed to provide significant mortgage relief, which could have moved us much more quickly to lower debt. And even if my hoped-for virtuous circle is getting under way, it will be years before we get to anything resembling full employment.'b'But things could have been worse; they would have been worse if we had followed the policies demanded by Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s opponents. For as I said at the beginning, Republicans have been demanding that the Fed stop trying to bring down interest rates and that federal spending be slashed immediately \xe2\x80\x94 which amounts to demanding that we emulate Europe\xe2\x80\x99s failure.'b'And if this year\xe2\x80\x99s election brings the wrong ideology to power, America\xe2\x80\x99s nascent recovery might well be snuffed out.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Upset by Gingrich Shifts G.O.P.

'b''b'WE have a tool that can prevent hundreds of murders, rapes and robberies each year at minimal cost to taxpayers. But we\xe2\x80\x99re not using it in a majority of cases because a state law restricts its use.'b'DNA evidence solves crimes. Since 1996, when New York State\xe2\x80\x99s DNA'b' databank'b' opened with strong support from my predecessor, Robert M. Morgenthau, the bank\xe2\x80\x99s DNA samples have been linked to more than 3,500 sexual assaults, 860 murders, 1,100 robberies and 3,400 burglaries. Thousands of criminal convictions have resulted. Today, however, we are hamstrung by a law that does not authorize the collection of DNA following convictions of certain misdemeanors. This has meant that we can\xe2\x80\x99t use DNA technology in more than half of our cases. By expanding the collection of DNA to include those convicted of all crimes in New York State\xe2\x80\x99s penal law, as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has called for, we will be better able to identify the guilty, exonerate the innocent, bring justice to crime victims and prevent additional crimes from occurring.'b'In 2006, lawmakers decided to include some but not all misdemeanors in the DNA databank. Opponents questioned why someone convicted of a low-level misdemeanor \xe2\x80\x94 petty larceny, for example \xe2\x80\x94 should be required to provide a DNA sample. The answer can be found in the results of that decision: samples collected from people convicted of petty larceny have been linked to roughly 48 murders and 220 sexual assaults. Clearly, the 2006 expansion of the DNA program \xe2\x80\x94 which passed with only six dissenting votes in the State Assembly \xe2\x80\x94 confirmed that collecting samples from offenders convicted of minor crimes helps solve and prevent more serious crimes.'b'Whom does DNA bring to justice, and how does it prevent future crimes? The case of 'b'Curtis Tucker'b' is instructive. Following his conviction in 2010 for robbing and assaulting a 74-year-old Manhattan man suffering from Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s disease, Mr. Tucker was required to submit a DNA sample, which typically is obtained by swabbing the inside of a person\xe2\x80\x99s cheek. Three days later, that $30 test produced a match linking Mr. Tucker to a brutal 2004 assault and attempted rape of a 15-year-old girl in the stairwell of her Manhattan apartment building.'b'Mr. Tucker had been convicted multiple times in Manhattan courts for misdemeanor offenses that did not require providing a DNA sample. Had he been required to provided such a sample after his first misdemeanor conviction, the 2004 case would have been solved earlier and the 2010 attack prevented.'b'Crucially, DNA evidence does more than put criminals away; it also exonerates the innocent. One of my top goals as district attorney has been to avoid wrongful convictions. Having a tool like an all-crimes DNA databank at our disposal would go a long way toward helping us achieve that all-important goal of avoiding wrongful convictions.'b'Despite the truly remarkable benefits of DNA testing, some skeptics have questioned whether it is sufficiently regulated and reliable. This concern is understandable but unfounded. The collection of DNA is highly regulated in the eight state-of-the-art, accredited state labs that conduct criminal forensic analysis. Strict safeguards control the handling of DNA testing and results, including the storage of information by barcode and not name, with criminal penalties for those who violate these rules. When testing leads to a match in the databank, samples are retested at least once and often twice. To date in New York, we have never had a \xe2\x80\x9cfalse positive,\xe2\x80\x9d or the misidentification of DNA from one person as the DNA of another.'b'Collecting DNA from all those convicted of all crimes has received overwhelming bipartisan support from across the state, including from crime victims, their advocates, exonerated defendants, the state and city bar associations, and the state\xe2\x80\x99s district attorneys, police chiefs and sheriffs. But its passage has been stymied because other criminal justice legislation that does not enjoy such broad support has been tacked on to it. Let\xe2\x80\x99s not repeat that mistake this year.'b'No law enforcement tool is perfect, and, as with a fingerprint, a DNA match at a crime scene is an investigative tool, not proof positive of guilt. But DNA is by far the most reliable evidence we have today \xe2\x80\x94 more than eyewitness accounts, testimony and even confessions. And importantly, as we try to make our justice system more fair, DNA is truly color blind.'b'Chestnut Hill, Mass.'b'TWO weeks ago, dozens of cars were set alight in the French city of Clermont-Ferrand after a 30-year-old truck driver, Wissam El-Yamni, was roughed up and then died while in police custody. The uproar underscored the hostility of young minority men toward authority across communities in Europe, an antipathy that has at times led to deadly violence.'b'The failure of Islamic integration in Europe is often attributed \xe2\x80\x94 especially by right-wing parties \xe2\x80\x94 to an excess of tolerance toward the large-scale Muslim immigration that began in the mid-1970s. By recognizing Muslim religious requirements, the argument goes, countries like France, Britain and the Netherlands have unwittingly hindered assimilation and even, in some cases, fostered radicalism. But the unrest in gritty European suburbs stems not from religious difference, but from anomie.'b'Europeans should not be afraid to allow Muslim students to take classes on Islam in state-financed schools and universities. The recognition and accommodation of Islamic religious practices, from clothing to language to education, does not mean capitulation to fundamentalism. On the contrary, only by strengthening the democratic rights of Muslim citizens to form associations, join political parties and engage in other aspects of civic life can Europe integrate immigrants and give full meaning to the abstract promise of religious liberty.'b'The rise of right-wing, anti-immigrant parties has led several European countries to impose restrictions on Islamic dress, mosque-building and reunification of families through immigration law. These policies are counterproductive. Paradoxically, people for whom religion is otherwise not all that important become more attached to their faith\xe2\x80\x99s clothing, symbols and traditions when they feel they are being singled out and denied basic rights.'b'Take, for example, the French debate over whether to recognize the Jewish Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur, and the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha as official holidays. Yes, the French state clings to the principle of \xe2\x80\x9cla\xc3\xafcit\xc3\xa9,\xe2\x80\x9d or secularism \xe2\x80\x94 but the state\xe2\x80\x99s recognition of Easter and Christmas as official holidays feels, to some Jews and Muslims, like hypocrisy. It is Islam\xe2\x80\x99s absence in the institutions young European Muslims encounter, starting with the school\xe2\x80\x99s calendar, classroom and canteen, that contributes to anger and alienation.'b'In the last few months, there have been some signs that the right-wing momentum has slowed. A French bill to ban headscarves from day care centers was killed in committee. The Dutch Parliament voted down a bill to outlaw Islamic animal slaughter. And Germany\xe2\x80\x99s most populous state helped offset a judicial ban on school prayer by announcing equal access to religion courses for Muslim students.'b'European countries could use a period of benign neglect of the Islam issue \xe2\x80\x94 but only after they finish incorporating religion into the national fabric. For too long, they have instead masked an absence of coherent integration policy under the cloak of \xe2\x80\x9cmulticulturalism.\xe2\x80\x9d The state outsourced the hard work of integration to foreign diplomats and Islamist institutions \xe2\x80\x94 for example, some students in Germany read Saudi-supplied textbooks in Saudi-run institutions.'b'This neglect of integration helped an unregulated \xe2\x80\x9cunderground Islam\xe2\x80\x9d to take hold in storefronts, basements and courtyards. It reflected wishful thinking about how long guest workers would stay and perpetuated a myth of eventual departure and repatriation.'b'In Britain, for example, race-based equality laws protected Sikhs and Jews as minorities, but not Hindus and Muslims, since they were still considered \xe2\x80\x9cforeign.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Institutional exclusion fueled a demand for religious recognition, and did much to unite and segregate Muslims. Islamist organizations became the most visible defenders of the faith. It is crucial now to provide the right mix of institutional incentives for religious and political moderation, and the most promising strategy for doing that is for governments to consult with the full range of law-abiding religious institutions that Muslims have themselves established.'b'The French Council for the Muslim Faith, the German Islam Conference, the Committee for Italian Islam and the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board in Britain \xe2\x80\x94 all state-sanctioned Islamic organizations set up in the past decade \xe2\x80\x94 represent a broad cross-section of mosque administrators in every country. They have quietly begun reconciling many practical issues, from issuing mosque permits to establishing Islamic theology departments at public universities to appointing chaplains in the military and in prisons.'b'Ultimately, however, elected democratic institutions are the place where the desires of individual Muslims should be expressed. Ever since 1789, when a French legislator argued that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Jews should be denied everything as a nation, but granted everything as individuals,\xe2\x80\x9d Europeans have struggled to resolve the tension between rights derived from universal citizenship versus group membership.'b'Over the next 20 years, Europe\xe2\x80\x99s Muslim population is projected to grow to nearly 30 million \xe2\x80\x94 7 to 8 percent of all Europeans \xe2\x80\x94 from around 17 million. Granting Muslims full religious freedom wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t remove obstacles to political participation or create jobs. But it would at least allow tensions over Muslims\xe2\x80\x99 religious practices to fade. This would avoid needless sectarian strife and clear the way for politicians to address the more vexing and urgent challenges of socioeconomic integration.'b'Not long ago, a veteran Republican strategist told me that a politician could succeed with his zipper down, but not with his words unbridled.'b'He was talking about Newt Gingrich, and was saying that Gingrich\xe2\x80\x99s philandering and three marriages weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to be his real problem, given how many men in government had been forgiven for messy sexual pasts.'b'His greater liabilities were his wildly mixed messages, gross overstatements and insistence on inserting himself \xe2\x80\x94 like some mouthy Gump doppelg\xc3\xa4nger with a doctorate \xe2\x80\x94 into every key moment of the late 20th century.

Since 2000 they have lived in the posh enclave of McLean, Va., not Appalachia, and have personally stimulated the economy with expenditures at Tiffany, not Zales.'b'He lashes out against secularists and trumpets his and Callista\xe2\x80\x99s Roman Catholicism, though the two of them lived for six years in 'b'explicit defiance'b' of its tenets.'b'Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s reinventions pale beside Gingrich\xe2\x80\x99s. At one moment, in one passage of oratory, Gingrich is the only stick-to-his-guns conservative running. At another moment, in another passage, he\xe2\x80\x99s a seasoned practitioner of compromise, as proved by the Clinton years.'b'He\xe2\x80\x99s also a longtime Washington insider who\xe2\x80\x99s the only reform-minded outsider equipped to change the capital\xe2\x80\x99s ways. How does that work?'b'In contesting his second wife\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'claim'b' on ABC\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cNightline\xe2\x80\x9d that he had requested an open marriage, he accused the news media of a special anti-Republican zeal, conveniently forgetting how that same media \xe2\x80\x94 with his gleeful encouragement \xe2\x80\x94 pounced on the moral failings of President Clinton, a Democrat.'b'He rails that the media can\xe2\x80\x99t be trusted, then readily cites any dispatch that cuts in his favor as unassailable truth. He 'b'did this'b' on Monday on ABC\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cGood Morning America,\xe2\x80\x9d invoking a New York Times article from 2008 as part of his defense against Romney\xe2\x80\x99s charge that he has lobbied lawmakers.'b'He had initially been slated to appear on ABC on Sunday, on \xe2\x80\x9cThis Week,\xe2\x80\x9d but canceled after the network\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cNightline\xe2\x80\x9d report. He did competing networks\xe2\x80\x99 Sunday shows instead.'b'By Monday, though, he was ready to heed the siren call of George Stephanopoulos, his pique with ABC as transitory as his ire at CNN\xe2\x80\x99s John King last week was inflated. It\xe2\x80\x99s all one hyperbolic \xe2\x80\x94 and, in its way, brilliant \xe2\x80\x94 performance.'b'For a Republican electorate looking for heat, he delivers gust upon gust of hot air. Romney manages only a tepid breeze.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have emotion and passion,\xe2\x80\x9d Romney told the anchor Chris Wallace on \xe2\x80\x9cFox News Sunday,\xe2\x80\x9d in a voice that communicated neither. Twice more he mentioned passion, as if willing it into his bones.'b'Wallace played a clip of Gingrich\xe2\x80\x99s South Carolina victory speech, noting how fiercely angry at the state of the country Gingrich seemed.'b'Romney said that he himself was \xe2\x80\x9cvery upset.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Most Democrats are elated. Gingrich seems to them a weaker opponent for President Obama than Romney would be. They\xe2\x80\x99re rooting for him.'b'But unbridled words have an unexpected currency right now. And one ill-timed, major economic relapse could give the general-election advantage to any Republican nominee, including Gingrich, whose bombast would then get the loudest microphone in the world.'b'I hope President Obama read about Maddie Parlier as he was working on his State of the Union address. Parlier is the subject of 'b'Adam Davidson\xe2\x80\x99s illuminating article'b' in the current issue of The Atlantic.'b'Parlier\xe2\x80\x99s father abandoned her when she was young and crashed his car while driving drunk, killing himself and a family of four. Maddie is smart and hard-working. She did reasonably well in high school but got pregnant her senior year.'b'She and the father of her child split up, which put the kibosh on her college dreams because she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford day care. She temped for a while. Her work ethic got her noticed, and she got a job as an unskilled laborer at Standard Motor Products, which makes fuel injectors.'b'Parlier earns about $13 an hour. She\xe2\x80\x99d like to become one of the better-paid workers in the plant, but, in today\xe2\x80\x99s factories, that requires an enormous leap in skills. It feels cruel, Davidson writes, to mention all the things Parlier would have to learn to move up. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know the computer language that runs the machines. \xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know trigonometry or calculus, and she\xe2\x80\x99s never studied the properties of cutting tools or metals. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to maintain a tolerance of 0.25 microns, or what tolerance means in this context, or what a micron is.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A good attitude and hustle have taken Parlier as far as they can. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard, given her situation, to acquire the skills she needs to realize the American dream.'b'Davidson\xe2\x80\x99s article is important because it shows the interplay between economic forces (globalization and technology) and social forces (single parenthood and the breakdown of community support). Globalization and technological change increase the demands on workers; social decay makes it harder for them to meet those demands.'b'Across America, millions of mothers can\xe2\x80\x99t rise because they don\xe2\x80\x99t have adequate support systems as they try to improve their skills. Tens of millions of children have poor life chances because they grow up in disorganized environments that make it hard to acquire the social, organizational and educational skills they will need to become productive workers.'b'Tens of millions of men have marred life chances because schools are bad at educating boys, because they are not enmeshed in the long-term relationships that instill good habits and because insecure men do stupid and self-destructive things.'b'Over the past 40 years, women\xe2\x80\x99s wages have risen sharply but, as Michael Greenstone and Adam Looney of the 'b'Hamilton Project'b' point out, median incomes of men have dropped 28 percent and male labor force participation rates are down 16 percent. Next time somebody talks to you about wage stagnation, have them break it down by sex. It\xe2\x80\x99s not only globalization and technological change causing this stagnation. It\xe2\x80\x99s the deterioration of the moral and social landscape, especially for men.'b'The idiocy of our current political debate is that neither side seems capable of talking about the interplay of economic and social forces. Most of the Republican candidates talk as if all that is needed is more capitalism. But lighter regulation and lower taxes won\xe2\x80\x99t, on their own, help the Maddie Parliers of the world get the skills they need to compete.'b'Democrats, meanwhile, have shifted their emphasis from lifting up the poor to pounding down the rich. Democratic candidates no longer emphasize early childhood education and community-building. Instead they embrace the pseudo-populist Occupy Wall Street hokum \xe2\x80\x94 the opiate of the educated classes.'b'This materialistic ethos emphasizes reducing inequality instead of expanding opportunity. Its policy prescriptions begin (and sometimes end) with raising taxes on the rich. This makes you feel better if you detest all the greed-heads who went into finance. It does nothing to address those social factors, like family breakdown, that help explain why American skills have not kept up with technological change.'b'If President Obama is really serious about restoring American economic dynamism, he needs an aggressive two-pronged approach: More economic freedom combined with more social structure; more competition combined with more support.'b'As a survey of nearly 10,000 Harvard Business School grads by Michael Porter and Jan Rivkin makes clear, to get companies to locate their plants in the U.S., Obama is going to have to simplify the tax code, cut corporate rates, streamline regulations, make immigration policy more flexible and balance the budget over the long term.'b'To ensure there\xe2\x80\x99s skilled labor for those plants, Obama would have to champion different policies: successful training programs like 'b'Job Corps'b', better coordination between colleges and employers, better treatment for superstar teachers, more child care options and better early childhood education.'b'This agenda is libertarian in the capitalist sector and activist in the human capital sector. Don\xe2\x80\x99t triangulate meekly toward the center; select bold policies from both ends. That\xe2\x80\x99s what would help Maddie Parlier and millions like her.'b'It was early in the evening of Jan. 13 when 'b'Ryan Boatright'b', the freshman basketball player at the University of Connecticut, learned that he was being suspended from the team 'b'for the second time'b' this season. Earlier that day, he had flown into South Bend, Ind., with his teammates for a game against Notre Dame. The 19-year-old point guard was excited because some 400 people from his hometown, Aurora, Ill., were coming to see him play.'b'When his coach, Jim Calhoun, broke the news that the N.C.A.A. was still investigating him, Boatright collapsed in Calhoun\xe2\x80\x99s arms. In tears, he called his mother, Tanesha, who began weeping uncontrollably. 'b'As I chronicled on Saturday'b', it was her acceptance of plane tickets a year or so ago that had caused his first suspension. The N.C.A.A. had ruled the tickets an \xe2\x80\x9cimproper benefit,\xe2\x80\x9d and had ordered him to sit out six games and pay a $100-per-month fine to repay the tickets. What more, she wondered, could the N.C.A.A. want?'b'A lot, it turned out. Tanesha is a single mother raising four children on a small salary. The N.C.A.A. investigators viewed her circumstances as a cause for suspicion, not sympathy. For instance, she owns a car. Where did she get the money to pay for it, they asked? How did she pay for her home? And so on.'b'Concluding that she had no choice but to cooperate \xe2\x80\x94 otherwise, her son would surely pay a severe price \xe2\x80\x94 Tanesha turned over her bank statements, as the N.C.A.A. demanded. Four N.C.A.A. investigators pored through her financial records and conducted interrogations in Aurora, seeking \xe2\x80\x9cevidence\xe2\x80\x9d that she was getting money from \xe2\x80\x9cimproper\xe2\x80\x9d sources. (Tanesha declined to comment.)'b'When the investigators saw a series of cash deposits in her bank account, they demanded to know the source of the money. She told them: Friends had given her money so that she and her children could have a joyful Christmas. The investigators said they didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe her; they felt sure that she must have gotten the money from an unscrupulous sports agent or some other party outlawed by the N.C.A.A.'b'Meanwhile, her son remains in limbo, unable to play the game he loves, his reputation unfairly besmirched, while he awaits the N.C.A.A.\xe2\x80\x99s latest ruling. I keep hearing it might happen soon, but, so far, nothing. People associated with Connecticut basketball, including Calhoun, are said to be furious at the N.C.A.A.\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of Ryan Boatright. But the university is as fearful of the N.C.A.A. as Tanesha. It has yet to say a single word publicly on his behalf.'b'When I asked the N.C.A.A. about the Boatright case, the response I received was deeply disingenuous. Refusing to discuss the actions of its investigators, it essentially said that Connecticut, not the N.C.A.A., declared Boatright ineligible. That is technically true. Schools declare athletes ineligible because if they don\xe2\x80\x99t, the N.C.A.A. will deprive them of scholarships, force them to forfeit games and prevent them from playing in postseason games. Most astonishing, an N.C.A.A. spokeswoman told me that the organization does not have the legal authority to compel cooperation from parents. Again, technically true: Its real weapon \xe2\x80\x94 the threat of destroying their sons\xe2\x80\x99 careers \xe2\x80\x94 is far more potent than any mere subpoena.'b'Over the past three weeks, as 'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve written a series of columns'b' about the abuses of the N.C.A.A., one question keeps reverberating in my head: How can this be happening in America?'b'How can children be punished for the deeds of their parents \xe2\x80\x94 deeds that aren\xe2\x80\x99t even wrong in any basic legal sense? How can the N.C.A.A. blithely wreck careers without regard to due process or common fairness? How can it act so ruthlessly to enforce rules that are so petty? Why won\xe2\x80\x99t anybody stand up to these outrageous violations of American values and American justice?'b'The columns have also prompted e-mails, mostly from parents of college athletes, with their own examples of N.C.A.A. injustices. The women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball player at Harvard who came to the United States from Britain and isn\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to play because she struggled when she first got to the U.S. and had to repeat a year of high school. The team manager \xe2\x80\x94 yes, team manager! \xe2\x80\x94 who was forced out of his role because he knew a high school player that his school was recruiting. The A students forced off the court because the N.C.A.A. does not include their high school A.P. courses among its \xe2\x80\x9capproved\xe2\x80\x9d coursework. The coach whose career was ended when the N.C.A.A. accused him of \xe2\x80\x9cunethical conduct\xe2\x80\x9d without giving him a chance to defend himself.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe N.C.A.A. is like the Gestapo,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote one parent in an e-mail. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s out there, we all fear it, and it is all-powerful and follows its own rules and makes them up as they go along. Who are they protecting? The same thing the Gestapo protected: themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'After weeks of temporizing, Mitt Romney said he 'b'plans to release'b' a small slice of his tax records on Tuesday \xe2\x80\x94 his 2010 returns and an estimate for his 2011 taxes. It is not enough. American voters need to know a lot more about the business interests that Mr. Romney says make him the best candidate to be president. (President Obama, after all, released eight years\xe2\x80\x99 worth of tax records during the 2008 campaign; Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s father, George, released 12 years\xe2\x80\x99 worth when he ran for president in 1968.)'b'Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s main rival for the Republican presidential nomination, Newt Gingrich \xe2\x80\x94 after a lot of pious declarations about how Mr. Romney needed to come clean \xe2\x80\x94 has released only one year\xe2\x80\x99s worth of his tax records. He did so not because of any real dedication to transparency, but because he wanted to increase the pressure on Mr. Romney and to show that he had paid an effective tax rate of 31.7 percent, roughly twice the rate that Mr. Romney has said he paid.'b'There is lot more than that to be learned from Mr. Gingrich\xe2\x80\x99s documents, starting with the mockery they make of his claim to be an insurgent Washington outsider, the supposed anti-establishment candidate.'b'After he was drummed out of the House speaker\xe2\x80\x99s office in 1998, Mr. Gingrich set about creating a lucrative living, by trading on his political connections. 'b'In 2010, he reported a total income of $3.16 million'b' (including a tidy $76,200 Congressional pension).'b'Most of Mr. Gingrich\xe2\x80\x99s income has come from helping corporate clients gain access and solicitous treatment from Washington\xe2\x80\x99s power elite. One of his consulting groups, the 'b'Center for Health Transformation'b', 'b'gave clients advice in reaching what it called'b' \xe2\x80\x9ctop transformational leadership across industry and government.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'His services, according to news accounts, included helping his clients formulate arguments to get lawmakers to incorporate their interests in legislation. Over the years, that included up to $1.8 million in \xe2\x80\x9cconsulting fees\xe2\x80\x9d to him and his firm from Freddie Mac, the lending company that Mr. Gingrich has accused of helping to cause the housing crisis.'b'Mr. Gingrich insists that none of this highly paid work is lobbying. \xe2\x80\x9c'b'I was never a lobbyist'b',\xe2\x80\x9d he said on \xe2\x80\x9cMeet the Press\xe2\x80\x9d on Sunday. \xe2\x80\x9cI never did any lobbying.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That is true, in the sense that Mr. Gingrich never registered as a lobbyist \xe2\x80\x94 someone who is paid to go to Congressional or government offices and make specific pitches on behalf of special pleaders to influence legislation. But people of his stature never register. They develop strategy and use their contacts to open doors and then leave the appointment-making to more junior people who are registered as lobbyists.'b'According to The Washington Post, 'b'the Gingrich brand generated $100 million'b' in revenue over the past decade for a collection of for-profit enterprises, including that health care group, which charged six-figure dues to large corporations.'b'So Mr. Gingrich can claim he was never a lobbyist, but there is no way he can claim that he is anything but a Washington insider who has made millions by trading on his political connections for more than a decade. He\xe2\x80\x99s a shrewd broker of Washington influence, and about as \xe2\x80\x9cestablishment\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and cynical \xe2\x80\x94 as you can get.'b'President Rafael Correa of Ecuador is leading a relentless campaign against free speech, harassing his critics, forcing independent broadcasters off the air and hijacking the nation\xe2\x80\x99s courts in his bid to bankrupt the country\xe2\x80\x99s largest newspaper.'b'After Emilio Palacio, the editorial page editor of 'b'El Universo'b', wrote a column accusing Mr. Correa of ordering the army to open fire on a hospital during a police protest, Mr. Correa filed a criminal suit against the editor and three of the paper\xe2\x80\x99s directors, claiming \xe2\x80\x9caggravated defamation of a public official.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Despite outrageous irregularities \xe2\x80\x94 the case was finally decided by a \xe2\x80\x9ctemporary magistrate\xe2\x80\x9d who, according to an independent forensic analysis, may have outsourced the job of writing the decision to the president\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer \xe2\x80\x94 an appeals court confirmed a $40 million award for the president, plus three-year sentences for the directors and Mr. Palacio. A final appeal by the directors is expected to be heard on Wednesday. Mr. Palacio has run out of appeals.'b'Looking forward to next year\xe2\x80\x99s presidential elections, in which he is likely to run, Mr. Correa has also pushed through a law that would forbid the news media from \xe2\x80\x9ceither directly or indirectly promoting any given candidate, proposal, options, electoral preferences or political thesis, through articles, specials or any other form of message.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Correa\xe2\x80\x99s assault on the press has rightly drawn criticism from the 'b'Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression'b' at the 'b'Organization of American States'b'. Now he is trying to silence the rapporteur. Last month, his government presented the O.A.S. with recommendations to \xe2\x80\x9cimprove\xe2\x80\x9d the special rapporteur, by reducing its financing, limiting the scope of its annual reports and imposing a code of conduct to restrict its independence.'b'The United States and others only belatedly recognized what Mr. Correa was up to. In December, the O.A.S. adopted a broader final report on 'b'the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights'b' monitoring system that included some of the recommendations. When the O.A.S. ambassadors meet in Washington this week, they should do all they can \xe2\x80\x94 there is room to maneuver \xe2\x80\x94 to protect the financing and the voice of the rapporteur. Mr. Correa, predictably, couches his moves in populist rhetoric. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we are liberating our states from the de facto powers that always dominated them \xe2\x80\x94 like the power of information \xe2\x80\x94 these de facto powers accuse us,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in'b' a speech'b' before Latin-American leaders in December. There is no doubt that his assault on a free press is an assault on democracy.'b'Latin America has a bitter history of authoritarian rule. It has struggled hard to get beyond those days. All of the hemisphere\xe2\x80\x99s democratic leaders, including President Obama, need to push back against Mr. Correa.'b'Two years ago, when the Supreme Court struck down bans on independent corporate and union expenditures in elections in the 'b'Citizens United'b' case, Justice Anthony Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s majority opinion claimed that money does not \xe2\x80\x9cgive rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.\xe2\x80\x9d While it might result in \xe2\x80\x9cinfluence over or access to elected officials,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, it is not the same as bribery.'b'Last month, in a 5-to-2 vote, the Montana Supreme Court rejected that misguided reasoning and 'b'upheld'b' a part of a state anticorruption law banning corporations from making political expenditures from general treasuries. The court\xe2\x80\x99s dissenters argued that Montana cannot ignore the Citizens United decision \xe2\x80\x94 and they may well be proved right when the case is appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Still, the majority and a dissenting opinion agree that Citizens United has given corporations enormous power barely distinguishable from bribery.'b'Montana has a long history of fighting political corruption. A century ago, state voters passed an initiative that banned corporate spending to help or hurt candidates for public office. They were responding to 'b'epic political corruption'b' caused by the copper kings who controlled a big part of the state\xe2\x80\x99s wealth.'b'The court\xe2\x80\x99s majority in Western Tradition Partnership v. Montana ruled that Citizens United does not apply to Montana\xe2\x80\x99s law because it is tailored to meet a compelling state interest and its burden on corporations\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical activity or speech\xe2\x80\x9d is minimal \xe2\x80\x94 they can easily set up political action committees for contributions from officers and shareholders. The court also stressed the acute need to limit corporate influence in politics because elected officials shape policies that determine winners and losers in fights over the state\xe2\x80\x99s natural resources.'b'In Citizens United, the conservative majority turned itself into a copper kings\xe2\x80\x99 court. The Montana Supreme Court, faced with tangible effects of corporate electioneering, shows how that decision undermines the fight against political corruption \xe2\x80\x94 and can make it far worse.'b'Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey acted in the public interest when he signed a long-overdue bill that permits pharmacies to sell a limited number of syringes to individuals without prescriptions. This new law will save lives across the state by slowing the spread of blood-borne viruses like H.I.V.'b'Intravenous drug users in New Jersey who likely contracted H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, from contaminated needles have accounted for more than 40 percent of the nearly 76,000 H.I.V./AIDS cases recorded in the state since the beginning of the epidemic, compared with about 25 percent nationally. Many of those who died from the disease might never have been infected at all had the Legislature acted promptly on needle access bills that were introduced in various forms in the 1990s.'b'But the Legislature waited until 2006, when it authorized a handful of programs that were permitted to distribute clean needles to addicts. A 2010 state analysis found that they had been instrumental in recruiting addicts to treatment and that they had the potential to significantly slow the transmission of blood-borne diseases.'b'Not all addicts, however, are willing to be seen collecting syringes, so the new law allows pharmacies to sell as many as 10 syringes at a time to adults without a prescription. The pharmacies must provide them with information on treatment and instructions for safe disposal.'b'The state still needs to expand programs that provide addicts with treatment and access to clean needles.'b''b'To the Editor: 'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Bird Flu Scientists Agree to Delay Virus Research'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (news article, Jan. 21):'b'There is great debate in the scientific and public health community about what should be done regarding recent experiments in which scientists mutated H5N1 bird flu strains so that they could spread readily between ferrets.'b'Ferrets are the best model for predicting human flu transmission, so the assumption should be that this new strain would spread among humans, perhaps as easily as seasonal flu.'b'Both sides in the debate deeply value public health and are seeking to diminish the dangers of bird flu. The question is whether these new experiments increase or decrease the dangers of a bird flu pandemic.'b'Naturally occurring H5N1 bird flu has killed nearly 60 percent of the 'b'583'b' cases confirmed by the World Health Organization since 2003. Fortunately, it has not spread effectively among people. If this engineered transmissible H5N1 strain were to escape the lab by accident or intentional act, and if it maintained high lethality while spreading as effectively as seasonal flu, it could kill tens or hundreds of millions of people worldwide.'b'Those in favor of the work have argued that it will improve bird flu surveillance and vaccine development efforts. But it seems unlikely that bird flu surveillance and control programs will be substantially changed based on this research. And developing vaccines against H5N1 strains that are actually emerging in nature does not require this kind of research.'b'The potential benefits of the research do not justify the potential dangers, so the research should be discontinued. While in almost all circumstances basic research should be fully disseminated in the science community, in this case the results should not be published in a way that allows them to be replicated by others. If allowed to continue, the research should be performed only in pursuit of concrete, urgent goals under international approval and the greatest possible safety conditions.'b'TOM INGLESBY'b'\nBaltimore, Jan. 24, 2012'b''b''b'The writer, an infectious-disease doctor, is director of the Center for Biosecurity, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.'b''b''b'\n'b'Editors\xe2\x80\x99 Note: 'b''b''b'We invite readers to respond to this letter for our Sunday Dialogue.

If Jerusalem 'b'really 'b' believes that a nuclear-armed Tehran poses an existential threat \xe2\x80\x94 and cannot be contained by a conventional military attack, sanctions, deterrence or regime change \xe2\x80\x94 there remains one option to end the threat that people fear to talk about: Israel\xe2\x80\x99s use of nuclear weapons.'b'Far-fetched? Thinking the unthinkable remains embedded in the planning of all nuclear-armed nations. For an Israel that grew out of the Holocaust and beat back adversaries seeking its destruction without the bomb, the unthinkable option becomes more plausible when a nuclear-arming Iran repeatedly calls for the Jewish state\xe2\x80\x99s extinction.

But Dodd-Frank, like most regulation, is reactive and not proactive.'b'Instead of waiting until something happens to act, Congress should create simple legislation to prevent the underlying causes of the 2008 financial crisis from realigning in such a way to bring down the economy (think of Glass-Steagall). Dodd-Frank does nothing to prevent the \xe2\x80\x9ctoo big to fail\xe2\x80\x9d banks from growing bigger and failing. It simply allows for an orderly liquidation once an institution fails.'b'The best way to prevent another crisis is not to allow the banks to get bigger and more systemically important, and then wind them down tidily after failure. The best way to prevent another crisis is to prevent them from getting too big in the first place.'b'AARON NESSEL'b'\nEvanston, Ill., Jan. 18, 2012'b''b''b'The writer is a lawyer on the regulatory side of the financial services industry. 'b''b'Cairo'b'THE fate of one man can sometimes clarify the deepest flaws of a government and of the society it rules. Today in Egypt, on the anniversary of its uprising against Hosni Mubarak, that man is Maikel Nabil Sanad.'b'Mr. Nabil spent much of the last year in a tiny, fetid cell in El Marg Prison in Cairo, where he went on a hunger strike. He was removed, under guard, to a hospital on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day to recuperate. Last week he was pardoned and yesterday he was released. But his fight \xe2\x80\x94 and his troubles \xe2\x80\x94 are probably not over.'b'What he has endured already illustrates not just the repressive practices of Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s interim military rulers. It also illuminates a broader challenge facing Egyptian society itself, if it hopes that democracy and pluralism will replace the Mubarak government.'b'That is because Mr. Nabil, unlike other jailed protesters, is a Coptic Christian by background, an atheist by belief and a pacifist whose rejection of violence has led him even to declare zealously that Israel has a right to live in peace in the region, a sentiment that contrasts with most Egyptians\xe2\x80\x99 grudging acceptance and suspicion of their neighbor.'b'So while other imprisoned dissidents have become causes c\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8bres here, Mr. Nabil has not. Still, he has continued to campaign against the interim government, and to preach that until all voices \xe2\x80\x94 even unpopular ones like his \xe2\x80\x94 can be heard, none will be safe.'b'The fact that reaction to his persecution has been muted, even among some activists, suggests how hard the struggle for free expression will be in Egypt.'b'Mr. Nabil\xe2\x80\x99s criticisms of the military predate the uprising. He agitated against conscription in 2009 and refused his call-up notice in 2010. He was detained for that \xe2\x80\x94 and detained again on his way to Tahrir Square in February. Military intelligence agents beat him for carrying a placard that said of the state: \xe2\x80\x9cWe want it civil, not religious or military.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Then his real troubles started. Shortly after Mr. Mubarak stepped down, Mr. Nabil wrote Facebook and blog posts, including one saying that the army and the people were 'b'never one hand'b' \xe2\x80\x94 an effort, Mr. Nabil said, to puncture a myth that the military had supported the protesters. (The post ridiculed a chant, \xe2\x80\x9cThe people and the army are one hand.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'The post also said, long before other protesters would reach the same conclusion, that the revolution had \xe2\x80\x9cso far managed to get rid of the dictator but not of the dictatorship.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'On March 28, Mr. Nabil was arrested, and 13 days later he was sentenced by a military tribunal to three years in prison \xe2\x80\x94 later reduced to two \xe2\x80\x94 for insulting the army. His summary trial was one of thousands that bypassed guarantees for fair trials.'b'Relatives said he refused to write a formal apology to the armed forces. Instead, he continued his polemical writings from prison. In an essay, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'One Citizen'b',\xe2\x80\x9d that was smuggled out and posted online in December, he implored Egyptians to understand \xe2\x80\x9cthat all freedom is lost once they allow the wolf to choose the first victim from amongst the herd, that they cannot regain the freedom of society unless every \xe2\x80\x98one citizen\xe2\x80\x99 is free.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Meanwhile, Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s interim military rule has been marked by escalating repression and, ultimately, the use of live ammunition against protesters. Even so, the repression was calibrated. Most of the victims were from vulnerable minorities like revolutionary activists, human rights workers and Christians.'b'The military clearly believes it has the support of Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s majority, and wants to minimize the risk of losing it. These tactics were in evidence most dramatically in October, when the military forcefully dispersed a largely Coptic demonstration, resulting in 27 deaths. Even Mr. Nabil\xe2\x80\x99s release seems calibrated: it carried no admission of error by the army, and is being read here as an effort to deflate dissidence during the anniversary.'b'The army\xe2\x80\x99s violent actions last year are more significant. If they were meant to stigmatize a few unpopular opponents in order to justify repression, much of Egyptian society has to some degree been complicit. Majority public opinion has not turned against the generals, who say repression is a defense against \xe2\x80\x9chidden hands\xe2\x80\x9d that threaten \xe2\x80\x9cstability.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some activists have publicly stood up for Mr. Nabil. But his case has received a mere fraction of the attention given the unjustly accused and recently released activist Alaa Abdel Fattah. That divergence exposes how distant Egypt remains from an abiding respect for unorthodox views like Mr. Nabil\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 an essential feature of pluralistic politics. To reach that goal, there will have to be fundamental changes not just in Egyptian law and voting, but in its society.'b'For now, Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s authorities must release all of their political detainees and retry, in civilian courts, all of the civilians sentenced by military courts. The United States and the international community must make it clear that violations of fundamental rights will hurt Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s relations with the world.'b'And Egyptian society must come to grips with the broader circumstances that allowed Mr. Nabil\xe2\x80\x99s detention and persecution to go largely unnoticed.'b'A visitor who saw Mr. Nabil late last year said he was \xe2\x80\x9cstruck by the weakness of his body compared to the strength of his mind.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Nabil will need more of that strength. Social change is a gradual process, and widespread social indifference to his fate will not end soon.'b'But Egypt won\xe2\x80\x99t be a full democracy until its people value the lonely defiance of a man like Maikel Nabil, even when they differ with most of his beliefs.'b'In an essay, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cMaking It in America,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'in the latest issue of The Atlantic'b', the author Adam Davidson relates a joke from cotton country about just how much a modern textile mill has been automated: The average mill has only two employees today, \xe2\x80\x9ca man and a dog. The man is there to feed the dog, and the dog is there to keep the man away from the machines.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Davidson\xe2\x80\x99s article is one of a number of pieces that have recently appeared making the point that the reason we have such stubbornly high unemployment and sagging middle-class incomes today is largely because of the big drop in demand because of the Great Recession, but it is also because of the quantum advances in both globalization and the information technology revolution, which are more rapidly than ever replacing labor with machines or foreign workers.'b'In the past, workers with average skills, doing an average job, could earn an average lifestyle. But, today, average is officially over. Being average just won\xe2\x80\x99t earn you what it used to. It can\xe2\x80\x99t when so many more employers have so much more access to so much more above average cheap foreign labor, cheap robotics, cheap software, cheap automation and cheap genius. Therefore, everyone needs to find their extra \xe2\x80\x94 their unique value contribution that makes them stand out in whatever is their field of employment. 'b'Average is over.'b''b'Yes, new technology has been eating jobs forever, and always will. As they say, if horses could have voted, there never would have been cars. But there\xe2\x80\x99s been an acceleration. As Davidson notes, \xe2\x80\x9cIn the 10 years ending in 2009, [U.S.] factories shed workers so fast that they erased almost all the gains of the previous 70 years; roughly one out of every three manufacturing jobs \xe2\x80\x94 about 6 million in total \xe2\x80\x94 disappeared.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And you ain\xe2\x80\x99t seen nothin\xe2\x80\x99 yet. Last April, Annie Lowrey of Slate wrote about a start-up called \xe2\x80\x9cE la Carte\xe2\x80\x9d that is out to shrink the need for waiters and waitresses: The company \xe2\x80\x9chas produced a kind of souped-up iPad that lets you order and pay right at your table. The brainchild of a bunch of M.I.T. engineers, the nifty invention, known as the Presto, might be found at a restaurant near you soon. ... You select what you want to eat and add items to a cart. Depending on the restaurant\xe2\x80\x99s preferences, the console could show you nutritional information, ingredients lists and photographs. You can make special requests, like \xe2\x80\x98dressing on the side\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98quintuple bacon.\xe2\x80\x99 When you\xe2\x80\x99re done, the order zings over to the kitchen, and the Presto tells you how long it will take for your items to come out. ... Bored with your companions? Play games on the machine. When you\xe2\x80\x99re through with your meal, you pay on the console, splitting the bill item by item if you wish and paying however you want. And you can have your receipt e-mailed to you. ... Each console goes for $100 per month. If a restaurant serves meals eight hours a day, seven days a week, it works out to 42 cents per hour per table \xe2\x80\x94 making the Presto cheaper than even the very cheapest waiter.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What the iPad won\xe2\x80\x99t do in an above average way a Chinese worker will. Consider this paragraph from Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s terrific 'b'article in The Times'b' by Charles Duhigg and Keith Bradsher about why Apple does so much of its manufacturing in China: \xe2\x80\x9cApple had redesigned the iPhone\xe2\x80\x99s screen at the last minute, forcing an assembly-line overhaul. New screens began arriving at the [Chinese] plant near midnight. A foreman immediately roused 8,000 workers inside the company\xe2\x80\x99s dormitories, according to the executive. Each employee was given a biscuit and a cup of tea, guided to a workstation and within half an hour started a 12-hour shift fitting glass screens into beveled frames. Within 96 hours, the plant was producing over 10,000 iPhones a day. \xe2\x80\x98The speed and flexibility is breathtaking,\xe2\x80\x99 the executive said. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s no American plant that can match that.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'b'And automation is not just coming to manufacturing, explains Curtis Carlson, the chief executive of SRI International, a Silicon Valley idea lab that invented the Apple iPhone program known as Siri, the digital personal assistant. \xe2\x80\x9cSiri is the beginning of a huge transformation in how we interact with banks, insurance companies, retail stores, health care providers, information retrieval services and product services.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There will always be change \xe2\x80\x94 new jobs, new products, new services. But the one thing we know for sure is that with each advance in globalization and the I.T. revolution, the best jobs will require workers to have more and better education to make themselves above average. Here are the latest unemployment rates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for Americans over 25 years old: those with less than a high school degree, 13.8 percent; those with a high school degree and no college,\xc2\xa08.7 percent; those with some college or associate degree,\xc2\xa07.7 percent; and those with bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree or higher, 4.1 percent.'b'In a world where average is officially over, there are many things we need to do to buttress employment, but nothing would be more important than passing some kind of G.I. Bill for the 21st century that ensures that every American has access to post-high school education.'b'Berkeley, Calif.'b'MANY potential homebuyers who can afford to buy are instead waiting, worried that home prices will continue to decline.'b'In its most recent quarterly survey, Fannie Mae reported a continuing decline in the fraction of renters and homeowners who think buying a home is a safe investment.'b'But there is a way to buy a home with less risk to one\xe2\x80\x99s hard-earned cash: a down-payment protection plan.'b'Down-payment protection would provide a sensible and affordable way to restore confidence. It would complement the proposals President Obama made in his 'b'State of the Union address'b' Tuesday for increasing mortgage refinancings at today\xe2\x80\x99s low interest rates.'b'When combined with other economic woes, is it any wonder that so many potential buyers, especially younger adults, are renting, or living with relatives? By one recent estimate, the nation has about two million fewer households than under more normal conditions. Some of these potential buyers hesitate to take the risk of buying, even though their jobs and credit history may qualify them for mortgages. While near-record numbers of houses all over the country are empty, the sidelines are crowded with this huge \xe2\x80\x9cshadow demand.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Activating that demand for houses, condos and apartments would help the sales of related goods and services, which would in turn help reduce unemployment.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s how down-payment protection could work. Homebuyers could purchase protection from the government for a one-time fee, say 1 percent of the house purchase price, or $2,000 on a house selling for $200,000. The fee could vary with the risk of house price declines in each area. The plan would be open to all buyers.'b'At the end of three years, the government would automatically mail checks to protected homeowners if average house prices in their area were lower than when they purchased their homes. (No decline, no check \xe2\x80\x94 just like 'b'auto insurance'b'.)'b'Or, the payment might be applied to the mortgage to reduce the balance due. Declines would be based on the government\xe2\x80\x99s house-price indexes for nearly 400 areas in the country. Either way, without selling their homes, at the end of the third year homebuyers would be quickly and fully compensated for any loss of equity, up to the amount of their down payment.'b'Down-payment protection would encourage lenders to ease currently tight credit conditions. The Federal Reserve has documented that banks\xe2\x80\x99 lending standards have become tighter. Maybe they\xe2\x80\x99ve tightened them too much. Because lenders\xe2\x80\x99 risks tend to rise as house prices fall, the protection could also be used to encourage lenders to ease their mortgage terms a bit. In that scenario, the buyer of the house could pay for the down-payment protection and then assign it to the lender in return for easier mortgage terms, like agreeing to lower rates, fees or down payments.'b'That, too, would advance the goal of allowing more borrowers to qualify and buy houses.'b'Only the federal government can readily offer a down-payment protection program that is large enough to raise actual and expected future house prices, which would in turn lower how much the buyer would have to pay. In addition, unlike private providers of protection, the government reaps substantial extra revenue when its policies raise national income. Even if the taxpayers provide some subsidy, to the extent that the economy does better, they would get some benefit.'b'Depending on the fees and revenue gains, based on a scenario of two million participating home buyers, the expected net cost to taxpayers would be a few billion dollars annually, far less than some of the housing programs that have already been tried.'b'And, if it demonstrated the viability of the protection, the government could pass the baton to the private sector.'b'Having the government offer not just mortgage insurance to protect lenders, but also down-payment protection for homebuyers, could increase demand. A stronger housing sector in turn improves business for those who provide related services and products, which would create more jobs.'b'Israel\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Court is the body that provides checks and balances to the country\xe2\x80\x99s executive and legislative powers, upholding constitutional standards. Over the years the court has gained a reputation as one of the most judicially active, human rights-oriented courts in the world.'b'In the four decades since the 1967 Six-Day War between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the court has become a stage for an escalating conflict between two very different world views.'b'Israel is the only modern state that has held territories under military occupation for over four decades. It is also unusual for a nation to allow residents of territories under a military occupation to petition its Supreme Court and request intervention in acts of state.'b'Since the early years of the occupation, the Supreme Court has unwittingly found itself pushed into a corner time and again. Rather than functioning as the bastion of human rights that it was established to be, it has instead become the entity responsible for balancing the needs of a state engaged in a prolonged occupation with basic principles of democracy.'b'This Op-Doc expands on one of the themes explored in my new feature documentary, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Law in These Parts,\xe2\x80\x9d and asks about the role of the Supreme Court in the legal underpinnings of the longest military occupation in modern times.\xc2\xa0'b'Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s military junta showed some political sense on Tuesday 'b'when it announced'b' the easing of a longtime state of emergency law, a hated symbol of authoritarian rule under President Hosni Mubarak \xe2\x80\x94 and now. The generals clearly hope to placate activists who had planned new protests for Wednesday, the anniversary of the revolt that led to Mr. Mubarak\xe2\x80\x99s ouster.'b'Whether they intend to significantly change their behavior is another matter. Instead of just repealing the 1981 law, as it should have, Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi announced that the military government would limit its use of extrajudicial arrests and detentions to \xe2\x80\x9cthuggery.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s a broad loophole for generals who have used the malleable \xe2\x80\x9cthuggery\xe2\x80\x9d charge before as an all-purpose way to go after anyone they chose. More than 800 Egyptians were killed in the past year as the military used excessive force to break up demonstrations and torture detainees. And more than 12,000 civilians were referred to military tribunals, according to Human Rights Watch.'b'There is positive news. The military allowed elections to proceed and, on Monday, Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s first freely elected Parliament in six decades 'b'held its opening session'b'. Islamists dominate the new legislature, but the main party, the Muslim Brotherhood, seems to be acting responsibly.'b'The generals, however, have refused to cede power until the end of June, after a new constitution is ratified and a president elected. And they insist on negotiating certain issues \xe2\x80\x94 including what the constitution will say on civilian oversight of the military \xe2\x80\x94 solely with the Brotherhood.'b'We are also alarmed by the junta\xe2\x80\x99s raids and continued interrogations of foreign-financed groups, including the United States-based 'b'National Democratic Institute'b', the 'b'International Republican Institute'b' and 'b'Freedom House'b'. So, rightly, are some members of Congress.'b'Egypt faces many challenges, including a serious economic crisis. If the junta does not do a better job of supporting a democratic transition, the Obama administration will have a hard time certifying that Egypt meets new Congressional conditions for $2 billion in annual American aid, most of which goes to the army.'b'Justice Michael Gableman of the Wisconsin Supreme Court 'b'announced'b' last week that he will not retroactively recuse himself by taking back his vote in one of the court\xe2\x80\x99s highly divisive recent cases. The decision is indefensible.'b'In a 4-to-3, right-left vote last June, the court 'b'overturned'b' a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s stay of the Republican-backed state law curbing bargaining rights of public employees. A brave county prosecutor made 'b'a motion'b' for the justice to recuse himself last month after The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel 'b'reported'b' that, secretly and outrageously, the justice received free legal counsel for two years beginning in 2008 from the Wisconsin law firm of Michael Best &amp; Friedrich, which represented the state in defending the law.'b'The justice has a blatant conflict of interest: He owes money to a firm that got his vote in this and other cases. He should have agreed not to sit on any case where the law firm is involved until he pays what he owes.'b'His tawdry 'b'defense'b' is that he agreed to pay the firm if he won the case where it represented him, and if the state paid his bill, so the free counsel was not a gift. Evading payment unless he won is unjustifiable.'b'This is not Justice Gableman\xe2\x80\x99s first ethical breach. He won his seat in 2008 in a foul campaign against the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s only African-American, Louis Butler. Justice Gableman 'b'accused'b' Mr. Butler of having worked as a public defender \xe2\x80\x9cto put criminals on the street,\xe2\x80\x9d including by finding \xe2\x80\x9ca loophole\xe2\x80\x9d to release a girl\xe2\x80\x99s rapist.'b'In addition to playing to the fear and racism of some voters, the charge was false. The offender served his full sentence. In 2010, the Wisconsin court considered whether to sanction him under the state judicial code and split along the same ideological lines in a 3-to-3 vote without his. That meant he could not be disciplined for lying.'b'Now the justice claims it would be wrong for him to recuse himself because of \xe2\x80\x9cpartisan demands.\xe2\x80\x9d The prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s motion was directed to the full court, not only Justice Gableman, \xe2\x80\x9cin the interest of justice\xe2\x80\x9d under \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d To regain the public\xe2\x80\x99s trust, the court must disqualify him if he does not face up to his impropriety and recuse himself.'b'There is absolutely no excuse for the New York Police Department\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'decision to show a hate-filled film about Muslims'b' to more than 1,400 city police officers.'b'Relations between police and the diverse Muslim community are already tense after The Associated Press uncovered aggressive surveillance of Muslims, including American citizens. The propaganda of this film will only damage those relations further and make law enforcement more difficult.'b''b'The film'b' shows some of the grisliest jihadist terrorists attacks in recent years and argues that the real agenda for Islamists in America is to infiltrate and dominate the country. The department said at first that it was shown to only a handful of officers, but that proved to be false when the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University obtained police records through the courts after a nine-month struggle. Police documents show some confusion over where the film, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Third Jihad,\xe2\x80\x9d came from \xe2\x80\x94 possibly a contractor \xe2\x80\x94 and how it kept running for three months to a year in a conference area.'b'Paul Browne, a Police Department spokesman, said the officer responsible for making sure the film ran \xe2\x80\x9con a continuous loop\xe2\x80\x9d while officers were filling out papers has been disciplined. That is not remotely enough.'b'Mr. Browne said Commissioner Raymond Kelly found the film objectionable. Mr. Kelly should apologize for the film, which was financed and distributed by the conservative Clarion Fund, and he should make clear that his department does not tolerate such noxious and dangerous stereotyping.'b'A year ago, after the last State of the Union address, we applauded President Obama for challenging the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 blame-government, slash-and-burn rhetoric. He explained why Washington must do more to help put millions of struggling people back to work and why any credible plan to wrestle down the deficit must include the wealthy paying a fairer share of taxes.'b'After a rough start to 2011, economic numbers have improved, and Mr. Obama has pushed Congress to extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits and outlined an ambitious jobs agenda. But the country\xe2\x80\x99s problems are profound. There are 13.1 million unemployed, and the risk of stagnation is real. Republican candidates are pounding on the wrong, but seductive, notion that the real problem is government spending \xe2\x80\x94 especially on the \xe2\x80\x9cothers,\xe2\x80\x9d the poor and minorities. Congressional Republicans have barely wavered in their obstructionism.'b'Mr. Obama has become steadily more assertive, but he will have to push even harder. 'b'The State of the Union address'b' was a chance to do that, and he did not squander it.'b''b'He sounded many of the same themes'b' as last year, but his tone was sharper and he was far more willing to apportion blame, particularly singling out the financial industry for its excesses and politicians who are still determined to defend tax cuts for the rich and undo desperately needed financial regulations. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of Americans barely get by,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cor we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s talk of \xe2\x80\x9can economy built to last\xe2\x80\x9d was a bit too folksy, but he is right that the country can\xe2\x80\x99t rely on some invisible hand to develop a strategy to compete in the 21st century. Washington must do a lot more to create good jobs, to encourage new industries, to build the infrastructure to support a vibrant economy and to address climate change and promote energy independence.'b'The president\xe2\x80\x99s calls to deny tax breaks to companies that outsource and provide a tax credit to companies that bring jobs back home are good ones. The real challenge will be to ensure that those repatriated jobs are good-paying jobs. The president called for better job training and education, but a skills gap isn\xe2\x80\x99t the main problem. Employers aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to do a lot more hiring until consumers buy more products. Demand is unlikely to recover until Congress agrees to more federal spending, including aid to states for hiring.'b'Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s idea to use half of the savings from winding down the wars for public-works projects is laudable and could put hundreds of thousands back to work. Republicans are sure to insist that the money be used for deficit reduction, setting up another battle to simply do the obviously right thing. Mr. Obama has pushed banks and Congress to make it easier for borrowers who are current in their payments to refinance. On Tuesday night, he called \xe2\x80\x94 finally \xe2\x80\x94 for a full investigation of the lending abuses that inflated the bubble and led to the crash. That is the best hope for getting meaningful redress for borrowers.'b'In addition to his longstanding call to let the high-end Bush-era tax cuts expire, Mr. Obama called for a \xe2\x80\x9cBuffett rule\xe2\x80\x9d to ensure that millionaires pay an effective rate of at least 30 percent, ensuring that they never pay less than the middle class. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can call this class warfare all you want,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes? Most Americans would call that common sense.\xe2\x80\x9d We agree.'b'Over the last year, Americans have become more aware of the deep inequities in the economy and of the government\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to act. Mr. Obama deserves some of the credit for that, but it has a lot more to do with the unrelenting tough times and the efforts of Occupy Wall Street and other protests. What Americans want now is strong political leadership.'b'WASHINGTON'b'Sure, Mittens can be annoying.'b'Paying an infuriatingly low tax rate and stashing millions in Swiss banks and the Cayman Islands, like a John Grisham villain.

The proposal 'b'President Obama'b' 'b'announced'b' on Tuesday night in his 'b'State of the Union address'b' \xe2\x80\x94 to make such attendance compulsory in every state \xe2\x80\x94 is a step in the right direction, but it would not go far enough to reduce a dropout rate that imposes a heavy cost on the entire economy, not just on those who fail to obtain a diploma.'b'In 1970, the United States had the world\xe2\x80\x99s highest rate of high school and college graduation. Today, according to the 'b'Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development'b', we\xe2\x80\x99ve slipped to No. 21 in high school completion and No. 15 in college completion, as other countries surpassed us in the quality of their primary and secondary education.'b'Only 7 of 10 ninth graders today will get high school diplomas. A decade after the 'b'No Child Left Behind'b' law mandated efforts to reduce the racial gap, about 80 percent of white and Asian students graduate from high school, compared with only 55 percent of blacks and Hispanics.'b'Like President Obama, many reformers focus their dropout prevention efforts on high schoolers; replacing large high schools with smaller learning communities where poor students can get individualized instruction from dedicated teachers has been shown to be effective. Rigorous evidence gathered over decades suggests that some of the most promising approaches need to start even earlier: preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds, who are fed and taught in small groups, followed up with home visits by teachers and with group meetings of parents; reducing class size in the early grades; and increasing teacher salaries from kindergarten through 12th grade.'b'These programs sound expensive \xe2\x80\x94 some Americans probably think that preventing 1.3 million students from dropping out of high school each year can\xe2\x80\x99t be done \xe2\x80\x94 but in fact the costs of inaction are far greater.'b'High school completion is, of course, the most significant requirement for entering college. While our economic competitors are rapidly increasing graduation rates at both levels, we continue to fall behind. Educated workers are the basis of economic growth \xe2\x80\x94 they are especially critical as sources of innovation and productivity given the pace and nature of technological progress.'b'If we could reduce the current number of dropouts by just half, we would yield almost 700,000 new graduates a year, and it would more than pay for itself. Studies show that the typical high school graduate will obtain higher employment and earnings \xe2\x80\x94 an astonishing 50 percent to 100 percent increase in lifetime income \xe2\x80\x94 and will be less likely to draw on public money for health care and welfare and less likely to be involved in the criminal justice system. Further, because of the increased income, the typical graduate will contribute more in tax revenues over his lifetime than if he\xe2\x80\x99d dropped out.'b'When the costs of investment to produce a new graduate are taken into account, there is a return of $1.45 to $3.55 for every dollar of investment, depending upon the educational intervention strategy. Under this estimate, each new graduate confers a net benefit to taxpayers of about $127,000 over the graduate\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime. This is a benefit to the public of nearly $90 billion for each year of success in reducing the number of high school dropouts by 700,000 \xe2\x80\x94 or something close to $1 trillion after 11 years. That\xe2\x80\x99s real money \xe2\x80\x94 and a reason both liberals and conservatives should rally behind dropout prevention as an element of economic recovery, leaving aside the ethical dimensions of educating our young people.'b'Some might argue that these estimates are too large, that the relationships among the time-tested interventions, high school graduation rates and adult outcomes have not been proved yet on a large scale. Those are important considerations, but the evidence cannot be denied: increased education does, indeed, improve skill levels and help individuals to lead healthier and more productive lives. And despite the high unemployment rate today, we have every reason to believe that many of these new graduates would find work \xe2\x80\x94 our history is filled with sustained periods of economic growth when increasing numbers of young people obtained more schooling and received large economic benefits as a result.'b'Of course, there are other strategies for improving educational attainment \xe2\x80\x94 researchers learn more every day about which are effective and which are not. But even with what we know, a failure to substantially reduce the numbers of high school dropouts is demonstrably penny-wise and pound-foolish.'b'Proven educational strategies to increase high school completion, like high-quality preschool, provide returns to the taxpayer that are as much as three and a half times their cost. Investing our public dollars wisely to reduce the number of high school dropouts must be a central part of any strategy to raise long-run economic growth, reduce inequality and return fiscal health to our federal, state and local governments.'b'IN October 1998, British police officers arrested the Chilean general Augusto Pinochet while he was recuperating from back surgery at a London hospital. They were acting on an international warrant issued by the Spanish judge Baltasar Garz\xc3\xb3n seeking General Pinochet\xe2\x80\x99s extradition to stand trial in Spain on charges of torture and murder. After a 17-month legal battle, General Pinochet was released on medical grounds, but Judge Garz\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s warrant paved the way for stripping the former dictator of immunity and prosecuting him in Chile.'b'Since the Pinochet arrest, Judge Garz\xc3\xb3n has indicted human-rights violators around the world. His actions helped make it possible to prosecute expatriate Rwandans for their role in the 1994 genocide and Chad\xe2\x80\x99s former dictator, Hiss\xc3\xa8ne Habr\xc3\xa9, who was indicted for crimes against humanity by a Senegalese judge.'b'Yet Judge Garz\xc3\xb3n is now himself 'b'under legal attack'b' for confronting Spain\xe2\x80\x99s own dark history. He is on trial this week before the Spanish Supreme Court for daring to investigate crimes committed during the Spanish Civil War and the nearly four-decade dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco. The case against him is fueled by domestic political vendettas rather than substantive legal arguments and it could dramatically set back international efforts to hold human-rights violators accountable for their crimes.'b'In October 2008, in response to a petition from victims and relatives of those killed or tortured by Franco\xe2\x80\x99s forces, Judge Garz\xc3\xb3n ordered the exhumation of 19 mass graves and charged Franco and his accomplices posthumously with the murder and disappearance of more than 114,000 people.'b'Shortly after Judge Garz\xc3\xb3n issued his edict, Spain\xe2\x80\x99s chief prosecutor, Javier Zaragoza, challenged it, partly by claiming that it violated Spain\xe2\x80\x99s sweeping 1977 amnesty law. This law, which the United Nations Human Rights Committee has urged Spain to repeal, was passed after Franco\xe2\x80\x99s death in 1975 with the military\xe2\x80\x99s support and forbade the prosecution of any crime \xe2\x80\x9cof a political nature\xe2\x80\x9d committed during the Franco years.'b'An appellate court ruled against Judge Garz\xc3\xb3n in late 2008 and the case appeared to be resolved. But several months after the ruling, two tiny far-right groups sued Judge Garz\xc3\xb3n for \xe2\x80\x9cprevarication\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 knowingly overstepping his authority \xe2\x80\x94 in violating the amnesty law.'b'As international criticism grew, and supporters staged large protests backing Judge Garz\xc3\xb3n, the Supreme Court accepted two other spurious suits brought against him, despite the state prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to pursuing them.'b'Although Judge Garz\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s actions have always been controversial, they have been instrumental in the global fight against impunity. His pursuit of General Pinochet relied on universal jurisdiction, a legal principle asserting that heinous crimes like torture and genocide may be prosecuted in any country, regardless of who the victims or perpetrators were. Indeed, the current case against Judge Garz\xc3\xb3n shows just how necessary universal jurisdiction is when countries are unable to confront their own pasts.'b'Criminally charging judges for prevarication is extremely rare in Spain, and a conviction would disbar Judge Garz\xc3\xb3n for 20 years \xe2\x80\x94 effectively ending his career. The Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s zeal to try him has little legal basis; rather, it reflects Spanish elites\xe2\x80\x99 widespread unease with applying international legal principles to Spain\xe2\x80\x99s conflicted history and a deep-seated animosity toward Judge Garz\xc3\xb3n that is as much personal as political.'b'While the Supreme Court has many justices appointed by the rightist Partido Popular (founded by one of Franco\xe2\x80\x99s former ministers), Judge Garz\xc3\xb3n also has made powerful enemies on the left, because in the late 1980s he investigated government-backed death squads created to battle the Basque separatist group ETA. His findings helped bring down a Socialist government in 1996.'b'Judge Garz\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s prosecution has already had a chilling effect on worldwide efforts to hold human-rights violators accountable, and a conviction would be interpreted as an even stronger warning sign. According to Reed Brody of Human Rights Watch, the Haitian judge Carv\xc3\xa8s Jean is following Judge Garz\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s legal travails intently as he deliberates whether to indict Jean-Claude Duvalier for crimes against humanity or to adhere to Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations, which would place those crimes off limits.'b'More disturbingly, due to Judge Garz\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s legal woes, the case brought by Franco\xe2\x80\x99s victims and their families is now languishing. (The only exception is in Argentina, where a prominent human-rights lawyer, using universal jurisdiction, recently filed suit charging Franco with crimes against humanity.)'b'In his 2005 memoir, Judge Garz\xc3\xb3n wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cA system built on the corpses of those who are still awaiting justice so they can rest in peace is an illegitimate system and one that is condemned to eventually suffer the same fate.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It would send a tragic and telling message to those victims \xe2\x80\x94 and others like them around the world \xe2\x80\x94 if the one person convicted for Franco\xe2\x80\x99s crimes is the judge who dared to investigate them.'b'These are fragments of David Kato, glimpses of a Ugandan activist and friend who \xe2\x80\x93 one year ago today \xe2\x80\x93 was brutally murdered. These moments offer a perspective on the inner world that David shared with us, a world teeming with passion and relentless determination, good humor and vivid daydreams.'b'During our first days in Kampala, a member of Parliament told us, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no longer a debate in Uganda as to whether homosexuality is right or not \xe2\x80\x93 it is not.\xe2\x80\x9d From what we knew of the pending Anti-Homosexuality Bill \xe2\x80\x93 which proposed death for H.I.V.-positive gay men and prison for anyone who failed to turn in a known homosexual \xe2\x80\x93 we were tempted to believe him.'b'But David showed us a different reality. Initially, he played something of a fixer, our main liaison with the L.G.B.T., or \xe2\x80\x9ckuchu\xe2\x80\x9d community. We soon realized, however, that the man known as the \xe2\x80\x9cgrandfather of the kuchus\xe2\x80\x9d was one of the most outspoken and inspired activists in East Africa. The more time we spent documenting his work, the more evident it became that, contrary to the M.P.\xe2\x80\x99s claim, David and his fellow activists were, in fact, generating real debate in Uganda. Kampala\xe2\x80\x99s kuchus had begun to dismantle the country\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory status quo, and were working tirelessly to change their fate and that of others across Africa.'b'Today, as we revisit our memories of David, we remember his fortitude and remarkable legal achievements, boldly guided by his vision of establishing a Ugandan gay village. But perhaps most of all we recall these words, spoken with more logic than defiance: \xe2\x80\x9cIf we keep on hiding, they will say we are not here.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In 'b'the State of the Union address'b', President Obama promised a fresh investigation into mortgage abuses that led to the financial meltdown. The goal, he said, is to \xe2\x80\x9chold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Could this be it, finally? An investigation that results in clarity, big fines and maybe even jail time?'b'There is good reason to be skeptical. To date, federal civil suits over mortgage wrongdoing have been narrowly focused and, at best, ended with settlements and fines that are a fraction of the profits made during the bubble. There have been no criminal prosecutions against major players. Justice Department officials say that it reflects the difficulty of proving fraud \xe2\x80\x94 and not a lack of prosecutorial zeal. That is hard to swallow, given the scale of the crisis and the evidence of wrongdoing from private litigation, academic research and other sources.'b'This new investigation could be the real thing. Eric Schneiderman, the New York State attorney general, will be a co-chairman of the group, and he has refused to support a settlement being worked out between big banks most responsible for foreclosure abuses and federal agencies and some state attorneys general.'b''b'He rightly objected'b' to the fact that in exchange for providing some $20 billion worth of mortgage relief \xe2\x80\x94 mainly by reducing the principal on homeowners\xe2\x80\x99 loans \xe2\x80\x94 the banks wanted release from legal claims that have never been fully investigated, including those related to potential tax, trust and securities violations in mortgage loans.'b'In the past year, the Obama administration has pushed back against Mr. Schneiderman, even as other attorneys general also left the settlement talks. By choosing him now to help run the investigation, the president appears to be embracing the call for a much broader inquiry that, properly executed, could result in a far bigger settlement.'b'For now, the administration is saying that the new investigation and the settlement talks will both proceed. It would be better to settle with the banks only after officials have a full picture of any and all violations.'b'There are reasons to be wary. Some of the federal officials who will also be involved with the investigation \xe2\x80\x94 including Eric Holder Jr., the United States attorney general, and Lanny Breuer, 'b'the leader of the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s criminal division'b', who will be a co-chairman \xe2\x80\x94 have not distinguished themselves in the pursuit of mortgage fraud.'b'To win and retain public trust, both the administration and all the group\xe2\x80\x99s co-chairmen \xe2\x80\x94 there are also four other officials from the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service \xe2\x80\x94 must agree on several steps immediately.'b'The administration must ensure that the group has ample resources. The co-chairmen must hire a tough-as-nails prosecutor with a successful track record in financial fraud to drive the investigation forward. And the group must move quickly and vigorously, issuing subpoenas and filing cases. It is not starting from scratch; various agencies have all had separate investigations under way.'b'President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s credibility is on the line. To restore public faith in the financial system, nothing less than a full investigation and full accountability will do.'b'The Supreme Court 'b'ruled'b' unanimously on Monday that the police violated the Constitution when they hid a Global Positioning System tracking device on the car of Antoine Jones and monitored his movements for 28 days. 'b'It put law enforcement on notice'b' that most GPS electronic surveillance will be suspect without a judge\xe2\x80\x99s warrant.'b'As welcome as the ruling was, the court left too many questions unanswered. It did not say how long this kind of surveillance can go on before requiring a warrant or what types of crimes justify GPS monitoring. It did not say what the rule would be if the police had tracked Mr. Jones with a technology not hidden on his car.'b'The view of a five-justice majority is that the ancient legal concept of trespass is sufficient to prohibit the intrusion in this case. But a persuasive concurring opinion for four justices makes plain why that concept is unsuitable for addressing 21st-century technology. The result is a narrow holding: It upholds the overturning of Mr. Jones\xe2\x80\x99s conviction for distributing cocaine. But the police could argue that a warrant is unnecessary for short-term GPS surveillance or, more importantly, for monitoring that involves no physical intrusion and might well win.'b'Justice Antonin Scalia wrote the majority opinion that says that the police\xe2\x80\x99s action of putting the GPS device on Mr. Jones\xe2\x80\x99s car and using it to monitor the car\xe2\x80\x99s movements constitutes a search the same as entering his house without being invited and violates the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition against unlawful searches and seizures as it is \xe2\x80\x9ctied to common-law trespass.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Justice Samuel Alito Jr. in the concurring opinion properly focuses instead on the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable expectation of privacy\xe2\x80\x9d the court has used as its standard since 'b'1967'b', explaining why GPS technology \xe2\x80\x94 which makes \xe2\x80\x9clong-term monitoring relatively easy and cheap\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 requires thinking differently about what\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable.'b'His opinion explains convincingly why Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the idea of trespass fails the same way the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning failed in early cases about wiretapping: The court 'b'found'b' no violations when taps were made on wires near, not in, houses targeted. Similarly, if cars were to include GPS tracking devices as smartphones now do, the majority holding \xe2\x80\x9cwould provide no protection\xe2\x80\x9d against using the devices for surveillance.'b'The full court recognized the intrusion on Mr. Jones\xe2\x80\x99s right to privacy. A majority of the justices also recognized the wider threat to citizens\xe2\x80\x99 privacy from this and other new technologies. Regrettably, their understanding is not reflected in the narrow holding.'b'Gov. Andrew Cuomo has proposed allowing the New York City system, instead of the state system, to begin handling all but the most dangerous juvenile offenders. This is an excellent idea in principle, but the city and state must make sure that the quality of services is high and that a detailed plan is in place before they put this new policy into effect in the fall.'b'The state juvenile system has long been known for excessive violence, inadequate psychiatric services and high recidivism. Gladys Carri\xc3\xb3n, 'b'the commissioner'b' of the Office of Children and Family Services, has closed more than a dozen facilities, while encouraging localities to treat low-risk offenders in community-based programs.'b'Cities and counties have embraced the idea. A result is that the number of young people held by the state has plummeted from about 2,300 in 2000 to about 600 today, including about 230 that will end up in the city\xe2\x80\x99s custody. That said, the low-risk youths in state custody have a complex array of problems and a great need for counseling and psychiatric services.'b'Under Governor Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, the state would redirect money to the city so that it could arrange care, including confinement, for less serious offenders. The new regime is expected to reap only modest savings. But city officials say they will be using nonprofit agencies that have lower personnel costs \xe2\x80\x94 and already provide the necessary services. Critics worry that nonprofit groups are not up to the job and that the new program will devolve into a patronage handout system. That must not be allowed to happen.'b'When you pay $100,000 for a red-hot BMW M5, you expect the twin-turbo V8 to emit a mighty song. Those who drive this superbrutal version of the midsize BMW are not generally in search of silence. And a nudge on the accelerator fills the cabin with a richly satisfying ascent from low rumble to high scream. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a recording, a virtual roar.'b'I was stunned when I first learned in the December issue of Automobile magazine that the sound you hear inside a 2013 M5 will be coming from its speakers, and, to judge by subsequent letters and Web chatter, I am not alone. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it! A car that lip-synchs!\xe2\x80\x9d moaned one correspondent.'b'The sound doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even come from a microphone in the engine compartment, which would make some perverse sense, but from a digital recording: \xe2\x80\x9ca discreet soundtrack in keeping with the harmonious and assured characteristics of the V8 power plant,\xe2\x80\x9d BMW explains in its literature. Stomping on the gas pedal, the Bavarians continue, \xe2\x80\x9cprompts an immediate audible response to match the instantaneous \xe2\x80\x94 and typically M \xe2\x80\x94 burst of power from beneath the bonnet.\xe2\x80\x9d They call it Active Sound Design.'b'I tried to put this in perspective. We all know that much of what we hear in life is not really so. Canned laughter and \xe2\x80\x9csweetened\xe2\x80\x9d applause have been TV staples for decades, and all the slamming doors, breaking glass and squealing tires you hear in movies are sound effects. (I always notice when they have tires squealing on dirt roads.)\xc2\xa0'b'Natalie Wood doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually sing \xe2\x80\x9cI Feel Pretty\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cWest Side Story.\xe2\x80\x9d When recording artists go flat, electronics get them back on tune, and Broadway theaters use wireless mics. Our daily life is filled with electronic pianos, ring tones, the disembodied voice giving you your bank balance over the telephone. Even silence can be electronic, courtesy of sound-canceling headphones.'b'I remember visiting the East-West German border at the Fulda Gap before the Wall came down. That was where the Soviet tanks were supposed to come rushing in at the outbreak of World War III, and the guards on both sides put on a great show of preparedness. I was on the West German side. And from the East, I kept hearing roosters crowing and dogs barking.'b'After a while, I realized that it was the same crowing and barking at intervals. It was a recording. The East German side was a no-man\xe2\x80\x99s land, and the intention was apparently to make visitors believe all was well over there.'b'Of course, the BMW\xe2\x80\x99s engine recording is really what you would hear if the car did not have extraordinary sound insulation.'b'And I can appreciate BMW\xe2\x80\x99s quandary. Buyers of powerful cars place a high premium on the \xe2\x80\x9cexhaust note,\xe2\x80\x9d and manufacturers spend a lot of money getting it right. At the same time, high-end cars are expected to filter out the sounds of the mundane world. BMW might further argue that electronics are taking over many other functions. Stability control that helps control a car during a skid. Screens that mimic mechanical speedometers.'b'So why is Active Sound Design so surprising? For one thing, the electronic driving aids and displays make no pretense about what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing. Recorded engine sounds, however, are a deliberate deception. They\xe2\x80\x99re like going to a concert and listening to a recording. On the other hand, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind buying a BMW recording and installing it in my \xe2\x80\x9996 Jeep Cherokee.'b'In November, a terrified 13-year-old girl pounded on an apartment door in Brooklyn. When a surprised woman answered, the girl pleaded for a phone. She called her mother, and then dialed 911.'b'The girl, whom I\xe2\x80\x99ll call Baby Face because of her looks, frantically told police that a violent pimp was selling her for sex. He had taken her to the building and ordered her to go to an apartment where a customer was waiting, she said, and now he was waiting downstairs to make sure she did not escape. She had followed the pimp\xe2\x80\x99s directions and gone upstairs, but then had pounded randomly on this door in hopes of getting help.'b'Baby Face said she hurt too much to endure yet another rape by a john. She told prosecutors later that she was bleeding vaginally and that her pimp had recently kicked her down a stairwell for trying to flee.'b'That 911 call set in motion 'b'the arrest of Kendale Judge'b', then 21. Judge has pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking, kidnapping, rape and compelling prostitution. He is in jail, and we haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard his side of the events yet.'b'The episode also shines a spotlight on how the girl was marketed \xe2\x80\x94 in ads on 'b'Backpage.com'b', a major national Web site where people place ads to sell all kinds of things, including sex. It is a godsend to pimps, allowing customers to order a girl online as if she were a pizza.'b'Lauren Hersh, the ace prosecutor in Brooklyn who leads the sex-trafficking unit there, says that of the 32 people she and her team have prosecuted in the last year and a half \xe2\x80\x94 typically involving victims aged 12 to 25 \xe2\x80\x94 a vast majority of the cases included girls marketed through Backpage ads.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPimps are turning to the Internet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hersh. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re not putting the girls on the street so much. Backpage is a great vehicle for pimps trying to sell girls.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Craigslist backed out of this sector 'b'after public protests'b'. Pimps then moved to 'b'Backpage.com'b', which is owned by Village Voice Media, owners of The Village Voice weekly newspaper.'b'Attorneys general from 48 states wrote a joint letter to Backpage, warning that it had become \xe2\x80\x9ca hub\xe2\x80\x9d for sex trafficking and calling on it to stop running adult services ads. The attorneys general said that they had identified cases in 22 different states in which pimps peddled underage girls through Backpage.'b'The attorneys general cited a 15-year-old girl who was being forced to have sex with men last year in Dorchester, Mass. The pimp marketed the girl through Backpage.'b'But Backpage isn\xe2\x80\x99t budging. Indeed, it has fought back with personal attacks on those, 'b'such as Ashton Kutcher'b', who have linked it to human trafficking.'b'Steve Suskin, legal counsel to Village Voice Media, 'b'gave me a lengthy statement'b' in which he argued that the company is already cooperating closely with law-enforcement authorities. He cited a 16-year-old girl in Seattle who was rescued as a result of a tip the company had made.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCensorship will not rid the world of exploitation,\xe2\x80\x9d Suskin asserted.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s true that there\xe2\x80\x99s some risk that pimps will migrate to new Web sites, possibly based overseas, that are less cooperative. But, on balance, that\xe2\x80\x99s a risk worth taking. The present system is failing. Pimps aren\xe2\x80\x99t the shrewdest marketers, and eliminating a hub for trafficking should at least chip away at the problem.'b'Backpage suggests that it is battling censors and prudes. In fact, what drives it seems to be greed. In their letter, the attorneys general said that Backpage earns 'b'more than $22 million annually'b' from prostitution advertising.'b'On Backpage, the pimps claim adult ages for the girls they market, but Hersh scoffs. \xe2\x80\x9cI see 19,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I immediately think 13.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not seeing a lot of cases where there\xe2\x80\x99s not coercion,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cThe average age where a girl is forced into prostitution is 12 to 14. And most of these 16- or 17 year-olds are being run by pretty vicious pimps.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'While there are no reliable figures for human trafficking, the more we look, the more we find. The Brooklyn district attorney, 'b'Charles J. Hynes'b', says that in the year before he set up a sex-trafficking unit in June 2010, his office prosecuted no trafficking cases. Since then, the office has become a national model, indicting 32 people, with 10 convictions and no acquittals so far.'b'Among those rescued was Baby Face, who had run away from home in September. Judge allegedly found her on the street, bought food for her and told her that she was beautiful. Within a few days, he had posted her photo on Backpage and was selling her five to nine times a day, prosecutors say. When she didn\xe2\x80\x99t earn enough money, he beat her with a belt, they add.'b'When Baby Face ran away from her pimp and desperately knocked on that apartment door in Brooklyn, she was also in effect pounding on the door of the executive suites of Backpage and Village Voice Media. Those executives should listen to her pleas.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'How U.S. Lost Out on iPhone Work'b'\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c'b'In China, the Human Costs That Are Built Into an iPad'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cThe iEconomy\xe2\x80\x9d series, front page, Jan. 22 and 26):'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s ironic and disheartening that the company that set out to change the world could accomplish the task only by employing vendors who subject workers to slave-labor wages and an Orwellian work environment.'b'With all due respect to the late, great Steve Jobs, if the famous 1984 Super Bowl commercial for Apple were reshot, the image of Big Brother on the giant screen might fittingly be his own.'b'In stark contrast to its counterculture origins, Apple seems to have evolved into the embodiment of everything it once despised \xe2\x80\x94 a greedy, callous, ruthless behemoth beholden only to fund managers who demand incremental profits every quarter at any cost.'b'BRUCE SILVERMAN'b' Minneapolis, Jan. 26, 2012'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'I\xe2\x80\x99m grateful that American workers do not have the \xe2\x80\x9cflexibility\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdiligence\xe2\x80\x9d of those who are manufacturing our electronics overseas.'b'Your articles and other investigations of the Foxconn plant in China where Apple products are made have noted terrible conditions there: under-age workers; a rash of suicide attempts by employees; workers stuffed into overcrowded dormitories; serious injuries and even death as a result of poor safety standards.'b'If we don\xe2\x80\x99t want workers\xe2\x80\x99 lives to look like this, we can\xe2\x80\x99t be unscrupulous as consumers.'b'I can pay more for humanely produced beef.

Service'b' Mount Sinai Medical Center'b' New York, Jan. 18, 2012'b''b''b''b'Mitch Daniels, the former Bush budget director who is now Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s governor, made the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 reply to President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union address. His performance was, well, boring. But he did say something thought-provoking \xe2\x80\x94 and I mean that in the worst way.'b'For Mr. Daniels tried to wrap his party in the mantle of the late Steve Jobs, whom he portrayed as a great job creator \xe2\x80\x94 which is one thing that Jobs definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. And if we ask why Apple has created so few American jobs, we get an insight into what is wrong with the ideology dominating much of our politics.'b'Mr. Daniels first berated the president for his \xe2\x80\x9cconstant disparagement of people in business,\xe2\x80\x9d which happens to be a complete fabrication. Mr. Obama has never done anything of the sort. He went on: \xe2\x80\x9cThe late Steve Jobs \xe2\x80\x94 what a fitting name he had \xe2\x80\x94 created more of them than all those stimulus dollars the president borrowed and blew.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Clearly, Mr. Daniels doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have much of a future in the humor business. But, more to the point, anyone who reads The New York Times knows that his assertion about job creation was completely false: Apple employs very few people in this country.'b''b'A big report'b' in The Times last Sunday laid out the facts. Although Apple is now America\xe2\x80\x99s biggest U.S. corporation as measured by market value, it employs only 43,000 people in the United States, a tenth as many as General Motors employed when it was the largest American firm.'b'Apple does, however, indirectly employ around 700,000 people in its various suppliers. Unfortunately, almost none of those people are in America.'b'Why does Apple manufacture abroad, and especially in China? As the article explained, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just about low wages. China also derives big advantages from the fact that so much of the supply chain is already there. A former Apple executive explained: \xe2\x80\x9cYou need a thousand rubber gaskets? That\xe2\x80\x99s the factory next door. You need a million screws? That factory is a block away.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is familiar territory to students of 'b'economic geography'b': the advantages of industrial clusters \xe2\x80\x94 in which producers, specialized suppliers, and workers huddle together to their mutual benefit \xe2\x80\x94 have been a running theme since the 19th century.'b'And Chinese manufacturing isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only conspicuous example of these advantages in the modern world. Germany remains a highly successful exporter even with workers who cost, on average, $44 an hour \xe2\x80\x94 much more than the average cost of American workers. And this success has a lot to do with the support its small and medium-sized companies \xe2\x80\x94 the famed Mittelstand \xe2\x80\x94 provide to each other via shared suppliers and the maintenance of a skilled work force.'b'The point is that successful companies \xe2\x80\x94 or, at any rate, companies that make a large contribution to a nation\xe2\x80\x99s economy \xe2\x80\x94 don\xe2\x80\x99t exist in isolation. Prosperity depends on the synergy between companies, on the cluster, not the individual entrepreneur.'b'But the current Republican worldview has no room for such considerations. From the G.O.P.\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, it\xe2\x80\x99s all about the heroic entrepreneur, the John Galt, I mean Steve Jobs-type \xe2\x80\x9cjob creator\xe2\x80\x9d who showers benefits on the rest of us and who must, of course, be rewarded with tax rates lower than those paid by many middle-class workers.'b'And this vision helps explain why Republicans were so furiously opposed to the single most successful policy initiative of recent years: the auto industry bailout.'b'The case for this bailout \xe2\x80\x94 which Mr. Daniels has denounced as \xe2\x80\x9ccrony capitalism\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 rested crucially on the notion that the survival of any one firm in the industry depended on the survival of the broader industry \xe2\x80\x9cecology\xe2\x80\x9d created by the cluster of producers and suppliers in America\xe2\x80\x99s industrial heartland. If G.M. and Chrysler had been allowed to go under, they would probably have taken much of the supply chain with them \xe2\x80\x94 and Ford would have gone the same way.'b'Fortunately, the Obama administration didn\xe2\x80\x99t let that happen, and the unemployment rate in Michigan, which hit 14.1 percent as the bailout was going into effect, is now down to a still-terrible-but-much-better 9.3 percent. And the details aside, much of Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union address can be read as an attempt to apply the lessons of that success more broadly.'b'So we should be grateful to Mr. Daniels for his remarks Tuesday. He got his facts wrong, but he did, unintentionally, manage to highlight an important philosophical difference between the parties. One side believes that economies succeed solely thanks to heroic entrepreneurs; the other has nothing against entrepreneurs, but believes that entrepreneurs need a supportive environment, and that sometimes government has to help create or sustain that supportive environment.'b'And the view that it takes more than business heroes is the one that fits the facts.'b'The Simpson-Bowles report wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just a policy document. For a few months, it expanded the national debate. Everybody seemed to realize that the country was beset by large challenges that could no longer be neglected: soaring debt, lagging growth, wage stagnation, family breakdown, political dysfunction.'b'Suddenly, there was a sense of urgency. There were grand plans coming from all directions.'b'A bipartisan group of 65 senators gathered to think about government afresh. 'b'The Times had a fantastic online budget calculator'b' to let readers reinvent government according to their own priorities.'b'The Peter G. Peterson Foundation asked six think tanks from across the political spectrum to offer fiscal solutions. The proposals teemed with big ideas: fundamental tax reform that would simplify the code and boost growth; fundamental entitlement reform to restrain cost; doubling spending on science, pre-K education and adult retraining; taxing fossil fuels to spur innovation; shifting from a consumption-led to an investment-led economy.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s sad to compare that era of bigness to the medium-sized policy morsels that President Obama put in his State of the Union address. He had some big themes in the speech, but the policies were mere appetizers. The Republicans absurdly call Obama a European socialist on the stump, but the Obama we saw Tuesday night was a liberal incrementalist.'b'There was nothing big, like tax reform or entitlement reform. There was no comprehensive effort to restore trust in government by sweeping away the tax credits and special-interest schemes that entangle Washington. Ninety percent of American workers work in the service economy, but Obama spoke mostly about manufacturing.'b'Instead, there were a series of modest proposals that poll well. In that sense, it was the Democratic version of Newt Gingrich\xe2\x80\x99s original \xe2\x80\x9cContract With America\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a series of medium-size ideas with 80 percent approval ratings.'b'Some of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s ideas are outstanding. Presidential nominees should get an up-or-down vote within 90 days. We should connect community colleges more closely with labor markets. We should raise the income tax rates for millionaires back to Clinton-era levels. We should responsibly promote fracking to develop natural gas.'b'Some of the ideas were lamentable. Instead of simplifying the tax code, Obama would muddy it up with more tax loopholes for corporations as long as they conformed to this or that industrial policy.'b'Some of the ideas were just inexplicable. Is the government really going to defund Ivy League science labs if Ivy League colleges raise their tuitions?'b'But the core point is that these policies are incremental, not transformational. You could pass them all and the country might be slightly better off or slightly worse off, but it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be on a different trajectory.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s odd that an administration that once wanted to do everything all at once now should be so gradualist. Maybe its members were scarred by the traumas of health care and the 2010 election. Maybe they just want to win the election, so every policy has to be politically easy instead of politically challenging.'b'Maybe the president\xe2\x80\x99s aides believe that most of our problems are overhyped. I have heard them hint that in dozens of interviews. To balance the budget, we only need to bend revenues and taxes a bit. To compete with China, we only need to shift the playing field a bit.'b'Maybe the president\xe2\x80\x99s cautious tendencies are just coming out.'b'In normal times, that sober, incremental approach would be admirable. In normal times, the best sort of change is gradual, flexible and constant. But these are not normal times. This is not Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s second term, or Eisenhower\xe2\x80\x99s. The fiscal train wreck is coming. The current U.S. growth model is insufficient. The American family and the American political system are cracking up.'b'Legislatively, the president has to build a center-left governing majority that can overwhelm those Republicans who will never support him. That can be done only with ground-shifting policies. Politically, the president has to resonate with voters who feel the country is on the wrong track. Prudentially, the president has to prepare for the likelihood that the economy is going to hit another rough patch this year \xe2\x80\x94 if Greece leaves the euro or if the French banks implode or if the Iranian crisis comes to a head. If any of that happens, the desire for profound change would be overwhelming and the candidate with a few carefully targeted tax credits would get blown away.'b'This election is about averting national decline. The president is making a mistake in ceding the size advantage to the Republicans. The Republicans at least speak with epic alarm about the nation\xe2\x80\x99s problems. They are unified behind big tax and welfare state reforms that would purge Washington and shake things up.'b'The president is making a mistake in running a Sunset Boulevard campaign: I am big; it\xe2\x80\x99s my presidency that got small.'b'Davos, Switzerland'b'IS 20th-century capitalism failing 21st-century society? Members of the global elite debated that unusual question on Wednesday at the annual 'b'World Economic Forum'b'.'b'There was a time, not long ago, when such a debate would have been held only among the protesters who annually shelter in igloos farther down the Alpine slopes. So it is encouraging that more than three years since the global financial crisis, a belated process of soul-searching has begun in search of the right lessons to learn from it.\xc2\xa0'b'In Britain, members of the Conservative-led government \xe2\x80\x94 not least the prime minister, David Cameron \xe2\x80\x94 have echoed the Labour Party\xe2\x80\x99s call for a more responsible capitalism.'b'There is a great difference, however, between being willing to talk about an issue and being ready to act.'b'It is a difference between those who still believe that all governments can do is get out of the way and those who believe there is a real role for governments in first reviving our economies, and then setting the right rules for future success. The challenge therefore is not just to capitalism but also to politics.'b'At the Group of 20 summit in London three years ago, Prime Minister Gordon Brown and 'b'President Obama'b' led concerted action to guide the world economy from the brink. Three years later, some governments are engaging in a short-sighted fiscal protectionism that can only lead to stunted growth.'b'If we learned anything from the 1930s, it was that governments cannot shrug their shoulders and watch as their own people are consigned to unemployment. I find it tragic and astonishing that some governments need to learn this lesson again.'b'Nor should we forget the causes of the current growth and debt crisis as we seek to put our economies on a more sustainable footing.\xc2\xa0'b'Both the United States and Britain suffered because their economies were overly reliant on the financial sector\xe2\x80\x99s artificial profits; living standards for the many worsened while the economic rewards skewed\xc2\xa0to the top 1 percent; a capitalist model encouraged short-term decision-making oriented toward quarterly profits rather than long-term health; and vested interests \xe2\x80\x94 from giant banks to media moguls \xe2\x80\x94were deemed too big to fail or too powerful to challenge.'b'We need to recognize that the trickle-down promise of conservative theorists has turned into a gravity-defying reality in which wealth has flowed upward disproportionately and, too often, undeservedly. To address properly the squeeze in middle-class incomes on both sides of the Atlantic requires fresh thinking from governments about how people train for their working lives and what a living wage should be.'b'Governments can set better \xe2\x80\x94 not necessarily more \xe2\x80\x94 rules to encourage productive businesses that invest, invent, train, make and sell real products and services. We need rules that discourage the predatory behavior of those seeking the fast buck through hostile takeovers and asset-stripping that do not have the interests of the shareholders, the employees or the economy at heart. \xc2\xa0In Britain, the Labour Party is considering how we can raise the bar for corporate takeovers so that companies\xe2\x80\x99 futures are not determined by\xc2\xa0just a handful of speculators.'b'And governments must remember they are elected to serve the people, not the powerful lobbies who can pay for access or influence. Too often the real enemies of market capitalism are some of the leading beneficiaries of the current model, which favors price-gouging cartels and consumer exploitation. In Britain, airlines need to be more upfront about\xc2\xa0 the true cost of their fares, and pension firms cannot continue to sign up customers for products that can chip away at their retirement income through exorbitant management fees.'b'As President Obama noted in his 'b'State of the Union address'b' on Tuesday, it is neither socially nor economically sustainable for the wealthiest and most powerful to avoid paying their fair share. I support proposals for a financial transactions tax levied equally on the major trading centers from Hong Kong and Singapore to Wall Street and the City of London. The British government needs to show more leadership on this issue in Europe \xe2\x80\x94 and all members of G-20 need to help make it happen.'b'Britain loses billions of pounds in revenues because of outdated rules that allow our richest citizens to keep their money in off-shore tax havens. Tax authorities need to know about income and wealth hidden behind front companies, trusts and other complex financial products. If these rules cannot be changed by international agreement, progressive governments should go ahead and do it themselves.'b'As President Obama said in his State of the Union address this week, it is \xe2\x80\x9ccommon sense\xe2\x80\x9d to ask a billionaire to pay, proportionally, at least as much as his secretary in taxes. Indeed, in Davos this week, I will look around the room and ask myself who pays taxes at a higher rate \xe2\x80\x94 those eating the soup or those serving it?\xc2\xa0'b'In my country, I believe that changing the rules of capitalism will mean a change of government. But more generally, it will require a change in what citizens expect and ask of politics. The question is not so much whether 20th-century capitalism is failing 21st-century society but whether politics can rise to the challenge of changing a flawed economic model.'b'SANTA CRUZ, Calif.'b'IT\xe2\x80\x99S time to acknowledge the foreign policy disaster that American support for the 'b'Porfirio Lobo'b' administration in 'b'Honduras'b' has become. Ever since the June 28, 2009, coup that deposed Honduras\xe2\x80\x99s democratically elected president, 'b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Manuel Zelaya'b', the country has been descending deeper into a human rights and security abyss. That abyss is in good part the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s making.'b'The headlines have been full of horror stories about Honduras. According to the United Nations, it now has the world\xe2\x80\x99s highest murder rate, and San Pedro Sula, its second city, is more dangerous than Ciudad Ju\xc3\xa1rez, Mexico, a center for drug cartel violence.'b'Much of the press in the United States has attributed this violence solely to drug trafficking and gangs. But the coup was what threw open the doors to a huge increase in drug trafficking and violence, and it unleashed a continuing wave of state-sponsored repression.'b'The current government of President Lobo won power in a November 2009 election managed by the same figures who had initiated the coup. Most opposition candidates withdrew in protest, and all major international observers boycotted the election, except for the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute, which are financed by the United States.'b''b'President Obama'b' quickly recognized Mr. Lobo\xe2\x80\x99s victory, even when most of Latin America would not. Mr. Lobo\xe2\x80\x99s government is, in fact, a child of the coup. It retains most of the military figures who perpetrated the coup, and no one has gone to jail for starting it.'b'This chain of events \xe2\x80\x94 a coup that the United States didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop, a fraudulent election that it accepted \xe2\x80\x94 has now allowed corruption to mushroom. The judicial system hardly functions. Impunity reigns. At least 34 members of the opposition have disappeared or been killed, and more than 300 people have been killed by state security forces since the coup, according to the leading human rights organization 'b'Cofadeh'b'. At least 13 journalists have been killed since Mr. Lobo took office, according to the 'b'Committee to Protect Journalists'b'.'b'The police in Tegucigalpa, the capital, are believed to have killed the son of Julieta Castellanos, the rector of the country\xe2\x80\x99s biggest university, along with a friend of his, on Oct. 22, 2011. Top police officials quickly admitted their suspects were police officers, 'b'\n'b' but failed to immediately detain them. When prominent figures came forward to charge that the police are riddled with death squads and drug traffickers, the most famous accuser was a former police commissioner, Alfredo Landaverde. He was assassinated on Dec. 7. Only now has the government begun to make significant arrests of police officers.'b'State-sponsored repression continues. According to Cofadeh, at least 43 campesino activists participating in land struggles in the Agu\xc3\xa1n Valley have been killed in the past two and a half years at the hands of the police, the military and the private security army of Miguel Facuss\xc3\xa9. Mr. Facuss\xc3\xa9 is mentioned in United States Embassy cables made public by WikiLeaks as the richest man in the country, a big supporter of the post-coup regime and owner of land used to transfer cocaine.'b'And yet, in early October, Mr. Obama praised Mr. Lobo at the White House for leadership in a \xe2\x80\x9crestoration of democratic practices.\xe2\x80\x9d Since the coup the United States has maintained and in some areas increased military and police financing for Honduras and has been enlarging its military bases there, according to an analysis by the 'b'Fellowship of Reconciliation'b'. Congress, though, has finally begun to push back. Last May, 87 members signed a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton calling for a suspension of military and police aid to Honduras. Representative Howard L. Berman of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, wrote to her on Nov. 28, asking whether the United States was arming a dangerous regime. And in December, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and others obtained conditions on a small portion of the 2012 police and military aid appropriated for Honduras.'b'\n'b''b'Why has the State Department thrown itself behind the Lobo administration despite brutal evidence of the regime\xe2\x80\x99s corruption? In part because it has caved in to the Cuban-American constituency of Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the Republican chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and her allies. They have been ferocious about Honduras as a first domino with which to push back against the line of center-left and leftist governments that have won elections in Latin America in the past 15 years. With its American air base, Honduras is also crucial to the United States\xe2\x80\x99 military strategy in Latin America.'b'As Honduras plunges into a tragic abyss, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to finally cut off all police and military aid. \xe2\x80\x9cStop feeding the beast\xe2\x80\x9d is the way Ms. Castellanos, the academician whose son was killed, puts it. She, like other human rights advocates, insists that the Lobo government cannot reform itself.'b'The State Department is beginning to help address the situation behind the scenes. But Honduran human-rights activists, along with many of us in the United States who care about Honduras, do not believe that this administration can, or should, manage a cleanup of the very cesspool it helped to create by supporting a government that owes its power to a coup.'b'Instead, we need to respect proposals for alternative approaches that Honduran human-rights advocates and the opposition are beginning to formulate. These come from people who are still fighting against the coup and who continue to risk paying the price of being shot dead by state security forces.'b'They, not the State Department, have the right to lead their country forward.'b'Under the federal lobbying law, Newt Gingrich can legitimately claim that he is not a lobbyist. That alone demonstrates how much the law needs to be changed.'b'As his rival for the Republican presidential nomination, Mitt Romney, regularly and correctly points out, Mr. Gingrich has made a great deal of money in Washington peddling his influence, while carefully staying about half-an-inch short of the legal definition of lobbyist. He is only one of thousands of people in Washington\xe2\x80\x99s influence industry who skirt the common-sense definition of lobbying by taking advantage of the law\xe2\x80\x99s loopholes.'b'The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 has three tests: 1) Do you make more than $3,000 over three months from lobbying? 2) Have you had more than one lobbying contact? 3) Have you spent more than 20 percent of your time lobbying for a single client over three months?'b'Only a person who has met all three tests must register as a lobbyist. So a former lawmaker who has many lobbying contacts and makes $1 million a year lobbying but has no single client who takes up more than 20 percent of his time would not be considered a lobbyist.'b'A 'b'task force'b' of the American Bar Association sensibly recommended last year that the 20 percent rule be eliminated, which would require far more people to register as lobbyists, and subject them to ethics and disclosure requirements. (The 'b'Center for Responsive Politics found'b' that more than 3,000 lobbyists simply \xe2\x80\x9cde-registered\xe2\x80\x9d after Congress imposed new reporting requirements for lobbyists in 2007.) Of course, many prominent influence-peddlers do not actually meet with lawmakers or federal officials themselves. They provide \xe2\x80\x9cstrategic advice\xe2\x80\x9d on how to navigate Washington and whom to see, while other members of their firms do the face-to-face lobbying work. (This is how Mr. Gingrich made most of his millions.)'b'With a better lobbying law, the work of these consultants would also be disclosed. Whenever a lobbying contact is made with a lawmaker or bureaucrat for a client, a form should be filed showing all the people who worked for the client, how much they are paid, and what work they did regarding a law, an earmark, or a regulation.'b'Disclosure, however, does not stanch the pipeline of money from the lobby industry that remains out of control. On Tuesday, President Obama proposed an important reform that would prohibit lobbyists from fund-raising for federal candidates they had lobbied in the previous two years and would also prohibit fund-raisers from becoming lobbyists during the same period. There should also be lower dollar limits on how much lobbyists can contribute in total to federal candidates, party committees and political action committees.'b'President Obama has said he will not accept contributions from lobbyists, but at least 'b'15 of his biggest fund-raisers'b' work in lobby shops and are unregistered. Meanwhile, 'b'the Republican candidates'b' have taken in hundreds of thousands of dollars from lobbyists. And there are no limits on donations to unregulated \xe2\x80\x9csuper PACs\xe2\x80\x9d.'b'Congress has shown little interest in tightening these requirements, in part because lawmakers don\xe2\x80\x99t want to close off a lucrative career in lobbying after they leave office. More than 400 former lawmakers have become lobbyists or consultants in the last decade.'b'Eric Lichtblau 'b'reported in The Times'b' on Sunday that former Representative William Delahunt, a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts, is making $15,000 a month lobbying for a wind energy project for which he personally earmarked $1.7 million while in Congress. Experts said they had never heard of a lawmaker benefiting so directly from one of his own earmarks. The practice of earmarking has largely been curbed, but the abuses of lobbying will continue to spread until Congress finally decides to act.'b'Instead of ensuring that voting rights are extended to all Americans, many state legislatures are engaged in efforts to 'b'shut out voters'b' in this election year, taking aim at young people, immigrants and minorities.'b'Last week, a panel of judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia heard a case that could eviscerate the ability of the federal government to prevent racial discrimination in voting. The issue in 'b'Shelby County v. Holder'b' involves Section 5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which requires that jurisdictions with flagrant histories of racial discrimination in voting must get permission from the Justice Department or a federal court before making any changes in their voting rules or laws.'b'Shelby County, Ala., one of those jurisdictions, 'b'contends'b' that Section 5 intrudes unconstitutionally on the sovereign authority of states. It argues that while the preclearance rule was justified when the country, especially the South, was ending legal segregation, it is no longer needed. That argument was properly dismissed in a 151-page 'b'opinion'b' by Judge John Bates of Federal District Court, who ruled that the discrimination that led to passage and extensions of the Voting Rights Act endures. The appeals court should uphold his decision.'b'The case is important because in 2009, by a 8-to-1 vote, the Supreme Court said there are 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cserious constitutional questions\xe2\x80\x9d'b' about whether Section 5 meets a current need, although the justices did not answer those questions at that time. Chief Justice John Roberts Jr., writing for the majority, left some legal experts with the impression that the court had come close to striking down Section 5. Fortunately, it did not do so.'b'When Congress nearly unanimously reauthorized the Voting Rights Act in 2006, it relied on abundant evidence that there is still pervasive, persistent, even Jim Crow-style 'b'voting discrimination'b' in the South and elsewhere \xe2\x80\x94 including in Shelby County and other parts of Alabama. Without Section 5\xe2\x80\x99s preclearance requirement, Congress found, \xe2\x80\x9cracial and language minority citizens will be deprived of the opportunity to exercise their right to vote, or will have their votes diluted, undermining the significant gains made by minorities in the last 40 years.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The provision remains an effective and essential check against widespread voting violations. Many jurisdictions still actively sabotage the interests of minority voters, as shown in new efforts to keep these voters from the polls. Discrimination would be even more widespread without the continuing and critical deterrence of the preclearance requirement.'b'Hispanic residents and civil-rights advocates have raised alarms for years about the police in East Haven, Conn. Their claims gained chilling corroboration on Tuesday. 'b'The Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested'b' a sergeant and three officers on charges of terrorizing the town\xe2\x80\x99s Hispanic neighborhoods, stopping and detaining people, searching businesses without cause, beating people in handcuffs, smashing a man\xe2\x80\x99s head into a wall.'b'The charges echoed what the Justice Department reported in December, accusing East Haven police of widespread \xe2\x80\x9cbiased policing, unconstitutional searches and seizures and the use of excessive force.\xe2\x80\x9d This was made more appalling when the mayor, Joseph Maturo Jr., was 'b'asked by a reporter'b' how he would respond to the arrests and said that 'b'he might have tacos for dinner'b'. First, he said he was joking. When it dawned on him that snide flippancy was the wrong response to grave accusations of police brutality, he said he was sorry for his \xe2\x80\x9coff-collar comment.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That is not enough. Mayor Maturo should now resign. He has shown a stunning incapacity for understanding the severity of the scandal in his government and has been fatally compromised by his knee-jerk support for the tainted police department and its chief. The mayor\xe2\x80\x99s repugnant remark is the least of it. This case is about institutional brutality and oppression.'b'The East Haven case is one squalid part of the far larger furor over immigration, where Spanish-speaking people are met with suspicion and abuse and states and localities rush to pass laws empowering local police officers to harass presumed illegal immigrants. Racial-profiling is flourishing in this climate, and the Obama administration has rightly stepped up efforts to fight it. Judging from the racism so casually exhibited by Mr. Maturo, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a long struggle.'b'House members were moved to tears on Wednesday when 'b'Representative Gabrielle Giffords handed in her resignation'b' because, she said, she needed more time to heal from the grievous gunshot wound she suffered last year at the hands of a would-be assassin. The rarest of Congressional events \xe2\x80\x94 a display of genuinely bipartisan tributes \xe2\x80\x94 was the parting gift from her colleagues along with unanimous approval of Ms. Giffords\xe2\x80\x99s bill to fight drug trafficking along the Mexican border.'b'Left unstated amid the lawmakers\xe2\x80\x99 celebration of Ms. Giffords\xe2\x80\x99s survival was the abject failure of Congress and President Obama to repair the porous gun control laws that helped enable a mentally disturbed gunman to shoot and kill six and wound Ms. Giffords and 12 others in a matter of seconds last January.'b'Ringing vows were made immediately after the Tucson rampage to ban the high-volume ammunition clips used by the gunman, to prod states to submit names of the mentally disturbed to the federal watch list for gun sales, and to plug the notorious gun-show loophole that allows anyone to buy high-powered military weapons without a background check.

But for this to happen, Congress must turn over billions in penalties, expected from the BP 'b'oil spill'b', to the Gulf of Mexico states for the restoration of the delta\xe2\x80\x99s wetlands.'b'Since the 19th century, the Army Corps of Engineers has channelized the 'b'Mississippi River'b' to improve navigation while avoiding the expense of dredging. But the 'b'levees'b' built for that goal deprived the marsh of the alluvial silt that nurtured it over millenniums. After the epic 1927 flood, the corps raised the levees higher still. Starved of silt, the marshes are now subsiding into the gulf.'b'On top of that, sulfur, natural gas and 'b'oil'b' production companies have, since the 1930s, dug close to 10,000 miles of canals into the delta, gaining direct routes to their mineral wealth. These canals brought saltwater deep into the wetlands, killing marsh grasses and encouraging tidal and wave action that eroded banks. Like the pelican, our state bird that, legend has it, feeds its young with its own blood, the Mississippi River Delta has sacrificed itself for the good of the nation. But the nation has not repaid in kind.'b'Disaster and rebirth is an old story around here. My family has lived that cycle for generations. After the hurricane of 1915, the family spent three weeks on the levee, the only high ground, their cattle and rice, ready to harvest, washed away. Life was hard. But it was also the land of plenty. In deltaic mud 200 feet deep, they farmed rice, indigo and oranges. They hunted and fished. In the Depression, according to my mother, who would later found Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s Chris Steak House, \xe2\x80\x9cWe never knew we were poor. There was always plenty of food for the taking.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What is happening to the delta today is a national crisis. Twenty percent of the seafood caught in the United States in 2009 came from the gulf. (That dropped to 16 percent in 2010, when vast areas of the gulf were closed.) Ninety percent of that catch depends on the wetlands for some part of its life cycle.'b'The BP spill occurred at just the moment and at just the spot offshore where the magnificent but endangered bluefin tuna spawns. Chances are we\xe2\x80\x99ve lost at least one generation of bluefin. (Sushi fans, think, no more'b' 'b'toro.) Another sure sign of loss is how hard oysters are to come by. Oysters have been a mainstay in the seafood gumbo with which my Plaquemines Parish family begins our festive dinners. This December, oysters for my Christmas dressing came from a friend in Galveston, Tex.'b'The oil spill may prove to be one too many disasters for the return of the Plaquemines Parish my family once knew \xe2\x80\x94 unless we see it as an urgent opportunity for changes long overdue.'b'The future of all our shellfish and fisheries \xe2\x80\x94 shrimp, oyster, redfish, pompano, speckled trout \xe2\x80\x94 hinges on restoration of the delta wetlands using the billions that BP and other companies could end up owing. Since a hurricane\xe2\x80\x99s storm surge is reduced by the wetlands it travels across \xe2\x80\x94 by as much as a foot for every two and a half miles, according to some scientists \xe2\x80\x94 the longevity of New Orleans also relies on the wetlands\xe2\x80\x99 restoration. How else to get all that grain from the heartland to international markets?'b'President Obama recently signed legislation appropriating $9.6 million for restoration studies in the Louisiana coastal area. But we already know how to restore the delta: by diverting the silt-laden Mississippi waters into the wetlands. Pilot river diversion programs are already building wetlands. At Wax Lake at the mouth of the Atchafalaya River, a natural diversion of the Mississippi, silt has built 25 square miles of new wetlands \xe2\x80\x94 which would cut a storm surge headed for inland cities and towns by many feet.'b'The moment is ripe. The Obama administration has called for using BP\xe2\x80\x99s fines for coastal restoration. The bipartisan Restore the Gulf Coast Act of 2011 was approved by a key Senate committee in September, but has not come to a vote there or in the House. If it passes, 80 percent of the Clean Water Act penalties against BP would go to the injured parties \xe2\x80\x94 the gulf states.'b'Senator Mary Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, rightly argues that the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share should be used to restore the delta wetlands, a national treasure that suffered the most harm from the BP oil spill. All that\xe2\x80\x99s needed now is a sense of purpose and the political will.'b'After months of standing by as Republicans tried to gut environmental laws and discredit his clean energy initiatives, President Obama took the offensive in 'b'his State of the Union address'b'. He blasted Republicans for their single-minded commitment to fossil fuels, argued the case for a diversified energy strategy and dared to talk about climate change, a topic he has been silent on for months.'b'He has little chance of persuading Congress to go along with most of his sensible proposals, including those to extend and enlarge subsidies for alternative fuels and cut subsidies for the oil industry. He is right to do as much as he can on his own, opening up more federal land to wind and solar installations and pushing the military to draw more of its energy from renewable sources.'b'The president has a history of making great speeches with frustratingly limited follow-through. We suspect that some of his campaign advisers \xe2\x80\x94 spooked by the pounding over the Solyndra bankruptcy filing and absurd Republican claims about losing tens of thousands of potential jobs from his denial of the environmentally risky Keystone XL oil pipeline \xe2\x80\x94 will be tempted to argue that the issue is a loser.'b'There is a powerful case to be made that clean energy investments that will create real jobs and keep America competitive in a $5 trillion global market for advanced energy technologies. If the president doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it, the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 defense of big coal and oil will prevail.'b'The lengthy Republican investigation into the failure of a single solar energy company, Solyndra, has already raised doubts about the value and integrity of a multibillion-dollar federal program designed to support renewable energy development. Mr. Obama had the right response: The failure of some public investments to pan out was not reason enough to abandon clean energy or \xe2\x80\x9ccede the wind or solar or battery industry to China or Germany.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s an argument he will have to keep making.'b'We found particularly compelling his plain-speaking defense of regulation \xe2\x80\x94 and the way he implicitly linked the antiregulatory folks who brought down the banking system (and their corporate pals) with the folks fighting environmental regulations (and their corporate pals). He vowed not to \xe2\x80\x9cback down\xe2\x80\x9d from rules aimed at preventing oil spills, rules protecting children from mercury poisoning, rules guaranteeing safe food and clean water.'b'Mr. Obama agreed that a comprehensive strategy must include fossil fuels, and he pledged to promote natural gas and open up the outer continental shelf for oil exploration \xe2\x80\x94 both in an environmentally safe manner. This did not placate the Republicans. After the speech, their spokesmen immediately tried to steer the conversation back to the pipeline and the failure of Solyndra. Mr. Obama has much the better of this issue \xe2\x80\x94 if he sticks with it.'b'This week, New York State lawmakers unveiled proposed 'b'legislative district maps'b', based on the 2010 census and required in time for this year\xe2\x80\x99s elections.

The proper solution is to start over.'b'Here are a few examples of redistricting gone wrong:'b'\xc2\xb6In three new Senate districts, Republicans forced incumbent Democrats into the same district to run against each other. State Senator Michael Gianaris, a powerful Queens Democrat, found that his block was carefully excised from his present district and tucked into the neighboring district of Senator Jos\xc3\xa9 Peralta, another Democrat.'b'\xc2\xb6Republicans also manipulated redistricting formulas created in the late 19th century to add a 63rd Senate seat. And instead of putting that new district in New York City, where the population justifies an addition, they carved up Albany County to create a new seat for a favorite Republican assemblyman.'b'\xc2\xb6Democrats in the Assembly have also drawn new districts unfairly. On Long Island, for example, Democrats altered four Assembly districts so that instead of one Democratic and three Republican seats, at least one of the Republicans could easily lose to a Democrat.'b'This kind of redistricting is deeply undemocratic, making it hard to take on incumbents and their parties. Legislators focusing on their own districts have also failed so far to release Congressional district maps. Federal District Court Judge Gary Sharpe added to the urgency on Friday by ruling that the state\xe2\x80\x99s Congressional primaries will be held on June 26 instead Sept. 11.'b'Common Cause New York has shown that it is possible to draw straightforward and fair 'b'maps'b' of Congressional and state legislative districts by keeping communities intact and respecting local jurisdictional lines.'b'The goal is to have districts that promote competition and serve communities fairly. The solution may have to come from the courts, since these maps are likely to be the subject of litigation. In the meantime, Governor Cuomo must prepare to veto this scandalous mess and not settle for any compromise that fails to correct the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s gerrymandered product.'b'Post-Mubarak Egypt is facing profound challenges with its unfinished revolution and looming economic crisis.

But, like so many hard-working people, they were just one setback away from foundering.'b'Samantha, a hipster with her black T-shirt, jeans, boots, a nose stud and puka-shell necklace, is proof that science rewards hard work as much as inspiration. She toiled on her research after school, on weekends and through the summer at Stony Brook University for two and a half years, and during the school year spends eight to 12 hours a week in the lab.'b'Samantha\xe2\x80\x99s congressman is Steve Israel, a Democrat who has long tried to focus attention on the plight of the middle class. 'b'He invited Samantha to attend the State of the Union address'b', hoping to make a point about the need to invest in young minds and in the science and technology that built Long Island, home to fabled laboratories, research labs and manufacturers for the military and space program.'b'He wanted Republicans to pay attention, since they are so determined to starve government programs, weaken the safety net and shun public investment in education and science, all while slashing rich people\xe2\x80\x99s taxes. \xe2\x80\x9cHow does a middle-class family with a daughter who\xe2\x80\x99s a genius find themselves in a homeless shelter through no fault of their own?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Israel said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t just about a celebration of her tenacity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Without government support \xe2\x80\x94 public schools, state research institutions and the county shelter that kept her family safe \xe2\x80\x94 Samantha\xe2\x80\x99s survival would have been left to the private sector. In her case, that would have been Dunkin\xe2\x80\x99 Donuts, Starbucks and Quizno\xe2\x80\x99s, three places she looked for jobs, none of which offered her one.'b'Though she didn\xe2\x80\x99t make the Intel finals, she\xe2\x80\x99s well on her way, maybe to Brown or Yale. She thought about where she might have been without the refuge of science, her teacher Rebecca Grella and the mind-expanding challenges of a life in the lab. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe flunking out of school, honestly,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'If the worst thing that ever happens to 'b'Temi Fagbenle'b' is that she gets to play college basketball for only three seasons instead of four, she\xe2\x80\x99ll have lived a blessed life. No question, the wrong being perpetrated on this 6-foot-4 Harvard freshman pales compared with some of the injustices in college sports that 'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve been recounting lately'b'.'b'Still, Fagbenle\xe2\x80\x99s ordeal is worth telling for three reasons. It illustrates the sheer pettiness of the N.C.A.A. It shows that the N.C.A.A. won\xe2\x80\x99t rectify even an obvious mistake to help an athlete. Saddest of all, it shows that even mighty Harvard won\xe2\x80\x99t stand up to the N.C.A.A. Originally intended to help universities police their athletic teams, the N.C.A.A. has become higher education\xe2\x80\x99s Frankenstein, terrifying its overseers.'b'Let me tell you a little bit about Temi. Yes, she\xe2\x80\x99s 6-foot-4 and a terrific basketball player, but she\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more than that. Born to Nigerian parents \xe2\x80\x94 her father is a prominent journalist \xe2\x80\x94 she moved with her large family to London as a girl. When she was 15, her parents enrolled her as a junior in 'b'Blair Academy'b', a New Jersey prep school, hoping the education she got there would lead her to the Ivy League. The Fagbenles had their hearts set on Harvard.'b'Temi struggled her first year, so much so that she and her parents decided that she should repeat her junior year to better her chances of getting into Harvard. By the time she graduated, she had won letters in track and tennis as well as basketball, had starred in the school play, had improved her grades enough to be 'b'accepted at Harvard'b', and had become one of the most popular students at Blair. Along the way, she turned down scholarship offers from big-time basketball schools like Duke.'b'If you are wondering how this outstanding high school career could have led to Temi\xe2\x80\x99s being ruled ineligible to play as a freshman, you\xe2\x80\x99re not alone. Her mistake, if you can call it that, was to take an exam, the General Certificate of Secondary Education, required of all British students when they are around 15. Inexplicably \xe2\x80\x94 and incorrectly \xe2\x80\x94 the N.C.A.A. says that the exam marks a British student\xe2\x80\x99s graduation from high school. Under its rules, a British high school graduate must enroll in college within two years of taking the G.C.S.E. Because Temi repeated her junior year, it took her three years.'b'The sheer idiocy of this rule boggles the mind. As Harvard pointed out in a letter to the N.C.A.A., if she had stayed in London until she finished high school, she could have played. If she had started as a freshman in an American high school and repeated a grade, she could have played. But because she repeated a grade after coming to the United States, she is ineligible. It not only seems unfair, it seems discriminatory.'b'Behind the scenes, Harvard worked to get the N.C.A.A. to reverse its decision, making four separate appeals. All were denied. With Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s help, Temi retained a lawyer, who gave serious thought to trying to get a restraining order against the N.C.A.A., on the grounds that the rule violates state antidiscrimination laws. But, in the end, Temi decided not to sue, to Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s palpable relief. After all, if Temi began playing and then ultimately lost the case, the women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball team would have to forfeit the games in which she had played. Sotto voce, officials also expressed fears that the N.C.A.A. might retaliate in other ways.'b'Despite its behind-the-scenes efforts, Harvard has never once said publicly that the rule is wrong and that Temi is being unfairly punished. On the contrary, in an e-mailed statement, 'b'Bob Scalise'b', the Harvard athletic director, said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe at Harvard are fully committed to following all N.C.A.A. rules and guidelines.\xe2\x80\x9d Even, apparently, when those rules are wrong and unjust.'b'And, I might add, deeply hurtful. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen someone has a tremendous talent, you are taking away a fundamental part of their identity,\xe2\x80\x9d says Temi\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, Beth Reilly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there is a stigma in being declared ineligible, an implication that you have done something wrong. You have a label attached that the whole world sees.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I understand why a school like the University of Connecticut won\xe2\x80\x99t stand up to the N.C.A.A. There is nothing bigger in the state of Connecticut than UConn basketball. If it were to start playing 'b'Ryan Boatright'b', the suspended point guard whose mother is the subject of an N.C.A.A. witch hunt, it would risk not only forfeiting games, but missing the N.C.A.A. championship tournament. The price is too high.'b'But I would have thought that Harvard was made of sterner stuff. Harvard claims to have values that transcend wins and losses. Harvard has often been a leader in changing how universities act. So long as schools continue to cower in the face of N.C.A.A. abuses, those abuses will continue.'b'The Temi Fagbenle case was a perfect opportunity for Harvard to stand up for what\xe2\x80\x99s right. Maybe next time.'b'Newt Gingrich is spaced-out. Literally.'b'Anyone who remembers him from his days as speaker of the House in the \xe2\x80\x9990s remembers how erratic, unpredictable and off-the-wall he could be, but, so far, this campaign season he has managed to conceal his many absurdities and eccentricities.'b'Furthermore, many Republican primary voters seem willing to forgive and forget his past. Others seem not even to remember it. He has been able to pass himself off as a wise elder statesman \xe2\x80\x94 a historian without a history \xe2\x80\x94 able to capture the anger and anxiety of the right and articulate it with force, lucidity and gravitas.'b'Oh, it is to laugh! That is if you\xe2\x80\x99re on the left.'b'But for those on the right with firsthand knowledge of working with Gingrich when he was in Washington, this is a nightmare scenario. The outside possibility that Gingrich could win the nomination and wreck the party scares them to death. Their panic over this has reached a fever pitch.'b'And this is not without merit.'b'An 'b'NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released this week'b' found that Gingrich now enjoys a 9-point lead nationally among registered Republican likely primary voters. However, Gingrich fared worse than all other Republican candidates when tested against Obama. The poll suggested that Obama would trounce Gingrich by 18 points.'b'(Luckily for Mitt Romney, Gingrich\xe2\x80\x99s surge in Florida may be fizzling. 'b'A Quinnipiac poll'b' of likely Republican voters in that state found that Romney leads Gingrich by nine percentage points. If that holds, Romney and the establishment Republicans will have dodged a bullet like Neo in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Matrix.\xe2\x80\x9d A Romney loss in Florida would call his candidacy into question and send the party scrambling for a more attractive replacement.)'b'One of the latest establishment Republicans to try to avert the Gingrich catastrophe is former Senator Bob Dole, 'b'who wrote a letter to the Romney campaign'b' on Thursday saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI have not been critical of Newt Gingrich, but it is now time to take a stand before it is too late.\xe2\x80\x9d It only got better from there. Dole continued, \xe2\x80\x9chardly anyone who served with Newt in Congress has endorsed him, and that fact speaks for itself. He was a one-man-band who rarely took advice.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Dole\xe2\x80\x99s concern in his statement, and the concern of countless others, is: \xe2\x80\x9cIf Gingrich is the nominee it will have an adverse impact on Republican candidates running for county, state and federal offices.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As Peter D. Hart, a Democratic pollster, told MSNBC, \xe2\x80\x9cGingrich is Goldwater.\xe2\x80\x9d He continued, \xe2\x80\x9cIn the general election, Gingrich not only takes down his ship, he takes down the whole flotilla.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Part of the reason for this is Gingrich is thoroughly unlikable among the electorate at large and utterly nonsensical in his approach to real problem-solving. The fact that he has convinced some primary voters that he is an intellectual is one of the best electoral sleights of hand I can recall. As Dole said of Newt when he was in Washington: \xe2\x80\x9cGingrich had a new idea every minute, and most of them were off the wall.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To that point, 'b'Gingrich told a crowd'b' on Florida\xe2\x80\x99s so-called Space Coast on Wednesday that \xe2\x80\x9cby the end of my second term, we will have the first permanent base on the Moon. And it will be American.\xe2\x80\x9d And he said that he would push for the introduction of a \xe2\x80\x9cNorthwest Ordinance for Space\xe2\x80\x9d so that when the number of colonists reached 13,000, they could petition for statehood.'b'(By the way, I find it interesting that Gingrich didn\xe2\x80\x99t insist on answering the question about Puerto Rican statehood at Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s debate, yet he\xe2\x80\x99s advocating for a state on the Moon. Earth to Newt: phone home.)'b'In the speech, Gingrich implied that he was \xe2\x80\x9cbold\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cromantic\xe2\x80\x9d and called himself \xe2\x80\x9cvisionary\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgrandiose\xe2\x80\x9d in the vein of Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy and the Wright brothers. Gingrich is a virtual supernova of megalomaniacal madness.'b'In a way, the space speech made sense. Gingrich was doing what he does: tossing out random ideas like darts at a board, hoping to score. He was repackaging the idea of Manifest Destiny for the Moon and appealing to an area of the country whose pride and purpose were wounded by the ending of the space shuttle program.'b'But, on the other hand, this is exactly the kind of election-year lunacy that establishment Republicans have been worrying about. Florida has 'b'one of the highest state unemployment rates'b' in the country and has one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country. The last thing that people who can\xe2\x80\x99t hold on to their jobs and houses here on Earth want to hear about is a colony on the Moon. The whole thing bespeaks a man detached from the real world concerns of real people.'b'As Dole\xe2\x80\x99s statement went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cIn my opinion, if we want to avoid an Obama landslide in November, Republicans should nominate Governor Romney as our standard-bearer.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The truth is that the Republican Party has no good choice at this point. It only has bad choices and worse choices. And the American public is beginning to recognize that. As the Republican courtiers of incompetence beat up each other, knock down each other and reveal each other\xe2\x80\x99s flaws, a number of recent surveys have found that President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s poll numbers on a number of metrics have begun to trend upward.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s because an election is a choice, a zero-sum game \xe2\x80\x94 the worse the Republican field looks, particularly if Gingrich is at the front of it, the better President Obama looks by comparison, regardless of one\xe2\x80\x99s misgivings about his first term.'b'Establishment Republicans understand this simple, painful truth: Romney is no guarantee of victory, but Gingrich is an absolute guarantee of defeat. At least here on Earth.'b'DO you think that after all is said and done, Newt Gingrich will just go down in history as the politician who conclusively proved that voters don\xe2\x80\x99t care about a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s sexual misbehavior?'b'Imagine the history students of 2112, reading about the early 21st century on their vaporphones, or whatever they have by then. They would get to this presidential campaign and there would be a little footnote saying that despite a totally outrageous marital history, Newt Gingrich won the presidential primary in one of the most socially conservative states in the country. Maybe there would be a clip of him making the how-dare-you-sir speech to CNN\xe2\x80\x99s John King.'b'Probably not exactly what Newt has in mind.'b'Perhaps things will go differently. Maybe, despite his blah debate performances in Florida, Newt will do well in this week\xe2\x80\x99s primary, and go on to win the nomination, become president and build lots of moon colonies while saving America from Shariah law and the corrosive effects of the writing of Saul Alinsky.'b'But if not, he\xe2\x80\x99ll still be the guy who managed to become a credible presidential candidate despite the three wives, the serial adultery, etc. etc. etc. He had a lot of help from the voters. In South Carolina, only 31 percent of the people interviewed by Public Policy Polling said they believed the second Mrs. Gingrich when she told ABC that her husband had asked her to share his sexual favors with his longtime mistress, who is now the third Mrs. G.'b'Presumably they believed Newt, who said that he had \xe2\x80\x9cwitnesses\xe2\x80\x9d who were eager to go to ABC and denounce the story. Although the Gingrich campaign now says the proffered witnesses didn\xe2\x80\x99t really exist. Except for his daughters by his first marriage. Who truly would not seem to be the best possible experts on whether Newt wanted to have whoopee rights to both their stepmothers.'b'If Gingrich loses the Florida primary, I hope it is for the crime of middle-aged-child abuse.'b'But about that open-marriage poll question: I believe that what the voters were actually saying was that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear about it. The American public has a long history of ignoring the private lives of elected officials whenever possible. They gave up on politicians as role models somewhere around Richard Nixon.'b'Perhaps the critical moment came when voters decided to elect Bill Clinton president despite what were very clear storm warnings about his tendency to wander off, sexually speaking. Which was followed by the public\xe2\x80\x99s very clear decision to keep Bill Clinton even after he was caught in behavior that, really, even the head of Hedonists Inc. could not possibly have thought was a good idea.'b'And it all worked out! Now Clinton is Beloved Ex-President Clinton, and everybody keeps sighing over how great things were when the prince of bad behavior was in charge.'b'That goes for the social right, too. They are going to go for the guy who they think will carry out their agenda. Even if he is, say, an anti-abortion crusader whose ex-wife swore that he took her to get an abortion. (See: former Georgia Congressman Bob Barr.)'b'The far right seems to be particularly indifferent to bad-behavior issues. Maybe this is because their supporters know that sinning social conservatives operate at a disadvantage. It is way easier to avoid the hypocrisy label if you\xe2\x80\x99re a straying civil libertarian whose family values speeches mainly involve encouraging kids to donate money to feed impoverished people in Africa. You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be charged with speaking out of both sides of your mouth when the first side is talking about supporting Doctors Without Borders.'b'Conservative voters also like expressions of remorse and promises to reform. When all else fails, they have even been known to argue that everybody does it. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, they all have stinky feet,\xe2\x80\x9d former Congressman J. C. Watts, a Baptist preacher, said while he was campaigning for Newt in South Carolina.'b'Although actually, when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about 1) Committing adultery, 2) Divorcing your wife while she\xe2\x80\x99s sick to marry your mistress, 3) Committing adultery, 4) Allegedly asking your wife to let you keep the mistress on the side and 5) Divorcing your wife while she\xe2\x80\x99s sick to marry your mistress ... it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear everybody doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do it.'b'But in a way, Watts is right. (And we do like that stinky feet line.) Everybody has something. Rick Santorum lusted in his heart for earmarks. Mitt Romney drove to Canada with the family Irish setter strapped on the car roof.'b'And Newt argues his checkered past is actually an advantage. He suggested to the Christian Broadcasting Network that \xe2\x80\x9cit may make me more normal than somebody who wanders around seeming perfect and maybe not understanding the human condition, and the challenges of life for normal people.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Take that, Mitt.'b'I once wrote a book on how gossip about politicians\xe2\x80\x99 private lives impacts their careers, and it was a very interesting experience, as a result of which I know way more about Grover Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s sex life than most people would find reasonable. Until the 1970s, voters found it very easy to ignore things they would rather not know about prominent politicians, since the mainstream media didn\xe2\x80\x99t report it. That rule began to crack about the time one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful politicians, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman Wilbur Mills, was caught trying to drunkenly fish a striptease dancer out of the Washington Tidal Basin.'b'Ever since then, we have been writing about the ways politicians misbehave in private, usually after an ex-lover or angry wife blows the whistle. And the voters frequently yawn. However, the people a misbehaving politician really has to worry about are not his constituents, but his peers. These days, a congressman\xe2\x80\x99s colleagues will throw him overboard in a second. We all remember that Anthony Weiner was driven out of Congress after he got caught tweeting pictures of his underwear. While he was inhabiting it. I am going to go out on a limb and say that his constituents in Brooklyn and Queens were not charmed by this behavior, but you did not see any widespread calls within his district for him to resign. No, the people who forced Weiner to go away were the Democratic leaders, particularly Nancy Pelosi, who thought he was hurting the party in general.'b'Over the last few days, there has been a big-name Republican uprising against Gingrich, featuring everybody from Bob Dole to Ann Coulter. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t personally offended by Newt\xe2\x80\x99s marital history \xe2\x80\x94 or if they are, they can certainly live with it. But they\xe2\x80\x99re totally afraid that if he actually got the nomination and people had to take a long, serious look at the whole Newt picture, the Republicans would be destroyed in November.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ll see what happens. But here\xe2\x80\x99s the good news: Newt has always dreamed of being a figure in American history books, and I think he\xe2\x80\x99s got that nailed.'b'Santiago, Chile'b'LATE last month the British newspaper The Guardian asked readers to vote for its 'b'person of the year'b'. The candidates included household names like German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Egyptian techno-revolutionary Wael Ghonim and the Burmese pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. All placed far behind a striking, nose-ringed student from Chile named Camila Vallejo.'b'Though far from a familiar face in the United States, the 23-year-old Ms. Vallejo has gained rock-star status among the global activist class. Since June she has led regular street marches of up to 200,000 people through Santiago\xe2\x80\x99s broad avenues \xe2\x80\x94 the largest demonstrations since the waning days of the Pinochet regime in the late 1980s. Under her leadership, the mobilization, known as the Chilean Winter, has gained nationwide support; one of its slogans, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are the 90 percent,\xe2\x80\x9d referred to its approval rating in late September.'b'Ms. Vallejo\xe2\x80\x99s charismatic leadership has led commentators to make the obligatory comparisons to other Latin American leftist icons like Subcomandante Marcos and Che Guevara. Yet \xe2\x80\x9cCommander Camila,\xe2\x80\x9d as her followers call her, has become a personality in her own regard. She skewers senators in prime-time TV debates and stays on message with daytime talk-show hosts hungry for lurid details about her personal life, while her eloquence gives her a preternatural ability to connect with an audience far beyond her left-wing base.'b'In perhaps the most poignant set piece in the year of the protester, Ms. Vallejo addressed a dense ring of photographers and reporters in August while kneeling within a peace sign made of spent tear-gas shells, where she calmly mused about how many educational improvements could have been bought with the $100,000 worth of munitions at her feet.'b'Ms. Vallejo, like many of her fellow student leaders, is an avowed communist. But while she has publicly commended other regional leftists like Presidents Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador, she and her generation have little in common with the older left of Fidel Castro or Hugo Ch\xc3\xa1vez. They are less ideological purists than change-seeking pragmatists, even if that means working within the existing political order.'b'Still, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the movement is upending Chilean society. True, it is centered on a policy question, namely reforming an educational system that disproportionally favors the children of wealthy families. But the earth-shaking Paris protests in 1968 also began with calls for university reform \xe2\x80\x94 before spiraling into street battles between radicalized students and truncheon-wielding gendarmes, opposing symbols in the culture war between old and new France.'b'The same process is under way in Chile. As the protests increasingly devolve into rock and tear-gas exchanges between students and the police, it\xe2\x80\x99s becoming clear that more than education policy is at stake: a nonviolent social revolution in which disaffected, politically savvy youth are trying to overthrow the mores of an older generation, one they feel is still tainted by the legacy of Pinochet. It is not just about policy reform, but also about changing the underlying timbers of Chilean society.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that the movement should be led by someone as charismatic as Ms. Vallejo. Paris 1968 had its celebrity protesters, handsome faces that brought hundreds of thousands into the streets, photogenic young men like Jacques Sauvageot and Daniel Cohn-Bendit. Chile has Ms. Vallejo.'b'Chile is perhaps Latin America\xe2\x80\x99s greatest success story. After decades of authoritarian rule, it has spent the last 20 years building a thriving economy with a renewed democratic culture and a booming, educated middle class. But it is also confronting a dangerous imbalance: While the liberalization of higher education has led to improvements in access, tuition has consistently outpaced inflation and now represents 40 percent of the average household\xe2\x80\x99s income.'b'At the same time, protesters say that wealthy students from private and expensive, co-pay charter schools have unfair access to elite universities, while the rest struggle to meet entrance standards at under-financed public institutions.'b'Criticism of the university system has been growing for years, but it was only in April that, energized by protests against a dam in Patagonia, students finally took to the streets. The protests grew over the winter; by the first press conference held by the national confederation of student unions, known as the Confech, Ms. Vallejo had emerged as its leader.'b'Echoing 1960s street activism, the Chilean Winter dabbled in the absurd, but with a high-tech, social-media twist. 'b'Thousands gathered'b' in front of the presidential palace in June dressed as zombies, then broke into a choreographed dance to Michael Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThriller.\xe2\x80\x9d In July, students again gathered in front of the palace for a huge \xe2\x80\x9c'b'kiss-in'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Though the ideas came, 'b'said Giorgio Jackson'b', former student president of Chile\xe2\x80\x99s Catholic University, from \xe2\x80\x9ceverywhere, absolutely every local space,\xe2\x80\x9d the movement\xe2\x80\x99s success hinged on the leadership\xe2\x80\x99s ability to channel such creativity while maintaining a unified front to government and the media. The organization used a Web site to gather ideas and disseminate content for placards and posters. And it has used Ms. Vallejo\xe2\x80\x99s 300,000-plus Twitter followers to quickly initiate huge \xe2\x80\x9ccacerolazos,\xe2\x80\x9d a form of dictatorship-era protest where people walk the streets banging on pots and pans.'b'While they vow to continue until all their lofty demands are met, the students have already scored some political victories. The government\xe2\x80\x99s proposed 2012 budget has a $350 million increase for higher education, with promises to finance scholarships for qualifying students from families up to the 60th percentile in household income. Meanwhile, the year began with the naming of Chile\xe2\x80\x99s third education minister in six months.'b'It was only a matter of time, perhaps, before the movement\xe2\x80\x99s focus on education began to broaden. As more support for the movement came from outside the universities, its interests changed accordingly. \xe2\x80\x9cThis year we have already started talking about political reforms and tax reforms, and we think the students and youth in general play an important role in profound reforms in the country,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noam Titelman, the new student president at Catholic University.'b'Tax reform is, not coincidentally, now at the top of the government\xe2\x80\x99s agenda. And rightly so: though it has one of the wealthiest economies in Latin America, Chile is the 13th most unequal country in the world.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSomething very powerful that has come out of the heart of this movement is that people are really questioning the economic policies of the country,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Vallejo said. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople are not tolerating the way a small number of economic groups benefit from the system. Having a market economy is really different from having a market society. What we are asking for, via education reform, is that the state take on a different role.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The movement has also begun to spread regionally. 'b'Ms. Vallejo lent'b' her star power to Brazilian student protests in August, while in November students demonstrated in France, Germany and several other countries in support of Confech\xe2\x80\x99s Latin American March for Education.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe student movement here is permanently connected to other student movements, principally in Latin America, but also in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Vallejo said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe believe this reveals something fundamental: that there is a global demand for the recovery and defense of the right to education.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But the students clearly have a lot to learn about real-world politics. Ms. Vallejo and other student leaders spent weeks lobbying in Parliament, only to be left out of the final budget negotiations.'b'Frustration with Ms. Vallejo\xe2\x80\x99s strategy propelled a rival leftist, Gabriel Boric, to challenge her in the latest round of student-government elections. On Dec. 7, national TV news crews lingered past 5 a.m. outside the University of Chile to cover a stunning defeat for the world\xe2\x80\x99s most famous student leader.'b'Yet even in her early-morning concession speech, Ms. Vallejo claimed victory, recognizing that the movement was greater than any one figure.

This may be Ms. Vallejo\xe2\x80\x99s greatest contribution: to restore faith in a discredited system by showing a new generation that politics can be responsive to the people\xe2\x80\x99s demands.'b'LOS ANGELES'b'CHEERLEADERS with Tourette\xe2\x80\x99s syndrome. Like a fly buzzing against the window, this weird arrangement of words flitted across the edge of my consciousness last week. I kept thinking I should take a minute to track down the Onion piece from which this kooky phrase surely emanated, but finally committed some desultory Googling, and discovered that the buzzing idea correlated (more or less) to an actual event. A break in the case \xe2\x80\x94 and the appearance of two of the girls in a television interview \xe2\x80\x94 brought the story to national attention.'b'One afternoon last October in a small town about 50 miles from Buffalo, a high school cheerleader lay down for a nap, and woke up changed. She had been struck not with Tourette\xe2\x80\x99s but with a host of symptoms that resembled it: facial tics, uncontrollable movement, stuttering, verbal outbursts. Several other schoolmates have been afflicted, for a total of 14 girls. One boy reported symptoms. \xc2\xa0'b'Parents, school officials and doctors investigated possible organic causes of this troubling event, and serially ruled out potential suspects, from vaccine reactions to environmental hazards. (Erin Brockovich is looking into possible toxic causes.) The girls continued to suffer, dropped out of school and gave television interviews in which their arms looped around wildly and their voices broke and warbled.'b'Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of nutty story that only happens once, or so I briefly thought, until more focused Googling quickly led me to an almost identical episode, this one in 2002, in a high school in rural North Carolina. Once again, a cheerleader was first to manifest the strange symptoms, and once again other girls, some of them cheerleaders, were struck with the same condition.'b'There are famous cases that closely mimic these strange events. In 1962, in a girls\xe2\x80\x99 school in Tanzania, a laughing epidemic spread to 95 students and lasted for months. In 1965 there was a fainting episode at a girls\xe2\x80\x99 school in Blackburn, England, that landed 85 girls in the hospital. In 1983, when there was a widespread fear of chemical warfare in the West Bank, more than 900 Arab schoolgirls and a few female Israeli soldiers exhibited the symptoms of having been gassed, but doctors found no specific cause for the outbreak.'b'In all of these cases, the ultimate diagnosis \xe2\x80\x94 unpalatable in our post-Freudian age \xe2\x80\x94 was good old-fashioned hysteria.\xc2\xa0In the cheerleader cases, the first girl seems to have suffered from some kind of mental or emotional distress, which she expressed through otherwise unrelated physical symptoms. The other girls \xe2\x80\x94 victims of yesteryear\xe2\x80\x99s mass hysteria and today\xe2\x80\x99s mass psychogenic illness, in which the symptoms of hysteria pass from person to person, like contagion \xe2\x80\x94 believed the condition to be communicable and \xe2\x80\x9ccaught\xe2\x80\x9d it.'b'Hysteria is the most retrograde and non-womyn-empowering condition. It\xe2\x80\x99s not supposed to happen anymore (we have Title IX!), but it won\xe2\x80\x99t seem to go away. Both history and myth are filled with stories of girls exhibiting bizarre symptoms around the time of puberty \xe2\x80\x94 from Cassandra and her raving, to the girls of the Salem witch trials, to the girls whose households were believed to be the site of poltergeist hauntings, to cheerleaders in New York and North Carolina. Pubescent girls, it seems, are manifestly more likely to exhibit extreme and bizarre psychological symptoms than are teenage boys.'b'What no one has been able to determine is why this is so, why it is the cheerleaders and not the linebackers who come down with tics and stuttering. Female adolescence is \xe2\x80\x94 universally \xe2\x80\x94 an emotionally and psychologically intense period. It is during this time that girls become aware of the emergence of womanhood, with both the great joy and promise that come with it, and also the threat of danger. Much on their minds is their new potential for childbearing, an event that for most of human history has been fraught with physical peril. Furthermore, their emergence as sexual creatures brings with it heady excitement and increased physical vulnerability. They are also sharply aware that soon they will have to leave home forever, and at the very moment when they are most keenly desirous of its comforts and protections.'b'Most parents of adolescent girls will never have to contend with episodes of hysteria of the kind experienced by the cheerleaders. But anyone with a teenage daughter can attest that this is a time of emotional extremes and high drama, of girls who are one moment affectionate youngsters and the next screaming banshees. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s gotten into you?\xe2\x80\x9d the perplexed mother in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Exorcist\xe2\x80\x9d wonders about her demonized daughter; it\xe2\x80\x99s a question that the mothers of non-possessed girls often ask during the teenage years.'b'What girls need during this time is a stable and supportive space in which to work out all of this drama. In many respects a teenage girl\xe2\x80\x99s home is more important to her than at any time since she was a small child. She also needs emotional support and protection from the most corrosive cultural forces that seek to exploit her when she is least able to resist. Most of all she needs some privacy to work to make a way for herself as a strong and confident young woman. The emotional swings of normal female adolescence attest to its intensity, and they are also the reason girls need and deserve more protection during this time of their lives. As a neurologist treating the New York girls said: \xe2\x80\x9cThese girls will get better. We have to give them time and space.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'IN recent years, a trend has emerged in the behavioral sciences toward shorter and more rapidly published journal articles. These articles are often only a third the length of a standard paper, often describe only a single study and tend to include smaller data sets. Shorter formats are promoted by many journals, and limits on article length are stringent \xe2\x80\x94 in many cases as low as 2,000 words.'b'This shift is partly a result of the pressure that academics now feel to generate measurable output. According to the cold calculus of \xe2\x80\x9cpublish or perish,\xe2\x80\x9d in which success is often gauged by counting citations, three short articles can be preferable to a single longer one.'b'But some researchers contend that the trend toward short articles is also better for science. Such \xe2\x80\x9cbite size\xe2\x80\x9d science, they argue, encourages results to be communicated faster, written more concisely and read by editors and researchers more easily, leading to a more lively exchange of ideas.'b'In a'b' 2010 article'b', the psychologist Nick Haslam demonstrated empirically that, when adjusted for length, short articles are cited more frequently than other articles \xe2\x80\x94 that is, page for page, they get more bang for the buck. Professor Haslam concluded that short articles seem \xe2\x80\x9cmore efficient in generating scientific influence\xe2\x80\x9d and suggested that journals might consider adopting short-article formats.'b'We believe, however, there are a number of serious problems with the short-article format.'b'First, we dispute the importance of Professor Haslam\xe2\x80\x99s finding that short articles get more bang for the buck. Suppose that you conduct two studies, each offering evidence for the same conclusion, and you can opt to publish them either as one long article or as two short ones. Suppose that the scientists who will cite your studies will cite them in either format, either the long article or the pair of shorter articles. Based on citations, each of the three articles would have the same impact, but on a per-page measure, the shorter articles would be more \xe2\x80\x9cinfluential.\xe2\x80\x9d But this would reflect only how we measure impact, not a difference in actual substance or influence.'b'Second, we challenge the idea that shorter articles are easier and quicker to read. This is true enough if you consider a single article, but assuming that there is a fixed number of studies carried out, shorter articles simply mean 'b'more 'b'articles. And an increase in articles can create more work for editors, reviewers and, perhaps most important, anyone looking to fully research or understand a topic.'b'Third, we worry that shorter, single-study articles can be poor models of science. Replication is a cornerstone of the scientific method, and in longer papers that present multiple experiments confirming the same result, replication is manifestly on display; this is not always so with short articles. (Indeed the shorter format may discourage replication, since once a study is published its finding loses novelty.) Short articles are also more likely to suffer from \xe2\x80\x9ccitation amnesia\xe2\x80\x9d: because an author has less space to discuss previous relevant work, he often doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do so, which can give the impression that his own finding is more novel than it actually is.'b'Finally, as 'b'we discuss in detail'b' in this month\xe2\x80\x99s issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, we are troubled by the link between small study size and publication bias. Theoretically, if several small studies on a topic, each with its own small data set, are sent to publishers, the overall published results should be equivalent to the results of a single large study on that topic using a complete data set. But according to several \xe2\x80\x9cmeta-studies\xe2\x80\x9d that have been conducted, this is often not the case: rather than the small studies\xe2\x80\x99 converging on the same result as a large study when published, the small studies give a very different result.'b'The reason is that small studies generate a wide variety of results, and those studies that generate boring results or results contrary to what their authors predicted are either never submitted for publication or rejected. This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that the authors or the journal editors are being dishonest; it just means that they look for significant effects and give priority to novelty. Small studies are inherently unreliable \xe2\x80\x94 larger studies or, better still, multiple studies on the same topic, are more likely to give definitive, accurate results.'b'The rise of bite-size science is worrisome. We urge that editors demand more replication of unexpected findings and that the importance that the academic community gives to quantity of citations be balanced with a greater awareness of potential publication bias.'b'Until then, bite-size science will be hard to swallow.'b'THREE million children in this country take drugs for problems in focusing. Toward the end of last year, many of their parents were deeply alarmed because there was a 'b'shortage of drugs like Ritalin and Adderall'b' that they considered absolutely essential to their children\xe2\x80\x99s functioning.'b'But are these drugs really helping children? Should we really keep expanding the number of prescriptions filled?'b'In 30 years there has been a twentyfold increase in the consumption of drugs for attention-deficit disorder.'b'As a psychologist who has been studying the development of troubled children for more than 40 years, I believe we should be asking why we rely so heavily on these drugs.'b'Attention-deficit drugs increase concentration in the short term, which is why they work so well for college students cramming for exams. But when given to children over long periods of time, they neither improve school achievement nor reduce behavior problems. The drugs can also have serious side effects, including stunting growth.'b'Sadly, few physicians and parents seem to be aware of what we have been learning about the lack of effectiveness of these drugs.'b'What gets publicized are short-term results and studies on brain differences among children. Indeed, there are a number of incontrovertible facts that seem at first glance to support medication. It is because of this partial foundation in reality that the problem with the current approach to treating children has been so difficult to see.'b'Back in the 1960s I, like most psychologists, believed that children with difficulty concentrating were suffering from a brain problem of genetic or otherwise inborn origin. Just as Type I diabetics need insulin to correct problems with their inborn biochemistry, these children were believed to require attention-deficit drugs to correct theirs. It turns out, however, that there is little to no evidence to support this theory.'b'In 1973, I reviewed the literature on drug treatment of children for The New England Journal of Medicine. Dozens of well-controlled studies showed that these drugs immediately improved children\xe2\x80\x99s performance on repetitive tasks requiring concentration and diligence. I had conducted one of these studies myself. Teachers and parents also reported improved behavior in almost every short-term study. This spurred an increase in drug treatment and led many to conclude that the \xe2\x80\x9cbrain deficit\xe2\x80\x9d hypothesis had been confirmed.'b'But questions continued to be raised, especially concerning the drugs\xe2\x80\x99 mechanism of action and the durability of effects. Ritalin and Adderall, a combination of dextroamphetamine and amphetamine, are stimulants. So why do they appear to calm children down? Some experts argued that because the brains of children with attention problems were different, the drugs had a mysterious paradoxical effect on them.'b'However, there really was no paradox. Versions of these drugs had been given to World War II radar operators to help them stay awake and focus on boring, repetitive tasks. And when we reviewed the literature on attention-deficit drugs again in 1990 we found that all children, whether they had attention problems or not, responded to stimulant drugs the same way. Moreover, while the drugs helped children settle down in class, they actually increased activity in the playground. Stimulants generally have the same effects for all children and adults. They enhance the ability to concentrate, especially on tasks that are not inherently interesting or when one is fatigued or bored, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t improve broader learning abilities.'b'And just as in the many dieters who have used and abandoned similar drugs to lose weight, the effects of stimulants on children with attention problems fade after prolonged use. Some experts have argued that children with A.D.D. wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t develop such tolerance because their brains were somehow different. But in fact, the loss of appetite and sleeplessness in children first prescribed attention-deficit drugs do fade, and, as we now know, so do the effects on behavior. They apparently develop a tolerance to the drug, and thus its efficacy disappears. Many parents who take their children off the drugs find that behavior worsens, which most likely confirms their belief that the drugs work. But the behavior worsens because the children\xe2\x80\x99s bodies have become adapted to the drug. Adults may have similar reactions if they suddenly cut back on coffee, or stop smoking.'b'TO date, no study has found any long-term benefit of attention-deficit medication on academic performance, peer relationships or behavior problems, the very things we would most want to improve. Until recently, most studies of these drugs had not been properly randomized, and some of them had other methodological flaws.'b'But in 2009, findings were published from a well-controlled study that had been going on for more than a decade, and the results were very clear. The study randomly assigned almost 600 children with attention problems to four treatment conditions. Some received medication alone, some cognitive-behavior therapy alone, some medication plus therapy, and some were in a community-care control group that received no systematic treatment. At first this study suggested that medication, or medication plus therapy, produced the best results. However, after three years, these effects had faded, and by eight years there was no evidence that medication produced any academic or behavioral benefits.'b'Indeed, all of the treatment successes faded over time, although the study is continuing. Clearly, these children need a broader base of support than was offered in this medication study, support that begins earlier and lasts longer.'b'Nevertheless, findings in neuroscience are being used to prop up the argument for drugs to treat the hypothesized \xe2\x80\x9cinborn defect.\xe2\x80\x9d These studies show that children who receive an A.D.D. diagnosis have different patterns of neurotransmitters in their brains and other anomalies. While the technological sophistication of these studies may impress parents and nonprofessionals, they can be misleading. Of course the brains of children with behavior problems will show anomalies on brain scans. It could not be otherwise. Behavior and the brain are intertwined. Depression also waxes and wanes in many people, and as it does so, parallel changes in brain functioning occur, regardless of medication.'b'Many of the brain studies of children with A.D.D. involve examining participants while they are engaged in an attention task. If these children are not paying attention because of lack of motivation or an underdeveloped capacity to regulate their behavior, their brain scans are certain to be anomalous.'b'However brain functioning is measured, these studies tell us nothing about whether the observed anomalies were present at birth or whether they resulted from trauma, chronic stress or other early-childhood experiences. One of the most profound findings in behavioral neuroscience in recent years has been the clear evidence that the developing brain is shaped by experience.'b'It is certainly true that large numbers of children have problems with attention, self-regulation and behavior. But are these problems because of some aspect present at birth? Or are they caused by experiences in early childhood? These questions can be answered only by studying children and their surroundings from before birth through childhood and adolescence, as my colleagues at the University of Minnesota and I have been doing for decades.'b'Since 1975, we have followed 200 children who were born into poverty and were therefore more vulnerable to behavior problems. We enrolled their mothers during pregnancy, and over the course of their lives, we studied their relationships with their caregivers, teachers and peers. We followed their progress through school and their experiences in early adulthood. At regular intervals we measured their health, behavior, performance on intelligence tests and other characteristics.'b'By late adolescence, 50 percent of our sample qualified for some psychiatric diagnosis. Almost half displayed behavior problems at school on at least one occasion, and 24 percent dropped out by 12th grade; 14 percent met criteria for A.D.D. in either first or sixth grade.'b'Other large-scale epidemiological studies confirm such trends in the general population of disadvantaged children. Among all children, including all socioeconomic groups, the incidence of A.D.D. is estimated at 8 percent. What we found was that the environment of the child predicted development of A.D.D. problems. In stark contrast, measures of neurological anomalies at birth, I.Q. and infant temperament \xe2\x80\x94 including infant activity level \xe2\x80\x94 did not predict A.D.D.'b'Plenty of affluent children are also diagnosed with A.D.D. Behavior problems in children have many possible sources. Among them are family stresses like domestic violence, lack of social support from friends or relatives, chaotic living situations, including frequent moves, and, especially, patterns of parental intrusiveness that involve stimulation for which the baby is not prepared. For example, a 6-month-old baby is playing, and the parent picks it up quickly from behind and plunges it in the bath. Or a 3-year-old is becoming frustrated in solving a problem, and a parent taunts or ridicules. Such practices excessively stimulate and also compromise the child\xe2\x80\x99s developing capacity for self-regulation.'b'Putting children on drugs does nothing to change the conditions that derail their development in the first place. Yet those conditions are receiving scant attention. Policy makers are so convinced that children with attention deficits have an organic disease that they have all but called off the search for a comprehensive understanding of the condition. The National Institute of Mental Health finances research aimed largely at physiological and brain components of A.D.D. While there is some research on other treatment approaches, very little is studied regarding the role of experience. Scientists, aware of this orientation, tend to submit only grants aimed at elucidating the biochemistry.'b'Thus, only one question is asked: are there aspects of brain functioning associated with childhood attention problems? The answer is always yes. Overlooked is the very real possibility that both the brain anomalies and the A.D.D. result from experience.'b'Our present course poses numerous risks. First, there will never be a single solution for all children with learning and behavior problems. While some smaller number may benefit from short-term drug treatment, large-scale, long-term treatment for millions of children is not the answer.'b'Second, the large-scale medication of children feeds into a societal view that all of life\xe2\x80\x99s problems can be solved with a pill and gives millions of children the impression that there is something inherently defective in them.'b'Finally, the illusion that children\xe2\x80\x99s behavior problems can be cured with drugs prevents us as a society from seeking the more complex solutions that will be necessary. Drugs get everyone \xe2\x80\x94 politicians, scientists, teachers and parents \xe2\x80\x94 off the hook. Everyone except the children, that is.'b'If drugs, which studies show work for four to eight weeks, are not the answer, what is? Many of these children have anxiety or depression; others are showing family stresses. We need to treat them as individuals.'b'As for shortages, they will continue to wax and wane. Because these drugs are habit forming, Congress decides how much can be produced. The number approved doesn\xe2\x80\x99t keep pace with the tidal wave of prescriptions. By the end of this year, there will in all likelihood be another shortage, as we continue to rely on drugs that are not doing what so many well-meaning parents, therapists and teachers believe they are doing.'b'Research into the bird flu virus has set off an impassioned scientific debate over its risks and benefits. Here is a sampling.'b''b'To the Editor: 'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Bird Flu Scientists Agree to Delay Virus Research'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (news article, Jan. 21):'b'There is great debate in the scientific and public health community about what should be done regarding recent experiments in which scientists mutated H5N1 bird flu strains so that they could spread readily between ferrets.'b'Ferrets are the best model for predicting human flu transmission, so the assumption should be that this new strain would spread among humans, perhaps as easily as seasonal flu.'b'Both sides in the debate deeply value public health and are seeking to diminish the dangers of bird flu. The question is whether these new experiments increase or decrease the dangers of a bird flu pandemic.'b'Naturally occurring H5N1 bird flu has killed nearly 60 percent of the 'b'583'b' cases confirmed by the World Health Organization since 2003. Fortunately, it has not spread effectively among people. If this engineered transmissible H5N1 strain were to escape the lab by accident or intentional act, and if it maintained high lethality while spreading as effectively as seasonal flu, it could kill tens or hundreds of millions of people worldwide.'b'Those in favor of the work have argued that it will improve bird flu surveillance and vaccine development efforts. But it seems unlikely that bird flu surveillance and control programs will be substantially changed based on this research. And developing vaccines against H5N1 strains that are actually emerging in nature does not require this kind of research.'b'The potential benefits of the research do not justify the potential dangers, so the research should be discontinued. While in almost all circumstances basic research should be fully disseminated in the science community, in this case the results should not be published in a way that allows them to be replicated by others. If allowed to continue, the research should be performed only in pursuit of concrete, urgent goals under international approval and the greatest possible safety conditions.'b'TOM INGLESBY'b' Baltimore, Jan. 24, 2012'b''b''b'The writer, an infectious-disease doctor, is director of the Center for Biosecurity, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.'b''b''b'Readers React'b''b'Knowledge is always empowering, and identifying specific genetic mutations enabling a flu virus strain that rarely infects people, albeit with very high fatality rates, to become more readily transmissible among humans could prove an important contribution, possibly opening the door to targeted therapeutics and preventatives.'b'In arguing whether this research should have been done, we must keep in mind that flu strains have very high mutation rates, and the disputed mutations could well have arisen naturally at any time. The research in question was approved by peer review and financed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the federal entity with the deepest experience in evaluating and supporting studies of the most dangerous infectious organisms known, and was conducted in high security Biosafety Level 3 facilities.'b'So, I disagree with Professor Inglesby and those of like mind who seem to see only the risk side of a risk-benefit calculation.

These are necessary for university appointments and advancement, to say nothing about acceptance by colleagues.'b'The present discussion brings to mind a similar problem faced by atomic scientists just before World War II. As word of Lise Meitner\xe2\x80\x99s discovery of nuclear fission spread through Europe, the Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard took it upon himself to persuade colleagues around the world to limit public discussion related to this discovery, to prevent Nazi scientists from developing an atomic bomb.'b'It seems clear to me, as a scientist, that when our discoveries have an impact in ways that threaten humanity existentially, we must sometimes delay the gratification that comes with publicizing our findings.'b'One hopes that pertinent details concerning this extraordinarily virulent virus will be suppressed.'b'ABRAHAM R.

Those concrete goals should strongly influence the scientific agenda for H5N1 going forward.'b'I am not proposing that we create a new oversight system for biological research more broadly. But I do agree with Dr. Korn to the extent that, if this specific research is allowed to continue, it should be performed only with appropriate, international oversight and the highest biocontainment conditions.'b'Dr. Racaniello doubts the assumption that the experimental H5N1 strain would be transmissible in humans. But a recent report from leading Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists argued that \xe2\x80\x9conly the ferret model is equally well suited for studying both the pathogenicity and transmissibility of human and avian influenza viruses.\xe2\x80\x9d While no animal can perfectly predict human infection, we have to rely on the closest surrogates to make judgments. The principal scientist of the controversial H5N1 experiment said he believes that this engineered virus would spread as well as seasonal flu.'b'Dr. Alcabes believes that the numbers are exaggerated. Every year seasonal flu infects as many as a billion people. The only confirmed data we have regarding the H5N1 fatality rate is the list of W.H.O.-confirmed cases, nearly 60 percent of whom have died.'b'There is speculation that there may be many mild cases of H5N1 not in the W.H.O. database, but there are very few documented clinical cases of mild H5N1 infection. Even if the case fatality rate of this experimental strain were much lower, the consequences of a pandemic would be terrible. The 1918 flu killed about 2 percent of its victims \xe2\x80\x94 an estimated 50 million died. The global population was less than a quarter of what it is now.'b'I am not proposing, as Dr. Alcabes implies, that we should \xe2\x80\x9cban virus research.\xe2\x80\x9d On the contrary, I fully support research that diminishes the dangers of H5N1, precisely because of the lethality of the virus. But H5N1 research intended to create highly transmissible strains deserves extraordinary scrutiny.'b'To paraphrase a point made by Dr. Liboff, if discoveries have the potential to threaten humanity, we should take a different course.'b'TOM INGLESBY'b' Baltimore, Jan. 27, 2012'b''b'MIAMI'b'WHAT is it with Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s penchant for getting in tangles with blond politicians on airport tarmacs?'b'Usually, tarmacs are for joyous welcomes or teary goodbyes.

Jan Brewer of Arizona, who met Air Force One when the president landed in Phoenix.

Brewer complained afterward that she had felt \xe2\x80\x9cunnerved\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca little bit threatened\xe2\x80\x9d by Obama and that he had walked away while she was in midsentence.'b'Brewer told Monica Crowley, subbing for Sean Hannity on Fox News, that she had given the president a letter inviting him to join her at the border to discuss enforcement.

Brewer\xe2\x80\x99s grasp of facts is tenuous, after all: she told The Arizona Republic in 2010 that her father died fighting the Nazis in Germany, when he died a decade after the end of the war, which he spent working at an ammunition factory in Nevada.'b'Both of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s tarmac tiffs worked in his favor. After his encounter with Hillary, he told advisers that it was the first time he knew he could beat her because he saw fear in her eyes.'b'After his brouhaha with Brewer, dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cthe dust-up in the desert,\xe2\x80\x9d he became a hero to the Hispanics he had gone West to court.

He did not like debating, and Michelle urged him to be more visceral. He often faded onstage because he stubbornly refused to accept debates as alpha combat rather than beta seminars. He disdained anything he saw as superficial politics, from sound bites to macho put-downs.'b'If Obama continues to resist the gladiatorial subtext, while Romney embraces it, the debates could be more evenly matched than the Republicans dare to dream.'b'THE Associated Press reported last week that Fidel Castro, the former president of Cuba, wrote an opinion piece on a Cuban Web site, following a Republican Party presidential candidates\xe2\x80\x99 debate in Florida, in which he argued that the \xe2\x80\x9cselection of a Republican candidate for the presidency of this globalized and expansive empire is \xe2\x80\x94 and I mean this seriously \xe2\x80\x94 the greatest competition of idiocy and ignorance that has ever been.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When Marxists are complaining that your party\xe2\x80\x99s candidates are disconnected from today\xe2\x80\x99s global realities, it\xe2\x80\x99s generally not a good sign.

Schibbye once woke up to find a rat mussing his hair.'b'The prison is a violent, disease-ridden place, with inmates fighting and coughing blood, according to Schibbye\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Linnea Schibbye Steiner, who last met with her husband in December. It is hot in the daytime and freezing cold at night, and the two Swedes are allowed no mail or phone calls, she said. Fortunately, she added, the 250 or so Ethiopian prisoners jammed in the cell protect the two journalists, pray for them and jokingly call their bed \xe2\x80\x9cthe Swedish embassy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What was the two men\xe2\x80\x99s crime? Their offense was courage. 'b'They sneaked'b' into the Ogaden region to investigate reports of human rights abuses.'b'Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, Ethiopia\xe2\x80\x99s increasingly tyrannical ruler, seemed to be sending a signal to the world\xe2\x80\x99s journalists: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you dare mess with me!'b'So the only proper response is a careful look at Meles\xe2\x80\x99s worsening repression. Sadly, this repression is abetted by acquiescence from Washington and by grants from aid organizations.'b'Those Swedish journalists will probably be released early because of international pressure. But there will be no respite for the countless Ethiopians who face imprisonment, torture and rape.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m in Davos, Switzerland, for the annual meeting of the 'b'World Economic Forum'b', and so is Meles. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been pursuing him for the last few days, trying to confront him and ask him about his worsening pattern of brutality.'b'He has refused to see me, so I enlisted 'b'my Twitter followers'b' to report Meles sightings. I want to ask him why he has driven more journalists into exile over the last decade than any other leader in the world, 'b'according to the Committee to Protect Journalists'b' in New York City.'b'Meles has done genuine good in fighting poverty. He has some excellent officials under him, 'b'including a superb health minister'b', and Ethiopia\xe2\x80\x99s economy is making progress in health and agriculture. Ethiopia is full of aid organizations, and it has a close intelligence and military relationship with the United States government.'b'Yet since 2005, when an initial crackdown left 200 protesters dead and 30,000 detained, Meles has steadily tightened his grip. 'b'A Human Rights Watch report this month'b' noted that the government is forcibly removing tens of thousands of people from their rural homes to artificial villages where they risk starvation. Those who resist endure arrests, beatings or worse.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe repression is getting worse,\xe2\x80\x9d notes 'b'Tamerat Negera'b', who fled to the United States after the newspaper he edited was closed down in 2009. \xe2\x80\x9cHis vision seems an attempt to root out any dissent.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Meles has criminalized dissent, with 'b'a blogger named Eskinder Nega'b' now facing terrorism charges, which could mean a death sentence. His true crime was calling on the government to allow free speech and end torture.'b'Appallingly, the Meles regime uses foreign food aid to punish his critics. Ethiopia is one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest recipients of development aid, 'b'receiving about $3 billion annually'b', with the United States one of its largest donors. This money does save lives. But it also \xe2\x80\x9cunderwrites repression in Ethiopia,\xe2\x80\x9d in the words of Human Rights Watch.'b'Families and entire areas of the country are deliberately starved unless they back the government, human rights groups have shown. In Ethiopia, the verb \xe2\x80\x9cto starve\xe2\x80\x9d is transitive.'b'Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m a huge advocate of smart aid to fight global poverty. But donors and aid groups need to ensure that their aid doesn\xe2\x80\x99t buttress repression.'b'The Meles regime, run largely by a coterie from his own minority Tigrayan ethnicity, has been particularly savage in the Ogaden region, where it faces an armed uprising. When Jeffrey Gettleman, a colleague at The New York Times, went to the Ogaden in 2007, he found a pattern of torture and rape. The government then 'b'arrested Gettleman and two colleagues'b', detaining them for five days in harsh conditions.'b'The two Swedish reporters illegally entered the Ogaden and met a rebel group to examine that human rights wasteland. In December, 'b'they were sentenced to 11-year terms'b'.'b'Steiner, Schibbye\xe2\x80\x99s wife, said of the harsh conditions: \xe2\x80\x9cEleven years in an Ethiopian prison is equal to life, because you do not survive that long.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Amnesty International says'b' that in the last 11 months, the government has arrested at least 114 Ethiopian journalists and opposition politicians. It described this as \xe2\x80\x9cthe most far-reaching crackdown on freedom of expression seen in many years in Ethiopia.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Prime Minister Meles, you may have dodged me in Davos, but your brutality toward Swedish, American and Ethiopian journalists will not silence the world\xe2\x80\x99s media. You\xe2\x80\x99re just inviting more scrutiny.'b'The system for reviewing presidential appointments is broken. The Senate has a constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on the naming of judges and high-ranking executive branch officials. But the process has been hijacked by cynical partisanship and cheap tricks.'b'This is not a new problem, but it has gotten intolerably worse and is now threatening to paralyze government, as Republicans use the filibuster to try to kill off agencies they do not like. The number of unfilled judicial seats is nearing a historic high.'b'It is time to end the ability of a single senator, or group of senators, to block the confirmation process by threatening a filibuster, which can be overcome only by the vote of 60 senators. We agree with President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s call in the State of the Union address for the Senate to change its rules and require votes on judicial and executive nominees within 90 days.'b'This is a major change of position for us, and we came to it reluctantly. The filibuster has sometimes been the only way to deny life terms on the federal bench to extremist or unqualified judges. But the paralysis has become so dire that we see no other solution.'b'The president could be doing a better job of nominating judges expeditiously. Still, 85 federal judgeships are vacant, a number that has grown by 65 percent under Mr. Obama. Of those, the federal court\xe2\x80\x99s administrators consider 31 to be \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial emergencies,\xe2\x80\x9d which means other judges on courts with those openings have unmanageable caseloads.'b'Today, 18 judicial nominees wait for Senate votes even though they were approved by the Judiciary Committee, 16 unanimously. It can take a year for a nominee to receive a vote, an extraordinary hardship \xe2\x80\x94 since many cannot work while they wait \xe2\x80\x94 that threatens to reduce the pool of highly qualified candidates.'b'There are many examples. Goodwin Liu, a liberal law professor nominated last year to an appellate bench, was filibustered even though he was entirely in the legal mainstream, supported by conservatives including Kenneth Starr and Clint Bolick. His offense: He once dared to criticize Justice Samuel Alito Jr. as being too conservative.'b'Democrats used the filibuster to impose a two-year delay on President George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s appointment of Jeffrey Sutton, a highly credentialed candidate, for a federal judgeship because of his doubts about Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power to enact legislation protecting workers and consumers.'b'It is not just judicial appointments that are frozen. When Congress created a vitally needed Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as part of the financial reform law, Republicans in the Senate decided to block confirmation of a chief so the agency could not exercise its full regulatory powers.'b'This was not a matter of rejecting one choice for substantive reasons and asking for another. Republicans first told Mr. Obama that they would not confirm any head of the bureau unless he first agreed to gut its powers. Mr. Obama dropped his original choice, the highly qualified Elizabeth Warren, before she was named. Senate Republicans then blocked the confirmation vote for Richard Cordray, a strong pro-consumer leader and the bureau\xe2\x80\x99s chief of enforcement. Mr. Obama gave Mr. Cordray a recess appointment, which means he will be able to serve only until the end of 2013.'b'Senators also use filibusters to block nonpolitical positions, like the administrator of the General Services Administration \xe2\x80\x94 to demand passage of a pet project, out of pique or, most troubling, as part of the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 electoral strategy to block anything Mr. Obama wants.'b'There was an attempt to deal with this seven years ago. A bipartisan group of 14 senators agreed to prevent judicial filibusters except under \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary\xe2\x80\x9d circumstances after Republicans threatened to do away with the filibuster rule they now abuse so routinely. The center did not hold, and the agreement fell apart.'b'Under Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, during the 90-day period, hearings can be held, research conducted, objections raised, thunderous speeches given. But in the end, the senators will have to vote directly on the nominee, not hide behind the filibuster. This will require making confirmation hearings substantive events, not the Kabuki theater they are now.'b'We know it is risky. But the nation votes for a president, who needs to be able to appoint top officials and judges. The Senate needs to decide whether to give its consent or not. We can only hope that the president and the Senate will do that job responsibly, especially when both are controlled by the same party. Voters could then watch and reach their own judgments. And with fewer vacancies, government and the judiciary could do the nation\xe2\x80\x99s work.'b'BORN this way.'b'That has long been one of the rallying cries of a movement, and sometimes the gist of its argument. Across decades of widespread ostracism, followed by years of patchwork acceptance and, most recently, moments of heady triumph, gay people invoked that phrase to explain why homophobia was unwarranted and discrimination senseless.'b'Lady Gaga even spun an 'b'anthem'b' from it.'b'But is it the right mantra to cling to? The best tack to take?'b'Not for the actress Cynthia Nixon, 45, whose comments in The New York Times Magazine last Sunday raised those very questions.'b'For 15 years, until 2003, she was in a relationship with a man. They had two children together. She then formed a new family with a woman, to whom she\xe2\x80\x99s engaged. And she 'b'told'b' The Times\xe2\x80\x99s Alex Witchel that homosexuality for her \xe2\x80\x9cis a choice.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor many people it\xe2\x80\x99s not,\xe2\x80\x9d she conceded, but added that they \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t get to define my gayness for me.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'They do get to fume, though. Last week some did. They complained that she represented a minority of those in same-sex relationships and that she had furthermore handed a cudgel to our opponents, who might now cite her professed malleability as they make their case that incentives to change, not equal rights, are what we need.'b'But while her critics have good reason to worry about how her words will be construed and used, they have no right to demand the kind of silence and conformity from Nixon that gay people have justly rebelled against. She\xe2\x80\x99s entitled to her own truth and manner of expressing it.'b'\xc2\xa0Besides which, there are problems with some gay advocates\xe2\x80\x99 insistence that homosexuality be discussed and regarded as something ingrained at the first breath.'b'By hinging a whole movement on a conclusion that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been \xe2\x80\x94 and perhaps won\xe2\x80\x99t be \xe2\x80\x94 scientifically pinpointed and proved beyond all doubt, they hitch it to a moving target. The exact dynamics through which someone winds up gay are \xe2\x80\x9cstill an open question,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clinton Anderson, the director of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Concerns Office of the 'b'American Psychological Association'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is substantial evidence of various connections between genes, brain, hormones and sexual identity,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut those do not amount to a simple picture that A leads to B.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'One landmark study looked at gay men\xe2\x80\x99s brothers and found that 52 percent of identical twin brothers were also gay, in contrast with only 22 percent of nonidentical twin brothers and 11 percent of adoptive, genetically unrelated brothers. Heredity more than environment seemed to be calling the shots.'b'Other research has posited or identified common anatomical and chromosomal traits among gay men or lesbians, and there\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of a gay gene or, rather, set of genes in the mix. The push to isolate it is entwined with the belief that establishing that sexual orientation is like skin color \xe2\x80\x94 an immutable matter of biology \xe2\x80\x94 will make homophobia as inexcusable as racism and winnow the ranks of haters.'b'But bigotry isn\xe2\x80\x99t rational. Finding a determinative biological quirk, deviation or marker could prompt religious extremists who now want gays in reparative psychotherapy to focus on medical interventions instead. And a person\xe2\x80\x99s absence of agency over his or her concentration of melanin has hardly ended all discrimination against blacks.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s more, the born-this-way approach carries an unintended implication that the behavior of gays and lesbians needs biological grounding to evade condemnation. Why should it?'b'Our laws safeguard religious freedom, and that\xe2\x80\x99s not because there\xe2\x80\x99s a Presbyterian, 'b' 'b'Buddhist or Mormon gene. There\xe2\x80\x99s only a tradition and theology that you elect or decline to follow. But this country has deemed worshiping in a way that feels consonant with who you are to be essential to a person\xe2\x80\x99s humanity. So it\xe2\x80\x99s protected.'b'Our laws also safeguard the right to bear arms: not exactly a biological imperative.'b'Among adults, the right to love whom you\xe2\x80\x99re moved to love \xe2\x80\x94 and to express it through sex and maybe, yes, marriage \xe2\x80\x94 is surely as vital to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as a Glock. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot less likely to cause injury, if that\xe2\x80\x99s a deciding factor: how a person\xe2\x80\x99s actions affect the community around him or her.'b'I USE the words \xe2\x80\x9cmoved to love\xe2\x80\x9d in an effort to define the significant, important territory between \xe2\x80\x9cborn this way\xe2\x80\x9d and choice. That solid ground covers \xe2\x80\x9cbuilt this way,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9coriented this way,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cevolved this way\xe2\x80\x9d; it incorporates the possibility of a potent biological predisposition mingling with other factors beyond anyone\xe2\x80\x99s ready control; and it probably applies to Nixon herself. In a 'b'Daily Beast interview'b' after the Times article appeared, she clarified that she has experienced an unforced, undeniable attraction to individuals of both sexes. In other words, she\xe2\x80\x99s bisexual, not whimsical. She just happens not to like that term, she said.'b'In any case, concentrating on how she ended up like that misses the point.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMost people\xe2\x80\x99s sexual attractions are pretty much fixed\xe2\x80\x9d once they take root, said Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who has written extensively about homosexuality. In light of both that and the unanswered questions about what fixes them, there\xe2\x80\x99s more wisdom and less harm in accepting and respecting homosexuality than not.'b'We don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be born this way to refute the ludicrous assertion that homosexuality poses some special threat to the stability of the American family. We need only note that heterosexuality \xe2\x80\x94 as practiced by the likes of Newt Gingrich and John Edwards, for example \xe2\x80\x94 isn\xe2\x80\x99t any lucky charm, and yet no one\xe2\x80\x99s trying to heal the straights.'b'We don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be born this way to call out Chris Christie, currently'b' trying to avoid'b' responsibility for a decision about same-sex marriage in New Jersey, for being a political wimp. Andrew Cuomo showed courage and foresight in fighting successfully for such legislation in New York. Christie, who fancies himself a dauntless brawler, should do the same in the state next door.'b'I honestly have no idea if I was born this way. My memory doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stretch to the crib.'b'But I know that from the moment I felt romantic stirrings, it was Timmy, not Tammy, who could have me walking on air or wallowing in torch songs and tubs of ice cream. These feelings gelled early, and my considerable fear of society\xe2\x80\x99s censure was no match for them.'b'I know that being in a same-sex relationship feels as central and natural to me as my loyalty to my father, my pride in my siblings\xe2\x80\x99 accomplishments and my protectiveness of their children \xe2\x80\x94 all emotions that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t exit the womb with but will not soon shake.'b'And I know that I\xe2\x80\x99m a saner, kinder person this way than trapped in a contrivance or a lie. Surely that\xe2\x80\x99s not just to my advantage but to society\xe2\x80\x99s, too.'b'WHEN liberals are in a philosophical mood, they like to cast debates over the role of government not as a clash between the individual and the state, but as a conflict between the individual and the community. Liberals are for cooperation and joint effort; conservatives are for self-interest and selfishness. Liberals build the Hoover Dam and the interstate highways; conservatives sit home and dog-ear copies of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fountainhead.\xe2\x80\x9d Liberals know that it takes a village; conservatives pretend that all it takes is John Wayne.'b'In this worldview, the government is just the natural expression of our national community, and the place where we all join hands to pursue the common good. Or to borrow a line attributed to Representative Barney Frank, \xe2\x80\x9cGovernment is simply the name we give to the things we choose to do together.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Many conservatives would go this far with Frank: Government is one way we choose to work together, and there are certain things we need to do collectively that only government can do.'b'But there are trade-offs as well, which liberal communitarians don\xe2\x80\x99t always like to acknowledge. When government expands, it\xe2\x80\x99s often at the expense of alternative expressions of community, alternative groups that seek to serve the common good. Unlike most communal organizations, the government has coercive power \xe2\x80\x94 the power to regulate, to mandate and to tax. These advantages make it all too easy for the state to gradually crowd out its rivals. The more things we \xe2\x80\x9cdo together\xe2\x80\x9d as a government, in many cases, the fewer things we\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to do together in other spheres.'b'Sometimes this crowding out happens gradually, subtly, indirectly. Every tax dollar the government takes is a dollar that can\xe2\x80\x99t go to charities and churches. Every program the government runs, from education to health care to the welfare office, can easily become a kind of taxpayer-backed monopoly.'b'But sometimes the state goes further. Not content with crowding out alternative forms of common effort, it presents its rivals an impossible choice: Play by our rules, even if it means violating the moral ideals that inspired your efforts in the first place, or get out of the community-building business entirely.'b'This is exactly the choice that the 'b'White House has decided'b' to offer a host of religious institutions \xe2\x80\x94 hospitals, schools and charities \xe2\x80\x94 in the era of Obamacare. The new health care law requires that all employer-provided insurance plans cover contraception, sterilization and the morning-after (or week-after) pill known as 'b'ella'b', which can work as an abortifacient. A number of religious groups, led by the American Catholic bishops, had requested an exemption for plans purchased by their institutions. Instead, the White House has settled on an exemption that only covers religious institutions that primarily serve members of their own faith. A parish would be exempt from the mandate, in other words, but a Catholic hospital would not.'b'Ponder that for a moment. In effect, the Department of Health and Human Services is telling religious groups that if they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to pay for practices they consider immoral, they should stick to serving their own co-religionists rather than the wider public. Sectarian self-segregation is O.K., but good Samaritanism is not. The rule suggests a preposterous scenario in which a Catholic hospital avoids paying for sterilizations and the morning-after pill by closing its doors to atheists and Muslims, and hanging out a sign saying \xe2\x80\x9cno Protestants need apply.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The regulations are a particularly cruel 'b'betrayal of Catholic Democrats'b', many of whom had defended the health care law as an admirable fulfillment of Catholicism\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on social justice. Now they find that their government\xe2\x80\x99s communitarianism leaves no room for their church\xe2\x80\x99s communitarianism, and threatens to regulate it out of existence.'b'Critics of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s policy are framing this as a 'b'religious liberty issue'b', and rightly so. But what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake here is bigger even than religious freedom. The Obama White House\xe2\x80\x99s decision is a threat to 'b'any'b' kind of voluntary community that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t share the moral sensibilities of whichever party controls the health care bureaucracy.'b'The Catholic Church\xe2\x80\x99s position on contraception is not widely appreciated, to put it mildly, and many liberals are inclined to see the White House\xe2\x80\x99s decision as a blow for the progressive cause. They should think again. Once claimed, such powers tend to be used in ways that nobody quite anticipated, and the logic behind these regulations could be applied in equally punitive ways by administrations with very different values from this one.'b'The more the federal government becomes an instrument of culture war, the greater the incentive for both conservatives and liberals to expand its powers and turn them to ideological ends. It is Catholics hospitals today; it will be someone else tomorrow.'b'The White House attack on conscience is a vindication of health care reform\xe2\x80\x99s critics, who saw exactly this kind of overreach coming. But it\xe2\x80\x99s also an intimation of a darker American future, in which our voluntary communities wither away and government becomes the only word we have for the things we do together.'b'We welcomed the collapse this month of two flawed bills to prevent online piracy, bills that could have stifled speech and undermined Internet safety. But piracy by Web sites in countries like Russia and China, which offer high-quality bootleg copies of movies and music, is a real problem for the nation\xe2\x80\x99s creative industries. And there is legislation that could curb the operation of rogue Web sites without threatening legitimate expression.'b'The Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade (OPEN) Act, sponsored by Senator Ron Wyden and Representative Darrell Issa, offers a straightforward and transparent approach to the problem. Content owners could ask the International Trade Commission to investigate whether a foreign Web site was dedicated to piracy. The Web site would be able to rebut the claim. If the commission ruled for the copyright holder, it could direct payment firms like Visa and PayPal and advertising networks like Google\xe2\x80\x99s to stop doing business with the Web site.'b'The bill addresses concerns of copyright holders that the process would be too slow to match the pirates\xe2\x80\x99 speed. It would allow them to request temporary restraining orders when there is urgency to, say, stop a Russian Web site from illegally streaming the Super Bowl. That Web site would still have a chance to respond, but it would have to move more quickly to make its case.'b'The OPEN Act also avoids some of the pitfalls of the previous bills. The legislation backed by movie studios and record labels would have penalized Web sites accused of the vague crimes of enabling or assisting piracy. OPEN would penalize only Web sites dedicated \xe2\x80\x9cwillfully and primarily\xe2\x80\x9d to the infringement of copyrights or trademarks, a well-established standard used in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to prevent domestic piracy.'b'OPEN would not give copyright holders the authority to direct payment processors and ad networks to stop doing business with a given Web site: that would have opened a door for abuse. And the Justice Department would not be able to \xe2\x80\x9cdisappear\xe2\x80\x9d rogue Web sites by tinkering with their addresses \xe2\x80\x94 a provision too much like hacking, which worried safety experts.'b'By giving the International Trade Commission sole authority to determine infringement, OPEN would also prevent copyright holders from shopping around for sympathetic courts, making the process more consistent and less likely to spark trade conflicts and retaliatory moves.'b'The new bill may not be perfect; some Web sites that aid or abet pirates may avoid punishment. But it gives copyright holders powerful new tools to protect themselves. And it goes a long way toward addressing the concerns of Internet companies, protecting legitimate expression on the Web from overzealous content owners. The two sides need to move beyond their resentments and push for its passage.'b'When the last American troops came home from Iraq in December, thousands of Iraqis who had worked with the Americans were left behind. Many have already been targeted by militants, and some had taken refuge on American military bases. But once the bases were closed \xe2\x80\x94 or handed over to the Iraqi government \xe2\x80\x94 those Iraqis were forced into hiding. Unless Washington lives up to its moral obligation, many more will suffer or be killed.'b'The Special Immigrant Visa program was enacted by Congress in 2007 for Iraqis who helped the military, other parts of the American government and military contractors. It authorized 5,000 special visas annually \xe2\x80\x94 but only 3,317 were granted through 2011. Iraqis who aided American non-governmental organizations and media outlets can apply under the refugee program and are also having a hard time. But the special visa program has the worst delays.'b'Because of security vetting, processing has always been slow. The programs came to a near halt last year when two Iraqis living in Kentucky were charged with providing arms and money to Al Qaeda. The Obama administration then imposed additional security checks on all applicants. Approval in the Special Immigrant Visa program is now taking at least a year.'b'The American government never kept track of how many Iraqis it employed, so no one knows how many thousands of Iraqis are potentially eligible for admission. It is unclear exactly how many thousands of those Iraqis have visa applications pending. The administration refused to disclose a number last week.'b'Last July, 'b'the Iraqi Refugee Assistance Project'b' at the Urban Justice Center, a nonprofit, put the estimate at 62,000 Iraqis, including 29,000 who worked for the Americans, plus their family members. The group now says it has been told that 19,000 cases were dropped from the process, perhaps because people went into hiding, or they were just lost track of. The Philadelphia Inquirer recently used a figure of 15,000 Special Immigrant Visa applicants.'b'The United States has a responsibility to rigorously screen visa applicants and ensure they pose no threat to this country. The process needs to be transparent and accountable \xe2\x80\x94 and it needs to work expeditiously.'b'Today, Iraq is more stable than it was at the height of the violence, but with American troops gone, sectarianism and bloodshed are on the rise. The State Department is concerned enough about safety trends that this month it again formally warned Americans against all but essential travel to Iraq. There should be as much concern for the Iraqis who risked their lives to work with Americans \xe2\x80\x94 and are still living there and still at risk.'b'In November, a federal advisory board recommended that two scientific papers describing research that created strains of bird flu potentially transmissible in humans should be published only if key details are omitted. The fear is that terrorists or hostile nations could learn how to cause a pandemic. This week we will finally find out how the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity reached its conclusion.'b'Advocates of the research have protested that public health will suffer if a wide range of scientists are unable to fully study how the avian virus might be altered or develop the capacity to spread easily among humans. Opponents believe the experiments should never have been done without more rigorous analysis of the risks; some want the most lethal of the new viruses destroyed'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not clear why the National Institutes of Health, which financed the research and coordinates the board, decided not to release the statement in December, when it was approved by all 23 voting board members. The board sent the statement to the two journals \xe2\x80\x94 Science and Nature \xe2\x80\x94 that plan to publish the papers, but board members feared it could languish for months. Now, we are told, the journals plan to release the statement on Feb. 1.'b'The document is unlikely to settle the argument. It deals only with the threat posed by publishing details of the research, not with the even greater risk should the virus escape or be stolen from the laboratory. Even so, it should be made public now, while scientists and health officials are planning forums to debate the pros and cons of such research and whether similar work should proceed in the future.'b'We believe in robust research and almost always oppose censorship. But in this case the risks \xe2\x80\x94 of doing the work and publishing the results \xe2\x80\x94 far outweigh the benefits. Scientists and the public need to see how many eminent experts are less worried about censorship than about evildoers using the information to wreak havoc.\xc2\xa0'b''b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'Groundhog Day \xe2\x80\x94 celebrated this Thursday \xe2\x80\x94 is a holiday specifically for discussing the weather, as if people were otherwise silent on the subject.

After months of profound hibernation, drugged by the body fat of summer, a groundhog sometimes, on a mild winter day, pokes its head out of its burrow. What it thinks, no one knows.

Follow up as necessary to get a response that actually is responsive. Confirm the accuracy of the source and the truth of the response. Give the politician an opportunity to respond to contradictory data and information.'b'In this way, journalism will be doing its job to inform us.

Jones presents the disturbing possibility that the answer is yes. In Jones, the court held that long-term GPS surveillance of a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s car violated the Fourth Amendment. The justices\xe2\x80\x99 9-to-0 decision to protect constitutional liberty from invasive police use of technology was celebrated across the ideological spectrum.'b'Perhaps too quickly.

Heat sensors. Helicopter flyovers. Are these \xe2\x80\x9csearches\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment? The court has struggled with these questions over the years.'b'Writing for the court in Jones, Justice 'b'Antonin Scalia'b' looked to the 18th century for guidance. In his view, attaching the GPS was the sort of physical invasion of property the framers had in mind when they wrote the Bill of Rights.'b'Though Justice 'b'Samuel A. Alito Jr.'b' agreed that GPS tracking was a search, he ridiculed Justice Scalia for focusing on \xe2\x80\x9cconduct that might have provided grounds in 1791 for a suit for trespass to chattels.\xe2\x80\x9d For Justice Alito, the risk the GPS posed was loss of privacy, not property. Instead the question was whether long-term GPS tracking violated 'b'today\xe2\x80\x99s'b' \xe2\x80\x9creasonable expectations of privacy,\xe2\x80\x9d not those of another era. As a matter of existing doctrine, he asked the right question, but when applied to the government, the standard he used could turn our lives into the proverbial open book, and soon.'b'Focusing on public expectations of privacy means that our rights change when technology does. As Justice Alito blithely said: \xe2\x80\x9cNew technology may provide increased convenience or security at the expense of privacy, and many people may find the tradeoff worthwhile.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But aren\xe2\x80\x99t constitutional rights intended to protect our liberty even when the public accepts \xe2\x80\x9cincreased convenience or security at the expense of privacy\xe2\x80\x9d? Fundamental rights remain fundamental in the face of time and new inventions.'b'Paradoxically, Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s approach will better protect privacy rights over the long term. (He didn\xe2\x80\x99t deny the importance of today\xe2\x80\x99s expectations; he simply stressed that at the very least, the Fourth Amendment protects rights we had when the framers drafted the Constitution.) Still, his approach is problematic. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t always an available 18th-century analog for current government conduct, like GPS tracking. Justice Alito facetiously suggested that the only 18th-century analog would have been a constable hiding in the back of someone\xe2\x80\x99s carriage. (When Justice Scalia agreed, Justice Alito wryly remarked that \xe2\x80\x9cthis would have required either a gigantic coach, a very tiny constable, or both.\xe2\x80\x9d) And when 18th-century analogs run out, the court is left with its reasonable expectation test.'b'In a related case, Kyllo v. United States, even Justice Scalia held that police use of a thermal imager to detect 'b'marijuana'b' \xe2\x80\x9cgrow lamps\xe2\x80\x9d within a home was a search \xe2\x80\x94 but only so long as such technology was \xe2\x80\x9cnot in general public use.\xe2\x80\x9d There\xe2\x80\x99s that time bomb: expanding use of technology narrows rights.'b'Among the justices in the Jones case, only Sonia Sotomayor insisted that fundamental rights not be hostage to technological change. She called into question the court\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding reliance on expectations of privacy, which she deemed \xe2\x80\x9cill-suited to the digital age.\xe2\x80\x9d She suggested reconsidering the rule that the police can, without a warrant, get the vast amounts of information about ourselves that we give to third parties. To her, sharing our secrets \xe2\x80\x94 including e-mail and banking histories \xe2\x80\x94 with someone else does not necessarily mean the government gets access, too.

Rap songs in Arabic in particular \xe2\x80\x94 the new lingua franca of the hip-hop world \xe2\x80\x94 have spread through YouTube, Facebook, mixtapes, ringtones and MP3s from Tunisia to Egypt, Libya and Algeria, helping to disseminate ideas and anthems as the insurrections progressed. El G\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9ral, for example, was featured on a mixtape put out by the dissident group Khalas (Enough) in Libya, which also included songs like \xe2\x80\x9cTripoli Is Calling\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cDirty Colonel.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Why has rap \xe2\x80\x94 an American music that in its early global spread was associated with thuggery and violence \xe2\x80\x94 come to be so highly influential in these regions? After all, rappers are not the only musicians involved in politics. Late last week, protests erupted when Youssou N\xe2\x80\x99Dour, a Senegalese singer of mbalax, a fusion of traditional music with Latin, pop and jazz, was barred by a constitutional court from pursuing a run for president. But mbalax singers are typically seen as older entertainers who often support the government in power. In contrast, rappers, according to the Senegalese rapper 'b'Keyti'b', \xe2\x80\x9care closer to the streets and can bring into their music the general feeling of frustration among people.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Another reason is the oratorical style rap employs: rappers report in a direct manner that cuts through political subterfuge. Rapping can simulate a political speech or address, rhetorical conventions that are generally inaccessible to the marginal youth who form the base of this movement. And in places like Senegal, rap follows in the oral traditions of West African griots, who often used rhyming verse to evaluate their political leaders. \xe2\x80\x9cM.C.\xe2\x80\x99s are the modern griot,\xe2\x80\x9d Papa Moussa Lo, a k a Waterflow, told me in an interview a few weeks ago. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are taking over the role of representing the people.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Although many of these rappers style themselves as revolutionary upstarts, they are most concerned with protecting a constitutional order that they see as being trampled by unscrupulous politicians. On \xe2\x80\x9cCoup 2 Gueule,\xe2\x80\x9d Thiat accuses President Abdoulaye Wade of election fraud and of siphoning money from Senegal\xe2\x80\x99s Chemical Industries company (I.C.S.) and the African air traffic management organization (Asecna). He raps in Wolof, the dominant language in Senegal, \xe2\x80\x9cOld man, your seven-year presidential reign has been expensive/As if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough that you cheated during the last elections/You ruined the I.C.S. and hijacked Asecna\xe2\x80\x99s money.\xe2\x80\x9d (It flows better in Wolof.)'b'Most of these rappers made music prior to the political events that swept their countries. But by speaking boldly and openly about a political reality that was not being otherwise acknowledged, rappers hit a nerve, and their music served as a call to arms for the budding protest movements. In Egypt, the rapper Mohamed el Deeb told me in a recent interview, \xe2\x80\x9cshallow pop music and love songs got heavy airplay on the radio, but when the revolution broke out, people woke up and refused to accept shallow music with no substance.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As the Arab revolutions and African protests are ousting and discrediting establishment politicians, the young populations of these regions are looking to rappers as voices of clarity and leadership. Waterflow raises money at his shows to support his community because, like many of his fans, he believes that \xe2\x80\x9cwaiting for our political leaders to give us opportunities is a waste of time.\xe2\x80\x9d Other Senegalese rappers helped found the movement Y\xe2\x80\x99en a Marre (\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re Fed Up\xe2\x80\x9d), which has crystallized opposition to President Wade and led a campaign to register young voters for the elections next month. Some are even supporting candidates for president. The rapper Keyti does not back the candidacy of Mr. N\xe2\x80\x99Dour, because he thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to run out of self-interest, but acknowledges that it \xe2\x80\x9cwas much needed to make people realize how politicians have failed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Rappers are hoping to inaugurate a different kind of politics. They would sooner make a pilgrimage to the South Bronx than to the Senegalese, Sufi holy city of Touba; they reject the predefined roles available within the political arena. And we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forget that despite being thrust into the spotlight at a historic moment, rappers are also artists who want to make their music. As Deeb raps in his song \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Masrah Deeb'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Deeb\xe2\x80\x99s Stage) \xe2\x80\x94 written in the early days of the Egyptian revolution to remind people why they were taking to the streets \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a dictator/Deeb\xe2\x80\x99s a doctor in the beat department.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'THE Police Department has the formidable responsibility of keeping New Yorkers safe from a terrorist attack. It is entrusted with significant powers and broad discretion in how to use them. It has done an admirable job in preventing violence. But last week, we were reminded that no government entity with such powers should operate free from independent oversight.'b'The controversy centers around the department\xe2\x80\x99s use of a 2008 documentary film, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Third Jihad,\xe2\x80\x9d in training officers. The film aims to scare Americans into thinking that the United States is under attack from a shadowy conspiracy of Muslim groups that, it claims, pretend to be part of mainstream society while plotting its downfall. The film features cameo appearances by a number of officials, including Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly. Its use in training set back relations with the city\xe2\x80\x99s Muslim community, which is estimated at around 800,000 and whose members have been vital partners in combating terrorism.'b'After The Village Voice first 'b'reported'b', a year ago, on the film\xe2\x80\x99s use in training, the police claimed that it had been shown only once or twice and that the clip of Mr. Kelly had been lifted from previous film footage. Faced with newly released 'b'documents'b' demonstrating that the film was viewed by nearly 1,500 police officers and that Mr. Kelly was in fact interviewed by its producers, the department now acknowledges the truth, but maintains that the decision to show the film was the 'b'isolated error'b' of a single sergeant.'b'A similar pattern was evident when The Associated Press 'b'revealed'b' last August that the Police Department had been spying on Muslims as they prayed, ate and went about daily life. The police flatly denied the existence of the program. After The A.P. released documents about a \xe2\x80\x9cDemographics Unit\xe2\x80\x9d assigned to map Muslim communities, the police were forced to acknowledge the program, but 'b'minimized'b' its significance. At a City Council hearing, Mr. Kelly gave few details about the program and said the police were following the law.'b'Contrast this response with the reaction of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. when recently presented with similar issues. When it came to light that the F.B.I. had been using anti-Muslim training materials, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. 'b'denounced'b' their use and immediately ordered a comprehensive review. In response to allegations that the C.I.A.\xe2\x80\x99s cooperation with the police had blurred the line between foreign and domestic spying, the C.I.A.\xe2\x80\x99s inspector general 'b'reviewed the relationship'b' and concluded that a C.I.A. officer embedded with the police hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been sufficiently supervised. On Friday, Mr. Kelly said the officer would 'b'leave'b' in April.'b'History is filled with examples of law enforcement and intelligence officials overreaching during moments of perceived national security crisis. In the 1970s, the Church Committee 'b'investigated'b' both the F.B.I. and C.I.A. for spying on the political activities of Americans during the Vietnam War. These investigations led to the creation of oversight mechanisms: the F.B.I., for example, has benefited from Congressional oversight and a robust 'b'inspector general'b' who has uncovered a number of illegalities in the F.B.I.\xe2\x80\x99s counterterrorism programs.'b'The Police Department is a different story. Unlike other major city agencies, it is exempt from the jurisdiction of the Department of Investigation, which investigates corruption, incompetence and unethical or other forms of misconduct. The Internal Affairs Bureau, which investigates allegations of corruption and misconduct, and the 'b'Civilian Complaint Review Board'b', which looks into complaints from the public about police mistreatment, focus on individual accusations of wrongdoing. The City Council has shown little interest in examining police counterterrorism or using its subpoena power to force disclosure of information, in part because some politicians are fearful of appearing soft on crime.'b'History shows that any attempt to oversee the police will be met with great resistance by the department and its political allies. But no agency is immune from mistakes. When the stakes are as high as they are in fighting terrorism, there must be a mechanism to identify excesses and wrongdoing.'b'We need an independent inspector general for the Police Department. Such an official would have seen the film scandal for what it is: not the error of one sergeant, but an indication that procedures for authorizing training materials are lacking. Oversight makes government stronger, not weaker.'b'In November, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg 'b'described'b' the Police Department as \xe2\x80\x9cthe seventh biggest army in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d Effective oversight of such a potent force is a necessity \xe2\x80\x94 not a luxury \xe2\x80\x94 for the country\xe2\x80\x99s largest city.'b'Scotland, Conn.'b'YOU\xe2\x80\x99VE got to feel sorry for the American Psychiatric Association, at least for a moment. Its members proposed a change to the 'b'definition of autism'b' in the fifth edition of their Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, one that would eliminate the separate category of Asperger syndrome in 2013. And the next thing they knew, a prominent psychiatrist was quoted in a front-page article in this paper saying the result would be fewer diagnoses, which would mean fewer troubled children eligible for services like special education and disability payments.'b'Then, just a few days later, another front-pager featured a pair of equally prominent experts explaining their smackdown of the A.P.A.\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to eliminate the \xe2\x80\x9cbereavement exclusion\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the two months granted the grieving before their mourning can be classified as \xe2\x80\x9cmajor\xe2\x80\x9d depression.

The D.S.M. is the offspring of odd bedfellows: the medical industry, with its focus on germs and other biochemical causes of disease, and psychoanalysis, the now-largely-discredited discipline that attributes our psychological suffering to our individual and collective history.'b'This tension has been high since at least 1917. That\xe2\x80\x99s when Thomas Salmon, a future head of the A.P.A. \xe2\x80\x94 which was founded in 1844 \xe2\x80\x94 noted that psychiatry\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cclassification of mental diseases is chaotic.\xe2\x80\x9d He worried that \xe2\x80\x9cthis condition of affairs discredits the science of psychiatry and reflects unfavorably upon our association\xe2\x80\x9d and urged his membership to forge a diagnostic system \xe2\x80\x9cthat would meet the scientific demands of the present day.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The American Psychiatric Association has been trying to do just that ever since, mostly by leaving behind ideas about the meaning of our suffering in favor of observation and treatment of its symptoms. In 1980, it hit on the strategy of adopting a medical rhetoric, organizing those symptoms into neat disease categories and checklists of precisely described criteria and publishing them in the hefty \xe2\x80\x94 and, according to its chief author, \xe2\x80\x9cvery scientific-looking\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 D.S.M.-III.'b'That book, with its more than 200 objectively described diagnoses, would have made Dr. Salmon proud. By meeting the scientific demands of the day, it was credited by many with having rescued psychiatry from the brink of extinction, and its subsequent revisions have been the cornerstone of the profession\xe2\x80\x99s survival as a medical specialty.'b'But as all those Diagnostic and Statistical Manuals have stated clearly in their introductions, while the book seems to name the mental illnesses found in nature, it actually makes \xe2\x80\x9cno assumption that each category of mental disorder is a completely discrete entity with absolute boundaries dividing it from other mental disorders or no mental disorder.\xe2\x80\x9d And as any psychiatrist involved in the making of the D.S.M. will freely tell you, the disorders listed in the book are not \xe2\x80\x9creal diseases,\xe2\x80\x9d at least not like measles or hepatitis. Instead, they are useful constructs that capture the ways that people commonly suffer. The manual, they go on, was primarily written to give physicians, schooled in the language of disease, a way to recognize similarities and differences among their patients and to talk to one another about them. And it has been fairly successful at that.'b'Still, \xe2\x80\x9cpeople take it literally,\xe2\x80\x9d one psychiatrist who worked on the manual told me. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is its strength in a political sense.\xe2\x80\x9d And even if the A.P.A. benefits mightily from that misperception, the troubles on the front page are not the organization\xe2\x80\x99s fault. They are what happens when we expect the D.S.M. to be what it is not. \xe2\x80\x9cThe D.S.M. has been taken too seriously,\xe2\x80\x9d another expert told me. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the victim of its success.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Psychiatrists would like the book to deserve a more serious take, and thus to be less subject to these embarrassing diagnostic squabbles. But this is going to require them to have what the rest of medicine already possesses: the biochemical markers that allow doctors to sort the staph from the strep, the malignant from the benign. And they don\xe2\x80\x99t have these yet. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t even close. The human brain, after all, may be the most complex object in the universe. And the few markers, the genes and the neural networks, that have been implicated in mental disorders do not map well onto the D.S.M.\xe2\x80\x99s categories.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re like Cinderella\xe2\x80\x99s older stepsisters,\xe2\x80\x9d a psychiatrist told me the other day. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re trying to stick our fat feet into the delicate slipper so the prince can take us to the ball. But we ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to the ball right now.\xe2\x80\x9d Which is why we might feel a little sorry for the beleaguered A.P.A.'b'On the other hand, given that the current edition of the D.S.M. has earned the association \xe2\x80\x94 which holds and tightly guards its naming rights to our pain \xe2\x80\x94 more than $100 million, we might want to temper our sympathy. It may not be dancing at the ball, but once every mental health worker, psychology student and forensic lawyer in the country buys the new book, it will be laughing all the way to the bank.'b'It was good news that the Obama administration withstood pressure from Roman Catholic bishops and social conservatives to deny contraceptive coverage for millions of American women who work for religiously affiliated employers. Kathleen Sebelius, the Health and Human Services secretary, rejected broad exemptions from a new rule requiring all health plans to cover birth control, without a deductible or co-payment.'b'The requirement, announced last August, contains an exemption for employees of churches and other houses of worship. But it properly covers employees of hospitals, universities, charitable groups and other entities that are associated with religious organizations but serve the general public and employ people of different faiths. The final version of the rule gives certain nonprofit employers an extra year to comply. The administration\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to affordable birth control is welcome at a moment when women\xe2\x80\x99s access to reproductive health care, including contraceptives, cancer screenings and abortion services, is under assault in the courts, state legislatures and Congress, as well as on the Republican campaign trail.'b'Earlier this month, for example, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit lifted a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of a new Texas law requiring doctors to show women seeking an abortion a fetal sonogram. It forces doctors to describe the image and play the sound of the fetal heartbeat, despite a woman\xe2\x80\x99s wishes or a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s ethical objections.'b'This outrageous intrusion into the doctor-patient relationship tramples on the First Amendment rights of physicians and their patients. The 'b'opinion'b', written by the court\xe2\x80\x99s chief judge, Edith Jones, a vocal opponent of abortion rights, brushes aside the free-speech violation.'b'The Supreme Court has approved of laws requiring doctors to offer material describing fetal development and to inform patients before an abortion about possible risks of the procedure. Texas\xe2\x80\x99s more intrusive requirement is wholly unnecessary for informed consent and is intended to dissuade women from having the procedure.'b'It does not bode well that the panel that struck down the injunction retained jurisdiction over future appeals. The immediate impact of the ruling will be to encourage other states to adopt similar laws impinging on women\xe2\x80\x99s access to a constitutionally protected medical procedure.'b'With rising special-interest spending in state judicial elections, there is an urgent need to protect judicial integrity from the flood of campaign cash. Tennessee is leading the way with a new rule prohibiting judges from hearing cases when campaign spending by lawyers or litigants raises a reasonable question of their impartiality.'b'Adopted earlier this month by the Tennessee Supreme Court, the recusal rule applies to both direct contributions and independent expenditures favoring a judge\xe2\x80\x99s election. It requires judges to step aside when the level of campaign support raises a reasonable concern about his or her ability to be fair. Judges who deny a recusal request will need to provide their reasons in writing, and the final word on recusal will not be left to the challenged judge. The litigants will have a chance to appeal recusal decisions to the court\xe2\x80\x99s other judges.'b'The United States Supreme Court in a 2009 case recognized the potential threat to public trust in the justice system posed by outsized campaign spending in judicial elections. But few of the 38 states that elect their top judges have tried to combat the problem with more rigorous recusal rules. If special interests knew their campaign spending would be likely to trigger recusal, they might not try as hard to buy up judges.'b'Tennessee\xe2\x80\x99s good model should help prod court leaders in other jurisdictions to follow suit. Campaign spending problems have plagued judicial races in states like Illinois, Alabama and Pennsylvania. A sensible rule on recusal would significantly increase public confidence in judicial integrity.'b'Gov. Chris Christie\xe2\x80\x99s announcement last week that he would veto a measure to legalize same-sex marriage in New Jersey is maddening, but sadly predictable. He vowed to block marriage equality when he ran for office in 2009 and is now calling for a statewide referendum.'b'Supporters of marriage equality in the State Legislature need to press on. To turn what is a matter of civil rights over to voters would be an abdication of lawmakers\xe2\x80\x99 duty. It would also be a sharp break with New Jersey tradition. The last time the state held a referendum on civil rights was 1915, when a majority voted \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d on granting women the right to vote.'b'It appears there are enough votes in the Democratic-controlled Legislature to approve marriage equality, and legislative leaders should seize the moment. Just getting the measure to Mr. Christie\xe2\x80\x99s desk would be an important milestone. It would add momentum to the cause of equal rights beyond New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s borders.'b'Rounding up sufficient Republican votes for a veto override would be hard but not impossible. Under New Jersey law, the Legislature would have until January 2014, when the current two-year legislative session ends, to undo the governor\xe2\x80\x99s action with a two-thirds vote in both the Senate and Assembly.'b'Instead of blocking justice for gay people, some governors are actually leading the way. Gov. Andrew Cuomo set an inspiring example last year with his successful fight to allow same-sex couples to marry in New York. Now, Gov. Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley of Maryland and Gov. Christine Gregoire of Washington, both Democrats, are leading the drive for marriage equality in their states. New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s lawmakers will have to achieve that goal on their own.'b'The $259 billion in budget cuts over the next five years announced by the Pentagon may sound like a lot. But they are mainly a scaling back of previously projected spending \xe2\x80\x94 the delights of the Washington budget games.'b'This year, Pentagon spending will total $531 billion. In 2017, it will rise to $567 billion. Factoring in inflation, that amounts to only a minuscule 1.6 percent real cut. (Both numbers exclude war spending \xe2\x80\x94 $115 billion this year.)'b'After a decade of unrestrained Pentagon spending increases, President Obama deserves credit for putting on the brakes. The cuts are a credible down payment on his pledge to reduce projected defense spending by $487 billion in the next decade. They are not going to be enough. In the likely absence of a bipartisan budget pact, a further automatic across-the-board 10-year cut of nearly $500 billion is to take effect starting next January.'b'Even if a last-minute deal heads that off, the country needs to find more savings. And there is still plenty of room to cut deeper without jeopardizing national security.'b'Early in January, President Obama 'b'outlined'b' a new, more pragmatic defense strategy. Republicans predictably claimed he was hollowing out the force \xe2\x80\x94 but a smarter, more restrained use of force is just what the country needs to secure its vital interests.'b'Much of the savings will come from cutting the size of the Army and Marine Corps by almost 13 percent and stretching out purchases of planes and ships. At the same time, the military will buy more unpiloted drones, add special operations units, equip submarines to carry more cruise missiles and expand its cyberwarfare capacities.'b'That makes sense in a world where terrorism and unconventional attacks are a primary threat. Any plan to downsize ground forces must be matched by a credible plan to quickly build them up, if necessary.'b'The Pentagon also proposes a new round of domestic base closings, a less generous formula for military pay raises after 2015 and higher health insurance premiums for military retirees (families of working-age retirees now pay $500 annually), all of which we strongly support.'b'Unfortunately, that new thinking has been dragged down by some old-style budgetary inertia. Mr. Obama needs to push the Pentagon to do better. Here are some additional cuts that make sense:'b''b'SHRINK THE F-35 PROGRAM 'b'The total order of stealth fighters should be reduced to 1,000, from 2,440, saving more than $150 billion. The F-35 was designed as a low-cost, supercapable aircraft. It has become the costliest Pentagon procurement project ever and its performance has been disappointing. The Air Force, Navy and Marines need to cut their losses. Most of the savings would not come until the 2020s. Over $20 billion could be saved this decade by canceling the troubled Marine Corps variant.'b''b'CUT THE NUCLEAR BUDGET 'b'Mr. Obama has declared his commitment to arms control, but there is no reflection of that in the budget plan. He needs to back it up with significant cuts in the number of deployed strategic nuclear weapons, ballistic missile submarines and intercontinental ballistic missiles. Senator Tom Coburn, a Republican, offers a sensible 'b'plan'b' to do that, and estimates that it could save $79 billion over the next decade.'b''b'GO TO 10 AIRCRAFT CARRIER GROUPS 'b'The Pentagon could save $4 billion to $8 billion over a decade by revisiting the president\xe2\x80\x99s unwise decision not to eliminate one of the 11 aircraft carriers with associated ships and aircraft. Ten would provide more than enough surge capacity to support naval air operations anywhere in the world.'b'We know that it is politically easier to continue programs that outlive their usefulness or outrun their cost estimates \xe2\x80\x94 especially when Republican politicians are so eager to promise the Pentagon a blank check. And especially when the defense industry and its lobbyists are spreading so much cash around on Capitol Hill. But the country cannot afford to continue on this way. And there is no strategic argument for doing so. The era of hard choices at the Pentagon has barely begun.'b'Last week the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a British think tank, released a startling chart comparing the current slump with past recessions and recoveries. It turns out that by one important measure \xe2\x80\x94 changes in real G.D.P. since the recession began \xe2\x80\x94 Britain is doing worse this time than it did during the Great Depression. Four years into the Depression, British G.D.P. had regained its previous peak; four years after the Great Recession began, Britain is nowhere close to regaining its lost ground.'b'Nor is Britain unique. 'b'Italy is also doing worse'b' than it did in the 1930s \xe2\x80\x94 and with Spain clearly headed for a double-dip recession, that makes three of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s big five economies members of the worse-than club. Yes, there are some caveats and complications. But this nonetheless represents a stunning failure of policy.'b'And it\xe2\x80\x99s a failure, in particular, of the austerity doctrine that has dominated elite policy discussion both in Europe and, to a large extent, in the United States for the past two years.'b'O.K., about those caveats: On one side, British unemployment was much higher in the 1930s than it is now, because the British economy was depressed \xe2\x80\x94 mainly thanks to an ill-advised return to the gold standard \xe2\x80\x94 even before the Depression struck. On the other side, Britain had a notably mild Depression compared with the United States.'b'Even so, surpassing the track record of the 1930s shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a tough challenge. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t we learned a lot about economic management over the last 80 years? Yes, we have \xe2\x80\x94 but in Britain and elsewhere, the policy elite decided to throw that hard-won knowledge out the window, and rely on ideologically convenient wishful thinking instead.'b'Britain, in particular, was supposed to be a showcase for \xe2\x80\x9cexpansionary austerity,\xe2\x80\x9d the notion that instead of increasing government spending to fight recessions, you should slash spending instead \xe2\x80\x94 and that this would lead to faster economic growth. \xe2\x80\x9cThose who argue that dealing with our deficit and promoting growth are somehow alternatives are wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d declared David Cameron, Britain\xe2\x80\x99s prime minister. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot put off the first in order to promote the second.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'How could the economy thrive when unemployment was already high, and government policies were directly reducing employment even further? Confidence! \xe2\x80\x9cI firmly believe,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Jean-Claude Trichet \xe2\x80\x94 at the time the president of the European Central Bank, and a strong advocate of the doctrine of expansionary austerity \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cthat in the current circumstances confidence-inspiring policies will foster and not hamper economic recovery, because confidence is the key factor today.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Such invocations of the confidence fairy were never plausible; 'b'researchers at the International Monetary Fund'b' and elsewhere quickly debunked the supposed evidence that spending cuts create jobs. Yet influential people on both sides of the Atlantic heaped praise on the prophets of austerity, Mr. Cameron in particular, because the doctrine of expansionary austerity dovetailed with their ideological agendas.'b'Thus in October 2010 David Broder, who virtually embodied conventional wisdom, 'b'praised Mr. Cameron'b' for his boldness, and in particular for \xe2\x80\x9cbrushing aside the warnings of economists that the sudden, severe medicine could cut short Britain\xe2\x80\x99s economic recovery and throw the nation back into recession.\xe2\x80\x9d He then called on President Obama to \xe2\x80\x9cdo a Cameron\xe2\x80\x9d and pursue \xe2\x80\x9ca radical rollback of the welfare state now.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Strange to say, however, those warnings from economists proved all too accurate. And we\xe2\x80\x99re quite fortunate that Mr. Obama did not, in fact, do a Cameron.'b'Which is not to say that all is well with U.S. policy. True, the federal government has avoided all-out austerity. But state and local governments, which must run more or less balanced budgets, have slashed spending and employment as federal aid runs out \xe2\x80\x94 and this has been a major drag on the overall economy. Without those spending cuts, we might already have been on the road to self-sustaining growth; as it is, recovery still hangs in the balance.'b'And we may get tipped in the wrong direction by Continental Europe, where austerity policies are having the same effect as in Britain, with many signs pointing to recession this year.'b'The infuriating thing about this tragedy is that it was completely unnecessary. Half a century ago, any economist \xe2\x80\x94 or for that matter any undergraduate who had read Paul Samuelson\xe2\x80\x99s textbook \xe2\x80\x9cEconomics\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 could have told you that austerity in the face of depression was a very bad idea. But policy makers, pundits and, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say, many economists decided, largely for political reasons, to forget what they used to know. And millions of workers are paying the price for their willful amnesia.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'In \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Free-Market Socialism'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (column, Jan. 24), David Brooks criticizes both parties for choosing the wrong paths to address new economic challenges. But his critique of Democrats as shifting \xe2\x80\x9ctheir emphasis from lifting up the poor to pounding down the rich\xe2\x80\x9d is simplified and wrong.'b'Democrats in the House are fighting for the very initiatives Mr. Brooks demands, including early childhood education. The problem is, Where do we get the resources for such investments in a fiscally responsible way?'b'Democrats say that people who did exceptionally well over the last few years and are now paying historically low effective tax rates should pay a little more. Republicans in the House have said raising revenues from the rich to rebuild the middle class is off the table.'b'This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a matter of \xe2\x80\x9cpounding down the rich\xe2\x80\x9d; it is a matter of common sense: how does society pay for the very investments that Mr. Brooks seeks to strengthen society?'b'STEVE ISRAEL'b'\nMember of Congress, 2nd Dist., N.Y.'b'\nWashington, Jan. 24, 2012'b''b''b'FEW people realize that getting pregnant can mean losing your job. Imagine a woman who, seven months into her pregnancy, is fired from her position as a cashier because she needed a few extra bathroom breaks. Or imagine another pregnant employee who was fired from her retail job after giving her supervisors a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s note requesting she be allowed to refrain from heavy lifting and climbing ladders during the month and a half before her maternity leave: that\xe2\x80\x99s what happened to Patricia Leahy. In 2008 a federal judge in Brooklyn ruled that her firing was fair because her employers were not obligated to accommodate her needs.'b'We see this kind of case in our legal clinic all the time. It happens every day to pregnant women in the United States, and it happens thanks to a gap between discrimination laws and disability laws.'b'Federal and state laws ban discrimination against pregnant women in the workplace. And amendments to the Americans With Disabilities Act require employers to provide reasonable accommodations to disabled employees (including most employees with medical complications arising from pregnancies) who need them to do their jobs. But because pregnancy itself is not considered a disability, employers are not obligated to accommodate most pregnant workers in any way.'b'As a result, thousands of pregnant women are pushed out of jobs that they are perfectly capable of performing \xe2\x80\x94 either put on unpaid leave or simply fired \xe2\x80\x94 when they request an accommodation to help maintain a healthy pregnancy. Many are single mothers or a family\xe2\x80\x99s primary breadwinner. They are disproportionately low-income women, often in physically demanding jobs with little flexibility.'b'Thankfully, State Senator Liz Krueger, a Democrat from Manhattan, and Assemblywoman Aileen Gunther, a Democrat from Sullivan County, have introduced legislation to fill this gap in New York. Their bills \xe2\x80\x94 S. 6273 and A. 9114 \xe2\x80\x94 would require employers to provide reasonable accommodations for pregnant women whose health care providers say they need them, unless doing so would be an undue hardship for the employer.'b'These accommodations could include providing a seat for employees who spend long periods standing, allowing more frequent restroom breaks, limiting heavy lifting or transferring an employee to a less strenuous or hazardous position. As of 2010, seven states, including California, had passed laws requiring private employers to provide at least some accommodations. And they have been used countless times to help pregnant women keep their jobs.'b'This kind of law is a public health necessity. Without its protections, pregnant women are reluctant to ask for the accommodations they need for their own health and for the health of their unborn children. For many women, a choice between working under unhealthy conditions and not working is no choice at all. In addition, women who can work longer into their pregnancies often qualify for longer periods of leave following childbirth, which facilitates breastfeeding, bonding with and caring for a new child and a smoother and healthier recovery from childbirth.'b'Pregnancy-related accommodations also promote economic security for families. Women who are forced early into unpaid leave are set back with lost wages and, when they return to work, with missed advancement opportunities. Women who are let go don\xe2\x80\x99t just lose out on critical income \xe2\x80\x94 they must fight extra hard to re-enter a job market that is especially brutal on the unemployed. Worse yet, they often confront a bias against hiring mothers with small children.'b'Finally, employers might consider that providing accommodations to pregnant workers would even be good for the bottom line, in the form of reduced turnover, increased loyalty and productivity and healthier workers. With minor job modifications, a woman might be able to work up until the delivery of her child and return to work fairly soon after giving birth. If she were forced out instead, her employer would waste time and money finding a replacement. In the worst-case scenario, employers could be responsible for much higher medical costs if their workers were afraid to ask for accommodations and instead continued doing work that endangered their pregnancies.'b'Three-quarters of women now entering the work force will become pregnant on the job, yet gaps in our civil rights laws leave this enormous class without the right to the modest accommodations that would protect them. New York\xe2\x80\x99s Legislature should pass this law as soon as possible, and other states should follow. No pregnant woman in this country should have to choose between her job and a healthy pregnancy.'b'Some firefighters in the New York City Fire Department are actively opposing a federal judge\xe2\x80\x99s order to reform the department\xe2\x80\x99s long history of bad employment practices. They have started a misguided campaign called Merit Matters to stop the judge and the city from creating new exams for potential applicants and have distributed materials to various stationhouses. Last month, the Fire Department, in what seems like a misguided response, tried to ban \xe2\x80\x9c'b'material presenting opinions or viewpoints'b'\xe2\x80\x9d anywhere in the city\xe2\x80\x99s firehouses.'b'That broad language raised serious free speech issues. Stephen Cassidy, the president of the Uniformed Firefighters Association, told his 8,000 members 'b'to ignore the order'b', which prompted department officials to rework their directive last week. It now allows only \xe2\x80\x9cofficial department business or important information relating to approved departmental organizations\xe2\x80\x9d to be posted in firehouses. Since Merit Matters is not an approved department organization, its bulletins would not be allowed. This revised order seems overly broad as well.'b'Ronald Kuby, a civil liberties attorney working with Mr. Cassidy, quickly challenged the new language as potentially prohibiting the display of any material that expresses any opinion. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen it comes to free speech, you need to regulate with a scalpel,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kuby said on Monday. \xe2\x80\x9cInstead, they are using a sledgehammer.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Fire Department is right to be concerned and should not tolerate racially charged material that creates a hostile work environment, which might violate equal employment opportunity laws.'b'We strongly disagree with the city, firefighters and others who are contesting the wise ruling by Judge Nicholas Garaufis of Federal District Court. But the fire commissioner, Salvatore Cassano, should tell his lawyers to sit down with the firefighters to craft a policy that respects free expression without violating employment laws.'b'Washington'b'DRONES are not just for firing missiles in Pakistan. In Iraq, the State Department is using them to watch for threats to Americans. It\xe2\x80\x99s time we used the revolution in military affairs to serve human rights advocacy.'b'With drones, we could take clear pictures and videos of human rights abuses, and we could start with 'b'Syria'b'.'b'The need there is even more urgent now, because the 'b'Arab League'b'\xe2\x80\x99s observers suspended operations last week.'b'They fled the very violence they were trying to monitor. Drones could replace them, and could even go to some places the observers, who were escorted and restricted by the government, could not see. This we know: the Syrian government isn\xe2\x80\x99t just fighting rebels, as it claims; it is shooting unarmed protesters, and has been doing so for months. Despite a ban on news media, much of the violence is being caught on camera by ubiquitous cellphones. The footage is shaky and the images grainy, but still they make us YouTube witnesses.'b'Imagine if we could watch in high definition with a bird\xe2\x80\x99s-eye view. A drone would let us count demonstrators, gun barrels and pools of blood. And the evidence could be broadcast for a global audience, including diplomats at the United Nations and prosecutors at the International Criminal Court.'b'Drones are increasingly small, affordable and available to nonmilitary buyers. For hundreds of thousands of dollars \xe2\x80\x94 no longer many millions \xe2\x80\x94 a surveillance drone could be flying over protests and clashes in Syria.'b'An environmental group, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, has reported that it is using drones to monitor illegal Japanese whaling in the waters of the Southern Hemisphere. In the past few years, human-rights groups and the actor and activist 'b'George Clooney'b', among others, have purchased satellite imagery of conflict zones. Drones can see even more clearly, and broadcast in real time.'b'We could record the repression in Syria with unprecedented precision and scope. The better the evidence, the clearer the crimes, the higher the likelihood that the world would become as outraged as it should be.'b'This sounds a lot like surveillance, and it would be. It would violate Syrian airspace, and perhaps a number of Syrian and international laws. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t the kind of thing nongovernmental organizations usually do. But it is very different from what governments and armies do. Yes, we (like them) have an agenda, but ours is transparent: human rights. We have a duty, recognized internationally, to monitor governments that massacre their own people in large numbers. Human rights organizations have always done this. Why not get drones to assist the good work?'b'It may be illegal in the Syrian government\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, but supporting Nelson Mandela in South Africa was deemed illegal during the apartheid era. To fly over Syria\xe2\x80\x99s territory may violate official norms of international relations, but governments do this when they support opposition groups with weapons, money or intelligence, as NATO countries did recently in Libya. In any event, violations of Syrian sovereignty would be the direct consequence of the Syrian state\xe2\x80\x99s brutality, not the imperialism of outsiders.'b'There are some obvious risks and downsides to the drone approach. The Syrian government would undoubtedly seize the opportunity to blame a foreign conspiracy for its troubles. Local operators of the drones could be at risk, though a higher-end drone could be controlled from a remote location or a neighboring country.'b'Such considerations figured in conversations we have had with human rights organizations that considered hiring drones in Syria, but opted in the end for supplying protesters with phones, satellite modems and safe houses. For nearly a year now, brave amateurs with their tiny cameras arguably have been doing the trick in Syria. In those circumstances, the value that a drone could add might not be worth the investment and risks.'b'Even if humanitarian drones are not used in Syria, they should assume their place in the arsenal of human rights advocates. It is a precedent worth setting, especially in situations where evidence of large-scale human rights violations is hard to come by.'b'Drones can reach places and see things cell phones cannot. Social media did not document the worst of the genocide in the remote villages of Darfur in 2003 and 2004. Camera-toting protesters could not enter the fields where 8,000 men and boys were massacred in Srebrenica in 1995.

The shortfall is especially high among adults who lack insurance or regular access to a doctor, partly because the recession drove employers to lay off workers or cut health benefits.'b'Many low-  and middle-income people are now unable or unwilling to pay for screening tests or visits to the doctor. Their plight underscores the urgent need to retain the health care reform law that will expand proven screening and prevention programs at no charge to patients.'b''b'The study'b', based on a survey taken in 2010, was conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Cancer Institute. The three types of cancer were chosen for scrutiny because there is good evidence that, for certain age groups, screening for these cancers can reduce illness and save lives.'b'The survey results were discouraging. The percentage of people getting screened for breast cancer has hit a plateau and for cervical cancer turned slightly downward. In 2010, only 72.4 percent of the women ages 50 to 74 reported getting mammography screening within the previous two years, below the official national goal of 81.1 percent by the end of the decade. Only 83 percent of the eligible women reported having a Pap test to detect cervical cancer within the pervious three years, short of the 93 percent goal. The percentage of men and women between the ages of 50 and 74 getting screened for colorectal cancer has improved markedly, but it rose to only 58.6 percent in 2010, below the target of 70.5 percent.'b'The health care reform law will ensure that all Americans have access to vital preventive care.

Imagine a woman who, seven months into her pregnancy, is fired from her position as a cashier because she needed a few extra bathroom breaks. Or imagine another pregnant employee who was fired from her retail job after giving her supervisors a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s note requesting she be allowed to refrain from heavy lifting and climbing ladders during the month and a half before her maternity leave: that\xe2\x80\x99s what happened to Patricia Leahy. In 2008 a federal judge in Brooklyn ruled that her firing was fair because her employers were not obligated to accommodate her needs.'b'We see this kind of case in our legal clinic all the time. It happens every day to pregnant women in the United States, and it happens thanks to a gap between discrimination laws and disability laws.'b'Federal and state laws ban discrimination against pregnant women in the workplace. And amendments to the Americans With Disabilities Act require employers to provide reasonable accommodations to disabled employees (including most employees with medical complications arising from pregnancies) who need them to do their jobs. But because pregnancy itself is not considered a disability, employers are not obligated to accommodate most pregnant workers in any way.'b'As a result, thousands of pregnant women are pushed out of jobs that they are perfectly capable of performing \xe2\x80\x94 either put on unpaid leave or simply fired \xe2\x80\x94 when they request an accommodation to help maintain a healthy pregnancy. Many are single mothers or a family\xe2\x80\x99s primary breadwinner. They are disproportionately low-income women, often in physically demanding jobs with little flexibility.'b'Thankfully, State Senator Liz Krueger, a Democrat from Manhattan, and Assemblywoman Aileen Gunther, a Democrat from Sullivan County, have introduced legislation to fill this gap in New York. Their bills \xe2\x80\x94 S. 6273 and A. 9114 \xe2\x80\x94 would require employers to provide reasonable accommodations for pregnant women whose health care providers say they need them, unless doing so would be an undue hardship for the employer.'b'These accommodations could include providing a seat for employees who spend long periods standing, allowing more frequent restroom breaks, limiting heavy lifting or transferring an employee to a less strenuous or hazardous position. As of 2010, seven states, including California, had passed laws requiring private employers to provide at least some accommodations. And they have been used countless times to help pregnant women keep their jobs.'b'This kind of law is a public health necessity. Without its protections, pregnant women are reluctant to ask for the accommodations they need for their own health and for the health of their unborn children. For many women, a choice between working under unhealthy conditions and not working is no choice at all. In addition, women who can work longer into their pregnancies often qualify for longer periods of leave following childbirth, which facilitates breastfeeding, bonding with and caring for a new child and a smoother and healthier recovery from childbirth.'b'Pregnancy-related accommodations also promote economic security for families. Women who are forced early into unpaid leave are set back with lost wages and, when they return to work, with missed advancement opportunities. Women who are let go don\xe2\x80\x99t just lose out on critical income \xe2\x80\x94 they must fight extra hard to re-enter a job market that is especially brutal on the unemployed. Worse yet, they often confront a bias against hiring mothers with small children.'b'Finally, employers might consider that providing accommodations to pregnant workers would even be good for the bottom line, in the form of reduced turnover, increased loyalty and productivity and healthier workers. With minor job modifications, a woman might be able to work up until the delivery of her child and return to work fairly soon after giving birth. If she were forced out instead, her employer would waste time and money finding a replacement. In the worst-case scenario, employers could be responsible for much higher medical costs if their workers were afraid to ask for accommodations and instead continued doing work that endangered their pregnancies.'b'Three-quarters of women now entering the work force will become pregnant on the job, yet gaps in our civil rights laws leave this enormous class without the right to the modest accommodations that would protect them. New York\xe2\x80\x99s Legislature should pass this law as soon as possible, and other states should follow. No pregnant woman in this country should have to choose between her job and a healthy pregnancy.'b'Washington'b'DRONES are not just for firing missiles in Pakistan. In Iraq, the State Department is using them to watch for threats to Americans. It\xe2\x80\x99s time we used the revolution in military affairs to serve human rights advocacy.'b'With drones, we could take clear pictures and videos of human rights abuses, and we could start with 'b'Syria'b'.'b'The need there is even more urgent now, because the 'b'Arab League'b'\xe2\x80\x99s observers suspended operations last week.'b'They fled the very violence they were trying to monitor. Drones could replace them, and could even go to some places the observers, who were escorted and restricted by the government, could not see. This we know: the Syrian government isn\xe2\x80\x99t just fighting rebels, as it claims; it is shooting unarmed protesters, and has been doing so for months. Despite a ban on news media, much of the violence is being caught on camera by ubiquitous cellphones. The footage is shaky and the images grainy, but still they make us YouTube witnesses.'b'Imagine if we could watch in high definition with a bird\xe2\x80\x99s-eye view. A drone would let us count demonstrators, gun barrels and pools of blood. And the evidence could be broadcast for a global audience, including diplomats at the United Nations and prosecutors at the International Criminal Court.'b'Drones are increasingly small, affordable and available to nonmilitary buyers. For hundreds of thousands of dollars \xe2\x80\x94 no longer many millions \xe2\x80\x94 a surveillance drone could be flying over protests and clashes in Syria.'b'An environmental group, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, has reported that it is using drones to monitor illegal Japanese whaling in the waters of the Southern Hemisphere. In the past few years, human-rights groups and the actor and activist 'b'George Clooney'b', among others, have purchased satellite imagery of conflict zones. Drones can see even more clearly, and broadcast in real time.'b'We could record the repression in Syria with unprecedented precision and scope. The better the evidence, the clearer the crimes, the higher the likelihood that the world would become as outraged as it should be.'b'This sounds a lot like surveillance, and it would be. It would violate Syrian airspace, and perhaps a number of Syrian and international laws. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t the kind of thing nongovernmental organizations usually do. But it is very different from what governments and armies do. Yes, we (like them) have an agenda, but ours is transparent: human rights. We have a duty, recognized internationally, to monitor governments that massacre their own people in large numbers. Human rights organizations have always done this. Why not get drones to assist the good work?'b'It may be illegal in the Syrian government\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, but supporting Nelson Mandela in South Africa was deemed illegal during the apartheid era. To fly over Syria\xe2\x80\x99s territory may violate official norms of international relations, but governments do this when they support opposition groups with weapons, money or intelligence, as NATO countries did recently in Libya. In any event, violations of Syrian sovereignty would be the direct consequence of the Syrian state\xe2\x80\x99s brutality, not the imperialism of outsiders.'b'There are some obvious risks and downsides to the drone approach. The Syrian government would undoubtedly seize the opportunity to blame a foreign conspiracy for its troubles. Local operators of the drones could be at risk, though a higher-end drone could be controlled from a remote location or a neighboring country.'b'Such considerations figured in conversations we have had with human rights organizations that considered hiring drones in Syria, but opted in the end for supplying protesters with phones, satellite modems and safe houses. For nearly a year now, brave amateurs with their tiny cameras arguably have been doing the trick in Syria. In those circumstances, the value that a drone could add might not be worth the investment and risks.'b'Even if humanitarian drones are not used in Syria, they should assume their place in the arsenal of human rights advocates. It is a precedent worth setting, especially in situations where evidence of large-scale human rights violations is hard to come by.'b'Drones can reach places and see things cell phones cannot. Social media did not document the worst of the genocide in the remote villages of Darfur in 2003 and 2004. Camera-toting protesters could not enter the fields where 8,000 men and boys were massacred in Srebrenica in 1995. Graphic and detailed evidence of crimes against humanity does not guarantee a just response, but it helps.'b'If human rights organizations can spy on evil, they should.'b' 'b''b'I\xe2\x80\x99ll be shocked if there\xe2\x80\x99s another book this year as important as Charles Murray\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cComing Apart.\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99ll be shocked if there\xe2\x80\x99s another book that so compellingly describes the most important trends in American society.'b'Murray\xe2\x80\x99s basic argument is not new, that America is dividing into a two-caste society. What\xe2\x80\x99s impressive is the incredible data he produces to illustrate that trend and deepen our understanding of it.'b'His story starts in 1963. There was a gap between rich and poor then, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that big. A house in an upper-crust suburb cost only twice as much as the average new American home. The tippy-top luxury car, the Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz, cost about $47,000 in 2010 dollars. That\xe2\x80\x99s pricey, but nowhere near the price of the top luxury cars today.'b'More important, the income gaps did not lead to big behavior gaps. Roughly 98 percent of men between the ages of 30 and 49 were in the labor force, upper class and lower class alike. Only about 3 percent of white kids were born outside of marriage. The rates were similar, upper class and lower class.'b'Since then, America has polarized. The word \xe2\x80\x9cclass\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even capture the divide Murray describes. You might say the country has bifurcated into different social tribes, with a tenuous common culture linking them.'b'The upper tribe is now segregated from the lower tribe. In 1963, rich people who lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan lived close to members of the middle class. Most adult Manhattanites who lived south of 96th Street back then hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even completed high school. Today, almost all of Manhattan south of 96th Street is an upper-tribe enclave.'b'Today, Murray demonstrates, there is an archipelago of affluent enclaves clustered around the coastal cities, Chicago, Dallas and so on. If you\xe2\x80\x99re born into one of them, you will probably go to college with people from one of the enclaves; you\xe2\x80\x99ll marry someone from one of the enclaves; you\xe2\x80\x99ll go off and live in one of the enclaves.'b'Worse, there are vast behavioral gaps between the educated upper tribe (20 percent of the country) and the lower tribe (30 percent of the country). This is where Murray is at his best, and he\xe2\x80\x99s mostly using data on white Americans, so the effects of race and other complicating factors don\xe2\x80\x99t come into play.'b'Roughly 7 percent of the white kids in the upper tribe are born out of wedlock, compared with roughly 45 percent of the kids in the lower tribe. In the upper tribe, nearly every man aged 30 to 49 is in the labor force. In the lower tribe, men in their prime working ages have been steadily dropping out of the labor force, in good times and bad.'b'People in the lower tribe are much less likely to get married, less likely to go to church, less likely to be active in their communities, more likely to watch TV excessively, more likely to be obese.'b'Murray\xe2\x80\x99s story contradicts the ideologies of both parties. Republicans claim that America is threatened by a decadent cultural elite that corrupts regular Americans, who love God, country and traditional values. That story is false. The cultural elites live more conservative, traditionalist lives than the cultural masses.'b'Democrats claim America is threatened by the financial elite, who hog society\xe2\x80\x99s resources. But that\xe2\x80\x99s a distraction. The real social gap is between the top 20 percent and the lower 30 percent. The liberal members of the upper tribe latch onto this top 1 percent narrative because it excuses them from the central role they themselves are playing in driving inequality and unfairness.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s wrong to describe an America in which the salt of the earth common people are preyed upon by this or that nefarious elite. It\xe2\x80\x99s wrong to tell the familiar underdog morality tale in which the problems of the masses are caused by the elites.'b'The truth is, members of the upper tribe have made themselves phenomenally productive. They may mimic bohemian manners, but they have returned to 1950s traditionalist values and practices. They have low divorce rates, arduous work ethics and strict codes to regulate their kids.'b'Members of the lower tribe work hard and dream big, but are more removed from traditional bourgeois norms. They live in disorganized, postmodern neighborhoods in which it is much harder to be self-disciplined and productive.'b'I doubt Murray would agree, but we need a National Service Program. We need a program that would force members of the upper tribe and the lower tribe to live together, if only for a few years. We need a program in which people from both tribes work together to spread out the values, practices and institutions that lead to achievement.'b'If we could jam the tribes together, we\xe2\x80\x99d have a better elite and a better mass.'b'Senator John McCain spoke for many nervous Republicans on Sunday when he said it\xe2\x80\x99s time to \xe2\x80\x9cstop the debates.\xe2\x80\x9d They\xe2\x80\x99ve turned into mud-wrestling contests, he said on \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Meet the Press'b'\xe2\x80\x9d on NBC, and are driving up negative impressions of the party\xe2\x80\x99s presidential candidates.'b'Mr. McCain, who knows something about unfavorable ratings, is right that the 19 debates so far have left an increasingly sour taste in voters\xe2\x80\x99 mouths. Since the debates began, the popularity gap has grown between the leading Republican candidates and President Obama.'b'But that\xe2\x80\x99s not simply because the candidates have increased the intensity of their attacks on each other, nor is it curable by cutting back the mud-fighting, as Mr. McCain suggests. It\xe2\x80\x99s also because voters have been exposed to the broken windows of the Republican idea factory. The value of debates is to put the candidates on stage to air their ideas. If voters find them dishonest and divisive, the Republicans are getting the wrong message if they think all they have to do to fix that is to stop talking so much.'b'Consider some of the \xe2\x80\x9cbold ideas\xe2\x80\x9d the country learned about in just the last two debates in Florida, leading up to Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s primary there.'b'Newt Gingrich wants to build a lunar colony on the moon in just eight years, and he seems to believe that the private sector can be induced to pay for it. He wants to convene a \xe2\x80\x9cgold commission\xe2\x80\x9d to get the country back to hard money, which would shackle the economy to a single commodity. He wants to end multilingual ballots (disenfranchising millions), promote an uprising in Cuba and end the capital gains tax, which would allow millionaires to pay less of their income to the government than the minimum they pay now.'b'Mitt Romney promised to get millions of illegal immigrants to \xe2\x80\x9cself-deport,\xe2\x80\x9d apparently by making their lives miserable. He would veto the Dream Act, which would provide a path to citizenship for immigrant college students and military service members. He would refuse to extend any government help to struggling homeowners, while repealing the Dodd-Frank law that finally regulated the banking practices that led to the housing crisis.'b'The debates that Mr. McCain so deplores also gave voters a taste of the incompetent candidacies of Herman Cain, Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann, helping to put an end to them. They have properly marginalized Ron Paul and his cranky libertarianism.'b'And they have given Rick Santorum repeated opportunities to point out that Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s bellicose opposition to \xe2\x80\x9cObamacare\xe2\x80\x9d is an almost comical contradiction to his support for the same idea in Massachusetts when he was governor there. (Mr. Santorum\xe2\x80\x99s strong debate performances haven\xe2\x80\x99t given him much recent traction in the primaries, though.)'b'Most of all, the debates have shown the complete lack of interest by all the Republican candidates in the issues of economic fairness. While the candidates argue over their investments and their complex tax returns and who can cut taxes for the rich the most, the contrast to Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s newfound voice on shared responsibility could not be more clear.'b'The long series of debates are an open window onto the failed policies and dubious values of the Republican Party. No wonder some people want to close it.'b'A new federal study found that Americans are getting screened for three major cancers \xe2\x80\x94 breast, cervical and colorectal \xe2\x80\x94 at rates far below national targets. The shortfall is especially high among adults who lack insurance or regular access to a doctor, partly because the recession drove employers to lay off workers or cut health benefits.'b'Many low-  and middle-income people are now unable or unwilling to pay for screening tests or visits to the doctor. Their plight underscores the urgent need to retain the health care reform law that will expand proven screening and prevention programs at no charge to patients.'b''b'The study'b', based on a survey taken in 2010, was conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Cancer Institute. The three types of cancer were chosen for scrutiny because there is good evidence that, for certain age groups, screening for these cancers can reduce illness and save lives.'b'The survey results were discouraging. The percentage of people getting screened for breast cancer has hit a plateau and for cervical cancer turned slightly downward. In 2010, only 72.4 percent of the women ages 50 to 74 reported getting mammography screening within the previous two years, below the official national goal of 81.1 percent by the end of the decade. Only 83 percent of the eligible women reported having a Pap test to detect cervical cancer within the pervious three years, short of the 93 percent goal. The percentage of men and women between the ages of 50 and 74 getting screened for colorectal cancer has improved markedly, but it rose to only 58.6 percent in 2010, below the target of 70.5 percent.'b'The health care reform law will ensure that all Americans have access to vital preventive care. It already eliminates cost-sharing for the screenings in Medicare and new private policies, and, starting in 2014, it will expand Medicaid for the poor and provide subsidies to help middle-income people buy private health insurance. Republicans won\xe2\x80\x99t stop pressing for repeal of the law. American consumers, so many of whom are struggling to pay their health care bills, need to think a lot harder about what they would lose if Republicans get their way.'b'My plan had been to give the N.C.A.A. a rest this week; there are, after all, other problems in the world. But then, at 6:15 on Saturday evening, the N.C.A.A. announced that it was 'b'reinstating Ryan Boatright'b', the University of Connecticut freshman who had been suspended from the men\xe2\x80\x99s basketball team, and whose mother, Tanesha, had been the subject of a horrific investigation that 'b'I had previously written about'b'.'b'Even this bit of good news was double-edged for the Boatrights, however. In handing down its ruling, 'b'the N.C.A.A. issued a press release'b' so malicious in its intent that I could not let it pass. Longtime watchers of the N.C.A.A. tell me that they have never seen an athlete and his mother thrown under the bus the way Ryan and Tanesha Boatright were on Saturday. One rarely gets so clear a glimpse of moral bankruptcy. (I\xe2\x80\x99ve annotated the press release on my blog at 'b'http://nocera.blogs.nytimes.com'b'.)'b'In essence, the release says that Ryan and Tanesha received $8,000 in \xe2\x80\x9cimpermissible benefits\xe2\x80\x9d from two people it describes as having \xe2\x80\x9cimproper third-party influence over student-athletes and their families.\xe2\x80\x9d That sounds bad, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?'b'But what exactly constitutes \xe2\x80\x9cimproper third-party influence?\xe2\x80\x9d When I put this question to Stacey Osburn, the author of the N.C.A.A. press release, she said it means someone who takes advantage of an athlete \xe2\x80\x9cfor personal gain.\xe2\x80\x9d One example would be a \xe2\x80\x9cthird party\xe2\x80\x9d paying off an athlete\xe2\x80\x99s family to help steer him to a particular school. Another would be fronting for a sports agent, who hopes to eventually land the player as his client. (Agents are forbidden under the N.C.A.A.\xe2\x80\x99s definition of amateurism.)'b'In its release, the N.C.A.A. neither names the third parties nor explains what they stood to gain. But one of them is already known: Reggie Rose, Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s former A.A.U. coach and the brother of Derrick Rose, the Chicago Bulls star. According to the N.C.A.A., Rose paid for Tanesha to accompany her son on four recruiting trips. He made some payments on her 2008 Impala. And Rose took Ryan on a two-day trip to California where he got to scrimmage with some top-notch players.'b'Why did he do this? Clearly, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t trying to steer Ryan to a particular school. And he certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fronting for an agent; as good as he is, Ryan is not a sure-fire pro.'b'In fact, he did it because he and Tanesha have a longstanding friendship. He became a mentor to Ryan, something teenagers of single moms desperately need. Indeed, he took Ryan to California because Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s household was under an unusual amount of stress at the time. How is this wrong? Indeed, what exactly is the N.C.A.A. violation here? The N.C.A.A. never says.'b'I have since come to learn that the N.C.A.A. takes a dim view of Reggie Rose. It certainly has a right to its opinion. I\xe2\x80\x99ve also heard that the N.C.A.A. is deeply suspicious of mentors to disadvantaged athletes. Its working assumption is that men who get close to high school athletes must have nefarious motives. Well, some surely do, but some don\xe2\x80\x99t. The idea that Reggie Rose is not allowed to help Tanesha because the N.C.A.A. disapproves of him is, by any measure, offensive.'b'There is another issue. The parents of upper-middle-class athletes don\xe2\x80\x99t have problems with the N.C.A.A. when they want to go on recruiting trips with their children. They just write a check. And they don\xe2\x80\x99t get into financial binds that cause them to need help with car payments. It is not an accident that most serious N.C.A.A. \xe2\x80\x9cscandals\xe2\x80\x9d involve athletes and parents who are disadvantaged. It smells of discrimination.'b'On Sunday morning, Tanesha\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, Scott Tompsett, released 'b'an angry statement'b' refuting the N.C.A.A.\xe2\x80\x99s allegations and decrying its publication of material the family had been told would remain confidential. The Boatrights, he said, will \xe2\x80\x9cconsider their legal options.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But the Boatrights aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to sue, and the N.C.A.A. knows it. Ryan only wants to play basketball. Tanesha just wants the whole thing to go away. Her life has been turned upside down by the N.C.A.A.\xe2\x80\x99s investigation: She\xe2\x80\x99s lost her job, her friends have been harassed by N.C.A.A. investigators and it has affected her health. She blames herself for her son\xe2\x80\x99s problems, even though, by any reasonable standard, she did nothing wrong. I hear that she cries a lot these days.'b'On Sunday afternoon, Osburn 'b'issued one last statement'b' on behalf of the N.C.A.A. Responding to Tompsett\xe2\x80\x99s statement, she claimed the initial N.C.A.A. press release was necessary to combat \xe2\x80\x9cinaccurate reporting,\xe2\x80\x9d and that it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t violated the Boatrights\xe2\x80\x99 privacy. She concluded with one last cheap shot at Tanesha: \xe2\x80\x9cHad Ms. Boatright cooperated fully from the beginning, this matter could have been settled months ago.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Thus does the N.C.A.A. protect the sanctity of amateurism and the purity of college athletics.'b'House Republicans have hit upon a noxious scheme to help pay for an extension of the payroll tax cut: a tax increase on millions of poor working families. 'b'A bill'b' passed by the House and now in conference seeks to deny cash refunds under the child tax credit to those who file tax returns using \xe2\x80\x9cindividual taxpayer identification numbers\xe2\x80\x9d issued by the Internal Revenue Service. Only those using Social Security numbers would be eligible.'b'The refundable portion of the child tax credit is a life-saver for the working poor. Families that would be cut off by this policy change make an average of $21,000 per year, according to the Treasury Department. They would lose an average of $1,800. About 80 percent of those families are Hispanic. The taxpayer identification numbers are used frequently, though not exclusively, by unauthorized immigrants to pay the taxes because they are not eligible for Social Security numbers. The I.R.S. accepts their tax payments and allows families to claim the child tax credit regardless of immigration status. This policy is an effective antipoverty tool that protects children, most of whom are American-born citizens.'b'The Republicans who have flatly rejected tax increases on the rich have settled instead on limiting this refund, which kept about 1.3 million children from falling into poverty in 2009.'b'Leaving aside the cruelty of squeezing the poorest workers for a greater portion of their wages to make a point about illegal immigration, the bill punishes not just the undocumented, but the communities they live in, because a poor family\xe2\x80\x99s hard-earned wages get spent: on things like groceries, child care, utilities, gas and rent. This would be the bottom line of the House bill: a Congress that has failed for years to fix the immigration system, using its failure to harm children and hurting those at the bottom of the ladder to avoid the slightest pressure on millionaires. The Senate would be mad to go along with it.'b'Some firefighters in the New York City Fire Department are actively opposing a federal judge\xe2\x80\x99s order to reform the department\xe2\x80\x99s long history of bad employment practices. They have started a misguided campaign called Merit Matters to stop the judge and the city from creating new exams for potential applicants and have distributed materials to various stationhouses. Last month, the Fire Department, in what seems like a misguided response, tried to ban \xe2\x80\x9c'b'material presenting opinions or viewpoints'b'\xe2\x80\x9d anywhere in the city\xe2\x80\x99s firehouses.'b'That broad language raised serious free speech issues. Stephen Cassidy, the president of the Uniformed Firefighters Association, told his 8,000 members 'b'to ignore the order'b', which prompted department officials to rework their directive last week. It now allows only \xe2\x80\x9cofficial department business or important information relating to approved departmental organizations\xe2\x80\x9d to be posted in firehouses. Since Merit Matters is not an approved department organization, its bulletins would not be allowed. This revised order seems overly broad as well.'b'Ronald Kuby, a civil liberties attorney working with Mr. Cassidy, quickly challenged the new language as potentially prohibiting the display of any material that expresses any opinion. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen it comes to free speech, you need to regulate with a scalpel,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kuby said on Monday. \xe2\x80\x9cInstead, they are using a sledgehammer.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Fire Department is right to be concerned and should not tolerate racially charged material that creates a hostile work environment, which might violate equal employment opportunity laws.'b'We strongly disagree with the city, firefighters and others who are contesting the wise ruling by Judge Nicholas Garaufis of Federal District Court. But the fire commissioner, Salvatore Cassano, should tell his lawyers to sit down with the firefighters to craft a policy that respects free expression without violating employment laws.'
