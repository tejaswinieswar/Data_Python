b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cTiger on the Loose: Can It Happen Here?\xe2\x80\x9d (news article, Dec. 27):'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s little wonder that Tatiana, the tiger that escaped from the San Francisco Zoo, longed for her freedom. An Oxford University study published in the journal Nature found that wide-ranging carnivores like tigers and other big cats \xe2\x80\x9cshow the most evidence of stress and/or psychological dysfunction in captivity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Tigers are designed by nature to roam far and wide, hunt, claim territory and seek out mates. In captivity, they are denied everything that comes naturally to them and pose a serious danger to the public and keepers alike from attacks and escapes.'b'These acts of independence are often their last, as, like Tatiana, most animals who attempt to follow their natural instincts are killed.'b'How many people and animals must pay with their lives before we acknowledge that big cats don\xe2\x80\x99t belong in captivity?  Jennifer O\xe2\x80\x99Connor'b'Norfolk, Va., Dec. 28, 2007'b''b'The writer, on the staff of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, writes for its Animals in Entertainment Campaign. 'b''b'Cambridge, Mass.'b'ALTHOUGH the United Nations recently lowered its global H.I.V. estimates, as many as 33 million people worldwide are still living with the AIDS virus. This pandemic requires continued attention; preventing further deaths and orphans remains imperative. But the well-meaning promises of some presidential candidates to outdo even President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to nearly double American foreign assistance to fight AIDS strike me, an H.I.V.-AIDS specialist for 15 years, as missing the mark.'b'Some have criticized Mr. Bush for requesting \xe2\x80\x9conly\xe2\x80\x9d $30 billion for the next five years for AIDS and related problems, with the leading Democratic candidates having pledged to commit at least $50 billion if they are elected. Yet even the current $15 billion in spending represents an unprecedented amount of money aimed mainly at a single disease.'b'Meanwhile, many other public health needs in developing countries are being ignored. The fact is, spending $50 billion or more on foreign health assistance does make sense, but only if it is not limited to H.I.V.-AIDS programs.'b'Last year, for instance, as the United States spent almost $3 billion on AIDS programs in Africa, it invested only about $30 million in traditional safe-water projects. This nearly 100-to-1 imbalance is disastrously inequitable \xe2\x80\x94 especially considering that in Africa H.I.V. tends to be most prevalent in the relatively wealthiest and most developed countries. Most African nations have stable adult H.I.V. rates of 3 percent or less.'b'Many millions of African children and adults die of malnutrition, pneumonia, motor vehicle accidents and other largely preventable, if not headline-grabbing, conditions. One-fifth of all global deaths from diarrhea occur in just three African countries \xe2\x80\x94 Congo, Ethiopia and Nigeria \xe2\x80\x94 that have relatively low H.I.V. prevalence. Yet this condition, which is not particularly difficult to cure or prevent, gets scant attention from the donors that invest nearly $1 billion annually on AIDS programs in those countries.'b'I was struck by this discrepancy between Western donors\xe2\x80\x99 priorities and the real needs of Africans last month, during my most recent trip to Africa. In Senegal, H.I.V. rates remain under 1 percent  in adults, partly due to that country\xe2\x80\x99s early adoption of enlightened policies toward prostitution and other risky practices, in addition to universal male circumcision, which limits the heterosexual spread of H.I.V. Rates of tuberculosis, now another favored disease of international donors, are also relatively low in Senegal, and I learned that even malaria, the donors\xe2\x80\x99 third major concern, is not quite as rampant as  was assumed, with new testing finding that  many fevers aren\xe2\x80\x99t actually caused by the disease.'b'Meanwhile, the stench of sewage permeates the crowded outskirts of Dakar, Senegal\xe2\x80\x99s capital. There, as in many other parts of West Africa and the developing world, inadequate access to safe water results in devastating diarrheal diseases. Shortages of food and basic health services like vaccinations, prenatal care and family planning contribute to large family size and high child and maternal mortality. Major donors like the President\xe2\x80\x99s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as Pepfar,  and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria have not directly addressed such basic health issues. The Global Fund\xe2\x80\x99s director, Michel Kazatchkine, has acknowledged, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not a global fund that funds local health.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Botswana, which has the world\xe2\x80\x99s most lucrative diamond industry and is  the second-wealthiest country per capita in sub-Saharan Africa, is nowhere near as burdened as Senegal with basic public health problems. But as one of a dozen Pepfar \xe2\x80\x9cfocus\xe2\x80\x9d countries in Africa, this year it will receive about $300 million to fight AIDS  \xe2\x80\x94 in addition to the hundreds of millions already granted by drug companies, private foundations and other donors. While in that sparsely populated country last month, I learned that much of its AIDS money remains unspent, as even its state-of-the-art H.I.V. clinics  cannot absorb such a large influx of cash.'b'As the United States Agency for International Development\xe2\x80\x99s H.I.V. prevention adviser in southern Africa in 2005 and 2006, I visited villages in poor countries like Lesotho, where clinics could not afford to stock basic medicines but often maintained an inventory of expensive AIDS drugs and  sophisticated monitoring equipment for their H.I.V. patients. H.I.V.-infected children are offered exemplary treatment, while children suffering from much simpler-to-treat diseases are left untreated, sometimes to die.'b'In Africa, there\xe2\x80\x99s another crisis exacerbated by the rigid focus on AIDS: the best health practitioners have abandoned lower-paying positions in family planning, immunization and other basic health areas in order to work for donor-financed H.I.V. programs.'b'The AIDS experience has demonstrated that poor countries can make complex treatments accessible to many people. Regimens that are much simpler to administer than anti-retroviral drugs \xe2\x80\x94 like antibiotics for respiratory illnesses, oral rehydration for diarrhea, immunizations and contraception \xe2\x80\x94 could also be made widely available. But as there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a \xe2\x80\x9cglobal fund\xe2\x80\x9d for safe water, child survival and family planning, countries like Senegal \xe2\x80\x94 and even poorer ones \xe2\x80\x94 cannot directly tackle their real problems without pegging them to the big three diseases.'b'To their credit, some AIDS advocates are calling for a broader approach to international health programs. Among the presidential candidates, Senator Barack Obama, for example, proposes to go beyond spending for AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, highlighting the need to also strengthen basic health systems. And recently, Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s plan, along with the Global Fund, has become somewhat more flexible in supporting other health issues linked to H.I.V. \xe2\x80\x94 though this will be of little use to people, especially outside the \xe2\x80\x9cfocus\xe2\x80\x9d countries, who are dying of common illnesses like diarrhea.'b'But it is also important, especially for the United States, the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest donor, to re-examine  the epidemiological and moral foundations of its global health priorities.  With 10 million children and a half million mothers in developing countries dying annually of largely preventable conditions, should we mutiply AIDS spending while giving only a pittance for initiatives like safe-water projects?'b'If one were to ask the people of virtually any African village (outside some 10 countries devastated by AIDS) what their greatest concerns are, the answer would undoubtedly be the less sensational but more ubiquitous ravages of hunger, dirty water and environmental devastation. The real-world needs of Africans struggling to survive should not continue to be subsumed by the favorite causes du jour of well-meaning yet often uninformed Western donors.'b'The chance to bet your hard-earned money at unfavorable odds was once mostly limited to casinos in Nevada and Atlantic City. Today there are slot machines on Native American reservations from California to Connecticut and poker on casino boats on the Mississippi.'b'Increasingly, however, it is the humble and ubiquitous lottery that looks like the most insidious form of gambling.'b'Lawmakers pretend that lotteries make new taxes unnecessary. But lotteries are a tax, an inefficient, badly targeted one that is having a devastating impact on poor communities and beyond. One-third of all calls to Massachusetts\xe2\x80\x99 gambling hot line come from lottery players.'b'A new trend is making this bad situation far worse. As sales of the $1 lottery ticket began to wane, the games\xe2\x80\x99 designers cynically suggested that states up the ante, and the buzz, to as high as $50 for one scratch-off ticket. These games often offer many relatively small payouts \xe2\x80\x94 Texas\xe2\x80\x99s $50 lottery has thousands of prizes ranging from $50 to $50,000 \xe2\x80\x94 and snag more players.'b'These new super lotteries are especially dangerous. One study in Texas showed the more expensive tickets selling best in the most poverty-stricken ZIP codes, ones heavily populated with Hispanics and blacks. Money that should be used for food and housing goes up in a whiff of hope instead.'b'State lawmakers like to say that lottery revenues go to education. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t excuse the damage done. In any case, a large chunk of the revenues go to the lottery\xe2\x80\x99s own expenses, including prize payouts and salaries. States, meanwhile, have failed to invest in treatment programs for people who lose their shirts, homes and dignity playing the lottery and other games the states have dreamed up.'b'They can dress it up all they want in slogans about buying a ticket and a dream. But the states are encouraging behavior that is too often addictive and ruinous for people who can least handle the burden.'b'The overriding environmental issue of these times is the warming of the planet. The Democratic hopefuls in the 2008 campaign are fully engaged, calling for large \xe2\x80\x94 if still unquantified \xe2\x80\x94 national sacrifices and for a transformation in the way the country produces and uses energy. The Republicans do not go much further than conceding that climate change could be a problem and, with the notable exception of John McCain, offer no comprehensive solutions.'b'In 2000, when Al Gore could have made warming a signature issue in his presidential campaign, his advisers persuaded him that it was too complicated and forbidding an issue to sell to ordinary voters. For similar reasons, John Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s ambitious ideas for addressing climate change and reducing the country\xe2\x80\x99s dependence on foreign oil never advanced much beyond his Web site.'b'Times have certainly changed. It is not yet clear to what extent Americans are willing to grapple with the implications of any serious strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions: more specifically, whether they are ready to pay higher prices for energy and change their lifestyles to reduce their consumption of fossil fuels.'b'Polls suggest, however, that voters are increasingly alarmed, and for that Mr. Gore is partly responsible. His film, \xe2\x80\x9cAn Inconvenient Truth,\xe2\x80\x9d raised the issue\xe2\x80\x99s profile. Then came four reports from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mr. Gore, predicting catastrophic changes in weather patterns, sea levels and food production unless greenhouses gases can be quickly stabilized and then reduced by as much as 80 percent by midcentury.'b'There is also a growing appetite for decisive action \xe2\x80\x94 everywhere, it seems, except the White House. Governors in more than two dozen states are fashioning regional agreements to lower greenhouse gases, the federal courts have ordered the executive branch to begin regulating these gases, and the Senate has begun work on a bipartisan bill that would reduce emissions by nearly 65 percent by 2050.'b'Still, the country is a long way from a comprehensive response equal to the challenge. That is what the Democratic candidates are proposing. Senators Joseph Biden, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, former Senator John Edwards, Gov. Bill Richardson and Representative Dennis Kucinich have all offered aggressive plans that would go beyond the Senate bill and reduce emissions by 80 percent by midcentury (90 percent in Mr. Richardson\xe2\x80\x99s case), much as called for in the United Nations reports.'b'These plans would rest primarily on a cap-and-trade scheme that imposes a gradually declining ceiling on emissions and allows power plants, refineries and other emitters to figure out the cheapest way to meet their quotas \xe2\x80\x94 either by reducing emissions on their own or by purchasing credits from more efficient producers. The idea is to give companies a clear financial incentive to invest in the new technologies and efficiencies required to create a more carbon-free economy.'b'None of the Democrats trust the market to do the job by itself. All would make major investments in cleaner fuels and delivery systems, including coal-fired power plants capable of capturing carbon emissions and storing them underground. Every Democrat except Mr. Kucinich says that carbon-free nuclear power has to be part of the mix, although all are careful to say that safety issues and other concerns must first be resolved.'b'Internationally, the Democrats say they would seek a new global accord on reducing emissions to replace and improve upon the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012. Winning agreement among more than 180 nations will be slow-going, so several candidates, including Mrs. Clinton, have suggested jump-starting the process by bringing together the big emitters like China very early in their administrations. China and the United States together produce about 40 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s total emissions and neither has agreed to binding reductions.'b'The only Republican candidate who comes close to the Democrats with a plan for addressing climate change is John McCain, one of the authentic pioneers on the issue in the Senate. In 2003, along with Joseph Lieberman, Mr. McCain introduced the first Senate bill aimed at mandatory economywide reductions in emissions of 65 percent by midcentury. He also regularly addresses the subject on the campaign trail.'b'The other leading Republican candidates \xe2\x80\x94 Mitt Romney, Rudolph Giuliani, Fred Thompson, Mike Huckabee \xe2\x80\x94 talk about energy issues almost exclusively in the context of freeing America from its dependence on foreign oil. All promote nuclear power, embrace energy efficiency and promise greener technologies. Only Mr. Huckabee has dared raise the idea of government regulation, embracing, at least theoretically, the idea of a mandatory cap on emissions. The rest prefer President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s cost-free and demonstrably inadequate voluntary approach, which essentially asks industry to do what it can to reduce emissions.'b'So far, the Democratic candidates seem more engaged with the issue than some of their interrogators in the news media. In a recent study, the League of Conservation Voters found that as of two weeks ago, the five main political talk-show hosts had collectively asked 2,275 questions of candidates in both parties. Only 24 of the questions even touched on climate change.'b'One result is that even the candidates who urge comprehensive change have not been pressed on important questions of cost: How do they intend to pay for all the new efficiencies and technologies that will be necessary? And what kind of sacrifices will they be asking of people who almost certainly will have to pay more for their electric bills and their greener cars?'b'Addressing these questions will require more courage of the candidates than simply offering up broad new visions. The voters deserve an honest accounting and the candidates should be prepared to give it.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cA Rabbi of His Time, With a Charisma That Transcends It\xe2\x80\x9d (Connections column, Arts pages, Dec. 24), about Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel:'b'Edward Rothstein writes that theological politics \xe2\x80\x9ctends to eliminate distinctions and is impatient with differences, empathy and argument.\xe2\x80\x9d But this is only one approach to theological politics, the approach most often taken by the religious right.'b'The problem is that the religious right has so dominated theological discourse in our country for the last 25 years that it is easy to forget that religion is not necessarily rigid, conservative or fundamentalist.'b'The recent centennial of Rabbi Heschel\xe2\x80\x99s birth and the celebration of the birth of the leader of the Christian community serve as important reminders that religious people can be liberal and progressive.

The Republican John Sununu, won re-election by under 20,000 votes, and Allen Raymond, a Republican Party operative, went to jail for his role in the jamming.'b'Mr. Raymond has now written a book about his experiences, \xe2\x80\x9cHow to Rig an Election: Confessions of a Republican Operative.\xe2\x80\x9d In it, he paints a picture of the corruption of modern politics that should leave no doubt about the creativity and cynicism of operatives like Mr. Raymond or the need for tough new election-reform legislation.'b'Mr. Raymond, whose great-grandfather founded the Underwood Typewriter Company, was a privileged kid drawn to politics at a young age. He moved from small campaigns to larger ones, eventually working for the Republican National Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.'b'It was a world in which, he claims, dirty tricks were the norm. When Mr. Raymond opened a political telemarketing firm, he was hired by a Republican challenging a New Jersey Democratic congressman. Mr. Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s company \xe2\x80\x94 in a plan he says he hatched with the challenger\xe2\x80\x99s advisers \xe2\x80\x94 called liberal Democrats and urged them to vote for the Green Party candidate.'b'Those same advisers, he says, gave Mr. Raymond another assignment: to call white households asking them to vote for the Democrat, using the voice of, as he puts it, a \xe2\x80\x9cghetto black guy.\xe2\x80\x9d He also called union households, using voices with thick Spanish accents.'b'No one is suggesting that Mr. Sununu knew anything about the phone jamming. Mr. Raymond says his instructions came from James Tobin, the northeast regional director of the Republican National Committee.  And he says a top official of the New Hampshire Republican Party provided the phone numbers of the Democratic get-out-the-vote banks. Mr. Raymond jammed the lines \xe2\x80\x94 placing hundreds of hang-up calls an hour \xe2\x80\x94 to five Democratic offices across the state and a phone bank run by volunteer firefighters.'b'Mr. Raymond pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit phone harassment and was sentenced to five months in prison. Mr. Tobin argued in court that the idea to jam the phones was not his and that he committed no crime. A federal appeals court in Boston reversed his conviction, saying that the  law he was found guilty under was not \xe2\x80\x9ca close fit for what he did.\xe2\x80\x9d The Republican Party has paid a high-priced law firm in Washington to defend Mr. Tobin, according to The Associated Press, and Mr. Raymond suspects it is because Republican bigwigs \xe2\x80\x9cwanted him to keep his yap shut\xe2\x80\x9d about the origins of the scheme.'b'Mr. Raymond doesn\xe2\x80\x99t offer proof in the book and is clearly bitter about his former employers not coming to his defense. The Republicans, he says, \xe2\x80\x9cnot only threw me under the bus but then blamed me for getting run over.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Of course, this tradition of dirty trickery goes back decades. Donald Segretti, an operative with President Richard Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s re-election committee went to jail for distributing devious, and illegal, campaign literature. Today there are many others plying the trade \xe2\x80\x94 for both parties.'b'In 2006, Republicans in upstate New York accused Democrats of calling voters at the last minute and directing them to incorrect polling places.

Mr. Raymond argues, however, that illegal tactics are often standard operating procedure.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn my business,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes, \xe2\x80\x9ccommunications devices were all lethal weapons \xe2\x80\x94 and every fight was dirty.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It is remarkable how little Congress has done to stop all this.

The mind-boggling occurrences seemed to come out of nowhere, like the Viet Cong who set off a depth charge beneath the Johnson presidency with the Tet offensive at the end of January.'b'When Walter Cronkite learned of the coordinated wave of attacks throughout South Vietnam by the Cong and North Vietnamese regulars he is reported to have said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the hell is going on? I thought we were winning this war.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The nation shuddered. The U.S. had never lost a war, but now men padding around in black pajamas and flip-flops fashioned from discarded tires gave every appearance of battling the mightiest military on earth to a stalemate.'b'The New Hampshire primary was March 12. Eugene McCarthy, a quiet, cerebral and sometimes flaky senator from Minnesota who was calling for a negotiated settlement of the war, electrified the country and exposed the president\xe2\x80\x99s political vulnerability by finishing second with 42 percent of the vote.'b'Within days, Bobby Kennedy, who had only recently said he could see no circumstances in which he would challenge Johnson, was challenging him. McCarthy was furious. Johnson was traumatized.'b'By the end of the month, Johnson had abandoned the race.'b'Euphoria reigned \xe2\x80\x94 among young people, and those opposed to the war, and those who believed that ordinary people of good will could change the world. For many, it was the peak moment of the 1960s.'b'It lasted just four days.'b'On April 3, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot and killed in Memphis. Violence erupted in dozens of cities, and especially in Washington, where a number of people were killed and the fires were the worst the city had experienced since the British took the torch to it in 1814.'b'John J. Lindsay of Newsweek magazine said that when Bobby Kennedy was told that King had died, he put his hands to his face and murmured: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, God. When is this violence going to stop?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Kennedy himself was murdered two months later. I remember people not knowing what to say. The madness had been unleashed, and there seemed no way to rein it in.'b'There was much more to come, more war, the orgy of police violence at the Democratic convention in Chicago, the razor-thin election of Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew over Hubert Humphrey and Edmund Muskie in November.'b'But an awful lot of people tuned out after Kennedy was killed. That seemed to be when, for so many, the hope finally died. The nation has never really recovered from the bullet that killed R.F.K.'b'Arthur Schlesinger, in his biography of Kennedy, quotes Richard Harwood of The Washington Post:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe discovered in 1968 this deep, almost mystical bond that existed between Robert Kennedy and the Other America. It was a disquieting experience for reporters.  ... We were forced to recognize in Watts and Gary and Chimney Rock that the real stake in the American political process involves not the fate of speechwriters and fund-raisers, but the lives of millions of people seeking hope out of despair.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To the Editor:'b'In \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s Raise a Glass to Fairness\xe2\x80\x9d (Economic Scene, Dec. 26), David Leonhardt suggests that the argument for raising the federal tax on wine, unchanged at $1.07 a gallon since the early 1990s, is stronger than the argument for raising the tobacco tax. He points out all the ills associated with drinking abuse, including the some 17,000 Americans who die annually in alcohol-related traffic accidents.'b'It would seem that a far more appropriate tax to increase would be the federal gas tax, unchanged since 1993, at 18.4 cents a gallon.'b'Raising that tax would reflect all of the more than 42,000 traffic-related deaths each year, whether the result of drinking, fatigue, negligence or other causes.  Irvin Dawid'b'Palo Alto, Calif., Dec. 26, 2007'b'The most impressive thing about Mitt Romney is his clarity of mind. When he set out to pursue his party\xe2\x80\x99s nomination, he studied the contours of the Republican coalition and molded himself to its forms.'b'Earnestly and methodically, he has appealed to each of the major constituency groups. For national security conservatives, he vowed to double the size of the prison at Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay. For social conservatives, he embraced a culture war against the faithless. For immigration skeptics, he swung so far right he earned the endorsement of Tom Tancredo.'b'He has spent roughly $80 million, including an estimated $17 million of his own money, hiring consultants, blanketing the airwaves and building an organization that is unmatched on the Republican side.'b'And he has turned himself into the party\xe2\x80\x99s fusion candidate. Some of his rivals are stronger among social conservatives. Others are stronger among security conservatives, but no candidate has a foot in all camps the way Romney does. No candidate offends so few, or is the acceptable choice of so many.'b'And that is why Romney is at the fulcrum of the Republican race. He\xe2\x80\x99s looking strong in Iowa and is the only candidate who can afford to lose an important state and still win the nomination.'b'And yet as any true conservative can tell you, the sort of rational planning Mitt Romney embodies never works. The world is too complicated and human reason too limited. The PowerPoint mentality always fails to anticipate something. It always yields unintended consequences.'b'And what Romney failed to anticipate is this: In turning himself into an old-fashioned, orthodox Republican, he has made himself unelectable in the fall. When you look inside his numbers, you see tremendous weaknesses.'b'For example, Romney is astoundingly unpopular among young voters. Last month, the Harris Poll asked Republicans under 30 whom they supported. Romney came in fifth, behind Rudy Giuliani, Mike Huckabee, John McCain and Ron Paul. Romney had 7 percent support, a virtual tie with Tancredo. He does only a bit better among those aged 30 to 42.'b'Romney is also quite unpopular among middle-  and lower-middle class voters. In poll after poll, he leads among Republicans making more than $75,000 a year. He does poorly among those who make less.'b'If Romney is the general election candidate, he will face hostility from independent voters, who value authenticity. He will face hostility from Hispanic voters, who detest his new immigration positions. He will face great hostility in the media. Even conservative editorialists at places like The Union Leader in New Hampshire and The Boston Herald find his flip-flopping offensive.'b'But his biggest problem is a failure of imagination. Market research is a snapshot of the past. With his data-set mentality, Romney has chosen to model himself on a version of Republicanism that is receding into memory. As Walter Mondale was the last gasp of the fading New Deal coalition, Romney has turned himself into the last gasp of the Reagan coalition.'b'That coalition had its day, but it is shrinking now. The Republican Party is more unpopular than at any point in the past 40 years. Democrats have a 50 to 36 party identification advantage, the widest in a generation. The general public prefers Democratic approaches on health care, corruption, the economy and Iraq by double-digit margins. Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 losses have come across the board, but the G.O.P. has been hemorrhaging support among independent voters. Surveys from the Pew Research Center and The Washington Post, Kaiser Foundation and Harvard University show that independents are moving away from the G.O.P. on social issues, globalization and the roles of religion and government.'b'If any Republican candidate is going to win this year, he will have to offer a new brand of Republicanism. But Romney has tied himself to the old brand. He is unresponsive to the middle-class anxiety that Huckabee is tapping into. He has forsaken the trans-partisan candor that McCain represents. Romney, the cautious consultant, is pivoting to stress his corporate competence, and is rebranding himself as an Obama-esque change agent, but he will never make the sort of daring break that independent voters will demand if they are going to give the G.O.P. another look.'b'The leaders of the Republican coalition know Romney will lose. But some would rather remain in control of a party that loses than lose control of a party that wins. Others haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet suffered the agony of defeat, and so are not yet emotionally ready for the trauma of transformation. Others still simply don\xe2\x80\x99t know which way to turn.'b'And so the burden of change will be thrust on primary voters over the next few weeks. Romney is a decent man with some good fiscal and economic policies. But in this race, he has run like a manager, not an entrepreneur. His triumph this month would mean a Democratic victory in November.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hangover That Lasts\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Dec. 29), about the lingering damage caused by binge drinking:'b'One resolution recommended by Paul Steinberg is to \xe2\x80\x9cstop after one or two drinks.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In 1981, when I started the Broome County, New York, chapter of Remove Intoxicated Drivers, or RID, following the death of a 16-year-old cousin by a drunk driver, my own kids were 14, 12 and 11.'b'Naturally, even before they became \xe2\x80\x9cof age,\xe2\x80\x9d the subject of teenage drinking came up at home, and I became the laughingstock \xe2\x80\x94 in a good-natured way \xe2\x80\x94 of the younger set by suggesting that they would probably be safe if they limited themselves to one drink in a 24-hour period.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99d then add that I could imagine one 24-hour period ending, and the next beginning, at some point during a party \xe2\x80\x94 but they\xe2\x80\x99d have to remember that they\xe2\x80\x99d then have to wait another 24 hours.'b'Apparently they got the point.

The goal was to provide the American people with the fullest possible account of the \xe2\x80\x9cfacts and circumstances relating to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and to offer  recommendations to prevent future attacks. Soon after its creation, the president\xe2\x80\x99s chief of staff directed all executive branch agencies to cooperate with the commission.'b'The commission\xe2\x80\x99s mandate was sweeping and it explicitly included the intelligence agencies. But the recent revelations that the C.I.A. destroyed videotaped interrogations of Qaeda operatives leads us to conclude that the agency failed to respond to our lawful requests for information about the 9/11 plot. Those who knew about those videotapes \xe2\x80\x94 and did not tell us about them \xe2\x80\x94 obstructed our investigation.'b'There could have been absolutely no doubt in the mind of anyone at the C.I.A. \xe2\x80\x94 or the White House \xe2\x80\x94 of the commission\xe2\x80\x99s interest in any and all information related to Qaeda detainees involved in the 9/11 plot. Yet no one in the administration ever told the commission of the existence of videotapes of detainee interrogations.'b'When the press reported that, in 2002 and maybe at other times, the C.I.A. had recorded hundreds of hours of interrogations of at least two Qaeda detainees, we went back to check our records. We found that we did ask, repeatedly, for the kind of information that would have been contained in such videotapes.'b'The commission did not have a mandate to investigate how detainees were treated; our role was to investigate the history and evolution of Al Qaeda and the 9/11 plot. Beginning in June 2003, we requested all reports of intelligence information on these broad topics that had been gleaned from the interrogations of 118  named individuals, including both Abu Zubaydah and Abd al Rahim al-Nashiri, two senior Qaeda operatives, portions of whose interrogations were apparently recorded and then destroyed.'b'The C.I.A. gave us many reports summarizing information gained in the interrogations. But the reports raised almost as many questions as they answered. Agency officials assured us that, if we posed specific questions, they would do all they could to answer them.'b'So, in October 2003, we sent another wave of questions to the C.I.A.\xe2\x80\x99s general counsel. One set posed dozens of specific questions about the reports, including those about Abu Zubaydah. A second set, even more important in our view, asked for details about the translation process in the interrogations; the background of the interrogators; the way the interrogators handled inconsistencies in the detainees\xe2\x80\x99 stories; the particular questions that had been asked to elicit reported information; the way interrogators had followed up on certain lines of questioning; the context of the interrogations so we could assess the credibility and demeanor of the detainees when they made the reported statements; and the views or assessments of the interrogators themselves.'b'The general counsel responded in writing with non-specific replies. The agency did not disclose that any interrogations had ever been recorded or that it had held any further relevant information, in any form. Not satisfied with this response, we decided that we needed to question the detainees directly, including Abu Zubaydah and a few other key captives.'b'In a lunch meeting on Dec. 23, 2003, George Tenet, the C.I.A. director, told us point blank that we would have no such access. During the meeting, we emphasized to him that the C.I.A. should provide any documents responsive to our requests, even if the commission had not specifically asked for them. Mr. Tenet replied by alluding to several documents he thought would be helpful to us, but neither he, nor anyone else in the meeting, mentioned videotapes.'b'A meeting on Jan. 21, 2004, with Mr. Tenet, the White House counsel, the secretary of defense and a representative from the Justice Department also resulted in the denial of commission access to the detainees. Once again, videotapes were not mentioned.'b'As a result of this January meeting, the C.I.A. agreed to pose some of our questions to detainees and report back to us. The commission concluded this was all the administration could give us. But the commission never felt that its earlier questions had been satisfactorily answered. So the public would be aware of our concerns, we highlighted our caveats on page 146 in the commission report.'b'As a legal matter, it is not up to us to examine the C.I.A.\xe2\x80\x99s failure to disclose the existence of these tapes. That is for others. What we do know is that government officials decided not to inform a lawfully constituted body, created by Congress and the president, to investigate one the greatest tragedies to confront this country. We call that obstruction.'b'Special-interest money in politics is said to be like water \xe2\x80\x94 blocking its flow in one direction only channels it to another. In this year\xe2\x80\x99s presidential election, the flow is turning into a flood.'b'Campaign finance reforms have succeeded in cutting off the major parties from the corrupting power of unregulated \xe2\x80\x9csoft money\xe2\x80\x9d donations. That has simply shifted these donations to professedly independent groups. Regulating special-interest money in politics has never been more difficult \xe2\x80\x94 or more important.'b'Last year, groups not affiliated with the major parties were responsible for 19 percent of spending in federal elections, up from 7 percent in 2000, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal. These independent groups \xe2\x80\x94 often called \xe2\x80\x9c527s,\xe2\x80\x9d after the section of the tax code that allows them \xe2\x80\x94 are powerful conduits for special-interest money. They can raise money from corporations, organizations and wealthy individuals without the contribution limits that parties and campaigns have. Many represent very narrow political lobbies, like the tax-phobic Club for Growth, or various unions.'b'Although nominally unaffiliated with a particular candidate, these groups can play a critical role in the outcome of elections. A now-classic case is the 2004 attack advertising campaign paid for by Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, a group with no official ties to President Bush or the Republican Party.'b'Independent groups are flourishing this campaign season. Iowa is full of 527s, spending piles on television ads and get-out-the-vote efforts to help or harm candidates in both parties. The candidates invariably insist they have no control over the independents working on their behalf \xe2\x80\x94 even if, as in the case of one group helping John Edwards, it is run by a former top adviser.'b'Regulators have done little to stop this, even when campaign finance laws are being violated. Some of the worst offenders from 2004 were only recently slapped with fines. The slow-moving Federal Election Commission is likely to shift to wounded-snail pace next month when \xe2\x80\x94 because of a dispute over appointments to the commission \xe2\x80\x94 it is expected lose its quorum.'b'While the regulators are hobbled, the political operatives are becoming ever more wily. The newest players are so-called 501 (c) groups. That section of the tax code exempts nonprofit \xe2\x80\x9csocial welfare\xe2\x80\x9d groups, which are allowed to urge votes for or against candidates so long as partisan campaigning is not their primary purpose. These organizations, which are not required to detail their election spending or reveal donors\xe2\x80\x99 names, threaten to become this season\xe2\x80\x99s big new laissez-faire outlet.'b'It often looks like there is no way to hold back this flood. But giving up on regulating money in elections would be giving up on the goal of fair elections. Congress, regulators and the courts must do their best to be as creative and vigilant about keeping the money under control as special interests are in spending it.'b'Los Angeles'b'TO mathematicians, 32 is an interesting number: it\xe2\x80\x99s 2 raised to the fifth power, 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2. To economists, 32 is even more special, because it measures the difference in lifestyles between the first world and the developing world. The average rates at which people consume resources like oil and metals, and produce wastes like plastics and greenhouse gases, are about 32 times higher in North America, Western Europe, Japan and Australia than they are in the developing world. That factor of 32 has big consequences.'b'To understand them, consider our concern with world population. Today, there are more than 6.5 billion people, and that number may grow to around 9 billion within this half-century. Several decades ago, many people considered rising population to be the main challenge facing humanity. Now we realize that it matters only insofar as people consume and produce.'b'If most of the world\xe2\x80\x99s 6.5 billion people were in cold storage and not metabolizing or consuming, they would create no resource problem. What really matters is total world consumption, the sum of all local consumptions, which is the product of local population times the local per capita consumption rate.'b'The estimated one billion people who live in developed countries have a relative per capita consumption rate of 32. Most of the world\xe2\x80\x99s other 5.5 billion people constitute the developing world, with relative per capita consumption rates below 32, mostly down toward 1.'b'The population especially of the developing world is growing, and some people remain fixated on this. They note that populations of countries like Kenya are growing rapidly, and they say that\xe2\x80\x99s a big problem. Yes, it is a problem for Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s more than 30 million people, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not a burden on the whole world, because Kenyans consume so little. (Their relative per capita rate is 1.) A real problem for the world is that each of us 300 million Americans consumes as much as 32 Kenyans. With 10 times the population, the United States consumes 320 times more resources than Kenya does.'b'People in the third world are aware of this difference in per capita consumption, although most of them couldn\xe2\x80\x99t specify that it\xe2\x80\x99s by a factor of 32. When they believe their chances of catching up to be  hopeless, they sometimes get frustrated and angry, and some become terrorists, or tolerate or support terrorists. Since Sept. 11, 2001, it has become clear that the oceans that once protected the United States no longer do so. There will be more terrorist attacks against us and Europe, and perhaps against Japan and Australia, as long as that factorial difference of 32 in consumption rates persists.'b'People who consume little want to enjoy the high-consumption lifestyle. Governments of developing countries make an increase in living standards a primary goal of national policy. And tens of millions of people in the developing world seek the first-world lifestyle on their own, by emigrating, especially to the United States and Western Europe, Japan and Australia. Each such transfer of a person to a high-consumption country raises world consumption rates, even though most immigrants don\xe2\x80\x99t succeed immediately in multiplying their consumption by 32.'b'Among the developing countries that are seeking to increase per capita consumption rates at home, China stands out. It has the world\xe2\x80\x99s fastest growing economy, and there are 1.3 billion Chinese, four times the United States population. The world is already running out of resources, and it will do so even sooner if China achieves American-level consumption rates. Already, China is competing with us for oil and metals on world markets.'b'Per capita consumption rates in China are still about 11 times below ours, but let\xe2\x80\x99s suppose they rise to our level. Let\xe2\x80\x99s also make things easy by imagining that nothing else happens to increase world consumption \xe2\x80\x94 that is, no other country increases its consumption, all national populations (including China\xe2\x80\x99s) remain unchanged and immigration ceases. China\xe2\x80\x99s catching up alone would roughly double world consumption rates. Oil consumption would increase by 106 percent, for instance, and world metal consumption by 94 percent.'b'If India as well as China were to catch up, world consumption rates would triple. If the whole developing world were suddenly to catch up, world rates would increase elevenfold. It would be as if the world population ballooned to 72 billion people (retaining present consumption rates).'b'Some optimists claim that we could support a world with nine billion people. But I haven\xe2\x80\x99t met anyone crazy enough to claim that we could support 72 billion. Yet we often promise developing countries that if they will only adopt good policies \xe2\x80\x94 for example, institute honest government and a free-market economy \xe2\x80\x94 they, too, will be able to enjoy a first-world lifestyle. This promise is impossible, a cruel hoax: we are having difficulty supporting a first-world lifestyle even now for only one billion people.'b'We Americans may think of China\xe2\x80\x99s growing consumption as a problem. But the Chinese are only reaching for the consumption rate we already have. To tell them not to try would be futile.'b'The only approach that China and other developing countries will accept is to aim to make consumption rates and living standards more equal around the world. But the world doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have enough resources to allow for raising China\xe2\x80\x99s consumption rates, let alone those of the rest of the world, to our levels. Does this mean we\xe2\x80\x99re headed for disaster?'b'No, we could have a stable outcome in which all countries converge on consumption rates considerably below the current highest levels. Americans might object: there is no way we would sacrifice our living standards for the benefit of people in the rest of the world. Nevertheless, whether we get there willingly or not, we shall soon have lower consumption rates, because our present rates are unsustainable.'b'Real sacrifice wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be required, however, because living standards are not tightly coupled to consumption rates. Much American consumption is wasteful and contributes little or nothing to quality of life. For example, per capita oil consumption in Western Europe is about half of ours,  yet Western Europe\xe2\x80\x99s standard of living is higher by any reasonable criterion, including life expectancy, health, infant mortality, access to medical care, financial security after retirement, vacation time, quality of public schools and support for the arts. Ask yourself whether Americans\xe2\x80\x99 wasteful use of gasoline contributes positively to any of those measures.'b'Other aspects of our consumption are wasteful, too. Most of the world\xe2\x80\x99s fisheries are still operated non-sustainably, and many have already collapsed or fallen to low yields \xe2\x80\x94 even though we know how to manage them in such a way as to preserve the environment and the fish supply. If we were to operate all fisheries sustainably, we could extract fish from the oceans at maximum historical rates and carry on indefinitely.'b'The same is true of forests: we already know how to log them sustainably, and if we did so worldwide, we could extract enough timber to meet the world\xe2\x80\x99s wood and paper needs. Yet most forests are managed non-sustainably, with decreasing yields.'b'Just as it is certain that within most of our lifetimes we\xe2\x80\x99ll be consuming less than we do now, it is also certain that per capita consumption rates in many developing countries will one day be more nearly equal to ours. These are desirable trends, not horrible prospects. In fact, we already know how to encourage the trends; the main thing lacking has been political will.'b'Fortunately, in  the last year there have been encouraging signs. Australia held a recent election in which a large majority of voters reversed the head-in-the-sand political course their government had followed for a decade; the new government immediately supported the Kyoto Protocol on cutting greenhouse gas emissions.'b'Also in the last year, concern about climate change has increased greatly in the United States. Even in China, vigorous arguments about environmental policy are taking place, and public protests recently halted construction of a huge chemical plant near the center of Xiamen. Hence I am cautiously optimistic. The world has serious consumption problems, but we can solve them if we choose to do so.'b'As 2008 begins, house prices are still skidding, bank losses are still mounting, oil is again flirting with $100 a barrel and consumers are buying less as prices rise. To many, the wheels appear to be coming off the economy. To others, including President Bush and his aides, the economy is fundamentally sound and resilient.'b'Obviously, both camps cannot be right. Unfortunately, the preponderance of evidence is grim.'b'When Mr. Bush says the economy is strong, he is generally referring to rising wages, low unemployment and what he calls healthy economic growth. But wages have either fallen or failed to outpace inflation during most of his tenure.  Job creation is now slowing from a pace that has long been subpar. Economic growth is also braking, if not contracting. In any event, growth during the Bush years has not been healthy; rather, it has been abnormally lopsided. Corporate profits have soared (until recently) and the rich have become richer, while most Americans have treaded water or lost ground, their troubling circumstances masked by an unprecedented borrowing binge, now exacting its toll.'b'The other presumed economic bright spots \xe2\x80\x94 business investment and exports \xe2\x80\x94 are less bright upon closer inspection. According to a new government report, orders for big-ticket commercial goods rose a spare 0.1 percent in November.'b'As for exports, they have surged lately, but the growth has not yet led to more manufacturing jobs or inflation-beating pay raises for existing factory workers. The relative health of exporters is also obscuring the fact that to be more competitive in the long term, corporate America needs health care reform and tax reform, two fronts on which the Bush administration has made no progress. Instead, much if not most of recent export growth is due to the weakening dollar, which makes American products more affordable elsewhere.'b'While the boost is welcome, relying solely on a weaker currency to correct America\xe2\x80\x99s trade imbalance has downsides. For one, a falling dollar interacts with global money flows in a way that complicates the job of the Federal Reserve to steer the economy.

Kucinich\xe2\x80\x99s positions on most issues actually seem closer to John Edwards\xe2\x80\x99s, but last summer Edwards was caught on tape whispering to Hillary Clinton that Dennis was really not a serious contender. Petty, perhaps, but in a contest that begins with the presumption that nobody is qualified to lead the most powerful nation on earth without making at least two visits to Pottawattamie County, it resonates.'b'The Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s announcement that it has ordered a formal criminal investigation into the destruction of Central Intelligence Agency interrogation videotapes is a heartening, and unaccustomed, sign that the attorney general is doing his duty to get to the bottom of a roiling scandal.'b'After years of watching his predecessor excuse and obscure government wrongdoing, Attorney General Michael Mukasey\xe2\x80\x99s choice of a tough-minded career federal prosecutor to lead the criminal inquiry also strikes us as a good sign. This is especially true considering Mr. Mukasey\xe2\x80\x99s faltering performance at his confirmation hearing, where he refused to say whether he considered waterboarding \xe2\x80\x94 a brutal interrogation method believed to be shown on the tapes \xe2\x80\x94 to be torture.'b'It is essential that the truth of what was on those tapes and how they came to be destroyed now comes out and that all of the government officials involved in their destruction be held legally accountable \xe2\x80\x94 whether they are C.I.A. officers or top White House officials who spent three years debating whether to destroy the tapes.'b'The tapes, which depicted the interrogations of two Al Qaeda operatives in 2002, may themselves have amounted to evidence of a crime \xe2\x80\x94 torture \xe2\x80\x94 carried out under the president\xe2\x80\x99s authority. The decision to destroy them appears to be one more move by the Bush administration to cover up the many abuses it has committed in the name of fighting terrorism.'b'Reporting by The Times has shown that the destruction was, indeed, driven by fear of public scrutiny.'b'Government officials may also have engaged in illegal obstruction when they failed to provide the tapes to the bipartisan commission that President Bush assigned to review the events surrounding the Sept. 11 attacks, or to the courts. Mr. Mukasey\xe2\x80\x99s decision followed a joint preliminary inquiry by the Justice Department and the C.I.A.\xe2\x80\x99s inspector general, which determined a full criminal investigation was warranted.'b'John Durham, a federal prosecutor from Connecticut who will be in charge of the inquiry, has the experience for the job. We hope that he will also have the independence he needs to do it correctly.'b'We are eager to see Mr. Durham get to work \xe2\x80\x94 and eager to see the results. The country does not need an investigation that lasts years.'b'Mr. Durham\xe2\x80\x99s new assignment does not lessen the importance or urgency of an investigation into the matter by Congress. Lawmakers have ordered Jose A. Rodriguez Jr., the former head of the C.I.A.\xe2\x80\x99s clandestine branch, to appear at a hearing this month. Nor should it affect the A.C.L.U.\xe2\x80\x99s pending civil case seeking contempt sanctions for the C.I.A.\xe2\x80\x99s withholding of evidence sought under the Freedom of Information Act.'b'It is vital that Mr. Durham work quickly and fearlessly to collect evidence, establish what exactly was on those tapes and how they came to be destroyed, and determine what, if any prosecutions, are warranted. The ultimate test for Mr. Mukasey will be whether he grants Mr. Durham the latitude he needs to conduct a searching inquiry free of political meddling.'b'Iowa City'b'SOON, life here in Iowa returns to normal.'b'After months of campaigning from basement apartments, the guests from out of state will head for the airports. Their vacated apartments will be aired out and put to order. As several thousand reporters move on to New Hampshire, the local talk will turn from caucusing to a more global topic: weather. Iowans will settle in for the heart of winter, when the political yard signs will be buried in snow.'b'As recent newcomers from Massachusetts, my husband, Rob, and I will regret the closing of the Iowa primary season. We are awestruck to find ourselves living in a state where we need only walk three blocks to see pop icons opening for major candidates. We are thrilled to live where home prices are such that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be millionaires to put up a political yard sign. This year, we rushed to participate. In mid-October, we signed commitment cards and planted the symbol of our candidate on our front lawn.'b'In contrast, our more experienced Iowan friends and neighbors are philosophical about their role in American politics.

Patrons vote by putting a coffee bean in a glass jar marked for their candidate. This method is quintessentially Iowan: truth-seeking, modest and concrete.

No big deal.'b'As our season in the national spotlight comes to an end, some have asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy Iowa?\xe2\x80\x9d Why this hoopla for the votes of a state with more pigs than people? To this, I would respond, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not Iowa?\xe2\x80\x9d It has no national sports teams; there is plenty of untapped loyalty in the air. Its appreciation for diversity, I think, is underrated. Most important, Iowans possess a healthy Midwestern skepticism paired with a remarkably low level of cynicism. They are confident in their right, held by all Americans: the right to hold the future of the nation in their hands.'b'Tonight, when Rob and I stand in the local high school cafeteria with new friends and neighbors, we will be reborn as Iowans. Tomorrow, when it\xe2\x80\x99s all over, we will settle in for a long winter. We will purchase warmer clothing. We will spin winter dreams, like new strategies for the next hotly contested caucus season. Next time, we will make the most of our moment in the spotlight.

The studies found that uninsured people suffer significantly worse outcomes from cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer than those who have coverage.'b'One study by researchers at Harvard Medical School, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that uninsured near-elderly people got sicker at a faster rate than comparable people with insurance. Those disparities were sharply reduced when people turned 65 and became eligible for Medicare. Those who previously had insurance reported no significant change in their health as they transitioned to Medicare, but those with little or no prior coverage reported a substantial slowing of the decline of their health. It was strong proof of the value of Medicare\xe2\x80\x99s universal coverage for elderly Americans.'b'The value was particularly evident for previously uninsured individuals suffering from heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure or diabetes. Once on Medicare, they benefited greatly from medical management of blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose levels and quicker access to effective treatments and prescription drugs. They had 10 percent fewer major cardiac complications, such as heart attacks or heart failure, than would have been expected by age 72 based on their previous health trends.'b'A second study, by researchers at the American Cancer Society, found substantial evidence that lack of adequate health insurance coverage was associated with less access to care and poorer outcomes for cancer patients. The uninsured were less likely to receive recommended cancer screening tests and more likely to have their cancers diagnosed at a later stage, when they are less curable. They had lower survival rates than those with private insurance for several cancers for which there are screening tests and effective treatments, including breast and colorectal cancer.'b'The two studies leave little doubt that health improves when people gain insurance coverage. That coverage should be available to all Americans.'b'RIO DE JANEIRO'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s good to begin the year in a country where coconuts are cleaved with nonchalant grace and the air is salty-sweet and there are guys on the beach from the \xe2\x80\x9cLife is Too Short Surf Club\xe2\x80\x9d and the minister of tourism advises those frustrated by long lines in airports to \xe2\x80\x9crelax and come.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That last remark from Marta Suplicy was voted one of the quotes of the year by the daily O Globo, along with another from President Luiz In\xc3\xa1cio Lula da Silva evoking the most sensitive point of the female anatomy to explain his search for the essence of an energy accord with the United States.

Kirk 'b'\nHanover, N.H., Dec. 28, 2007'b''b''b'The writer is an associate librarian for information resources, Dartmouth College Library.'b''b'Cupertino, Calif.'b'LIKE many Americans, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been tuned into the nonstop coverage of the Iowa caucuses. Unlike many Americans, I\xe2\x80\x99m an actual Iowan, having grown up there in the 1930s. As I watch and listen from the promised land of California, where I moved long ago, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help but keep returning to a twin observation: Yes, this is really different from the Iowa of my childhood \xe2\x80\x94 but it\xe2\x80\x99s also kind of the same.'b'The difference is obvious and inescapable. The hypersaturated media and political attention we take for granted today depends on a system of communication that is fast, reliable and far-reaching. In my time such a system did not exist.'b'In the small town of Garrison, where I grew up, most houses had just a telephone, a big wooden boxy affair that was attached to the wall in the kitchen. A telephone switchboard installed in the front of one of the two gasoline filling stations on Main Street, which was all of four blocks long, was efficiently operated by Gesena Gross, an old maid. (That\xe2\x80\x99s what we callously called unmarried females in those days.) She was known as \xe2\x80\x9cCentral.\xe2\x80\x9d Her official hours were from about 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. She also had a switchboard in her home where one could call after hours in an emergency.'b'The farms had to share telephone lines; each family was assigned different rings so you could know whom the call was for. For instance, the Irwins would have one long ring and two short ones; the Burkeys would be assigned three short rings; the Boldts would have one long, one short, one long and one short and so on.'b'The problem arose when people on the same line would listen in on someone else\xe2\x80\x99s call and thus drain the power. The exasperated original callers could barely hear each other and there would ensue a request to the unwelcome eavesdroppers, incremental in intensity. \xe2\x80\x9cWill one or two of you please hang up your receivers?\xe2\x80\x9d and ending with \xe2\x80\x9cGet off the damn line!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As for other forms of communication, Garrison had no newspaper and no mail delivery. Residents daily walked to a post office on the town square. I do recall that there was mail delivery to the surrounding farm houses; the job was not highly paid but it was coveted because it came, on retirement, with a federal pension.'b'And radios? Most people owned simple devices that were powered by a battery or a small wind generator on the roof. Electrification came with the New Deal a few years later.'b'So where are the similarities?'b'Though Iowa has been holding caucuses since the mid-1800s, the rest of the country didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay attention to them until recently, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t even remember them from my childhood. What I do remember, though, are the passionate political gatherings that regularly took place on my grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s front porch. It occurs to me that these were not so different in spirit from the caucuses we are enduring now.'b'I recall the scenes from early in the \xe2\x80\x9930s. In early evening, after supper, about a half a dozen of the older men from the area would gather to chew the fat. After discussing local matters, the talk quite often turned to the who, why and how of political preferences.'b'Grandpa was a slight man, constructed mostly of bone, muscle and gristle. He liked to sit or stand quietly with his hands loosely clasped inside and just above the top of the bib of his denim overalls. He seldom raised his voice and he spoke softly and thoughtfully. He sounded authoritative.'b'Some of the men I remember: Ed Meece and Cap Gross were assertive Republicans; they were Herbert Hoover supporters. So was A. J. Donald, our neighbor and a banker. These gentlemen didn\xe2\x80\x99t think government should intervene in public affairs to fix the economy. They were certain that Franklin Roosevelt would ruin America.'b'Alex Irwin, Clarence Barkdoll and Ed Baldwin (our only druggist) \xe2\x80\x94 and Grandpa were dedicated Democrats who derisively pointed out \xe2\x80\x9cHoover villages\xe2\x80\x9d made of cardboard and flimsy lumber. (They called newspapers \xe2\x80\x9cHoover blankets.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'Grandpa was the only one of the group who was a farmer. And he understood that Roosevelt\xe2\x80\x99s programs would help the rural areas. In particular, I remember him talking about Roosevelt\xe2\x80\x99s promise to create \xe2\x80\x9cFarm to Market\xe2\x80\x9d roads that would put crushed rock mined from local limestone quarries on top of the dirt roads that storms turned into impassable mud paths, a monumental plague of the farm communities.'b'My grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s mini-caucuses and passions weren\xe2\x80\x99t just reserved for adults, though. Most mornings, before we trotted off to school, he would assemble my three other siblings and me. Generally, he\xe2\x80\x99d read us a few cogent Bible verses while we stood there, all gussied up in our clean school clothes, dinner pails in hand, champing to be off to see our classmates.'b'One morning, just as the Roosevelt-Hoover race was heating up, Grandpa glanced up during his reading and noticed a large pin on my older brother Jack\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. (Jack was probably 12 at the time.) The button, with bold black letters on a white background, read \xe2\x80\x9cHoover.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Grandpa froze; his face took on a grim, stony look; he gritted his teeth. Without seeming to look at the Bible, he finished his reading abruptly. Staring directly at Jack, he tapped his own shoulder and then pointed to the basket of corn cobs that fed the kitchen stove. In a split second, Jack plucked the offending emblem from his shoulder and flung it into the corn cobs. We went merrily off to school. Roosevelt won that election.'b'The murderous tribal violence that has spread through Kenya in recent days would be horrifying anywhere. It is particularly tragic to see this happening in a country that seemed finally to be on the path to a democratic and economically sound future. There may still be a chance to retrieve some of these hopes. That will likely require stepping back from the suspicious and hastily declared election results that sparked this ugly upheaval.'b'Officially, those results gave a second term to President Mwai Kibaki, despite independent reports of egregious irregularities. Even the chairman of Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s national election commission now says that he was pressured into an early declaration and cannot say who won.'b'Mr. Kibaki should renounce that official declaration and the embarassingly swift swearing in that followed. He should then meet with his principal challenger, Raila Odinga, to discuss a possible vote recount, election re-run or other reasonable compromise.'b'That isn\xe2\x80\x99t likely to happen without outside prodding. Urgent mediation by the leader of the African Union, John Kufuor, could help bring the two together before the violence gets worse. Already, more than 300 Kenyans are dead, 70,000 have been driven from their homes and thousands have fled to neighboring countries.'b'How different things seemed five years ago. Then Mr. Kibaki, allied with Mr. Odinga, was the democratic reformer challenging Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s longtime autocratic leader Daniel arap Moi and his handpicked candidate. Mr. Moi\xe2\x80\x99s reign was repressive and notoriously corrupt. International donors grew wary and despite having some of the best agricultural land, the most attractive tourist destinations and the best urban infrastructure in East Africa, Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s economy stagnated.'b'Mr. Kibaki promised change and won in what was the freest election Kenya has ever known. Since then, he has delivered on many of his promises. Corruption is still a serious problem, but Kenya has enjoyed an expansion of free primary and secondary education, vibrant growth and important reforms of the judiciary, civil service and economy. Now, Mr. Kibaki\xe2\x80\x99s apparent attempt to rig his own re-election has put these gains at grave risk.'b'Tribal resentments have long played a role in Kenyan politics. They flared anew after Mr. Kibaki and Mr. Odinga fell out over the spoils of the 2002 election. Mr. Kibaki comes from the long-dominant Kikuyu group, Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s largest. Mr. Odinga comes from the Luo, a smaller but politically important tribe.  Much of the violence of recent days has involved these two groups. In rural Eldoret, some 50 Kikuyu were burned to death inside a church where they had sought refuge. In the vast and tribally mixed urban slums of Nairobi, rival militias have been waging open warfare.'b'Mr. Kibaki and Mr. Odinga cannot ignore the chaos around them. No matter their personal ambitions and resentments, they must be brought together and pushed to come up with a solution that will calm their followers and restore Kenyans\xe2\x80\x99 faith in their democratic system \xe2\x80\x94  before the damage becomes irreversible.'b'The candidates have spent a year and tens of millions of dollars in Iowa, and Thursday night the first actual voters offered their first assessments. Some candidates and their strategists were hoping the caucuses and the New Hampshire primary next week would settle the race, weeding out the contenders for the two major parties\xe2\x80\x99 presidential nominations. Watching the campaign in cold, snowy and mostly empty Iowa, we were hoping for something else \xe2\x80\x94 that this year\xe2\x80\x99s Iowa-New Hampshire rush to judgment will be the last.'b'For all of Thursday night\xe2\x80\x99s drama, the results in Iowa did not preclude a race going into New Hampshire, and, we hope, beyond \xe2\x80\x94 to South Carolina, Florida and the cluster of primaries on Feb. 5. Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton, but she\xe2\x80\x99s got plenty of money left, and John Edwards got a boost. Mike Huckabee\xe2\x80\x99s win was unlikely to deter Mitt Romney or the Republicans who did not contest Iowa: John McCain and Rudolph Giuliani.'b'Keeping this race alive so significant numbers of Americans in more populated states can participate would begin to make up for the ludicrous spectacle of the past year, which enriched the television networks and the political consultants (some $300 million already spent) far more than it enriched the political dialogue. We hope both parties will wake up and end the undemocratic system in which the choice of a new president rests far too heavily on nonbinding votes in January by voters that don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily represent the rest of the country.'b'We don\xe2\x80\x99t question the enthusiasm or the commitment of the people of Iowa and New Hampshire. But Iowa, where a huge turnout amounts to less than 10 percent of the population, is about 92 percent white, more rural and older than the rest of the nation. New Hampshire has a non-Hispanic white population of about 95 percent. Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s Democrats are more liberal and more protectionist than the nation\xe2\x80\x99s Democrats. Its Republicans are more conservative, and religiously driven, than the nation\xe2\x80\x99s Republicans. And yet, The Boston Globe reported that Mr. Romney spent $7 million on ads in Iowa. That\xe2\x80\x99s nearly $4 per registered voter.'b'We believe the time has long passed for both parties to not only break the Iowa-New Hampshire habit but also end the damaging race to be third, with states pushing their primaries closer and closer to New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day.'b'Instead, the country should adopt a more sensible and more representative system of regional primaries, in which states are divided into regional groups that vote on a designated day. The honor of going first would rotate year to year among the regions. That would give a far broader range of American voters a say in this vitally important choice.'b'Make no mistake, there are choices to be made in this first election in many, many years in which both parties\xe2\x80\x99 nominations are being contested. Most of the Republican contenders (with the exception, most of the time, of Senator John McCain) offer the same kind of politics of division that has so polarized this nation over the last seven years. It is a politics that thrives on religious and social intolerance and fear.'b'Mr. Huckabee, the Baptist minister and former Arkansas governor, cloaks himself in affability and Christianity. But he bullied Mr. Romney into pleading with religious conservatives to accept his Mormon faith as Christian enough for a Republican nominee and, after professing charity, has recently become a scourge of undocumented immigrants.'b'Fear often appears to be the only plank on which Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, is standing, when you can tell where he is standing at all. Mr. Giuliani, who parlayed the 9/11 tragedy into a lucrative business and now speaks, bizarrely, of the \xe2\x80\x9c9/11 generation,\xe2\x80\x9d has switched his views a dizzying number of times \xe2\x80\x94 on immigration, on abortion, on New York.'b'Almost as dizzying, in fact, as the pirouettes executed by Mr. Romney, who wants American voters to forget his record as governor of Massachusetts \xe2\x80\x94 where he endorsed gay marriage and reproductive choice \xe2\x80\x94 and believe what he says now that he wants to be president. Among Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s tailored-for-the-campaign proposals is to double the size of the prison in Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay, Cuba, which even President Bush knows must be closed.'b'All of the Republicans want to continue President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s disaster of a war in Iraq, including Mr. McCain. He, however, has taken a courageous stand for immigration reform, which seemed to doom his candidacy last year, and is a strong advocate of the need to confront global warming and to stop the abuse of prisoners in Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s system of secret prisons.'b'The Democrats are united in their opposition to the war, but none have spelled out a persuasive plan for getting American troops home without setting off a wider conflagration.'b'Senator Obama generates enormous excitement with his youth, and his promises of change \xe2\x80\x94 even if it\xe2\x80\x99s not entirely clear what he intends to change or how. Senator Clinton, meanwhile, wavers between wanting to be seen as ready to serve as president because of her eight years in the White House with her husband \xe2\x80\x94 and trying to satisfy voters\xe2\x80\x99  yearnings for new ideas and new ways.'b'Mr. Edwards has a strong populist message, but it sounds a bit odd coming from a former tort lawyer and hedge fund executive who ran as a completely different person in 2004.  One of his ads features an out-of-work Maytag employee who said Mr. Edwards promised his 7-year-old son: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to keep fighting for your daddy\xe2\x80\x99s job.\xe2\x80\x9d We\xe2\x80\x99re still waiting for Mr. Edwards to explain how he, or any politician, can turn back the tide of economics and globalization. We\xe2\x80\x99d prefer if he explained how to make it work for all Americans.'b'None of this has led us to a choice in the nominating contests, never mind for the presidency. The majority of Americans are in the same position. That\xe2\x80\x99s why they should be allowed to see and hear more of these candidates, and not have to settle for the judgments of the people of Iowa and New Hampshire.'b'To the Editor:'b'In \xe2\x80\x9cNew Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve\xe2\x80\x9d (The Rural Life, Dec. 31), Verlyn Klinkenborg writes that he goes outside to stand with his horses shortly before midnight to savor an anticlimactic New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve with them.'b'But the anticlimax for this farmer comes several hours before midnight when I stoke the fire and turn out the lights.'b'The anticlimax continues when, several hours before sunrise, the collies wake me.

I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been through an election night that brought two.'b'Barack Obama has won the Iowa caucuses. You\xe2\x80\x99d have to have a heart of stone not to feel moved by this. An African-American man wins a closely fought campaign in a pivotal state. He beats two strong opponents, including the mighty Clinton machine. He does it in a system that favors rural voters. He does it by getting young voters to come out to the caucuses.'b'This is a huge moment. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of those times when a movement that seemed ethereal and idealistic became a reality and took on political substance.'b'Iowa won\xe2\x80\x99t settle the race, but the rest of the primary season is going to be colored by the glow of this result. Whatever their political affiliations, Americans are going to feel good about the Obama victory, which is a story of youth, possibility and unity through diversity \xe2\x80\x94 the primordial themes of the American experience.'b'And Americans are not going to want to see this stopped. When an African-American man is leading a juggernaut to the White House, do you want to be the one to stand up and say No?'b'Obama has achieved something remarkable. At first blush, his speeches are abstract, secular sermons of personal uplift \xe2\x80\x94 filled with disquisitions on the nature of hope and the contours of change.'b'He talks about erasing old categories like red and blue (and implicitly, black and white) and replacing them with new categories, of which the most important are new and old. He seems at first more preoccupied with changing thinking than changing legislation.'b'Yet over the course of his speeches and over the course of this campaign, he has persuaded many Iowans that there is substance here as well. He built a great organization and produced a tangible victory.'b'He\xe2\x80\x99s made Hillary Clinton, with her wonkish, pragmatic approach to politics, seem uninspired. He\xe2\x80\x99s made John Edwards, with his angry cries that \xe2\x80\x9ccorporate greed is killing your children\xe2\x80\x99s future,\xe2\x80\x9d seem old-fashioned. Edwards\xe2\x80\x99s political career is probably over.'b'Obama is changing the tone of American liberalism, and maybe American politics, too.'b'On the Republican side, my message is: Be not afraid. Some people are going to tell you that Mike Huckabee\xe2\x80\x99s victory last night in Iowa represents a triumph for the creationist crusaders. Wrong.'b'Huckabee won because he tapped into realities that other Republicans have been slow to recognize. First, evangelicals have changed. Huckabee is the first ironic evangelical on the national stage. He\xe2\x80\x99s funny, campy (see his Chuck Norris fixation) and he\xe2\x80\x99s not at war with modern culture.'b'Second, Huckabee understands much better than Mitt Romney that we have a crisis of authority in this country. People have lost faith in their leaders\xe2\x80\x99 ability to respond to problems. While Romney embodies the leadership class, Huckabee went after it. He criticized Wall Street and K Street. Most importantly, he sensed that conservatives do not believe their own movement is well led. He took on Rush Limbaugh, the Club for Growth and even President Bush. The old guard threw everything they had at him, and their diminished power is now exposed.'b'Third, Huckabee understands how middle-class anxiety is really lived. Democrats talk about wages. But real middle-class families have more to fear economically from divorce than from a free trade pact. A person\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime prospects will be threatened more by single parenting than by outsourcing. Huckabee understands that economic well-being is fused with social and moral well-being, and he talks about the inter-relationship in a way no other candidate has.'b'In that sense, Huckabee\xe2\x80\x99s victory is not a step into the past. It opens up the way for a new coalition.'b'A conservatism that recognizes stable families as the foundation of economic growth is not hard to imagine. A conservatism that loves capitalism but distrusts capitalists is not hard to imagine either. Adam Smith felt this way. A conservatism that pays attention to people making less than $50,000 a year is the only conservatism worth defending.'b'Will Huckabee move on and lead this new conservatism? Highly doubtful. The past few weeks have exposed his serious flaws as a presidential candidate. His foreign policy knowledge is minimal. His lapses into amateurishness simply won\xe2\x80\x99t fly in a national campaign.'b'So the race will move on to New Hampshire. Mitt Romney is now grievously wounded. Romney represents what\xe2\x80\x99s left of Republicanism 1.0. Huckabee and McCain represent half-formed iterations of Republicanism 2.0. My guess is Republicans will now swing behind McCain in order to stop Mike.'b'Huckabee probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be the nominee, but starting last night in Iowa, an evangelical began the Republican Reformation.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cImmigration and the Candidates\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Dec. 30):'b'You imply that liberal Democrats are in agreement that the 12 million immigrants in the United States illegally should be welcomed into legal status because they are here and it is unrealistic to do otherwise.'b'This is one liberal who believes that amnesty (or whatever euphemism you prefer), in addition to fostering a diminution of respect for the law, will serve as a signal to millions of others that if they can get here, they are home free.'b'Even the most generous of societies has to recognize the limits of its resources. With the world\xe2\x80\x99s population rising fast, we cannot address the unchecked growth of underdeveloped areas by admitting everybody to this country.'b'Any policy that signals a pseudo-open border will intensify the many resource problems we are already bumping up against. The Census Bureau predicts that if our immigration policy is not changed, our population will exceed 400 million by 2050.'b'The answer is not a fence across the South; as you say, 40 percent of illegal immigrants enter legally and overstay their visas.

If we had a secure border, combined with a temporary moratorium on legal immigration, we could bring our average total immigration levels back to historical norms.'b'A moratorium for 10 years, or perhaps 15, would cancel out the illegal immigration of recent years. This would also allow us to concentrate on a humane policy of assimilation for the millions of illegal immigrants who are here as a result of our government\xe2\x80\x99s failure to keep them out.'b'The moratorium approach is simple.

But what does it mean, aside from the obvious point that the economy is under extra pressure?'b'Well, one thing it means is that we\xe2\x80\x99re having the wrong discussion about foreign policy.'b'Almost all the foreign policy talk in this presidential campaign has been motivated, one way or another, by 9/11 and the war in Iraq. Yet it\xe2\x80\x99s a very good bet that the biggest foreign policy issues for the next president will involve the Far East rather than the Middle East. In particular, the crucial questions are likely to involve the consequences of China\xe2\x80\x99s economic growth.'b'Turn to any of several major concerns now facing America, and in each case it\xe2\x80\x99s startling how large a role China plays.'b'Start with the soaring price of oil. Unlike the oil crises that followed the Yom Kippur War and the overthrow of the shah of Iran, this crisis wasn\xe2\x80\x99t caused by events in the Middle East that disrupted world oil supply. Instead, it had its roots in Asia.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s true that the global supply of oil has been growing sluggishly, mainly because the world is, bit by bit, running out of the stuff: big oil discoveries have become rare, and when oil is found, it\xe2\x80\x99s harder to get at. But the reason oil supply hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to keep up with demand is surging oil consumption in newly industrializing economies \xe2\x80\x94 above all, in China.'b'Even now, China accounts for about only 9 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s demand for oil. But because China\xe2\x80\x99s oil demand has been rising along with its economy, in recent years China has been responsible for about a third of the growth in world oil consumption.'b'As a result, oil at $100 a barrel is, in large part, a made-in-China phenomenon.'b'Speaking of made in China, that brings us to a second issue. There\xe2\x80\x99s growing concern in this country about the effects of globalization on wages, largely because imports of manufactured goods from low-wage countries have surged, doubling as a share of G.D.P. since 1993. And more than half of that rise reflects the explosive growth of U.S. industrial imports from China, which went from less than 0.5 percent of G.D.P. in 1993 to more than 2 percent in 2006.'b'Last, but most important, is the issue of climate change, which will eventually be recognized as the most crucial problem facing America and the world \xe2\x80\x94 maybe not today, and maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of our lives.'b'Why is climate change a China issue? Well, China is already, by some estimates, the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest emitter of greenhouse gases. And as with oil demand, China plays a disproportionate role in emissions growth. In fact, between 2000 and 2005 China accounted for more than half the increase in the world\xe2\x80\x99s emissions of carbon dioxide.'b'What this means is that any attempt to mitigate global warming will be woefully inadequate unless it includes China.'b'Indeed, back in 2001, when he reneged on his campaign promise to limit greenhouse gas emissions, President Bush cited the fact that the Kyoto treaty didn\xe2\x80\x99t include China and India as an excuse for doing nothing. But the real problem is how to make China part of the solution.'b'So what does all this tell us about the presidential race?'b'On the Republican side, foreign policy talk is all bluster and braggadocio. To listen to the G.O.P. candidates, you\xe2\x80\x99d think it was still February 2003, when the national discourse was dominated by people who thought that American military might was sufficient to shock and awe the rest of the world into doing our bidding.'b'Memo: China has 50 times the population of Iraq.'b'The Democrats in general make far more sense.

In the past few weeks, I\xe2\x80\x99ve read nine of Angela Thirkell\xe2\x80\x99s Barsetshire novels. I expect to keep going right through all 29 of them, and when I\xe2\x80\x99m done I may start over again. This is a confession of sorts. When I first came upon Thirkell, nearly 30 years ago, she seemed like a diverting minor writer. Minor now seems too slight a word to me for the purveyor of such major pleasures.'b'Thirkell wrote nearly a novel a year between 1933 and her death in 1961, all set in the fictional English county of Barsetshire \xe2\x80\x94 a landscape borrowed from Trollope, who was the prolific author of novels that once seemed more minor than they do now. Unlike Trollope, Thirkell is uninterested in money and politics and ecclesiastical power. Many readers would say she is interested in love, because each of her novels ends with an engagement \xe2\x80\x94 the formal sign that hers is a comic universe. But love is just the device that frames her books, that brings them to a point.'b'One of Thirkell\xe2\x80\x99s characters is Laura Morland, an author of mysteries \xe2\x80\x94 one a year \xe2\x80\x94 set in the fashion world. \xe2\x80\x9cNot but what they are all the same,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Morland explains, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause my publisher says that pays better.\xe2\x80\x9d Thirkell\xe2\x80\x99s novels are all the same, too. If you cut only the scenes that take place during tea, half of Thirkell would be missing. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to say that her countryside becomes more intricate, novel by novel, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. The war darkens it, and so does England\xe2\x80\x99s dire postwar recovery.'b'But her continuing characters continue as they\xe2\x80\x99ve always done. Mrs. Brandon wins the heart of every man she sees. Mrs. Morland is forever losing her tortoise-shell hairpins. A young heroine \xe2\x80\x94 determined and dutiful \xe2\x80\x94 is always falling at last into the arms of a sensible man, who is often her elder by more than a few years.'b'What interests Thirkell is people talking, and the nonsense they talk. It makes no difference who. It might be the chaotic English of a Mixo-Lydian refugee in a novel set during the war or the inane chatter of the beautiful Rose Fairweather, whose favorite adjectives are \xe2\x80\x9cdispiriting\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cshattering,\xe2\x80\x9d though she has never been dispirited or shattered. Or the effusive biographer George Knox who, in a fit of illness in the first of these Barsetshire novels, says to his friend, Mrs. Morland, \xe2\x80\x9cEven Wordsworth was more interesting that I am at this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'These are novels full of what might be called applied literature, whole lifetimes of shared reading welling up allusively in conversation. The reader hears the constant sound of familiar authors passing back and forth behind the scenes, like servants heading from the kitchen to the dining room in great English houses. And yet the talk is wonderful because it is simply neighborhood gossip. The war encroaches on Barsetshire, but the gossip continues, against a broader, grimmer backdrop.'b'Thirkell has often been called nostalgic because she is describing a kind of life \xe2\x80\x94 English county life \xe2\x80\x94 that was vanishing even as her books were appearing. Yet there is nothing nostalgic or sentimental in her tone. She is brusque, judgmental, and also, somehow, tolerant, for without her tolerance these stories would never get off the ground. If she pokes fun at Miss Hampton and Miss Bent, a gay couple living in one of the Barsetshire villages, it is nothing compared to the fun they poke at everyone around them. For every Mr. Bissell \xe2\x80\x94 a schoolmaster fond of the word \xe2\x80\x9cCappitleist\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 there is a Mrs. Bissell, who is the soul of efficient goodness.'b'That is one reason to love Thirkell \xe2\x80\x94 the simple reassurances these books offer.

How do those May-December marriages \xe2\x80\x94 contracted with a single kiss \xe2\x80\x94 work out in the end? Is there really no crime? No outbursts of repressed rage? Is genteel poverty always resolved by a fortunate marriage? In the end, these questions matter no more than the question of Thirkell\xe2\x80\x99s literary stature.

For a long time the trade debate has sounded like generals preparing for the last war. The old free trade-protectionist discussion is just so beside the point. As Mr. Krugman notes, many people can be disadvantaged even by good free trade deals, and it is not protectionist to think about limiting the damage.'b'That same thinking can be extended to other issues. When managed exchange rates, industry and even company-specific tax breaks and cartels distort markets, it is not protectionist to seek remedies. The issue is not whether one supports globalization, but rather what kind of globalization one supports. It is time for a serious discussion of that and not about some imagined return to Smoot-Hawley protectionism.'b'Clyde Prestowitz'b'\nPotomac, Md., Dec. 29, 2007'b''b''b'The writer, president of the Economic Strategy Institute, was counselor to the secretary of commerce in the Reagan administration.'b''b''b' 'b''b'New Delhi'b'WHEN, in May 1991, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India was killed by a suicide bomber, there was an international outpouring of grief. Recent days have seen the same with the death of Benazir Bhutto: another glamorous, Western-educated scion of a great South Asian political dynasty tragically assassinated at an election rally.'b'There is, however, an important difference between the two deaths: while Mr. Gandhi was assassinated by Sri Lankan Hindu extremists because of his policy of confronting them, Ms. Bhutto was apparently the victim of Islamist militant groups that she allowed to flourish under her administrations in the 1980s and 1990s.'b'It was under Ms. Bhutto\xe2\x80\x99s watch that the Pakistani intelligence agency, Inter-Services Intelligence, first installed the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was also at that time that hundreds of young Islamic militants were recruited from the madrassas to do the agency\xe2\x80\x99s dirty work in Indian Kashmir. It seems that, like some terrorist equivalent of Frankenstein\xe2\x80\x99s monster, the extremists turned on both the person and the state that had helped bring them into being.'b'While it is true that the recruitment of jihadists had started before she took office and that Ms. Bhutto was insufficiently strong \xe2\x80\x94 or competent \xe2\x80\x94 to have had full control over either the intelligence services or the Pakistani Army when she was in office, it is equally na\xc3\xafve to believe she had no influence over her country\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy toward its two most important neighbors, India and Afghanistan.'b'Everyone now knows how disastrous the rule of the Taliban turned out to be in Afghanistan, how brutally it subjected women and how it allowed Al Qaeda to train in camps within its territory. But another, and in the long term perhaps equally perilous, legacy of Ms. Bhutto\xe2\x80\x99s tenure is often forgotten: the turning of Kashmir into a jihadist playground.'b'In 1989, when the insurgency in the Indian portion of the disputed region first began, it was largely an amateur affair of young, secular-minded Kashmiri Muslims rising village by village and wielding homemade weapons \xe2\x80\x94 firearms fashioned from the steering shafts of rickshaws and so on. By the early \xe2\x80\x9990s, however, Pakistan was sending over the border thousands of well-trained, heavily armed and ideologically hardened jihadis. Some were the same sorts of exiled Arab radicals who were at the same time forming Al Qaeda in Peshawar, in northwestern Pakistan.'b'By 1993, during Ms. Bhutto\xe2\x80\x99s second term, the Arab and Afghan jihadis (and their Inter-Services Intelligence masters) had really begun to take over the uprising from the locals. It was at this stage that the secular leadership of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front began losing ground to hard-line Islamist outfits like Hizbul Mujahedeen.'b'I asked Benazir Bhutto about her Kashmir policy and the potential dangers of the growing role of religious extremists in the conflict during an interview in 1994. \xe2\x80\x9cIndia tries to gloss over its policy of repression in Kashmir,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cIndia does have might, but has been unable to crush the people of Kashmir. We are not prepared to keep silent, and collude with repression.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Hamid Gul, who was the head of the intelligence agency during her first administration, was more forthcoming still. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Kashmiri people have risen up,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me, \xe2\x80\x9cand it is the national purpose of Pakistan to help liberate them.\xe2\x80\x9d He continued, \xe2\x80\x9cIf the jihadis go out and contain India, tying down their army on their own soil, for a legitimate cause, why should we not support them?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Benazir Bhutto\xe2\x80\x99s death is, of course, a calamity, particularly as she embodied the hopes of so many liberal Pakistanis. But, contrary to the commentary we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the last week, she was not comparable to Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Ms. Bhutto\xe2\x80\x99s governments were widely criticized by Amnesty International and other groups for their use of death squads and terrible record on deaths in police custody, abductions and torture. As for her democratic bona fides, she had no qualms about  banning rallies by opposing political parties while in power.'b'Within her own party, she declared herself the president for life and controlled all decisions. She rejected her brother Murtaza\xe2\x80\x99s bid to  challenge her for its leadership and when he persisted, he was shot dead in highly suspicious circumstances during a police ambush outside the Bhutto family home.'b'Benazir Bhutto was certainly a brave and secular-minded woman. But the obituaries painting her as dying to save democracy distort history. Instead, she was a natural autocrat who did little for human rights, a calculating politician who was complicit in Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s becoming the region\xe2\x80\x99s principal jihadi paymaster while she also ramped up an insurgency in Kashmir that has brought two nuclear powers to the brink of war.'b'King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia did the right thing when he pardoned the \xe2\x80\x9cQatif girl.\xe2\x80\x9d The perfect injustice of the case, in which a young woman was gang raped and then sentenced to 200 lashes for being alone in a car with a man to whom she was not married, left him no choice. Now another ugly face of Saudi justice has been revealed, one that cannot be explained by religion, ancient tradition or culture. The detention last month of an outspoken blogger, Fouad al-Farhan \xe2\x80\x94 only confirmed by the Interior Ministry this week \xe2\x80\x94 is an act of thoroughly modern despotism and one the king should immediately overrule.'b'Mr. Farhan\xe2\x80\x99s Web site, 'b'www.alfarhan.org'b', has posted a letter from him in which he said he was being investigated because of his writings about political prisoners. If King Abdullah is really serious about reforming his kingdom\xe2\x80\x99s legal system, as he has indicated that he is, then he must change not only the Sharia-based courts but also the organs of state security that silence critics in his name.'b'King Abdullah\xe2\x80\x99s announced reforms include the creation of a Supreme Court as well as specialized courts for criminal, commercial, labor and family matters, and the training of legal staff. These plans have been especially welcomed by foreigners doing business in Saudi Arabia, who have been hamstrung by the capriciousness of the religious judges.'b'The case of the woman from the Eastern town of Qatif should make clear to the king that his reforms cannot stop at making life easier for businessmen. They must also make life far better for women, who are denied basic legal and social rights, and they must give more legal protection to those who criticize the government.'b'Defenders of the existing Saudi system argue that change in this traditional society must come slowly. Many Saudis are clearly eager for more and faster change. A Gallup poll conducted last year showed that a majority want more freedoms for women. King Abdullah has demonstrated a laudable desire for reform. He must understand that cruelty, sex discrimination and censorship cannot be part of a modern legal system or a country that wants to participate in the modern world.'b'When President Bush visits Saudi Arabia this month, he should remind the king of that.'b'Juneau, Alaska'b'ABOUT the closest most Americans will ever get to a polar bear are those cute, cuddly animated images that smiled at us while dancing around, pitching soft drinks on TV and movie screens this holiday season.'b'This is unfortunate, because polar bears are magnificent animals, not cartoon characters. They are worthy of our utmost efforts to protect them and their Arctic habitat. But adding polar bears to the nation\xe2\x80\x99s list of endangered species, as some are now proposing, should not be part of those efforts.'b'To help ensure that polar bears are around for centuries to come, Alaska (about a fifth of the world\xe2\x80\x99s 25,000 polar bears roam in and around the state)  has conducted research and worked closely with the federal government to protect them. We have a ban on most hunting \xe2\x80\x94 only Alaska Native subsistence families can hunt polar bears \xe2\x80\x94 and measures to protect denning areas and prevent harassment of the bears. We are also participating in international efforts aimed at preserving polar bear populations worldwide.'b'This month, the secretary of the interior is expected to rule on whether polar bears should be listed under the Endangered Species Act. I strongly believe that adding them to the list is the wrong move at this time. My decision is based on a comprehensive review by state wildlife officials of scientific information from a broad range of climate, ice and polar bear experts.'b'The Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, has argued that 'b'global warming'b' and the reduction of polar ice severely threatens the bears\xe2\x80\x99 habitat and their existence. In fact, there is insufficient evidence that polar bears are in danger of becoming extinct within the foreseeable future \xe2\x80\x94 the trigger for protection under the Endangered Species Act. And there is no evidence that polar bears are being mismanaged through existing international agreements and the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act.'b'The state takes very seriously its job of protecting polar bears and their habitat and is well aware of the problems caused by climate change. But we know our efforts will take more than protecting what we have \xe2\x80\x94 we must also learn what we don\xe2\x80\x99t know. That\xe2\x80\x99s why state biologists are studying the health of polar bear populations and their habitat.'b'As a result of these efforts, polar bears are more numerous now than they were 40 years ago. The polar bear population in the southern Beaufort Sea off Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s North Slope has been relatively stable for 20 years, according to a federal analysis.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re not against protecting plants and animals under the Endangered Species Act. Alaska has supported listings of other species, like the Aleutian Canada goose. The law worked as it should \xe2\x80\x94 under its protection the population of the geese rebounded so much that they were taken off the list of endangered and threatened species in 2001.'b'Listing the goose \xe2\x80\x94 then taking it off \xe2\x80\x94 was based on science. The possible listing of a healthy species like the polar bear would be based on uncertain modeling of possible effects. This is simply not justified.'b'What is justified is worldwide concern over the proven effects of climate change.'b'The Center for Biological Diversity, which petitioned for the polar bear to be protected, wants the listing to force the government to either stop or severely limit any public or private action that produces, or even allows, the production of greenhouse gases. But the Endangered Species Act is not the correct tool to address climate change \xe2\x80\x94 the act itself actually prohibits any consideration of broader issues.'b'Such limits should be adopted through an open process in which environmental issues are weighed against economic and social needs, and where scientists debate and present information that policy makers need to make the best decisions.'b'Americans should become involved in the issue of climate change by offering suggestions for constructive action to their state governments. But listing the polar bear as threatened is the wrong way to get to the right answer.'b'One way to lessen the chance that troubled young people grow up to be full-fledged criminals is to send them to community-based counseling and probation programs instead of to detention centers where they are often traumatized and inducted into a life of crime. The community-based programs are less expensive than detention and more effective when it comes to cutting recidivism. But states and localities are often hampered by policies that provide perverse financial incentives for sending young people to the lockup.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s the case in New York City, which is struggling to remake its juvenile justice system. Detaining one youth for a year costs city taxpayers $200,000 \xe2\x80\x94 many times what it costs to care for troubled children in community-based programs. Unfortunately, the system encourages officials to choose detention for juveniles. The state reimburses the city 50 percent of the cost of pretrial detention, but pays nothing for community-based alternative programs that can make all the difference in getting troubled young people back on track.'b'Another serious problem, according to a recent study by the city\xe2\x80\x99s Independent Budget Office, is that the juvenile courts close at 5 p.m. and aren\xe2\x80\x99t open on weekends. Police officers who arrest young people at those times usually have no option but to send them directly to detention until the courts open. In some cases, the process can take several days. That\xe2\x80\x99s outrageous \xe2\x80\x94 especially since statistics show that once young people do make it to court, two-thirds are defined as low-risk suspects and are released to their parents pending trial. It would never be tolerated in the adult system where the law requires that suspects be swiftly arraigned.'b'Thanks to innovative policies, New York City has begun to reduce the number of low-level young offenders who are sent to state-run detention facilities. Many are now diverted to community-based programs where they can receive mental health and counseling services. That\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing, since more than 80 percent of young men who are sentenced to detention facilities end up arrested again within three years.'b'To the Editor:'b'The victory of Barack Obama in the Democratic caucuses in Iowa is a historic landmark for race relations in this country, particularly since that state is populated predominantly by whites. Is it a bellwether for the Democratic primaries and the 2008 national election?'b'If we look to the vast amount of research on racial prejudice and discrimination in our society and such remedial policies as affirmative action to combat racial and gender disparities, we know that college admissions as well as hiring authorities (almost always white and often male) have a much greater propensity to select or otherwise give preference to a white woman rather than a person of color, male or female. One might have expected the same pattern to hold true in an election. Will voters in other states across the country follow suit and help Mr. Obama defy the odds?'b'Norma M.

The stakes were enormous, but the campaign staff members and volunteers seemed as cool as the candidate.'b'The students, veterans, middle-aged moms, retirees and others working steadily to make Barack Obama president seemed to accept as fact that the country is ready for profound change and that their job is to help make it happen.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been busy knocking on doors, making phone calls, inputting data and basically just spreading hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kathryn Teague, a 19-year-old who has taken a year off from Keene State College to work in the campaign.'b'There is no longer any doubt that the Obama phenomenon is real. Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s message of hope, healing and change, discounted as fanciful and na\xc3\xafve by skeptics, drew Iowans into the frigid night air by the tens of thousands on Thursday to stand with a man who is not just running for president, but trying to build a new type of political movement.'b'By midnight, Joe Biden and Chris Dodd had been chased from the race; John Edwards was all but literally on his knees; and the Clintons were trying, for the umpteenth time, to figure out how to remake themselves as the comeback kids.'b'Shake hands with tomorrow. It\xe2\x80\x99s here.'b'Senator Obama\xe2\x80\x99s victory speech was a concise oratorical gem. No candidate in either party can move an audience like he can. He characterized his stunning victory as an affirmation of \xe2\x80\x9cthe most American of ideas  \xe2\x80\x94  that in the face of impossible odds, people who love this country can change it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Obama has shown, in one appearance after another, a capacity to make people feel good about their country again. His supporters want desperately to turn the page on the bitter politics and serial disasters of the past 20 years. That they have gravitated to a black candidate to carry out this task is \xe2\x80\x94 to use a term I heard for the first time this week \xe2\x80\x94 monumentous.'b'The Clintons, especially, have seemed baffled by the winds of change. They mounted a peculiar argument against Senator Obama, acknowledging that voters wanted change but insisting that you can\xe2\x80\x99t achieve change by doing things differently. Senator Hillary Clinton has had a devil of a time trying to cope with the demand for change while shouldering the legacy of an administration that defined the 1990s.'b'Barack Obama has none of that baggage.'b'But for all the talk of change, it\xe2\x80\x99s just one of the factors driving the Obama phenomenon. The simple truth is that hardly anyone  \xe2\x80\x94  in politics, in the news media or anywhere else  \xe2\x80\x94 realized what an extraordinary candidate Senator Obama would turn out to be.'b'He\xe2\x80\x99s smart, hard-working, charismatic, good-looking and a whiz at fund-raising.'b'He has an incandescent smile, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not frozen in place. He seems authentic. When he laughs, you have the feeling it\xe2\x80\x99s because something is funny.'b'People are lining up to believe in him. He has the easy demeanor (in a long, lanky frame) of someone who\xe2\x80\x99s comfortable with himself. Even when he fires up a crowd, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get too hot. He has the cadences that remind you of King but the cool that reminds you of Kennedy  \xe2\x80\x94  John, not Robert.'b'If the Clintons are going to stop Mr. Obama, they need to do it now. If he wins the New Hampshire primary Tuesday, the news media will go nuts and he will head toward the Jan. 19 caucuses in Nevada and the Jan. 26 primary in South Carolina (where half the voters are African-American) with incredible momentum.'b'I expect that African-Americans, under those circumstance, would view his campaign with almost religious fervor. All those questions about whether he\xe2\x80\x99s black enough would be history. Mr. Obama would be perceived by many as within striking distance of the presidency, and there will be very few blacks in favor of stopping that train.'b'However this election turns out, Mr. Obama can be credited with a great achievement. He has drawn tons of people, and especially young people, into the political process. More than anyone else, he has re-energized that process and put some of the fun back into politics. And he\xe2\x80\x99s done it by appealing openly and consistently to the best, rather than the worst, in us.'b'\xc2\x95'b'Sometimes your fingers dance too quickly over the keyboard. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was killed on April 4, 1968, not April 3, as I wrote earlier this week.'b'A new federal regulation allows employers to reduce or eliminate health benefits for retirees when they turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare. Although that will cause distress for some, it is a welcome step that could help slow the deterioration of employment-based health insurance. It seems likely that the new rule will help far more people than it hurts.'b'The regulation affects a relatively privileged minority of retirees \xe2\x80\x94 those who have company-provided health benefits. For companies that do provide retiree health benefits, there has been great uncertainty over whether they could provide broad coverage for those younger than 65 \xe2\x80\x94 those not eligible for Medicare \xe2\x80\x94 while limiting or denying benefits to older retirees without violating age-discrimination laws.'b'In late December, acting in accord with a favorable appeals court decision, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled that employers could drop coverage of older retirees or offer them plans that would supplement Medicare or comparable state insurance programs while providing better benefits to younger retirees. The age-discrimination issues may still have to be adjudicated by the Supreme Court but as a matter of sound public policy the new regulation makes sense.'b'The new rule is based on a plausible premise: If employers struggling with the rising costs of health care have to provide equal benefits, they will be more likely to eliminate all of their retiree coverage or reduce benefits to the younger retirees than to increase benefits to their Medicare-eligible retirees. Indeed, that has already happened in some public school districts in response to an earlier court decision and commission policy.'b'The new regulation is supported by some labor unions, which want precious health care dollars to go to active workers and younger retirees. It has been denounced as discriminatory by AARP, the main lobby for elderly Americans.'b'The regulation is clearly unfair to people who were willing to accept lower wages while working in return for lifetime health benefits that may now evaporate. Their spouses and dependents could also suffer if they are not eligible for Medicare when the retiree turns 65. Such dependents may well inflate the ranks of the uninsured, making it all the more imperative that the nation move toward universal health coverage.'b'There is no pain-free answer to the burden of rising health care costs. The least painful solution is to let Medicare carry the burden for those 65 and older while freeing employers to focus on younger retirees, who need help the most.'b'It is dangerous to draw too many conclusions from the Iowa caucuses \xe2\x80\x94 a telegenic display of activism by a tiny slice of Americans.'b'Still some powerful political currents were on display in Iowa, starting with a yearning for change and inspirational leadership among Democrats. Senator 'b'Barack Obama'b' positively soaked it up, growing steadily more confident and powerful in his oratory. Senator 'b'Hillary Clinton'b'\xe2\x80\x99s events were more like required-attendance lectures than rallying points for a political movement.'b'Republicans, too, talked about change, but mostly it was changing their association with President Bush. His name was hardly mentioned in Iowa, except by a dozen or so Republicans at a caucus we attended who explained why they had turned out for Mr. Obama.'b'The big question is whether these political currents remain charged as the campaign moves through New Hampshire, and into more populous and complex states.'b'In Iowa, Mr. Obama erased the gender gap, doing better than Mrs. Clinton among men and women, and replaced it with something we\xe2\x80\x99ll call the post-baby boomer effect. On caucus night, there was a very strong showing by men and women under 45, not just the expected 18-to-25-year-olds. Half supported Mr. Obama, a huge show of force in a multiple-candidate race.'b'Half of the Democrats said they picked a candidate based on his or her ability to change things, and they were overwhelmingly Obama people. Yes, there were those who talked about experience or the ability to win, and they preferred Mrs. Clinton, but those Iowans made up only about a quarter of the caucuses.'b''b'Mike Huckabee'b', a former Baptist minister and Arkansas governor, also presents himself as an agent of change, although his ideas sure sound familiar after seven years of Mr. Bush. He claimed his win in Iowa as proof that Republicans, too, want change. The polls showed Republicans picked him because he seemed safe. A vast majority identified themselves as evangelical Christians, and they supported Mr. Huckabee because they wanted someone who shared their values.'b'Even the skilled and affable Mr. Huckabee may have a hard time selling himself as \xe2\x80\x9cjust like us\xe2\x80\x9d in primaries where Republicans do not share his values quite as closely as in Iowa. If the currents Mr. Obama is exploiting are as powerful as they seem, Mr. Huckabee may find himself out of touch with large swathes of America should he win the nomination.'b'Mrs. Clinton is running as the toughest, most electable and most ready to serve Democrat. Those arguments fell flat in Iowa. Appearing on Thursday night with former President Bill Clinton behind one shoulder and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright behind the other felt like d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu \xe2\x80\x94 not what Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s voters were looking for.'b'Mr. Obama has made a huge promise \xe2\x80\x94 that he will change America, pretty much entirely. For those who have yet to register a choice \xe2\x80\x94 including this page and 99 percent of Democratic primary voters \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Obama has to show that he has the specific ideas and the personal ability to make good on that promise.

The uncomfortable truth is that political nepotism has often served feminism\xe2\x80\x99s cause well.'b'In 1924, Miriam A.

Benazir Bhutto, Indira Gandhi and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, among many others, slashed through gender barriers on the strength of their family names.'b'In the United States, where a poll last year found that 14 percent of people still admit they would not vote for a woman, nepotistic advancement for women in politics was most common early in the 20th century. As Jo Freeman, the feminist political scientist, has pointed out, six of the first 14 women elected to Congress were widows of incumbents. Three more were the daughters of politicians.'b'The first three women to serve full Senate terms all succeeded their husbands.

(And Ms. Kassebaum was the daughter of Alf Landon, the former Kansas governor.)'b'To some voters, Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s husband provides reassurance that the \xe2\x80\x9ccalculating\xe2\x80\x9d senator from New York won\xe2\x80\x99t degenerate into a feminine hysteric if she is elected to the White House. Yet Mrs. Clinton, the first woman who is a serious contender for the presidential nomination of one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s two major political parties, still has to work overtime to prove herself non-threatening. She clings to the political center like a life raft and rarely ventures from the shallow waters of establishment predictability.'b'Social psychologists have found that women in leadership roles are typically seen as either  warm, likable and incompetent, or  cold, distant and competent. To be a strong, competent woman is to be something culturally unattractive, which probably says something about why few American women even aspire to political office. Worldwide, even popular female politicians \xe2\x80\x94 Margaret Thatcher, Golda Meir, Angela Merkel \xe2\x80\x94 are slapped with the moniker \xe2\x80\x9ciron lady.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Granted, women who rely on their last names to ascend to power are not especially likely to pursue explicitly feminist policies. They may even be less likely to do so, in order to seem worthy of office.'b'But their chief function to the cause is outside of policy. By their very existence, these women attack the norms and assumptions that bar other women from ascending to power on their own.'b'Women like Lindy Boggs of Louisiana, who lost her husband in a plane crash in 1972 and then assumed his vacant office in the House of Representatives, showed us they could lead as well as their husbands did \xe2\x80\x94 even if they never would have been given the chance otherwise.'b'The best way to convince voters that women leaders are fully human \xe2\x80\x94 likable and competent at times, unlikable and incompetent at others \xe2\x80\x94 is to fill the world with more of them.'b'No mother wants to tell her daughter that she can aspire to the presidency only if she snags the most gifted politician of her generation. But Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s rise to power, unsettling as it is, follows a time-tested pattern for the breaking of gender barriers.'b'The great feminist promise of a Hillary Clinton presidency amounts to this: If we elect a political wife now, perhaps we won\xe2\x80\x99t have to later.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cAs New H.I.V.

Young gay men need real support and education before they have been infected and when they are at greatest risk. Research shows that key resiliency factors for gay youth are family acceptance and school-based interventions, such as gay-straight alliances and anti-bullying initiatives.'b'Sadly, when the New York City Council passed the Dignity for All Students Act ensuring these protections, Mayor Michael R.

President Bush and other democratic leaders cannot, and must keep pressing Tripoli for change.'b'Libya\xe2\x80\x99s return from the cold began in 2003. First, it accepted responsibility for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland \xe2\x80\x94 agreeing to compensate the victims\xe2\x80\x99 families \xe2\x80\x94 and forswore terrorism. Then it gave up its clandestine nuclear program.'b'Last month, Libya\xe2\x80\x99s leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, was feted in Paris. This month, the country that until 2003 was under United Nations Security Council sanctions took over the council\xe2\x80\x99s presidency. This week, its foreign minister made an official visit to Washington. There were no meetings with Mr. Bush or Vice President Dick Cheney. There was a personal tour of the White House, meetings with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and other cabinet members and lunch with representatives of some of America\xe2\x80\x99s biggest companies.'b'Rehabilitating a pariah state is never easy or without distasteful aspects. Re-engagement must be carefully calibrated so long as Libya continues to operate outside international norms by jailing political prisoners, torturing detainees, ignoring the rule of law and refusing to pay settlement claims promised to families of victims of Lockerbie and the 1986 bombing of the La Belle disco in Berlin. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is right to withhold confirmation of the first American ambassador to Tripoli in decades until those claims are resolved. (A charg\xc3\xa9 d\xe2\x80\x99affaires represents Washington\xe2\x80\x99s interests.)'b'According to Human Rights Watch, three Libyan dissidents have disappeared in the last 18 months.

Fathi Eljahmi has been in detention since 2004 when he gave interviews critical of Colonel Qaddafi. One of Ms. Rice\xe2\x80\x99s top aides raised Mr. Eljahmi\xe2\x80\x99s case with the foreign minister on Thursday. Ms. Rice, who discussed human rights generally during her meeting, would have made a stronger point if she had raised all three cases herself.'b'Libya is keen to have Ms. Rice visit this year. Before that happens, she is going to have to press a lot harder for changes in Libya\xe2\x80\x99s behavior, including releasing dissidents and settling the Lockerbie claims.

We all know there\xe2\x80\x99s only the thinnest of lines between Obama and Clinton on these matters  \xe2\x80\x94  a line that would instantly be obliterated by the mangle that is known as the United States Congress. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x9d is about Barack\xe2\x80\x99s promise to sweep away the old, unlovable red-meat politics and create a nonpartisan \xe2\x80\x9ccoalition for change that stretches through red states and blue states.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Which Hillary, veteran of the right-wing-conspiracy wars, regards as a fairy tale.'b'If Clinton wants to be Franklin (and Eleanor) Roosevelt in this campaign, and John Edwards is channeling William Jennings Bryan, Obama is, for all his early opposition to Iraq, the most conservative visionary in the group. Big change is hardly ever accomplished without political warfare. When the red and blue states join together and all Americans of good will march hand-in-hand to a mutually agreed upon destiny, the place they\xe2\x80\x99re going to end up would probably look pretty much like now with more health insurance.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake to read too much into the Iowa caucuses, in which public-spirited citizens gather together to produce utterly unreliable messages. (At the one I went to, Obama got 129 of 228 voters while Bill Richardson got 45. That translated into one delegate each.)'b'In a small state where newcomers on the honor system can register as local voters on the spot, it could be easy to turn a mass of out-of-state college students and volunteers into what looks like an uprising of Iowa Youth. Nevertheless, you can\xe2\x80\x99t ignore the fact that Hillary Clinton is now the candidate of the aging Democratic establishment whose supporters pray for a low turnout on Election Day. That might get her nominated in the long run, but it is not really the kind of image that makes you go whistling into the election booth.'b'Somewhere, Senator Edward Brooke must be chortling. You will remember that in 1969 Brooke, a moderate Republican, had the bad luck to be commencement speaker at Wellesley College on the day Hillary Rodham made a name for herself as a voice of her generation. She politely gave the first black American to be elected to the Senate since Reconstruction the back of her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cFor too long our leaders have used politics as the art of the possible,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. (\xe2\x80\x9c'b'This is bad'b'?\xe2\x80\x9d Brooke must have been thinking.)'b'It was not actually anything in particular that Brooke and his ilk had done that earned Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s lightly disguised contempt. It was just that they were tired and old and always looking for some way to cut a grubby deal instead of setting their sights on the impossible dream. She and her generation, she said, were \xe2\x80\x9csearching for a more immediate, ecstatic and penetrating mode of living.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Nearly 40 years later, here she is, forged into an architect of the possible by every conceivable kind of political and personal disaster. Campaigning in New Hampshire, she\xe2\x80\x99s warning voters that the guy who is promising to turn the whole process into something that people could actually feel good about is peddling \xe2\x80\x9cfalse hopes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Meanwhile Barack Obama gives his folks the ecstatic experience. \xe2\x80\x9cThey said this day would never come. They said our sights were set too high. They said this country was too divided, disillusioned to ever come together around a common purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d he told them Thursday night, creating a patriotic lump in every throat in the room.'b'How could you be 21 and not be for Barack Obama?'b'How could you be 53 and not wonder how this relative stranger will hold up when the disasters arrive, when things get truly nasty and the crowd starts seeing him as mortal?'b'But if she were around right now, Hillary Rodham the commencement speaker would probably be an Obama girl.'b'Seattle'b'IF it\xe2\x80\x99s a question of \xe2\x80\x9cexperience\xe2\x80\x9d versus \xe2\x80\x9cchange,\xe2\x80\x9d change will win every time. Hillary Clinton, of all people, should have known that. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t she remember 1992? That was when her husband made \xe2\x80\x9cchange\xe2\x80\x9d his mantra and chanted it all the way to the White House. This year, Mrs. Clinton tried to suggest that Barack Obama does not have enough experience to be president. He hung her experience around her neck and chanted the change mantra himself.'b'An Obama presidency would, in fact, be a huge change in all sorts of obvious ways. Yet on the Republican side as well, there is talk of change. Of course it is trickier with a sitting Republican president. But that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped one of the candidates from seizing on the word and using it as the centerpiece of his campaign.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not the candidate you would have guessed if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been listening to them: it\xe2\x80\x99s Mitt Romney. Nothing better illustrates the mystical power of \xe2\x80\x9cchange\xe2\x80\x9d in American politics, and its malleability, than its selection by the expensively engineered Romney machine, even though the word doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to apply in any way to the man or his campaign.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say what Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s campaign is really about. He would clearly do or say anything or its opposite to become president. But, in general, he seems to be trying to make himself as conventional a Republican as possible, calling for tax cuts blah blah blah, supporting President Bush 100 percent on Iraq, shedding any aberrant views on abortion or gay rights that he may have picked up by accident in Massachusetts.'b'He radiates conventionality, with his \xe2\x80\x9cLeave-It-to-Beaver\xe2\x80\x9d-and-then-some family and his good looks straight out of \xe2\x80\x9cMad Men,\xe2\x80\x9d the TV series about Madison Avenue in the early 1960s. (I was a few years behind Mr. Romney at a small private high school in Michigan. He graduated in 1965 and looks exactly the same now as he did back then.) If anything, his message ought to be stability: things do not have to change.'b'Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s actual mantra is \xe2\x80\x9cchange in Washington,\xe2\x80\x9d but that is no more helpful in the logic department. He is not campaigning for Congress. Bragging that he will bring \xe2\x80\x9cchange in Washington\xe2\x80\x9d is either a purposeful insult to a sitting president of his own party, or it means nothing at all. Clearly, it means nothing at all.'b'Of the two leading Republicans, it is Mike Huckabee who is the more obvious agent of change, for his party and the country, with his ambitious plans for destroying the economy with a national sales tax and his Democratic-sounding attacks on wealth and privilege. But Mr. Huckabee has let Mr. Romney steal the word from him.'b'The appeal of \xe2\x80\x9cchange\xe2\x80\x9d as a cri de coeur is that it sounds dynamic without committing you to anything in particular. Any slogan shared by Barack Obama and Mitt Romney is going to be pretty meaningless. Not only can voters give it any meaning they wish, it can have different meanings for different voters.'b'Best of all, being the candidate of change in some vague and meaningless way gives you cover to come out for stasis in most of the particulars. Americans say they want change, and think they want it, but there is room for doubt. The candidates of real, serious change, like Dennis Kucinich or Ron Paul, are going to be dropping like petals. And no wonder: they are scary. Change is scary.'b'What are the candidates actually promising? As often as not, it is protection from change. They will not muck around with your Social Security. They will make sure that you don\xe2\x80\x99t lose your health insurance \xe2\x80\x94 and that you will always be able to keep your own doctor. The world is changing fast, but they will protect you from any dire effects. They won\xe2\x80\x99t let the country get flooded with poisonous toys from China or workers from Mexico or (a Mike Huckabee offering) terrorists from Pakistan. A fence, that\xe2\x80\x99s what we need. A fence to cower behind, to keep out change, or at least to slow it down.'b'There is nothing contemptible about a reluctance to change. Most of us have it pretty good in this country, and can\xe2\x80\x99t be blamed for wanting things to stay that way. For that to happen, though, will require some wrenching changes. The list isn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising, or really very long, compared with the list of our blessings. We need to use less energy and borrow less money. We need to fix our schools and reform our health care system. We need to end a stupid war.'b'Is this what people mean when they demand \xe2\x80\x9cchange\xe2\x80\x9d? Are these things what the candidates have in mind when they promise to deliver it? If so, great. But all of these (except, maybe, ending the war) will require some changes that are unpleasant. We as a society have shown no tolerance for unpleasant changes, and politicians have shown no enthusiasm for trying to persuade us that they might be necessary.'b'If all you want is happy changes, you really don\xe2\x80\x99t want change at all.'b'Washington'b'HOW can we begin to understand why Mitt Romney outspent Mike Huckabee on television in Iowa by 6 to 1, yet lost, after watching his rival jump into the lead even before spending a single dollar on ads? How can we explain John Edwards\xe2\x80\x99s second-place finish despite his being outspent at least 3 to 1?'b'The answer is no less profound for being simple \xe2\x80\x94 what people say to one another can be as potent as what TV advertisements try to make them think.'b'While 30-second spots will remain a central means of persuasive communication, we have to recognize the power of individuals to influence one another. Our measurements of what Iowans were hearing from friends and colleagues reveal a critical dynamic that unfolded on caucus night.'b'Iowa was alight with TV advertising, but also alive with personal conversations about the candidates. Two weeks before the caucuses, 94 percent of Democrats and 85 percent of Republicans reported taking part in recent discussions concerning at least one candidate.'b'These conversations are more important than ever before. Public trust in all kinds of communication is eroding, with a notable exception: word of mouth. A Roper poll found the number of people who said they get good ideas and information from television ads declined from 1977 to 2003, while the number who said the same about word of mouth increased by 25 percentage points.'b'Our mid-December survey of Iowa voters found 38 percent saying they trusted information provided by TV ads, while 69 percent trusted \xe2\x80\x9ccomments from friends, relatives and colleagues.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s crucial to understand who is taking part in these conversations. Some participants are more important than others, transforming themselves from mere \xe2\x80\x9ctalkers\xe2\x80\x9d into advocates \xe2\x80\x94 committed supporters who evangelize on behalf of their candidates.'b'Whether by chance or design, such citizen advocates created the explosive growth in support for Mike Huckabee and sustained John Edwards, even as both were vastly outspent by their opponents.'b'Our polling found 23 percent of Republicans were advocates for Mike Huckabee as against 16 percent for Mr. Romney. At 30 percent, Mr. Edwards had the most word-of-mouth advocates among Democrats by a narrow margin, which explains how he was able to remain competitive in Iowa despite his financial disadvantage.'b'Not all word of mouth is good. In fact, it was negative word of mouth that helped knock Hillary Clinton from her front-runner\xe2\x80\x99s spot. Even when she was ahead, we found that two-and-a-half times as many Iowa Democrats were speaking ill of her than of Mr. Edwards. (Barack Obama nestled between the two.)'b'Money alone can\xe2\x80\x99t purchase word of mouth. After all, Mr. Huckabee and Mr. Edwards were outspent by their opponents on political organizing, as well as advertising. But it can work outside Iowa. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take much \xe2\x80\x94 just people willing to talk, and listen, to one another.'b'The day before the coldest day last week \xe2\x80\x94 when the temperature started out at 4 below and rose to 5 above \xe2\x80\x94 I knocked the mailbox off its post with the tractor blade. The mail doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come unless the approach to the mailbox is carefully plowed. So after every storm I sculpture a  drive-through lane, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t see the point of a day without mail. By then the Internet had been out for a couple of days because the satellite dish on the peak of the roof had filled with wet snow. And I crushed a hen\xe2\x80\x99s egg I had thoughtlessly stuffed in the pocket of my hand-me-down chore coat.'b'Otherwise, I was ready for the cold snap. The tanks for the poultry and horses were filled and steaming in the bitter air. The backup generator for the well and furnace was ready to go  if it looked as if the power would be out for more than a few hours. As cold goes, 4 below is  harsh enough to make this feel like a season of attrition and clumsiness, a time of small things breaking that won\xe2\x80\x99t get properly fixed until spring. Going out for dinner means taking  along heavy boots, work  gloves and a shovel, just  in case.'b'It is this just-in-caseness that I find myself noticing. The snow turns blue in the late afternoon, and it is hard to remember how stealthy this beauty is, how violent the cold can be. I find myself double-checking even my oldest habits \xe2\x80\x94 making sure the barn doors are latched and the gates closed, watching my footing, being doubly sure of myself around the horses. Only a little has to go wrong for a lot to go wrong in this weather.'b'At first, a day near zero doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel very different from a day in the teens. The degrees seem to be squeezed together, as if there were less difference between 0 and 15 than between 60 and 75. That\xe2\x80\x99s how it feels until it starts to warm up. The next morning, at 3 degrees, my eyelashes no longer stuck together. And as the day warmed, the sounds that had rung out so clearly in the freeze \xe2\x80\x94 the clinking of the gate chain, the stiff squeal of my boots on the snow \xe2\x80\x94 grew more and more humid. I won\xe2\x80\x99t need a balaclava to fix the mailbox. Only the sun can fix the satellite dish.'b''b'VERLYN KLINKENBORG'b''b'The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has grudgingly released data from a four-year survey of pilots about the safety of American aviation.

If the agency intended to show contempt for the flying public, it succeeded.'b'Between 2000 and 2004, NASA conducted about 29,000 interviews with airline pilots and general-aviation pilots to determine how often they saw risky incidents, like near midair collisions or runway incursions. It was a pioneering effort to determine if reaching out to pilots instead of waiting for them to report incidents might yield  insights into emerging problems.'b'Unfortunately, NASA, struggling under a heavy burden of space projects with a limited budget, seems to have lost interest in the aviation study even before any useful conclusions could be drawn about the value of the methodology or the safety significance of  early  findings. The survey was terminated before it could be extended to air-traffic controllers, flight attendants and mechanics. And NASA at first refused to release any of the data until pressured to do so by Congress.'b'Now the agency has reluctantly disgorged partial results that were heavily redacted to protect the identities of pilots. There are tantalizing hints of problems \xe2\x80\x94 complaints about fatigue, pilots asleep on the flight deck and difficulties  communicating with air-traffic controllers \xe2\x80\x94 but no indication of how often they occur or whether they are getting worse.'b'NASA has no intention of analyzing the data but does plan to ask the National Academy of Sciences to assess the validity of the methodology. That is not enough. The academy should also assess whether there are any clues in the data that could shed light on air safety. Congress should insist that NASA release the data in a form that can be analyzed by other independent experts. With air corridors growing  more congested, it would be nice to know if the surveys \xe2\x80\x94 paid through  taxpayer dollars \xe2\x80\x94 turned up anything air travelers need to worry about.'b'CONCORD, N.H.'b'The Hillary forces at the Plymouth Church caucus in Des Moines weren\xe2\x80\x99t averse to bribes.'b'They were passing out See\xe2\x80\x99s chocolates to Richardson supporters.'b'And they weren\xe2\x80\x99t averse to threats. \xe2\x80\x9cMy wife told me I\xe2\x80\x99d have to join them or I\xe2\x80\x99d be sleeping on the couch tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ed Truslow, a compact 68-year-old manufacturing representative.

In the 1960s, the bright young nationalists who took over the country when we got independence from the British believed that their first job was to eradicate \xe2\x80\x9ctribalism.\xe2\x80\x9d What they really meant, in a way, was that they wanted to eradicate the nations that made up Kenya. It was assumed that the process would end with the birth of a brand-new being: the Kenyan.'b'Compared with  other African nations, Kenya has had significant success with this experiment. But it has not been without its contradictions, though they had never really turned lethal until now.'b'Our Kenyan identity, so deliberately formed in the test tube of nationalist effort, has over the years been undermined, subtly and not so subtly, by our leaders \xe2\x80\x94 men who appealed to our histories and loyalties to win our votes.'b'You see, the burning houses and the bloody attacks here do not reflect primordial hatreds. They reflect the manipulation of identity for political gain.'b'So what was different about this election? What brought Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s equilibrium to an end?'b'Five years ago, we voted for a broad and nationally representative government. Inside this vehicle were the country\xe2\x80\x99s major tribes: the Luo, the Luhya, the Kikuyu, many Kalenjin \xe2\x80\x94 all the people now  killing one another.'b'We wanted this arrangement to quickly introduce a new and more inclusive Constitution, deal firmly with corruption and start a process of defining the nation in terms that include everybody.'b'Tragically, President Mwai Kibaki instead steered a course away from the coalition and cultivated the support of his Kikuyu community. He did a good job rebuilding the civil service and managing the economy, but he did it within a framework that was not sustainable.'b'When it came time to conduct our most recent election, Raila Odinga had built a movement on the back of President Kibaki\xe2\x80\x99s betrayal of the spirit of 2002. His political party, the Orange Democratic Movement, was the big ethnic tent similar to the one that had first brought President Kibaki to office.'b'On the day we cast our vote, we thought that our optimism and desire for an inclusive and broad government would prevail. Instead, three days later \xe2\x80\x94 after  reports that votes were being \xe2\x80\x9ccooked\xe2\x80\x9d in Kikuyu strongholds, after skirmishes in the room where the results were being announced, after the news media were ejected \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Kibaki was announced the winner and a haphazard swearing-in took place. And Kenya exploded.'b'Mr. Odinga and President Kibaki are not really ethnic leaders, but in the days since the disputed election they have stoked tribal paranoia and used it to cement electoral loyalty.'b'Mr. Odinga and his fellow party leaders are now determined to  avenge the wrong they believe they have suffered. Sadly, this leadership now appears to believe that the violence spreading across the country might be a valuable bargaining chip.'b'My further suspicion is that Mr. Odinga wants to sell to Kenyans and the world a sort of Ukrainian \xe2\x80\x9cpeople\xe2\x80\x99s revolution\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 where protesters  take to the streets and change the order of things, and are seen to be throwing happy pink petals on television, so America can say, ah, the people have spoken.'b'But rather than matters leading to a popular but peaceful uprising against a flawed election, we are likelier to suffer an escalation of retaliations and a descent to that special machete place that nations rarely recover from.'b'Yet all is not lost. Nations are built on crises like this. If there is such a thing as Kenya, it should be gathering energy right now. Two leaders can sit down, form a power-sharing agreement and put together a system to handle elections and transition. A Constitution that names and recognizes the tribal nations within our nation, that decentralizes some power and that includes us all in the process is possible.'b'For 40 years we have been dancing around each other, a gaseous nation circling and tightening. The moment is now to make a solid thing called Kenya.'b'As one economic pillar after another began to buckle in 2007 \xe2\x80\x94 lending, home sales and house prices, factory orders, holiday shopping \xe2\x80\x94 economists kept saying that recession was avoidable as long as employment held up. A job means a paycheck, a paycheck means spending, and spending means hope for the economy.'b'On Friday, the Labor Department reported that employment in December had buckled as well. Over all, a meager 18,000 jobs were created. Even worse, hiring in the private sector contracted by 13,000 jobs, a harbinger of recession. The figures are subject to change, but job growth has been slowing since June, making a big upward correction unlikely. The unemployment rate, which is not subject to revision,  also jumped in December, rising to 5 percent. As recently as last March, unemployment was only 4.4 percent. Such a big swing in such a short time also suggests a recession.'b'If the unemployment rate continues to rise in the next month or two, Congress and the administration will  have to step in to try to spur the economy. The best hope of doing that is with stimulus measures to increase spending and, in the process, lessen the impending economic harm to the most vulnerable families.'b'Unfortunately, there is no sign that President Bush \xe2\x80\x94 for whom tax cuts are always the answer no matter the question \xe2\x80\x94 realizes what is needed. After meeting with his economic advisers on Friday, just hours after the release of the jobs report, he insisted that the best economic move now is for Congress to work with him to \xe2\x80\x9cmake sure taxes remain low.\xe2\x80\x9d A day earlier, one of his  aides told reporters that among  the president\xe2\x80\x99s economic priorities  this year would be a push to  make  his signature tax cuts, which are scheduled to expire at the end of 2010, a permanent part of the tax code.'b'That is not new, and it is  wrongheaded. The promise of tax relief in 2011 would not increase spending in 2008. And economic stimulus is, by definition, temporary, intended to counter poor economic conditions. Permanent tax cuts could actually hurt the economy by worsening the outlook for the budget deficit for years to come.'b'Congress should not take its cues from the White House. Instead, lawmakers must come up with a stimulus package that addresses the country\xe2\x80\x99s clear and present threat of recession. To be effective, stimulus must be targeted at low- and middle-income Americans. As a group, they will spend most, if not all,  the assistance they receive, giving the economy an immediate lift.'b'Economic research is compelling that the most stimulative measures in a downturn are enhanced unemployment benefits and direct aid to states \xe2\x80\x94 which can be  tailored by the states to best fit   residents\xe2\x80\x99 needs. A one-shot tax rebate can be effective if it is targeted to people who will spend the largess. That argues against tax cuts for investment income \xe2\x80\x94 a centerpiece of the Bush tax cuts \xe2\x80\x94 because those are skewed to high-income Americans who tend to save rather than spend their extra dollars.'b'House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has already appointed a team of lawmakers to devise a stimulus plan that could be adopted quickly if conditions worsen. The toughest part of their task will be getting the White House to finally recognize that  more tax cuts is not what the country needs  and will not head off a recession.'b'To the Editor:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cRenters Report Being Stymied by Cost and Supply\xe2\x80\x9d (Long Island and the Region, Dec. 30) is on target regarding Long Island\xe2\x80\x99s shortage of rental housing.'b'I should mention another form of rental housing that more and more Long Islanders are using.

The Benazir Bhutto assassination was'b' judged as a boon'b' for Mrs. Clinton because it would knock the silly voters to their senses by reminding them it was  no time to roll the dice with foreign-policy novices. Oprah Winfrey\xe2\x80\x99s Obama rallies were largely 'b'viewed'b' as a routine celebrity endorsement, while Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s address on \xe2\x80\x9cFaith in America\xe2\x80\x9d was 'b'judged'b' as momentous as \xe2\x80\x9cMission Accomplished.\xe2\x80\x9d Only a week ago, Mr. Huckabee was 'b'literally laughed at'b' by reporters for his \xe2\x80\x9cHoward Dean meltdown\xe2\x80\x9d at a press conference where he contradictorily exhibited and then disowned an attack ad on Mr. Romney.'b'The 'b'final Des Moines Register poll'b' \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Huckabee up by six points and Mr. Obama by seven \xe2\x80\x94 was greeted with near-universal skepticism.

All those collegiate Obama enthusiasts, like the Dean brigades of the last Iowa political insurgency, were just 'b'too flighty'b' to actually bother to caucus.'b'What was  mostly forgotten in these errant narratives were the two largest elephants in the room: Iraq and George W. Bush. The conventional wisdom had it that both a tamped-down war and a lame-duck president were exiting  so quickly from center stage that they were receding from the minds of voters. In truth, they were only receding from the minds of those covering those voters.'b'The continued political import of Iraq could be found in three different polls in the past six weeks \xe2\x80\x94 'b'Pew'b', 'b'ABC News-Washington Post'b' and 'b'Wall Street Journal-NBC News'b'. They all showed the same phenomenon: the percentage of Americans who believe that the war is going well has risen strikingly in tandem with the diminution of violence \xe2\x80\x94 from 30 percent in February to 48 percent in November, for instance, in the Pew survey. Even so, these same polls show no change at all in the public\xe2\x80\x99s verdict on this misadventure or in President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s dismal overall approval rating. By the same margins as before (sometimes even slightly larger), a majority of Americans favor withdrawal no matter what happened during the \xe2\x80\x9csurge.\xe2\x80\x9d In another poll ('b'Gallup'b'), a majority still call the war a mistake, a finding that has varied little since February 2006.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s safe to assume that these same voters did not forget that Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Edwards enabled the Iraq fiasco. Or that Mr. Obama publicly opposed it. When Mrs. Clinton 'b'attacked'b' Mr. Obama for his supposedly \xe2\x80\x9cirresponsible and frankly na\xc3\xafve\xe2\x80\x9d foreign policy ideas \xe2\x80\x94 seeking talks with enemies like Iran \xe2\x80\x94 she didn\xe2\x80\x99t diminish him so much as remind voters of her own irresponsibility and na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9 about Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s Iraq scam in 2002.'b'In the Republican field, no candidate has less association with Iraq than Mr. Huckabee, a politically lucky and unintended consequence of his spectacular ignorance about foreign policy in general. When he finally did speak up in a newly published 'b'essay in  Foreign Affairs'b', he condemned the Bush administration for its \xe2\x80\x9carrogant bunker mentality\xe2\x80\x9d in its execution of the war. Mr. Romney, sensing an opening among the party faithful, loudly 'b'demanded'b' that Mr. Huckabee \xe2\x80\x9capologize to the president\xe2\x80\x9d for this insult. But Mr. Huckabee had the political savvy not to retreat, and in Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s final hours even  Mr. Romney desperately 'b'reversed himself'b' to 'b'slam'b' Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s mismanagement of Iraq.'b'Among the Republican candidates, Mr. Huckabee is also as culturally un-Bush as you can get. He constantly reminds voters that he did not go to an Ivy League school and that his plain values derived from a bona fide blue-collar upbringing, as opposed to, say, clearing brush on a vacation \xe2\x80\x9cranch\xe2\x80\x9d bought with oil money attained with family connections. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople are looking for a presidential candidate who reminds them more of the guy they work with rather than the guy that laid them off,\xe2\x80\x9d he 'b'told'b' Mr. Leno, in a nifty reminder of Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s corporate history as a Bush-style, Harvard-minted M.B.A.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s such populist Huckabee sentiments that are already driving the Republican empire to strike back. The party that has milked religious conservatives for votes for two decades is traumatized by the prospect that one of that ilk might actually become its standard-bearer. Especially if the candidate in question is a preacher who bashes Wall Street and hedge-fund managers and threatens to take a Christian attitude toward those too poor to benefit from the Bush tax cuts.'b'No wonder the long list of party mandarins eager to take down Mr. Huckabee includes Rush Limbaugh, Robert Novak, the Wall Street Journal editorial page and National Review. Dan Bartlett, the former close Bush adviser, has 'b'snickered'b' at Mr. Huckabee\xe2\x80\x99s presumably low-rent last name. Fred Barnes was reduced to incoherent babbling when a noticeably gloomy Fox News announced Mr. Huckabee\xe2\x80\x99s victory Thursday night.'b'But if, as the new narrative has it, Mr. McCain will ride to the party\xe2\x80\x99s rescue, the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 relief may be short-lived. He is their most experienced and principled horse, but he\xe2\x80\x99s also the oldest and the most encumbered by Bush and Iraq baggage. The NBC News analyst Chuck Todd may be on to something when he half-jokingly suggested last week that there was  a 5 percent chance that the G.O.P. may have to find a nominee not yet in the race.'b'Mr. Obama is in a far better position in his more-or-less ideologically united party than Mr. Huckabee is among Republicans, but, of course, he could lose for a myriad of reasons. Mr. Obama could make some world-class mistakes; the Clinton machine could land some attacks more devastating than  its withering critique of his kindergarten paper.'b'But if Clinton operatives know how to go negative, they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the positive balance of a 21st-century message. Iowa confirmed that the message the campaign has used to date \xe2\x80\x94 experience \xe2\x80\x94 is D.O.A. in post-Bush America.

But, as Michael Reid observes in his new book, \xe2\x80\x9cForgotten Continent,\xe2\x80\x9d durable mass democracies have emerged across the region.'b'In recent years, these democracies have rolled the dice with an extraordinary variety of leaders, including Michelle Bachelet in Chile; Luiz In\xc3\xa1cio Lula da Silva, the metalworker who rose to govern Brazil; and Venezuela\xe2\x80\x99s barracks-bred Hugo Ch\xc3\xa1vez.'b'The results have been uneven. Ch\xc3\xa1vez has tested everyone\xe2\x80\x99s patience with oil-fueled bluster about winged Socialist revolution. But step by prosaic step, the continent has moved toward open societies and the global economy.'b'This progress has come despite gross income disparities, which have made cities like S\xc3\xa3o Paulo labyrinths of riches and ruin. Lula\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely rise reflected the hope that these social chasms could be bridged, just as the early success of Barack Obama and Mike Huckabee reflects a society hungry for change and tired of hedge-fund titans skirting the taxes ordinary folks pay.'b'As they journey on foot, nations also dream. Democracies are inventive and averse to entitlement. Their imperfections are manifold, but so are their self-renewing mechanisms. They demand hope. The dynamic, over time, trumps the dynastic.'b'The Brazilian journey has often faltered, giving rise to the nostrum that this was a country with a great future condemned to its eternal contemplation. Annual murder figures in the tens of thousands testify to enduring social problems. Tom Jobim, who composed \xe2\x80\x9cThe Girl From Ipanema,\xe2\x80\x9d noted that Brazil is not for beginners.'b'Still, as Lula has intuited with his astute pragmatism \xe2\x80\x94 is anyone else a friend of both Ch\xc3\xa1vez and President Bush? \xe2\x80\x94 the tide is flowing this country\xe2\x80\x99s way. Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s future is now. There are five reasons: land, raw materials, energy, the environment and China.'b'Vastness defines Brazil; the agricultural use of its territory is nowhere near exhaustion. Already the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest exporter of coffee, beef, sugar and orange juice, it is fast increasing exports of other foodstuffs, including chicken ($4.2 billion worth in 2007, up from $2.9 billion in 2006) and soya. More than 220 million acres \xe2\x80\x94 an area greater than that currently under cultivation \xe2\x80\x94 remain unexploited outside rain forests.'b'Another fast-rising export is iron ore. China, which is investing heavily here, wants all it can get, just as it wants food (as does India) and energy. Brazil has an abundance of the latter, and could have much more.'b'Set aside for a moment Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s vast hydroelectric resources and its recent discovery of a huge deepwater oil field off the southeastern coast.'b'What will count over the long term is its world leadership in plant-based fuels, particularly ethanol from sugar cane, which produces eight times as much energy per hectare as the corn from which most U.S. ethanol is made. Combine that with near limitless farmland, and Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s important future-to-present shift comes into focus.'b'As Reid writes, \xe2\x80\x9cIf China was becoming the world\xe2\x80\x99s workshop and India its back office, Brazil is its farm \xe2\x80\x94 and potentially its center of environmental services.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The country\xe2\x80\x99s leadership in nonfossil fuels and the unparalleled biodiversity of its Amazon rain forest make it a natural leader in the 21st-century struggle with global warming.'b'None of the above would be significant if Brazil were unstable. But like most of the continent, it has become more predictable. China has realized this and is rapidly developing its commercial relations with Brazil and other Latin American countries. The United States has also pursued a range of free-trade agreements, with uneven results.'b'Over all, however, the continent has been left with a sense of U.S. neglect, sharpened by Bush\xe2\x80\x99s unfulfilled pre-9/11 promise of a new focus that would reflect the presence of more than 40 million Latinos in the U.S. The next president should make looking south a priority, with Brazil as pivot for intensified engagement.'b'Latin America\xe2\x80\x99s transformation in recent decades has been underestimated. It has been political and economic but also cultural. Deep prejudices against indigenous, mestizo and mulatto populations have been confronted and, if not defeated, undermined. In historical terms, this has been a time of empowerment for the dark-skinned.'b'The Americas are changing and, despite the anti-Yanqui rhetoric of Ch\xc3\xa1vez, becoming \xe2\x80\x94 step by step \xe2\x80\x94 more one.'b'Blog: 'b'www.iht.com/passages'b'.'b'California has now sued the Bush administration over its refusal to allow the state to set its own rules controlling greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks. The state\xe2\x80\x99s legal arguments are sound and so is its policy, especially when one considers the White House\xe2\x80\x99s seven-year failure to seriously confront  the problem of global warming.'b'The Clean Air Act of 1970 allows California to set  stronger air pollution standards as long as it gets a  waiver  from the federal government. California has applied for many such waivers over the years and has never been denied. One result is that the state has been a leader    in the effort to reduce pollutants like those  responsible for smog and acid rain.'b'In 2005, California sought permission to regulate vehicle emissions of carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas. For two years, the Bush administration hid behind the claim that carbon dioxide was not a pollutant covered by the Clean Air Act. The Supreme Court demolished that argument last year. The administration still denied California\xe2\x80\x99s request on equally spurious grounds.'b'It argued that a national standard would be preferable to a \xe2\x80\x9cpatchwork\xe2\x80\x9d of state rules. However, the Clean Air Act allows only two sets of rules,  federal rules and California\xe2\x80\x99s more stringent rules. Other states can then choose which to adopt. Sixteen states, which with California make up half  the vehicle market, have said they will adopt California\xe2\x80\x99s rules. This is hardly a patchwork.'b'The administration also argued that tougher fuel efficiency standards in the  energy bill recently signed into law by President Bush would yield greater greenhouse gas reductions than the California rules would. This is demonstrably untrue. California\xe2\x80\x99s regulations would reduce emissions from new vehicles by nearly 30 percent by 2016 \xe2\x80\x94 double the estimated reductions that would result from the energy law.'b'Finally, the government argued that because global warming affects all states, California cannot demonstrate the \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling and extraordinary\xe2\x80\x9d conditions necessary to merit a waiver. In earlier waiver cases, administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency have ruled that California must  show only that it  faces unusually severe problems, not that it is unique.'b'We would prefer that the White House reverse its position and order the E.P.A. to give California its waiver. If it does not, the courts must compel it to do so.'b'To the Editor:'b'It was gratifying to read your endorsement of the Polish government\xe2\x80\x99s skepticism about the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to station in Poland part of its European-based missile-defense system (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Poles Get Cold Feet,\xe2\x80\x9d editorial, Dec. 30).'b'In the Czech Republic, the proposal is in trouble: polls show a clear majority against the Czech component of the system. Washington claims the system responds to an Iranian nuclear threat, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no credible evidence of such a threat today.'b'And far from protecting against such a threat in the future, the United States militaristic stance, with its proclaimed right to wage preventive war and more than 700 military bases worldwide, only enhances its likelihood.'b'Nuclear powers can reduce the danger of nuclear warfare by taking major steps toward disarmament, globally and in the Middle East \xe2\x80\x94 not by expanding the nuclear threat.'b'Such steps would stop reinforcing the notion that nuclear weapons are legitimate currency in relations among nations; they would create a political climate discouraging new countries from developing nuclear weapons.'b'Joanne Landy'b'\nNew York, Dec. 31, 2007'b''b''b'The writer is co-director of the Campaign for Peace and Democracy. 'b''b'The Supreme Court hears arguments on Monday in a case about whether Kentucky\xe2\x80\x99s use of a \xe2\x80\x9ccocktail\xe2\x80\x9d of injected poisons to carry out the death penalty is unconstitutional. We believe that the death penalty, no matter how it is administered, is unconstitutional and wrong. If a state does execute anyone, it must do so in a way that is humane and does not impose needless suffering. Kentucky\xe2\x80\x99s method does not meet that standard.'b'Popular support for capital punishment is, thankfully, declining in this country. The growing number of exonerations of innocent people on death row has shown that the system cannot be trusted to make such an irrevocable decision. There is considerable evidence of racial discrimination in the application of the death penalty. After years of botched electrocutions and other horrors, it is clear that the methods of taking life are barbaric.'b'In Kentucky, and nearly all of the states that have capital punishment, executions are carried out by injection of a three-drug \xe2\x80\x9ccocktail.\xe2\x80\x9d This is supposedly more humane than the electric chair. The more one learns about lethal injection, the less humane it appears.'b'There is considerable evidence that inmates do not go peacefully or easily. Instead they are reported to feel suffocation, paralysis and excruciating pain. This is particularly true when poorly trained, unskilled workers are administering the drugs, which is all too often the case.'b'The Supreme Court could decide to focus on the narrow question about what legal standard to apply in lethal injection cases. The two sides disagree on just how substantial a risk there must be of the inmate\xe2\x80\x99s feeling severe pain for the procedure to be unconstitutional. It is, of course, important to get the standard right. But the court needs to look beyond that and rule that Kentucky\xe2\x80\x99s method of lethal injection violates the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.'b'The record in the case shows that Kentucky does not have adequate safeguards in place \xe2\x80\x94 both for procedures and personnel \xe2\x80\x94 to ensure that inmates do not suffer needlessly. Execution team members are not sufficiently trained in performing executions, and they do not adequately monitor inmates during executions to make sure  that they are not feeling pain. The lawyers for the inmates in the case have shown that Kentucky could revise its procedures in ways that substantially reduce the danger of causing pain and suffering. There is a one-drug alternative that would make it easier to detect when an inmate is in pain. There is no excuse for the state\xe2\x80\x99s employing anything but the most humane form of lethal injection.'b'In 2007, executions in this country dropped to a 13-year low, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. We believe that use of the death penalty will continue to decline, and we hope that it will eventually be banned completely. Until that time, however, the Supreme Court has a duty to ensure that it is not administered in a cruel way. Kentucky\xe2\x80\x99s ill-conceived and haphazard administration of lethal injection does not meet that constitutional requirement.'b'MANCHESTER, N.H.'b'Thank you, Senator  Obama. You\xe2\x80\x99ve defeated Senator Clinton in Iowa. It looks as if you\xe2\x80\x99re about to beat her in New Hampshire. There will be no Clinton Restoration. A nation turns its grateful eyes to you.'b'But gratitude for sparing us a third Clinton term only goes so far. Who, inquiring minds want to know, is going to spare us a first Obama term? After all, for all his ability and charm, Barack Obama is still a liberal Democrat. Some of us would much prefer a non-liberal and non-Democratic administration. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to increase the scope of the nanny state, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to undo the good done by the appointments of John Roberts and Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court, and we really don\xe2\x80\x99t want to snatch defeat out of the jaws of victory in Iraq.'b'For me, therefore, the most interesting moment in Saturday night\xe2\x80\x99s Republican debate at St. Anselm College was when the candidates were asked what arguments they would make if they found themselves running against Obama in the general election.'b'The best answer came, not surprisingly, from the best Republican campaigner so far \xe2\x80\x94 Mike Huckabee. He began by calmly mentioning his and Obama\xe2\x80\x99s contrasting views on issues  from guns to life to same-sex marriage. This served to remind Republicans that these contrasts have been central to G.O.P. success over the last quarter-century, and to suggest that Huckabee could credibly and comfortably make the socially conservative case in an electorally advantageous way.'b'Huckabee went on to pay tribute to Obama for his ability  \xe2\x80\x9cto touch at the core of something Americans want\xe2\x80\x9d in seeming to move beyond partisanship. And, he added, Senator Obama is \xe2\x80\x9ca likable person who has excited people about wanting to vote who have not voted in the past.\xe2\x80\x9d Huckabee was of course aware that in praising Obama he was recommending himself'b'I was watching the debate at the home of a savvy, moderately conservative New Hampshire Republican. It was at this moment that he turned to me and said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a huge skeptic about Huckabee. I\xe2\x80\x99m still not voting for him Tuesday. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to say \xe2\x80\x94 I like him. And I wonder \xe2\x80\x94 could he be our strongest nominee?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He could be. After the last two elections, featuring the well-born George Bush and Al Gore and John Kerry, Americans \xe2\x80\x94 even Republicans! \xe2\x80\x94 are ready for a likable regular guy. Huckabee seems to be that. He came up from modest origins. He served as governor of Arkansas for more than a decade. He fought a successful battle against being overweight. These may not be utterly compelling qualifications for the presidency. I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not ready to sign up.'b'Still,  as the conservative writer Michael Medved put it, \xe2\x80\x9cFor the work-hard-to-get-ahead strivers who represent the heart and soul of the G.O.P., there are obvious, powerful points of identification.\xe2\x80\x9d And they speak to younger voters who are not yet committed to the G.O.P. In Iowa, Huckabee did something like what Obama did on the Democratic side, albeit on a smaller scale. He drew new voters to the caucuses. And he defeated Mitt Romney by almost two to one, and John McCain by better than four  to one, among voters under 45.'b'Now it\xe2\x80\x99s true that many conservatives have serious doubts about Huckabee\xe2\x80\x99s positions, especially on foreign policy,  and his record, particularly on taxes.  The conservative  establishment is strikingly hostile to Huckabee \xe2\x80\x94 for both good and bad reasons. But voters seem to be enjoying making up their own minds this year. And Huckabee is a talented politician.'b'His campaigning in New Hampshire has been impressive. At a Friday night event at New England College in Henniker, he played bass with a local rock band, Mama Kicks. One secular New Hampshire Republican\xe2\x80\x99s reaction: \xe2\x80\x9cGee, he\xe2\x80\x99s not some kind of crazy Christian. He\xe2\x80\x99s an ordinary American.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In general, here in New Hampshire he\xe2\x80\x99s emphasized social issues far less than in Iowa (though he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t waffle when asked about them). Instead he\xe2\x80\x99s stressed conservative economic themes, seamlessly (if somewhat inconsistently) weaving together a pitch for limited government with a message that government needs to do more to address the concerns of the struggling middle class. This latter point seems to be resonating, as headlines in local papers announce an increase in the national unemployment rate amid speculation about a coming recession.'b'Some Democrats are licking their chops at the prospect of a Huckabee nomination. They shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be. For one thing, Michael Bloomberg would be tempted to run in the event of an Obama-Huckabee race \xe2\x80\x94 and he would most likely take votes primarily from Obama. But whatever Bloomberg does, the fact is that the Republican establishment spent 2007 underestimating Mike Huckabee. If Huckabee does win the nomination, it would be amusing if Democrats made the same mistake in 2008.'b'Washington'b'KENYA descended into chaos last week after accusations of vote rigging. The specter of further unrest haunts Pakistan after elections were postponed in the wake of Benazir Bhutto\xe2\x80\x99s assasination.  And two years ago Haitians clashed with the police in Port-au-Prince after a botched vote count enraged supporters of the leading presidential candidate.'b'Incidents like these reveal an abject lack of trust in the local election commissions that oversee voting. If cheating happens, as it surely has in Kenya, it is with the complicity or at least docility of these commissions.'b'Having led the United States-financed election observation mission in Haiti in 2006, and helped organize or observe elections in a half-dozen other countries, I know that the international community\xe2\x80\x99s typical election assistance (technical aid and outside observation) does not prevent post-election violence.'b'Our hands-off strategy is usually grounded in a fear of taking away local ownership of elections, an especially delicate issue in countries with colonial legacies. But even dedicated, honest election officials can find themselves overwhelmed by limited capacity, outside pressures and political infighting.'b'The solution is a United Nations monitoring unit devoted not to elections, but to the work of election commissions. The unit would set and examine standards in the four areas that usually produce turmoil: transparency, inclusiveness, electoral procedures (including the all-important issue of vote count) and openness to technical assistance and observation. Commissions that instituted and maintained these standards would receive United Nations certification; the failure of commissions to be certified, or the loss of certification, would be an early warning signal well in advance of a potentially explosive election.'b'Countries with solid records on elections administration could apply for permanent certification and, barring credible accusations from opposition parties or observers, would be subject only to periodic review. International election-day monitoring would continue, of course, as a complementary, additional check.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s important that this election commission unit remain independent from the current United Nations Electoral Assistance Division, which provides its own advice to electoral authorities. Answering directly to a senior United Nations official would allow the unit to provide candid assessments, even in situations where the United Nations itself is helping organize elections.'b'There will never be a way to guarantee free, fair and nonviolent elections, particularly in countries where collective grievances are strong and institutional accountability weak. But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough for observers, most of whom arrive shortly before polls open, to watch as elections are rigged or poorly administered and then cry foul as violence spins out of control.'b'Only by ensuring that election commissions meet minimum standards and are subject to continued, rigorous United Nations scrutiny will we inject badly needed legitimacy and stability into the election process.'b'Forty-seven United States senators recently wrote to the secretary of the interior, Dirk Kempthorne, asking him to lift the ban on carrying ready-to-fire weapons in national parks and wildlife refuges. Under current law, guns carried into or through a national park or refuge must be unloaded, taken apart, or cased in a way \xe2\x80\x9cthat will prevent their ready use.\xe2\x80\x9d According to the senators\xe2\x80\x99 letter, this rule infringes on gun owners\xe2\x80\x99  rights and is \xe2\x80\x9cconfusing, burdensome and unnecessary.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There is nothing confusing about the distinction between federal lands where hunting is allowed and national parks, where hunting is not. (Nor should someone who is confused by the difference be carrying a loaded weapon.) It is also no burden to unload a rifle and slip it into a case before, say, driving through Yellowstone.'b'The old adage used to be that there were plenty of gun laws, they just had to be enforced. These days, most gun laws are under unrelenting attack, thanks to the National Rifle Association\xe2\x80\x99s unbridled influence in Congress and the state legislatures.'b'The senators who signed this letter \xe2\x80\x94 led by  Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, and Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat  \xe2\x80\x94 insist that the federal government is infringing upon the gun-carrying rights granted by some states. As so often happens when guns are in question, the senators have forgotten to insist upon the rights of the vast majority of citizens, who choose not to carry guns.'b'They also appear to have forgotten that national parks and refuges are federal lands, set aside as peaceful preserves for all the species that enjoy them, including humans. Ready-to-fire guns have no place in them.'b'To the Editor:'b'If one needed any doubt that 1984 has truly arrived, \xe2\x80\x9cParis Isn\xe2\x80\x99t Burning,\xe2\x80\x9d by Corinne Maier (Op-Ed, Dec. 30), provides the proof positive.

So far, it\xe2\x80\x99s not looking so good for the Republicans.'b'On Saturday night, ABC News held back-to-back debates among the candidates for each party\xe2\x80\x99s nomination. The contrasts were vivid.'b'The six Republicans, who came first, were a study in grays, hunched over their desks like the officers of some restricted men\xe2\x80\x99s lodge. The only signs of life came when they all poured disdain on Mitt Romney \xe2\x80\x94 Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s big spender and big loser \xe2\x80\x94 or Ron Paul, who is so far behind in the polls we wondered why they bothered.'b'Then came the four Democrats: the woman, the African-American, the Hispanic American, the coiffed Southern lawyer. They seemed younger, livelier and clearly to be living in 21st-century America.'b'The Republicans sounded as if  they were reading old copy from Ronald Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s debate book. They reminded us of Senator John McCain\xe2\x80\x99s quip during a visit to The Times when we asked why none of his party\xe2\x80\x99s candidates wanted to be seen as George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s heir. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re all still trying to be Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s heir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'On domestic policy, the Republicans offered trickle-down bromides, with the exception of Mr. Paul, who wants to scrap the tax code. The others touted the power of tax cuts to boost the economy, an odd dissonance when Americans see economic woes all around them. They spoke reverently of unregulated business, when Americans know the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s failures to regulate are at the root of the mortgage crisis that is driving the economy toward recession and are the reason they have to worry about lead in their children\xe2\x80\x99s toys and poison in pet  food.'b'The Democrats fell over each other proclaiming their opposition to continuing those tax cuts. Unlike the Republicans, who never mentioned it, the Democrats took on the mortgage crisis, saying it demonstrated the need to regulate the banks that made irresponsible loans and the investment firms that profited from them.'b'Except again for Mr. Paul, the Republicans tried to outbid the others\xe2\x80\x99 commitment to staying the course in Iraq. That included Mike Huckabee, who defended his criticism of Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy as \xe2\x80\x9carrogant,\xe2\x80\x9d but offered no new ideas on how to manage Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s arrogantly mismanaged war. We hardly expected calls for withdrawal, but none of the five who support the war offered the slightest sense of how to achieve the victory they said they wanted.'b'The four Democrats debated ideas for ending the war, a service to American voters who overwhelmingly want it to end. Hillary Clinton, struggling for purchase against Barack Obama, who now owns the \xe2\x80\x9cchange agent\xe2\x80\x9d mantle, came to life over this issue. She called for withdrawal but sensibly said it must be done carefully, and that Americans have to accept the consequences.'b'It is too soon, in our view, to call either nominating contest, much less the fall election. But in a year in which voters are fed up with Washington (even Mr. McCain said on Sunday that his base was disillusioned), the Republicans have a long way to go to grasp the mood of the electorate in this 21st-century election.'b'The unemployment report on Friday was brutally bad. Unemployment rose in December, while job creation was minimal \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s highly likely, for technical reasons, that the job number  will be revised down, showing an actual decline  in employment.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s the latest piece of bad news about an economy in which the employment situation has actually been deteriorating for the past year.

The levees have been breached, and the repercussions of the housing crisis are spreading across the economy as a whole.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not certain, even now, that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a formal recession, although given the news on Friday you have to say that the odds are that we will. But what is clear is that 2008 will be a troubled year for the U.S. economy  \xe2\x80\x94 and that as a result, the overall economic record of the Bush years will have been dreary at best: two and a half years of slumping employment, three and a half years of good but not great growth, and two more years of renewed economic distress.'b'The November   election will take place against that background of economic distress, which ought to be good news for candidates running on a platform of change.'b'But the opponents of change, those who want to keep the Bush legacy intact, are not without resources. In fact, they\xe2\x80\x99ve already made their standard pivot when things turn bad  \xe2\x80\x94  the pivot from hype to fear. And in case you haven\xe2\x80\x99t noticed, they\xe2\x80\x99re very, very good at the fear thing.'b'You see, for 30 years American politics has been dominated by a political movement practicing Robin-Hood-in-reverse, giving unto those that hath while taking from those who don\xe2\x80\x99t. And one secret of that long domination has been a remarkable flexibility in economic debate. The policies never change  \xe2\x80\x94 but the arguments for these policies turn on a dime.'b'When the economy is doing reasonably well, the debate is dominated by hype \xe2\x80\x94 by the claim that America\xe2\x80\x99s prosperity is truly wondrous, and that conservative economic policies deserve all the credit.'b'But when things turn down, there is a seamless transition from \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s morning in America! Hurray for tax cuts!\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cThe economy is slumping! Raising taxes would be a disaster!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Thus, until just the other day Bush administration officials were in denial about the economy\xe2\x80\x99s problems. They were still insisting that the economy was strong, and touting the \xe2\x80\x9cBush boom\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x94  the improvement in the job situation that took place between the summer of 2003 and the end of 2006  \xe2\x80\x94  as proof of the efficacy of tax cuts.'b'But now, without ever acknowledging that maybe things weren\xe2\x80\x99t that great after all, President Bush is warning that given the economy\xe2\x80\x99s problems, \xe2\x80\x9cthe worst thing the Congress could do is raise taxes on the American people and on American businesses.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And even more dire warnings are coming from some of the Republican presidential candidates. For example, John McCain\xe2\x80\x99s campaign Web site cautions darkly that \xe2\x80\x9cEntrepreneurs should not be taxed into submission. John McCain will make the Bush income and investment tax cuts permanent, keeping income tax rates at their current level and fighting the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 plans for a crippling tax increase in 2011.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What \xe2\x80\x9ccrippling\xe2\x80\x9d tax increase, which would tax entrepreneurs into submission, is Mr. McCain talking about? The answer is, proposals by Democrats to let the Bush tax cuts for people making more than $250,000 a year expire, returning upper-income tax rates to the levels that prevailed in the Clinton years.'b'And we all remember how little entrepreneurship there was, how weakly the economy performed, during the Clinton years, right? Oh, wait. (I\xe2\x80\x99ve put some charts comparing job performance during the Clinton and Bush years on my Times blog, 'b'krugman.blogs.nytimes.com'b'. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty startling how comparatively weak the Bush era looks.)'b'Never mind. The whole point of scare tactics is that they can work even in the face of inconvenient facts.'b'And what I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure about is whether the Democrats are ready for the fight they\xe2\x80\x99re about to face.'b'Not to put too fine a point on it, Barack Obama won his impressive victory in Iowa with a sunny, upbeat message of change.'b'But there\xe2\x80\x99s a powerful political faction in this country that understands very well that any real change will create losers as well as winners. In particular, any serious progressive reform of health care, let alone a broader attempt to reduce middle-class insecurity and inequality, will have to mean higher taxes on the affluent. And members of that faction will do whatever it takes to scare people into believing that change means disaster for the economy.'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll succeed.

Health workers recently returned from H.I.V.-AIDS clinics in Africa and Central America report that nongovernmental programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission of H.I.V. are launched, but that they are embedded in gravely inadequate infrastructures that diminish the chances for success.

The Democrats who will vote in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday aren\xe2\x80\x99t worried that Hillary Clinton will steal the election from Barack Obama or John Edwards, but a good chunk of them would probably confess to dark fears about a Republican plot in November, even if Karl Rove won\xe2\x80\x99t be involved.'b'Last month, Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s secretary of state, Mike Coffman, a Republican, decertified the state\xe2\x80\x99s electronic voting machines, after the alarming finding that one model could be disabled with a magnet and others were scandalously inaccurate. He left voters to draw their own conclusions about what this meant for the state\xe2\x80\x99s most recent elections. The California secretary of state, Debra Bowen, a Democrat, took office last year after running on a don\xe2\x80\x99t-trust-electronic-voting platform, and in August she pulled the plug on the state\xe2\x80\x99s voting machines.'b'But what other options are there? Paper ballots aren\xe2\x80\x99t perfect. Ballot boxes can be stuffed or lost. Indeed, because of Florida\xe2\x80\x99s paper-ballot mess in 2000, electronic voting is probably here to stay.'b'Fortunately, there is an elegant solution that lets us use modern technology while assuaging the growing fears about voter fraud. Ronald L. Rivest, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer scientist, and Warren D. Smith, a mathematician and voting reform advocate, have proposed an ingenious method that would combine paper ballots and a Web site to achieve greater ballot security than is possible with paper or software alone.'b'Their basic idea is to allow each voter to take home a photocopy of a randomly selected ballot cast by someone else.'b'The scheme is low-tech. Paper ballots would be tallied by optical scanners or even by hand. The results would be then posted on a Web site. Using a serial number assigned to each ballot, voters could check the site to make sure that their random ballots were posted and had not been altered or misread.'b'To discourage vote buying, voters would not receive copies of their own ballots. My receipt would be someone else\xe2\x80\x99s ballot, so I would have no way of proving to a bribe-wielding politician whom I voted for. (There are no voter names on secret ballots, of course, so the random receipts would not compromise the privacy of the voting booth.)'b'Yet another opportunity for fraud, perhaps more likely than outright vote buying, would be created if voters were given paper records of their own ballots. Many voters would ditch their receipts in the first trash can they see. Then, crooked election workers could retrieve the discarded receipts and change the corresponding electronic votes, confident that there would be no evidence of their fraud.'b'But under the system proposed by Professor Rivest and Dr. Smith, should corrupt poll workers \xe2\x80\x9cforget\xe2\x80\x9d to count some ballots, people would notice and complain. And because the receipts are copies of ballots chosen at random each time, a few ballots would be copied twice or more. Finding a discarded receipt would not guarantee that it is \xe2\x80\x9csafe\xe2\x80\x9d to change the corresponding vote \xe2\x80\x94 there might be other copies of the same ballot floating around, and some watchful citizen might be checking them.'b'The Web site would also publish the names of everyone who voted. This would prevent someone from undetectably adding fake votes from names copied off, say, tombstones.'b'Perhaps best of all, because a public Web site would post the complete information from every ballot, anyone could check that every single vote has been counted accurately.'b'Too much trouble, you say? Don\xe2\x80\x99t bother, then. All that matters is that some concerned citizens check. The news media, the political parties, activists and bloggers would  be checking so that the rest of us don\xe2\x80\x99t have to. Indeed, Professor Rivest and Dr. Smith demonstrate mathematically that it takes only a tiny number of people checking the Web site to catch any substantial fraud with near certainty. For instance, to have 95 percent assurance of detecting a fraud involving 6 percent of ballots, only 50 voters would have to check, and this is true no matter how large the electorate. If the margin of victory is less than 6 percent, then more people would surely check.'b'The virtue of the system is its simplicity. The only technology that would be required is a Web site and a scanning printer that could produce a copy of a random ballot for each voter at the press of a button. That wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be hard to devise.'b'As YouTube demonstrates, the Internet is a leveling force, allowing people to assume roles formerly left to professionals. The Rivest-Smith scheme would make ensuring fair elections everyone\xe2\x80\x99s business.'b'President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan has bowed, somewhat, to domestic pressure and called in Scotland Yard  to help figure out who killed Benazir Bhutto. A credible investigation is urgently needed and Mr. Musharraf \xe2\x80\x94 who has no credibility of his own \xe2\x80\x94 needs all the help he can get.'b'Unfortunately, the ex-general immediately raised doubts about how much freedom British police will have to do their job. Even as he insisted that he wants to know how his political rival really died, he insisted that no government officials were involved and warned against investigators going on a \xe2\x80\x9cwild goose chase.\xe2\x80\x9d That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound as if  he\xe2\x80\x99s ready to encourage full cooperation.'b'The government says the assassin was a Qaeda operative, while Ms. Bhutto\xe2\x80\x99s followers charge that it was the work of people with either past or present ties to Mr. Musharraf. Until there is a credible explanation, there is no hope of calming the country\xe2\x80\x99s turmoil. And more turmoil is the last thing that Pakistan, with its nuclear weapons and its cozy ties to Al Qaeda and the Taliban, needs.'b'Investigators are already facing serious technical obstacles. The crime scene was hosed down by government workers, washing away potential evidence. And there was no autopsy done on Ms. Bhutto\xe2\x80\x99s body \xe2\x80\x94 both because her husband didn\xe2\x80\x99t want it and because Pakistani officials failed to order it. An autopsy may be the only way to determine if she was shot, as her supporters believe but the government initially denied, and who aimed the weapon.'b'Even if he permits a serious investigation, Mr. Musharraf will need to do a lot more to calm furies in Pakistan. He delayed this week\xe2\x80\x99s planned parliamentary elections until Feb. 18. For the vote to have any hope of legitimacy, Mr. Musharraf must now release jailed democratic activists and lawyers, lift press restrictions, allow international monitors to observe the polling, and permit Nawaz Sharif, now the country\xe2\x80\x99s most prominent opposition leader, to stand for election. The United States must insist that Mr. Musharraf do all of this and make clear that ballot-rigging will be exposed and condemned.'b'The weaknesses of Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s democracy go beyond Mr. Musharraf. The fact that Ms. Bhutto\xe2\x80\x99s political party quickly chose her husband \xe2\x80\x94 long tainted by charges of corruption \xe2\x80\x94 and her college-student son as its leaders underscores the system\xe2\x80\x99s feudal nature. Real democracy will take a long time to build in Pakistan, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the only path to stability.

Growing up, I heard about the blizzard of 1888. My great-grandfather walked to the town hall \xe2\x80\x94 for Town Meeting, not for a primary \xe2\x80\x94 on the tops of fences where snow was reliably stiff.'b'Before paved roads, cars and snowplows existed, farmers with paired horses or oxen pulled great rollers over the snows of Old Route 4, paying their town taxes by smoothing a path for sleighs. When I was a child, an old man told me a story: one ox pulling a roller got stuck on something, and when the farmer investigated, he found that his animal\xe2\x80\x99s hoof was caught in a chimney. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that even at 5 I believed that one.'b'Now, winding dirt roads carry signs that proclaim themselves one lane. When we walk on the whiteness, our boots crunch safely because dry snow covers the ice. We walk among glorious woods, old pasture land where we never meet a candidate or see a political sign.'b'Long tree branches extend ridges of snow, and white softens stone walls and the boulders that glaciers deposited. Only the noise of snowmobiles, over old railroad tracks, interrupts our silence.'b'The vast majority of all smokers had their first cigarette before the age of 18. That\xe2\x80\x99s why the key to reducing overall tobacco use is to prevent it in the young. The task is daunting. Almost a quarter of high school students nationwide currently smoke. There\xe2\x80\x99s ample reason for hope when one looks at New York City. Smoking among public high school students there dropped from 17.6 percent in 2001 to 8.5 percent in 2007 \xe2\x80\x94 a rate that is far below the national average.'b'Experts attribute the reduction to a comprehensive approach that included raising the combined state-city cigarette tax to $3 a pack \xe2\x80\x94 one of the highest in the nation \xe2\x80\x94  restricting public smoking, backing an aggressive anti-tobacco media campaign, cracking down on vendors who sell to minors and paying for smoking prevention and cessation programs. The results were stunning: just 20,000 public high school students out of the city\xe2\x80\x99s quarter-million smoked last year.'b'Connecticut, which has one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s best records in curbing adult smoking, is lagging far behind when it comes to youngsters. Officials say they are proud that the percentage of Connecticut\xe2\x80\x99s 176,000 public high school students who smoke dropped by a third between 2000 and 2005, from 25.6 percent to 17 percent. The state restricts public smoking and levies a cigarette tax of $2 per pack. A more vigorous campaign could surely have done more to reduce students\xe2\x80\x99 smoking.'b'Connecticut has for years been content with a scatter-shot approach, spreading dollars for prevention and treatment among several state departments with little coordination or leadership. It spends little or nothing on a publicity campaign to discourage smoking. An advocacy group recently ranked Connecticut last among the states in using money from a 1998 settlement with tobacco companies to fund tobacco prevention programs.'b'Unfortunately, Connecticut\xe2\x80\x99s approach is common among the states, which too often use the settlement money for purposes other than smoking prevention. Connecticut will receive $140 million this year as part of its annual share of that settlement, yet it plans to devote a mere $3 million to fight tobacco use. New York City has shown that a strong anti-smoking campaign can change habits and save lives on a broad scale. Connecticut, and all states, should follow the city\xe2\x80\x99s example.'b'THE woman in question became a lawyer after some years as a community organizer, married a corporate lawyer and is the mother of two little girls, ages 9 and 6.

Gender is probably the most restricting force in American life, whether the question is who must be in the kitchen or who could be in the White House. This country is way down the list of countries electing women and, according to one study, it polarizes gender roles more than the average democracy.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why the Iowa primary was following our historical pattern of making change. Black men were given the vote a half-century before women of any race were allowed to mark a ballot, and generally have ascended to positions of power, from the military to the boardroom, before any women (with the possible exception of obedient family members in the latter).'b'If the lawyer described above had been just as charismatic but named, say, Achola Obama instead of Barack Obama, her goose would have been cooked long ago.

The reasons are as pervasive as the air we breathe: because sexism is still confused with nature as racism once was; because anything that affects males is seen as more serious than anything that affects \xe2\x80\x9conly\xe2\x80\x9d the female half of the human race; because children are still raised mostly by women (to put it mildly) so men especially tend to feel they are regressing  to childhood when dealing with a powerful woman; because racism stereotyped black men as more \xe2\x80\x9cmasculine\xe2\x80\x9d for so long that some white men find their presence to be masculinity-affirming (as long as there aren\xe2\x80\x99t too many of them); and because there is still no \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d way to be a woman in public power without being considered a you-know-what.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not advocating a competition for who has it toughest. The caste systems of sex and race are interdependent and can only be uprooted together. That\xe2\x80\x99s why Senators Clinton and  Obama have to be careful not to let a healthy debate turn into the kind of hostility that the news media love. Both will need a coalition of outsiders to win a general election. The abolition and suffrage movements progressed when united and were damaged by division; we should remember that.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m supporting Senator  Clinton because like Senator  Obama she has community organizing experience, but she also has more years in the Senate, an unprecedented eight years of on-the-job training in the White House, no masculinity to prove, the potential to tap a huge reservoir of this country\xe2\x80\x99s talent by her example, and now even the courage to break the no-tears rule. I\xe2\x80\x99m not opposing Mr. Obama; if he\xe2\x80\x99s the nominee, I\xe2\x80\x99ll volunteer. Indeed, if you look at votes during their two-year overlap in the Senate, they were the same more than 90 percent of the time.  Besides, to clean up the mess left by President Bush, we may need two terms of President Clinton and two of President Obama.'b'But what worries me is that he  is seen as unifying by his race while she  is seen as divisive by her sex.'b'What worries me is that she is accused of \xe2\x80\x9cplaying the gender card\xe2\x80\x9d when citing the old boys\xe2\x80\x99 club, while he is seen as unifying by citing civil rights confrontations.'b'What worries me is that male Iowa voters were seen as gender-free when supporting their own, while female  voters were seen as biased if they did and disloyal if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'What worries me is that reporters ignore Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s dependence on the old \xe2\x80\x94 for instance, the frequent campaign comparisons to John F. Kennedy \xe2\x80\x94 while not challenging the slander that her progressive policies are part of the Washington status quo.'b'What worries me is that some women, perhaps especially younger ones, hope to deny or escape the sexual caste system; thus Iowa women over 50 and 60, who disproportionately supported Senator  Clinton, proved once again that women are the one group that grows more radical with age.'b'This country can no longer afford to choose our leaders from a talent pool limited by sex, race, money, powerful fathers and paper degrees. It\xe2\x80\x99s time to take equal pride in breaking all the barriers. We have to be able to say: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m supporting her because she\xe2\x80\x99ll be a great president 'b'and'b' because she\xe2\x80\x99s a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It took too many years and too many deaths to persuade Congress to act, but President Bush is expected to sign into law today a measure that will make it harder for people with a history of dangerous mental illness to purchase firearms. That is good news, but there is more work to be done.'b'The new law \xe2\x80\x94 the product of a rare partnership between gun control advocates and the National Rifle Association \xe2\x80\x94 addresses a glaring problem. Millions of criminal and mental health records are missing from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System used to screen gun purchasers and block sales to people who are disqualified by law from buying guns. The bill provides new financial incentives for states and localities to improve their spotty record-keeping and to share all pertinent information with the federal data system.'b'This important step forward owes much to the efforts of two New York Democrats: Senator Charles Schumer and Representative Carolyn McCarthy. They first tried to pass the measure in 2002, after a gunman, whose mental history should have blocked his purchase of a .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle, walked into a Long Island church and gunned down a priest and a parishioner.'b'That tragic crime was not enough to prod Congress to act, but last year\xe2\x80\x99s massacre at Virginia Tech was. The fact that the Virginia Tech shooter was allowed to buy semiautomatic pistols and high-capacity ammunition magazines, even though a court had found him to be dangerously mentally ill, sparked public outrage. It also put pressure on the N.R.A. to work with gun control proponents on legislation to plug the big gap in the background check system that helped pave the way for the deadly attack.'b'Having taken this much-needed step, the gun lobby should now join with gun control advocates to close another dangerous loophole: the one that permits nonlicensed dealers to sell firearms at gun shows without conducting any background check whatsoever. There is no principled reason gun show sales should be exempt, and the loophole poses a serious threat to public safety.'b'The N.R.A has so far successfully beaten back legislation to end the gun show loophole. It should not take another horrific attack by a mad gunman to change anyone\xe2\x80\x99s mind. This time the N.R.A., Congress and President Bush should do the right thing \xe2\x80\x94 before more lives are needlessly lost.'b'Nearly 40 years ago, President Richard Nixon issued an executive order calling for a national strategy to protect wildlife by restricting off-road vehicles to carefully designated trails. President Jimmy Carter later gave the interior secretary the authority to ban such vehicles from sensitive lands. Unfortunately, except for a brief and encouraging crackdown during the Clinton administration, nobody has paid much attention to these directives since.'b'There are now nine million off-road vehicles, meaning all-terrain vehicles and dirt bikes (snowmobiles are a separate category). And their owners, with little resistance from the authorities that ought to be policing them, are transforming some of America\xe2\x80\x99s most sensitive public lands into their personal playgrounds.'b'As Felicity Barringer and William Yardley wrote in The Times recently,   there are responsible owners who stick to designated trails as well as renegades who go \xe2\x80\x9coff trail\xe2\x80\x9d with grave consequences for animal habitat, fragile desert soils and historical artifacts. The real problem, however, is that the important decisions about where off-road vehicles can go are not being made by the federal Bureau of Land Management, which is supposed to protect these lands and regulate these vehicles, but by the owners, user associations and rural county officials who are under their thumb.'b'Utah is an alarming case in point. The bureau is presently drafting six new land-use plans for Utah that would allow about 15,000 miles of designated trails. The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, an environmental group, points out that many of these routes have been lifted straight from maps provided by the off-road vehicle associations and have not been independently surveyed to assess their potential damage to the soil, animal habitat and archaeological sites.'b'Worse, some of the trails would crisscross about 2.5 million acres of breathtakingly beautiful country that the Clinton administration thought worthy of permanent wilderness protection. Once these trails are in regular use, and enshrined on federal maps, the land would almost surely be ineligible for wilderness designation, which is typically reserved for roadless areas.'b'The threat to these lands stems partly from the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s philosophical inclinations: its aversion to federal stewardship and its relentless drive to open public lands to commercial and recreational use even when nature is the clear loser. It also stems from an insidious belief inside the federal bureaucracy that the problem is insoluble \xe2\x80\x94 that there are too many off-road vehicles and not enough federal agents to police them.'b'Washington has a duty to do better, beginning, at a minimum, with protecting those 2.5 million acres that the Bureau of Land Management identified in 1999 as having wilderness characteristics. It should then call a timeout on the whole process until the bureau has done the kind of independent surveys it is capable of doing \xe2\x80\x94 and is paid to do.'b'Derry, N.H.'b'Some of the people who showed up early to stand in the long line outside the field house of the Pinkerton Academy would end up waiting more than three hours to see the candidate. Barack Obama was running late, held back by huge and enthusiastic crowds at earlier events. Even people who were not planning to vote for him wanted to see him.'b'When he finally arrived and took the stage, Mr. Obama told the audience, to boisterous cheers: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something going on out there. Something\xe2\x80\x99s stirring in the wind.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The past week has been a bad one for cynics. For all the criticism of the presidential election process  \xe2\x80\x94  that it lasts too long, that the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary have too much influence, that the news media\xe2\x80\x99s coverage is too much about the horse race, and so on  \xe2\x80\x94  for all that, the early stages of this presidential race have been both compelling and heartening.'b'Voters are excited about this election. They have trudged through snow and frigid air in enormous numbers in Iowa and New Hampshire to see and hear and question the candidates. And most of the candidates are working incredibly hard, fighting their way through exhaustion to attend the next rally or town hall meeting or community breakfast or debate.'b'What is being fashioned in this process is nothing less than the face of early 21st century America.'b'Debra Gable and Bill Laprade told me during a chat in a Dunkin\xe2\x80\x99 Donuts here that they had driven from Barre Town in central Vermont to get a closer look at Mr. Obama, Senator Hillary Clinton and maybe Senator John McCain.'b'Mr. Laprade, who described himself as conservative, quietly expressed his disenchantment with President Bush and said Mr. McCain \xe2\x80\x9csounded sincere and genuine.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ms. Gable said she liked Senator McCain as well, but she was leaning toward Senator Obama. \xe2\x80\x9cI dislike politics,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause we focus on our differences even though we have so many more commonalities. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I think I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing from Obama, so I want to see how he is in person.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'No one knows whether Senator Obama can sustain his remarkable quest, or whether Senator Clinton can untangle the snags that have hobbled her campaign, or whether Senator McCain can resurrect a candidacy that not too long ago was pronounced dead.'b'But something new, not just in American politics but in the society as a whole, is undoubtedly emerging. The change is already under way. It would not have been possible to imagine even just a few years ago that a black man could come out of Iowa (and maybe New Hampshire) leading the charge toward the Democratic presidential nomination.'b'There are plenty of racists still lurking among us, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll no doubt be agitated by the Obama phenomenon. But it would be hard for anyone to make the case that the U.S. as whole has not become less racially prejudiced over the past several years. Implicit in Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s message of healing and reconciliation is the promise of further progress on this once intractable front.'b'Senator Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy is also historic \xe2\x80\x94  and emblematic of change. Misogyny still permeates most aspects of society, but there aren\xe2\x80\x99t many people willing to step up and make the case that a woman cannot lead the nation.'b'If there is a theme running through the nominating process of both parties, it\xe2\x80\x99s the idea that voters are fed up with the con, with the phony, plastic, programmed politicians who are obsessed with power and contemptuous of the real concerns of ordinary men and women.'b'I think it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting that the people crying out for a new kind of politics are not the down-and-outers, but are educated, middle-class Americans who in some sense understand that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been sold a bill of goods.'b'They see the value of their homes decreasing and their personal indebtedness climbing to new heights. They know how much it costs to send a son or daughter to college. They are tired of the war in Iraq and concerned about America\xe2\x80\x99s standing in the world. And they are worried that the American dream that has sustained so many generations for so long won\xe2\x80\x99t be there for their children and grandchildren.'b'When Barack Obama asks how many people in his overflow audience are still undecided and a third of the people raise their hands, it\xe2\x80\x99s a sign that there is a hunger for new leadership but that it won\xe2\x80\x99t be easily satisfied.'b'Something is stirring all right. Voters are paying attention. Young people are coming into the process. The electorate is fed up and ready to invoke the prerogatives of citizenship to hold the leadership to higher standards.'b'The textbooks tell us that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly how it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to work.'b'Norman, Okla.'b'The bloggers, hardly the politest bunch, were calling the gathering of former and present officials on Monday at the University of Oklahoma the \xe2\x80\x9cBen-Gay forum\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a nostalgia trip for oldies trying to creak their way back into electoral relevance.'b'Some of the more radical or wishful thinkers of the political crowd saw the session as something different: the possible beginning of a third party and another brick in the independent presidential bid by Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York.'b'Actually, it was neither.'b'It was more what David Boren, former senator from Oklahoma and now president of the university, called it: a gathering of 17 \xe2\x80\x9coutstanding public servants\xe2\x80\x9d who wanted to talk about more than Mr. Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s supposed White House aspirations or a third party.'b'Call it idealism or a yearning for the past, but the participants wanted to talk about more than their legacies. They wanted to warn that \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica is in danger\xe2\x80\x9d and urge the politicians of today to fulfill their basic obligations to the country, not the party or some sliver of an interest group or the lobbyist who forks over the most lucre.'b'And if some participants wanted to use the threat of an independent candidacy to get the attention of Republican and Democratic regulars, at this point that seems more a tactic than a solution.'b'Former Senator John Danforth, Republican of Missouri, told the enthusiastic crowd on Monday, the day before the New Hampshire primary, that each party has appealed too much to its \xe2\x80\x9ctrue believers\xe2\x80\x9d instead of appealing to the center. Former New Jersey Gov. Christie Todd Whitman said that it is up to voters to stop ceding ground to the fringes. Former Senator Chuck Robb, Democrat of Virginia, recalled, wistfully, meetings with Republican colleagues that aimed to find solutions to a big problem, not hunt for a \xe2\x80\x9cgotcha\xe2\x80\x9d to use against the other side.'b'For this group of political elders \xe2\x80\x94 two independents and the remainder split between the two parties \xe2\x80\x94 the fact that candidates in New Hampshire are chanting about change and Americans working together is just more evidence of the yearning out there to stop the narrow, divisive, expensive shenanigans in Washington.'b'This group wants the presidential hopefuls to offer specific ways to solve big problems like energy, health care and entitlements. They want candidates to promise \xe2\x80\x9ca truly bipartisan cabinet\xe2\x80\x9d and bipartisan working groups to talk about national defense, education and infrastructure.'b'Quixotic? Perhaps. It is easy to dismiss these lofty goals as impossible, even whimsical after eight years in which George W. Bush and Karl Rove devoted their political powers to dividing America on narrow emotional issues. But somebody should be saying what these veterans are saying. Congress does need to wear out carpet on the aisle between the two parties and thoughtful public leaders need to sit down in working groups to decide on the hard stuff instead of tearing each other apart on 24-hour television.'b'Before anyone, including these moderates, gives up on the two parties, it is  worth thinking about what a third party could mean. A new independent party, with or without Mr. Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s money, might siphon off moderate voters from the two main parties. If the independents did not succeed, which history suggests they would not, the main parties could wind up even more dominated by the screamers on both sides.'b'Right now, there is no third party and no candidate, just thoughtful people trying to get the political system to look at bigger ideas. In today\xe2\x80\x99s political world, there is nothing wrong with that.'b'An editorial on the Iowa caucuses on Saturday gave an incorrect history of the caucuses. One winner of contested caucuses did win the White House: George W. Bush in 2000.'b'Salem, N.H.'b'Both Barack Obama and John McCain attract independents. Both have a candor that appeals to voters and media-types alike. Both ask their audiences to serve a cause greater than self-interest. Both offer a politics that is grand and inspiring.'b'But they are very different men. Their policies obviously conflict, but their skills, world views and moral philosophies set them apart, too. One man celebrates communitarian virtues like unity, the other classical virtues like honor.'b'Obama\xe2\x80\x99s great skill is his ability to perceive and forge bonds with other people. Everybody who\xe2\x80\x99s dealt with him has a story about a time when they felt Obama profoundly listened to them and understood them. One of mine came a few years ago.'b'I was writing columns criticizing the Republican Congress, but each time I\xe2\x80\x99d throw in a few sentences slamming the Democrats, subconsciously trying to make myself feel good. One morning I got an e-mail message from Obama that roughly said: David, if you want to critique us, fine. But you\xe2\x80\x99re just throwing in those stray sentences to make yourself feel good.'b'I felt like a bug pinned down in a display case.'b'Out of that perceptiveness comes a distinct way of seeing the world. Obama emphasizes the connections between people, the networks and the webs of influence. These sorts of links are invisible to some of his rivals, but Obama is a communitarian. He believes you can only make profound political changes if you first change the spirit of the community. In his speeches, he says that if one person stands up, then another will stand up and another and another and you\xe2\x80\x99ll get a nation standing up.'b'The key word in any Obama speech is \xe2\x80\x9cyou.\xe2\x80\x9d Other politicians talk about what they will do if elected. Obama talks about what you can do if you join together. Like a community organizer on a national scale, he is trying to move people beyond their cynicism, make them believe in themselves, mobilize their common energies.'b'His weakness is that he never breaks from his own group. In policy terms, he is an orthodox liberal. He never tells audiences anything that might make them uncomfortable. In the Senate, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t join the Gang of 14, which created a bipartisan consensus on judges, because it would have meant deviating from liberal orthodoxy and coming to the center.'b'How do you build a trans-partisan coalition when every single policy you propose is reliably on the left?'b'John McCain has cordial relations with Obama, but he is very different. He is most moved by examples of heroism and individual excellence. His books are about individual character and patriotism, not networks or community-building.'b'He is not a loner (in fact, he dislikes being alone), but whether he is a prisoner of war or a senator, he is acutely aware of how corrupt social pressures encroach on individual integrity. While Obama seeks solidarity with groups, McCain resists conformity. He fights fiercely, though not always successfully, against political pressures in order to remain honest, brave and forthright.'b'In the Senate, he sits in the back of the Republican policy lunches cracking jokes at the hired spin-meisters. He is allergic to blind party discipline and builds radically different coalitions depending on his views on each issue \xe2\x80\x94 global warming, campaign finance, spending, the war. He is most offended by dishonor. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be sitting in his Senate office and he\xe2\x80\x99ll read about some act of selfishness \xe2\x80\x94 a corrupt Pentagon contract, Jack Abramoff\xe2\x80\x99s scandals \xe2\x80\x94 and he\xe2\x80\x99ll spend the next several months punishing wrongdoing.'b'McCain\xe2\x80\x99s campaign events are unpredictable. At Obama events, the candidate gives a moving speech while the crowd rises deliriously as one. McCain holds town meetings. People challenge him, sometimes angrily. And if they oppose him, McCain will come back to them two or three times so that there can be an honest exchange of views. Some politicians try to persuade their audience that they agree with them. McCain welcomes disagreement and talks about it.'b'McCain\xe2\x80\x99s weakness is that he flies by the seat of his pants. If elected, he will have to live in the cocoon of the White House and build an organized and predictable administration. As a pilot, he got used to taking off from aircraft carriers. But as president, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be the guy steering the aircraft carrier.'b'The central issue in this election is the crisis of leadership. Voters are reacting against partisan gridlock. Obama and McCain both offer ways to end this gridlock. Obama wants us to rise above it by rediscovering our commonalities. McCain hopes smash it with fierce honesty and independent action.'b'Today in New Hampshire, independent voters get to pick the model they prefer.'b'To the Editor:'b'Reading William Kristol\xe2\x80\x99s Jan. 7 column, \xe2\x80\x9cPresident Mike Huckabee?,\xe2\x80\x9d one would come away thinking that President Bush was an outstanding president and that America is enthusiastic to continue his course, with Mr. Huckabee at the helm. In reality, Bush policies and the conservative agenda \xe2\x80\x94 from abortion, Iraq and judicial appointments \xe2\x80\x94 are widely opposed. Most voters want the next president to undo Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s legacy, not extend it.'b'Mr. Huckabee may be Mr. Kristol\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clikable regular guy,\xe2\x80\x9d but America has matured.

Some populations could vanish within 100 years.'b'Though hunting still plays a role and led to a bilateral treaty with Russia, ratified last September, climate change is the major threat to polar bears today.'b'Governor Palin thinks the proposed listing is a backdoor way of forcing the federal government to change course on global warming policy, but it does no such thing. Instead, it simply seeks to protect bears in the absence of a better national approach to climate change.'b'If Governor Palin is serious about wanting wildlife policy linked to science, she should examine the studies that her state wildlife officials seem to have ignored.

But rather than having the public get involved, this would have to be carried out correctly at the state department of elections level.'b'What this really brings up is the entire lack of a government-sponsored official advisory committee to give scientific guidance and recommendations to the states on how to make our elections safe and secure in this new electronic age.'b'John David'b'\nFairfield, Conn., Jan. 7, 2008'b''b'\xc2\x95'b'To the Editor:'b'This is a welcome and novel idea.

It should be noted however, that unless the software that randomizes the ballots is open source, there will be no way to ensure that the ballots are indeed random. Therefore, regardless of how well the system works, the public will continue to distrust it.'b'Rob Harmon'b'\nVashon, Wash., Jan. 7, 2008'b''b'From the early indications, Americans are feeling enthusiastic about their constitutionally guaranteed right to vote. The Supreme Court should encourage, not frustrate, that enthusiasm when it hears a challenge today to a harsh voter identification law adopted by Indiana. The law aims to be an anti-fraud measure, but its main impact will be to disenfranchise large numbers of registered voters. The court should not let it stand.'b'The idea of asking voters for ID may not sound unreasonable, but the devil is in the exclusionary details. Before the 2005 law, Indiana voters simply had to sign in at the polls and their signatures were compared to the ones on file. Now voters must present a current government-issued photo ID, generally a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license.'b'The impact of that requirement falls unequally. Poor people, racial minorities and the elderly are especially unlikely to have driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses or other forms of ID required under the law. A study in Georgia, which enacted its own voter ID law, found that black voters were more than 83 percent more likely than whites not to have driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses or state-issued ID. Hispanics were nearly twice as likely not to have them.'b'Another problem is that such laws are often applied in a discriminatory way. A study in New Mexico found that Hispanic voters were significantly more likely than non-Hispanics to be asked to show the legally required ID.'b'In-person voter fraud is extremely rare, and there is no evidence of it occurring in Indiana. It says a lot about the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s motives that it did not apply the new ID rules to the kind of voting where there has been documented fraud: absentee voting. It is also not a coincidence that the people likely to be disenfranchised are from groups that vote disproportionately Democratic. Voter ID laws have been pushed across the country by Republicans. Despite the anti-fraud talk, the inescapable conclusion is that the laws are an attempt to shave a few percentage points off of a Democratic turnout.'b'This should not be a difficult case to decide. The court has ruled that the right to vote is so important that the Constitution requires that restrictions on it be given a strict review. The question the court must ask is \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the exclusions are necessary to promote a compelling state interest.\xe2\x80\x9d Given that in-person voter fraud appears nonexistent in Indiana, there is no compelling interest here.'b'Even if there were a genuine concern, there are plenty of \xe2\x80\x9cless-restrictive alternatives,\xe2\x80\x9d as the courts put it, to keep the process both clean and fair: requiring signatures, allowing poll watchers to challenge voters and imposing severe criminal penalties for anyone who tries to vote fraudulently.'b'Unfortunately, the court may be inclined to view this case through a political prism. If that happens, it may break down along the same 5-4 fault line that it did in Bush v. Gore. That would be terrible for both the court and the nation. The justices can strike a blow for their own reputation and for democracy by standing up for an obvious principle: that the right to vote cannot be taken away to serve the electoral purposes of a political party.'b'To the Editor:'b'Adam Liptak listed four lessons to be drawn from the incidents that he describes in \xe2\x80\x9cIf Your Hard Drive Could Testify ...\xe2\x80\x9d (Sidebar column, Jan. 7).'b'There is a fifth lesson: There are plenty of harmless-looking people traveling around with collections of child pornography on their laptops.'b'As a mother of three, I found this lesson far more compelling than the others.

He has not endorsed Mrs. Clinton or any candidate.'b'The New Hampshire primary has done Americans a service by leaving both parties\xe2\x80\x99 nominating contests open and giving a truly broad range of voters a chance to participate in these vitally important choices. The coming contests will be colored in large part by how the contenders and their backers answer a basic question: Just how far are they willing to go to win?'b'If the Republican fringe plays to type and decides to savage John McCain, the party\xe2\x80\x99s winner in New Hampshire, once again, and if the Clinton camp continues to allow its baser instincts to rule, they will do more harm than good to themselves, to their parties and to the political process. The danger signs are there on both sides, but are glaringly evident among the Democrats.'b'Senator Barack Obama did not refrain from dropping cutting comments about Senator Hillary Clinton into his speeches. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not running because I think it\xe2\x80\x99s my turn, that it\xe2\x80\x99s somehow owed to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say. But he generally pitched his speeches on notes of inspiration and hope.'b'Mrs. Clinton ran an angry campaign in New Hampshire, and polls showed that voters noticed. She won narrowly, but came perilously close to injecting racial tension into what should have been \xe2\x80\x94 and still should be \xe2\x80\x94 an uplifting contest between the first major woman candidate and the first major African-American candidate.'b'In the days before the voting, Mrs. Clinton and her team were so intent on talking about how big a change a woman president would be \xe2\x80\x94 and it surely would \xe2\x80\x94 that some of her surrogates even suggested that it would be a more valuable change than an African-American president. Mrs. Clinton managed to energize the women\xe2\x80\x99s vote in New Hampshire to win the contest, but the Democratic Party should be celebrating its full diversity, a refreshing and notable difference from the field of Republican contenders.'b'In Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s zeal to make the case that experience (hers) is more important than inspirational leadership (Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s), she made some peculiar comments about the relative importance of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and President Lyndon Johnson to the civil rights cause. She complimented Dr. King\xe2\x80\x99s soaring rhetoric, but said: \xe2\x80\x9cDr. King\xe2\x80\x99s dream began to be realized when President Lyndon Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. ... It took a president to get it done. \xe2\x80\x9d'b'Why Mrs. Clinton would compare herself to Mr. Johnson, who escalated the war in Vietnam into a generational disaster, was baffling enough. It was hard to escape the distasteful implication that a black man needed the help of a white man to effect change. She pulled herself back from the brink by later talking about the mistreatment and danger Dr. King faced. Former President Bill Clinton, who seems to forget he is not the one running, hurled himself over the edge on Monday with a bizarre and rambling attack on Mr. Obama.'b'Mr. Clinton has generally been a statesman as ex-president, and keeping up this sort of behavior will undermine his credibility and ability to do more good.'b'We understand, and usually admire, Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s determination. Allowing her team\xe2\x80\x99s wearyingly familiar strong-arm instincts to take over would be damaging for the Democrats in the fall, no matter who gets the nomination. Polls in Iowa and New Hampshire show that Democratic voters liked all of their candidates \xe2\x80\x94 they simply chose one. It would be a mistake for a politician whose unfavorable ratings across the nation have long been stuck in the 40 percent range to erase that good feeling about her party.'b'In 2000, after Mr. McCain beat George W. Bush in New Hampshire, the Republican Party\xe2\x80\x99s right wing savaged the Arizona senator and his family during the South Carolina primary. It was the nation\xe2\x80\x99s first taste of the politics of division practiced by Mr. Bush and Karl Rove that became the guiding principle of Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s presidency: winning justifies denying any role to the losers \xe2\x80\x94 even dissenting Republicans.'b'This year the Republicans have joined the Democrats in the chorus of change, and American voters have a right to expect it. The Republicans have not held back from criticizing each other, but not with the ferocity or the small-mindedness perfected by Mr. Rove. Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, ran a negative campaign, and he lost in his neighboring state.'b'Mr. McCain, despite some pandering, is still not the choice of social conservatives or religious conservatives. As with the Democrats, however, Republicans have done well with voters by talking about leading all Americans.'b'That is not to say theirs has been an uplifting campaign. The Republicans happily accuse the Democrats of advocating socialized medicine, which anyone who has listened to them knows is nonsense. Rudolph Giuliani has built his entire bid for the White House feeding fears of terrorism. But Mr. McCain, Mike Huckabee and even Mr. Romney talk about how disillusioned Americans are with Washington and about their intent to unite the country.'b'Americans have had seven painful and disillusioning years. The last thing they want is for either party to drag out the old playbooks of division and anger. We doubt now whether Mr. Bush ever intended to deliver on his 2000 pledge to unite, not divide. Americans still want, and deserve, a leader who will fulfill that promise.'b'Washington'b'THE relative calm that America\xe2\x80\x99s armed forces have imposed on Iraq is certainly grounds for cautious optimism. But it also raises some obvious questions: how was it achieved and what does it mean for future defense planning?'b'Many analysts understandably attribute the success to our troops\xe2\x80\x99 following the dictums of the Army\xe2\x80\x99s lauded new counterinsurgency manual. While the manual is a vast improvement over its predecessors, it would be a huge mistake to take it as proof \xe2\x80\x94 as some in the press, academia and independent policy organizations have \xe2\x80\x94 that victory over insurgents is achievable by anything other than traditional military force.'b'Unfortunately, starry-eyed enthusiasts have misread the manual to say that defeating an insurgency is all about winning hearts and minds with teams of anthropologists, propagandists and civil-affairs officers armed with democracy-in-a-box kits and volleyball nets. They dismiss as pass\xc3\xa9 killing or capturing insurgents.'b'Actually, the reality is quite different. The lesson of Iraq is that old-fashioned force works. Add 30,000 of the world\xe2\x80\x99s finest infantry to the 135,000 battle-hardened troops already there, as we have done, and the outnumbered insurgency is in serious trouble. Detain thousands more Iraqis as security threats, and the potential for violence inevitably declines. Press reports indicate that the number of Iraqis in prison doubled over the last year, to 30,000 from 15,000; and while casualty figures are sketchy, military officials told USA Today last September that the number of insurgents killed was already 25 percent higher in 2007 than in all of 2006.'b'And while the new counterinsurgency doctrine has an anti-technology flavor that seems to discourage the use of air power especially, savvy ground-force commanders in Iraq got the right results last year by discounting those admonitions. Few Americans are likely to be aware that there was a fivefold increase in airstrikes during 2007 as compared with the previous year, which went hand in hand with the rest of the surge strategy. Going high-tech once again proved to be highly successful.'b'Regrettably, two other uncomfortable developments also helped suppress violence. First, the Iraqi population has largely segregated itself into sectarian fiefs. Second, supposedly \xe2\x80\x9creformed\xe2\x80\x9d insurgents now dominate Anbar Province. While these Sunni partisans have for the moment sided with the United States, can we assume they\xe2\x80\x99ve bought into the idea of a truly pluralistic and democratic Iraq?'b'Nonetheless, fans of the counterinsurgency manual are using it as a bludgeon against anyone who wants to plan to fight the next war rather than the last one. Their line of thinking holds that our next war will be a replay of Iraq, and thus most of our armed forces should be structured for counterinsurgency.'b'But this ignores other potential threats. Should we simply wish away China\xe2\x80\x99s increasing muscle, or a resurgent Russia\xe2\x80\x99s plans for a fifth-generation fighter that would surpass our top of the line jet, the F-22 stealth fighter? Moreover, does anyone really believe that creating corps of civil affairs officers will deter North Korea or Iran?'b'Yes, there is always the possibility that we may again find ourselves battling an insurgency, and the manual has many great ideas. Furthermore, the proposal for a 20,000-strong adviser corps to help Iraqi local forces fight insurgents ought to be green-lighted.'b'The problem emerges when we consider pouring excessive resources into preparing for only one kind of conflict. Doing so would put us at real risk of losing the technological superiority that has kept America\xe2\x80\x99s vastly more dangerous threats at bay. Consider, for example, that our warplanes are on average more than 25 years old.'b'The enormous cost of the Iraq war, not to mention the loss of life on both sides, would seem to counsel against the idea of a similar operation elsewhere. Looking ahead, America needs a military centered not on occupying another country but on denying potential adversaries the ability to attack our interests. This is not a task for counterinsurgents, but rather for an unapologetically high-tech military that substitutes machines for the bodies of young Americans.'b'DERRY, N.H.'b'When I walked into the office Monday, people were clustering around a computer to watch what they thought they would never see: Hillary Clinton with the unmistakable look of tears in her eyes.'b'A woman gazing at the screen was grimacing, saying it was bad.

Some of us are ready and some of us are not.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There was a poignancy about the moment, seeing Hillary crack with exhaustion from decades of yearning to be the principal rather than the plus-one. But there was a whiff of Nixonian self-pity about her choking up. What was moving her so deeply was her recognition that the country was failing to grasp how much it needs her. In a weirdly narcissistic way, she was crying for us. But it was grimly typical of her that what finally made her break down was the prospect of losing.'b'As Spencer Tracy said to Katharine Hepburn in \xe2\x80\x9cAdam\xe2\x80\x99s Rib,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHere we go again, the old juice. Guaranteed heart melter. A few female tears, stronger than any acid.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Clintons once more wriggled out of a tight spot at the last minute.

All those years in the shadow of one Natural, only to face the prospect of being eclipsed by another Natural?'b'How humiliating to have a moderator of the New Hampshire debate ask her to explain why she was not as popular as the handsome young prince from Chicago. How demeaning to have Obama rather ungraciously chime in: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re likable enough.\xe2\x80\x9d And how exasperating to be pushed into an angry rebuttal when John Edwards played wingman, attacking her on Obama\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI actually have emotions,\xe2\x80\x9d she told CNN\xe2\x80\x99s John Roberts on a damage-control tour. \xe2\x80\x9cI know that there are some people who doubt that.\xe2\x80\x9d She went on \xe2\x80\x9cAccess Hollywood\xe2\x80\x9d to talk about, as the show put it, \xe2\x80\x9cthe double standards that a woman running for president faces.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIf you get too emotional, that undercuts you,\xe2\x80\x9d Hillary said. \xe2\x80\x9cA man can cry; we know that.

Hillary has barely talked to the press throughout her race even though the Clintons this week whined mightily that the press prefers Obama.'b'Bill Clinton, campaigning in Henniker on Monday, also played the poor-little-woman card in a less-than-flattering way. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t make her younger, taller or change her gender,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He was so low-energy at events that it sometimes seemed he was distancing himself from her. Now that she is done with New Hampshire, she may distance herself from him, realizing that seeing Bill so often reminds voters that they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go back to that whole megillah again.'b'Hillary sounded silly trying to paint Obama as a poetic dreamer and herself as a prodigious doer. \xe2\x80\x9cDr. King\xe2\x80\x99s dream began to be realized when President Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Did any living Democrat ever imagine that any other living Democrat would try to win a presidential primary in New Hampshire by comparing herself to L.B.J.? (Who was driven out of politics by Gene McCarthy in New Hampshire.)'b'Her argument against Obama now boils down to an argument against idealism, which is probably the lowest and most unlikely point to which any Clinton could sink. The people from Hope are arguing against hope.'b'At her victory party, Hillary was like the heroine of a Lifetime movie, a woman in peril who manages to triumph. Saying that her heart was full, she sounded the feminist anthem: \xe2\x80\x9cI found my own voice.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Antananarivo, Madagascar'b'THE Peace Corps recently began a laudable initiative to increase the number of volunteers who are 50 and older. As the Peace Corps\xe2\x80\x99 country director in Cameroon from 2002 until last February, I observed how many older volunteers brought something to their service that most young volunteers could not: extensive professional and life experience and the ability to mentor younger volunteers.'b'However, even if the Peace Corps reaches its goal of having 15 percent of its volunteers over 50, the overwhelming majority will remain recently minted college graduates. And too often these young volunteers lack the maturity and professional experience to be effective development workers in the 21st century.'b'This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case in 1961 when the Peace Corps sent its first volunteers overseas. Back then, enthusiastic young Americans offered something that many newly independent nations counted in double and even single digits: college graduates. But today, those same nations have millions of well-educated citizens of their own desperately in need of work. So it\xe2\x80\x99s much less clear what inexperienced Americans have to offer.'b'The Peace Corps has long  shipped out well-meaning young people possessing little more than good intentions and a college diploma. What the agency should begin doing is recruiting only the best of recent graduates \xe2\x80\x94 as the top professional schools do \xe2\x80\x94 and only those older people whose skills and personal characteristics are a solid fit for the needs of the host country.'b'The Peace Corps has resisted doing this for fear that it would cause the number of volunteers to plummet. The name of the game has been getting volunteers into the field, qualified or not.'b'In Cameroon, we had many volunteers sent to serve in the agriculture program whose only experience was puttering around in their mom and dad\xe2\x80\x99s backyard during high school. I wrote to our headquarters in Washington to ask if anyone had considered how an American farmer would feel if a fresh-out-of-college Cameroonian with a liberal arts degree who had occasionally visited Grandma\xe2\x80\x99s cassava plot were sent to Iowa to consult on pig-raising techniques learned in a three-month crash course. I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure the American farmer would see it as a publicity stunt and a bunch of hooey, but I never heard back from headquarters.'b'For the Peace Corps, the number of volunteers  has always trumped the quality of their work, perhaps because the agency fears that an objective assessment of its impact would reveal that while volunteers generate good will for the United States, they do little or nothing to actually aid development in poor countries. The agency has no comprehensive system for self-evaluation, but rather relies heavily on personal anecdote to demonstrate its worth.'b'Every few years, the agency polls its volunteers, but in my experience it does not systematically ask the people it is supposedly helping what they think the volunteers have achieved. This is a clear indication of how the Peace Corps neglects its customers; as long as the volunteers are enjoying themselves, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter whether they improve the quality of life in the host countries. Any well-run organization must know what its customers want and then deliver the goods, but this is something the Peace Corps has never learned.'b'This lack of organizational introspection allows the agency to continue sending, for example,  unqualified volunteers  to teach English when nearly every  developing country could easily find high-caliber English teachers among its  own population. Even after Cameroonian teachers and education officials ranked  English instruction as their lowest priority (after help with computer literacy, math and science, for example), headquarters in Washington continued to send trainees with little or no classroom experience to teach English in Cameroonian schools. One volunteer told me that the only possible reason he could think of for having been selected was that he was a native English speaker.'b'The Peace Corps was born during the glory days of the early Kennedy administration. Since then, its leaders and many of the more than 190,000 volunteers who have served have mythologized the agency into something that can never be questioned or improved. The result is an organization that finds itself less and less able to provide what the people of developing countries need \xe2\x80\x94 at a time when the United States has never had a greater need for their good will.'b'Iran played a reckless and foolish game in the Strait of Hormuz this week that \xe2\x80\x94 except for American restraint \xe2\x80\x94 could have spun lethally out of control.'b'Iranian officials played down Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s incident  in the narrow opening to the Persian Gulf, insisting that the encounter was a \xe2\x80\x9croutine\xe2\x80\x9d attempt by boats operated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to identify American warships. The American version hardly sounds routine: five Iranian speedboats charging within striking distance of the United States Navy warships in international waters, radioed warnings that the American ships would explode, followed by the Iranians\xe2\x80\x99 release into the sea of two white boxlike objects that could have been explosives.'b'On Tuesday, the Pentagon released a recording of the interchange that appears to substantiate Washington\xe2\x80\x99s narrative.'b'It is not clear what game the Iranians were playing or even who was giving the orders. President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to engage Iran diplomatically makes it even harder for American officials to deconstruct Iran\xe2\x80\x99s motives and increases the risk of future miscalculation on both sides.'b'With Mr. Bush on his way to the Middle East this week \xe2\x80\x94 an eight-day trip at least partially aimed at rallying opposition to Iran \xe2\x80\x94 Tehran may have been reminding both the Gulf Arabs and Washington of its capacity to make trouble in a waterway crucial to world oil shipping. The Iranians may also be testing America\xe2\x80\x99s appetite for confrontation after a new intelligence estimate concluded that Iran had halted its secret nuclear weapons program in 2003.'b'Mr. Bush was right to warn the Iranians on Tuesday that they were being dangerously provocative. It is also true that Iran\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors, and the rest of the world, should be very concerned about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s support for terrorism and its continuing nuclear appetites. Mr. Bush \xe2\x80\x94 who just a few months ago was raising the specter of World War III \xe2\x80\x94 also does not have a lot of credibility. He will have a much better chance of making his case on this trip if he follows the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s lead and, at least in public, exercises rhetorical restraint.'b'Iran must also get the message about the risk of future provocations. As the 2000 attack by Al Qaeda on the Navy destroyer Cole proved, American forces must be vigilant about defending themselves. Feints by Iran, or anyone else, to bait America can go dangerously awry. At a minimum, the administration should use this incident to engage Iran in formal talks on conduct in the strait.'b'To the Editor:'b'In \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s Your Consumption Factor?\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Jan. 2), Jared Diamond states that \xe2\x80\x9cper capita consumption rates in China are still about 11 times below ours.\xe2\x80\x9d I would add that while China\xe2\x80\x99s per capita carbon emissions are approaching 20 percent of ours, that pollution is mostly for industrial production that supports consumption in the United States and Europe.'b'Mr. Diamond argues that consumption is not necessarily linked to the quality of lifestyle.

Eliot Spitzer of New York on Wednesday laid out ambitious goals for his second year in office \xe2\x80\x94 all in a new and welcome diplomatic style. The centerpiece is a plan to upgrade the state\xe2\x80\x99s uneven public university system with a $4 billion state endowment and a $3 billion \xe2\x80\x9cinnovation\xe2\x80\x9d fund to encourage academic work that also helps the economy statewide. A public university system truly worthy of New York is certainly long overdue.'b'Governor Spitzer argues, correctly, that stronger universities would create jobs and vital economic communities. If he has his way, New York would someday have flagship schools to rival such big names as Berkeley or Rutgers. In particular, Mr. Spitzer wants to add 2,000 full-time faculty, including at least 250 new, eminent, big-name scholars. Veterans of the higher education battles in New York say that not since Nelson Rockefeller has a governor made so much of higher education and its important connection to a better economy.'b'With the current economy weakening, however, the governor will have to figure out how to pay for all his new priorities, as state revenues slide. In his annual State of the State speech, he suggested somehow leasing the state lottery in order to improve the university system. The idea of encouraging gambling to support learning has always worried us, and there are also concerns about how much of that pot actually makes it to the classroom. The governor\xe2\x80\x99s budget address is in a few weeks, and we hope to hear more then about how he will finance this new plan.'b'Mr. Spitzer\xe2\x80\x99s speech touched on other priorities worth exploring such as expanding health care for the state\xe2\x80\x99s 400,000 children and a $400 million housing fund to help police and teachers. And he has asked Nassau County Executive Thomas Suozzi to wrestle with the issue of controlling property taxes while still funding public schools.'b'Mr. Spitzer, who seemed unbeatable when he came into office, lost plenty of friends and influence in the last year. One reason is that he has tried to reform Albany\xe2\x80\x99s culture of corruption. But he made those challenges even harder with his peremptory style and other missteps. State investigators are determining whether his administration acted illegally by trying to accumulate and then publicize information damaging to the governor\xe2\x80\x99s chief Republican rival, Senate Leader Joseph Bruno.'b'This is also an election year, and Mr. Spitzer has made no secret of his ambition to end the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 and Mr. Bruno\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 longtime control of the Senate. With that political landscape, Mr. Bruno, and the senators who follow his dictates, are unlikely to eagerly embrace anything with the governor\xe2\x80\x99s name on it.'b'Whether for tactical reasons, or because he really wants to try a different approach, Mr. Spitzer was full of praise Wednesday for his political \xe2\x80\x9cpartners\xe2\x80\x9d of both parties. And he acknowledged his own abrasiveness, saying that \xe2\x80\x9csometimes my talk is a little too plain, too direct.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Unfortunately, he barely mentioned the need to reform campaign financing, an ongoing scandal in Albany. Missing altogether was a push for judicial reform or a commission to map election districts fairly. Mr. Spitzer\xe2\x80\x99s new style is a better one, but even a more diplomatic governor should not back away from the fights that really matter.'b'MANCHESTER, N.H.'b'Whatever your politics, people, you have to admit this is one great presidential race. What next? Fred Thompson takes Florida on a sympathy vote from retirees? (They like a leader who\xe2\x80\x99s really, really rested.) John Edwards finds a new emotion for South Carolina? (Anger is so cold weather.) I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone can top Mike Gravel\xe2\x80\x99s speech to the New Hampshire high school students when he told them to avoid alcohol and stick with marijuana. But really, we\xe2\x80\x99re ready for anything.'b'If you\xe2\x80\x99re a fan of democracy, Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s primary victory this week has to be a good thing. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want the whole election decided on the basis of a strange ritual in Iowa that resembles Red Rover with votes, along with the considered opinion of a small state full of idiosyncratic New Englanders. We want a turn! South Dakota wants a turn!'b'The Democratic contest is extremely unusual for an American election in that it contains more than one viable option. Barack Obama turns out to have a positive genius for making moderation sound exciting and is perhaps the only politician in American history who can get a crowd all worked up with a call to politeness. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can disagree without being disagreeable,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in his New Hampshire farewell, drawing a roar of approval.'b'In a country where the spoils go to the loudest shrieker, this is absolutely revolutionary and very important. Most Americans want a moderate government, but nobody has ever before been able to make moderate seem interesting, let alone sexy. (Remember Joseph Lieberman.)'b'On the other side, there\xe2\x80\x99s the new Hillary Clinton, who bears a distinct resemblance to the old Hillary Clinton. \xe2\x80\x9cOver the last week I listened to you, and in the process I found my own voice,\xe2\x80\x9d she told her victory party Tuesday night. She then went on to give an extremely boring speech that began: \xe2\x80\x9cThis campaign is about people.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Clinton actually seems most genuine when she\xe2\x80\x99s being dull. She\xe2\x80\x99s gone back to talking about policy with voters. That\xe2\x80\x99s just the way she saved her first Senate campaign by disappearing into the depths of upstate New York for an endless listening tour that drove reporters mad with tedium but seemed to make the citizens very happy.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFinding common ground and working to make change has been the cause of my life,\xe2\x80\x9d she told a crowd in Hampton, N.H., lifting Obama\xe2\x80\x99s theme. She is a shameless borrower of other candidates\xe2\x80\x99 good stuff. She\xe2\x80\x99s even cribbed Barack\xe2\x80\x99s signature \xe2\x80\x9cfired up\xe2\x80\x9d line on occasion, and it\xe2\x80\x99s probably only a matter of time before she announces the sudden discovery of long-lost Kenyan relatives.'b'But when she started answering questions, she got very Hillary \xe2\x80\x94 talking about carbon neutrality and H.M.O. payments and procurement reform, ticking off her five-point plans and three-part explanations. The large crowd, which had been standing in a high school gym for nearly two hours before she arrived, seemed to enjoy it. Her bond with the people isn\xe2\x80\x99t a passionate one, but when it works, it\xe2\x80\x99s a genuine connection that starts with the belief that she will work really, really hard on their behalf.'b'Everybody is going to have a story about why the gender gap erupted in New Hampshire, why female voters rallied to Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s side after the horrendous week when she lost Iowa, was cornered in the weekend debate, told that she was unlikable on national television, and then teared up when a sympathetic voter asked her how she held up under it all. Do women Obama\xe2\x80\x99s age look at him and see the popular boy who never talked to them in high school? Did they relate to Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s strategy of constantly reminding her audiences that she\xe2\x80\x99s been working for reform for 35 years? Barack\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be able to top that unless he can prove he was an agent of change in elementary school.'b'My own favorite theory is that this week, Hillary was a stand-in for every woman who\xe2\x80\x99s overdosed on multitasking. They grabbed at the opportunity to have kids/go back to school/start a business/become a lawyer. But there are days when they can\xe2\x80\x99t meet everybody\xe2\x80\x99s needs and the men in their lives  \xe2\x80\x94  loved ones and otherwise  \xe2\x80\x94  make them feel like failures or towers of self-involvement. And the deal is that they can either suck it up or look like a baby.'b'The women whose heart went out to Hillary knew that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t rational. She asked for this race, and if she was exhausted, the other candidates were, too. (John McCain is 71 and tired and nobody felt sorry for him.) The front-runner always gets ganged up on in debates. If her campaign was in shambles, it was her job to fix it or take the consequences. But for one moment, women knew just how Hillary felt, and they gave her a sympathy vote. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a long-term commitment, just a brief strike by the sisters against their overscheduled world.'b'Or it could just have been a better get-out-the-vote operation.'b'A Texas judge was so delighted last week to free a wrongly convicted inmate \xe2\x80\x94 after 27 years in prison \xe2\x80\x94 that the judge bought him a steak dinner and taught him how to use a cellphone to spread the news. The fact that this happened in Texas, famous for its draconian criminal punishments, was heartening. Most heartening of all was that Dallas County, where it occurred, is turning into a model for the rest of the nation in preserving potentially exonerating evidence in capital cases.'b'There are more than two million inmates in American prisons and jails, and some studies estimate that as many as 5 percent may be innocent. There are few procedures in place, however, for the wrongly convicted to put forth evidence to exonerate themselves.'b'The Texas inmate, Charles Chatman, who was serving 99 years for rape, was fortunate that Dallas County has saved many specimens. When the specimen in his case, a swab taken from the rape victim, was tested, Mr. Chatman\xe2\x80\x99s DNA did not match. He became the 15th prisoner to be exonerated in Dallas County since 2001 and one of more than 200 inmates nationally freed from prison through the pioneering use of DNA by the Innocence Project, a nonprofit legal group.'b'While DNA evidence has captured the popular imagination, Mr. Chatman\xe2\x80\x99s story \xe2\x80\x94 and that of many postconviction exonerations \xe2\x80\x94 is also in large part about eyewitness misidentification, the most common factor in wrongful convictions. The Innocence Project has proposed some important reforms that states should use in upgrading their criminal justice system. These include improvements in the use of eyewitness testimony and electronic recording of interrogations.'b'Better oversight and funding of crime labs is also crucial, along with creation of innocence commissions to manage claims of wrongful conviction. A groundbreaking federal law now grants federal inmates access to DNA testing. Most states and localities are lagging in doing this, and in properly preserving evidence.'b'Finally, for all the instant joy, most of the exonerated are never compensated for their lost lifetime. Society owes those who wrongly spend years in prison more than a steak dinner and cheering courtroom.'b'The American economy is weakening fast, and some prominent economists are saying a recession is already here. The Federal Reserve, with its prodigious lending capacity and power to cut interest rates, could yet save the day. But with prices, and fears of inflation, also rising, the Fed has less room to maneuver.'b'That is why it is imperative that President Bush and Congressional leaders begin a serious discussion about how to help revive the economy, if need be, with a short-term stimulus package.'b'President Bush has suggested that permanent tax cuts (his longtime goal and a favorite of nearly all the Republican presidential candidates) are his fix of choice. But those tax cuts would take effect in 2011, doing nothing for today\xe2\x80\x99s economic woes.'b'Democrats are broaching more sensible measures, like bolstered spending for unemployment compensation and food stamps and direct aid to states. They should consider adding the idea of a targeted tax rebate. A one-shot rebate would be another way to stimulate the economy \xe2\x80\x94 and could draw the tax-phobic White House into a constructive discussion.'b'If ever there was a time not to let ideology drive economic policy, it is now. More than a million people stand to lose their homes over the next two years. Some 10 million families stand to lose all of their home equity. Inflation is wiping out wage gains, while pushing up prices for food and gasoline. Job growth has stalled and unemployment is rising.'b'If conditions deteriorate even further, the White House and Congress would need to act quickly. That means they need to start talking now, before things turn grave, about how they would supplement the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s efforts with specific temporary boosts.'b'In the meantime, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has tough calls to make. Wall Street is insisting that lower rates are necessary, despite inflationary pressures, because recession is a more urgent threat than rising prices. There\xe2\x80\x99s truth to that. Yet even if the Fed slashed rates, there\xe2\x80\x99s no guarantee of a big rebound. Lower interest rates could cause the dollar to weaken further. A weaker dollar correlates to higher oil prices, which in turn, would blunt the  ability of lower rates to stimulate a lagging economy.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot riding on Mr. Bernanke\xe2\x80\x99s judgment. But the White House and Congress also must start preparing to step in if Mr. Bernanke and the Fed can\xe2\x80\x99t turn the economy around. One issue they must agree on: any fiscal stimulus legislation should be targeted and temporary.'b'Economic history is clear that stimulus measures that are effective in the short run tend to backfire if they go on too long. They become unaffordable, and that is bad for growth. The economy\xe2\x80\x99s challenges are formidable enough, without creating any more problems.'b'CAMPOS, Brazil'b'Near what remains of the first sugar factory in Brazil, built in 1877 with a sign in Latin over the entrance that translates as \xe2\x80\x9cSweet is the Reward of Work,\xe2\x80\x9d Danuza Gomes da Silva swings a glinting knife as she makes her way down the length of a field cutting cane.'b'She bends to slice the sticks of young cane dropped by other workers from the top of a truck. Again and again she straightens. A band of 12 laborers like hers plants about 10 acres a day. Sugar cane buds easily from the plowed furrows, and it grows fast. But the work associated with it is hard.'b'Danuza, round-faced and soft-eyed, makes between $8 and $13 a day depending on her productivity. At 35, she has four young children. Only 20 percent of the 7.5 million acres planted with sugar cane in Brazil is mechanized. The rest depends on manual labor like hers.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose my job,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, a smile on her face, the oversized cleaver in her hand.'b'Machines that plant and harvest are slowly spreading across the expanse of Brazilian cane fields. But Danuza\xe2\x80\x99s harsh existence is a reminder that behind the global buzz over Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s cane-based ethanol production  \xe2\x80\x94  the 21st century\xe2\x80\x99s environment-friendly biofuel par excellence \xe2\x80\x94 lurk enduring social problems.'b'Ethanol, renewable and relatively clean, is lovely. The life of the migrant Brazilian rural worker, finite and hot, is not.'b'Seldom has a country seen an image makeover quite as radical as Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s in recent years. From the unserious land of samba, slums, soccer and smoking rain forests, it has become the realm of ahead-of-the-curve ethanol production, flex-fuel cars running on any combination of ethanol and gasoline, and a biofuel revolution that could deliver the world from $100-a-barrel oil.'b'Where the world once saw Pel\xc3\xa9 and poverty, it now sees prescience: a country where 80 percent of new cars run on ethanol or gasoline, all gasoline contains close to 25 percent ethanol, and ethanol accounts for more than 40 percent of fuel consumption.'b'These numbers reveal new U.S. targets that might replace about one-sixth of gasoline consumption with ethanol by 2020 for what they are: belated and meager.'b'Brazil, in other words, was busy seeing tomorrow while America viewed it as mired in the past, a place too frivolous to be futuristic.'b'In fact, both images hold some truth. Brazil has led the way in demonstrating the potential of ethanol, has the land to expand the industry, uses sugar-based ethanol whose yield per hectare is eight times that of U.S. corn ethanol being developed at the cost of higher food prices and has shown the feasibility of a flex-fuel auto fleet.'b'But a day spent visiting cane production facilities of CBAA, a sugar and ethanol manufacturer, revealed the hardship from which these achievements were wrested.'b'A cane field opposite an area overrun by landless peasants had been burnt in an act of arson. A man searched forlornly for a horse he\xe2\x80\x99d illegally left to feed in the cane plantations and then lost. Outside a makeshift dormitory for migrant workers, men were slumped under clothes hung to dry.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe social situation is complicated,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arist\xc3\xb3teles Ramos Cardoso, the director of a local CBAA sugar and ethanol factory. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re near the city. We need labor. There\xe2\x80\x99s no shortage of criminals.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If the vast potential of sugar cane ethanol is to be realized, in Brazil as in poor African countries, its development must come in ordered ways that allow the likes of Danuza and her children to benefit. A new fuel should not carry oil\xe2\x80\x99s frequent curse: the enrichment of a narrow elite.'b'This will depend on several things: the labor standards adopted by the growing hordes of international investors drawn to ethanol; the opening up of the global trading system to this biofuel that many poor tropical countries will be able to produce; and the development of a global traded commodity market in ethanol with established norms.'b'Without such standards, development will stall. So will social progress.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe United States could really generate wealth for those who need it, while freeing itself from oil dependence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jos\xc3\xa9 Pessoa, the chief executive of CBAA. \xe2\x80\x9cIt should be buying my ethanol rather than imposing tariffs on it. It should be helping to develop the sugar-cane industry in Africa. This would be the intelligent way and best for the environment.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Pessoa is right. America must do its part, not least by freeing up its ethanol and sugar markets to imports. So must Brazil, by seeing a 35-year-old woman in the sun with children in need of education, and all the myriad people like them, through the billowing CO2-lite clouds of ethanol euphoria.'b'\xc2\x95'b'Blog: 'b'www.iht.com/passages'b'.'b'For 30 years, Philippe de Montebello has been the edifice within the edifice of the Metropolitan Museum of Art \xe2\x80\x94 as iconic, in his own way, as the museum\xe2\x80\x99s Fifth Avenue facade. He has announced that he will retire at the end of the year, but it is almost easier to think of him as an antiquity \xe2\x80\x94 and I mean this only sculpturally \xe2\x80\x94 being restored to the country of his origin. He must have come to us from private life, and to private life he will return, though it is hard to imagine him or the Met without each other as a backdrop.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s usual to see a nimbus of adjectives whenever Mr. de Montebello is described, words like \xe2\x80\x9cpatrician\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cimperious\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cold world.\xe2\x80\x9d Those words say somewhat less about his personal and institutional manner than they do about a chronic American anxiety over the largely non-American cultural richness embodied in the Metropolitan Museum\xe2\x80\x99s collections. It is really a historic uneasiness for Americans \xe2\x80\x94 we see ourselves as a new departure rather than as part of the diverse and ancient continuum that Mr. de Montebello so elegantly championed.'b'Finding the right language to explain the importance of acquiring, preserving and exhibiting great works of art is rarely easy \xe2\x80\x94  even for great curators and art historians. Mr. de Montebello was born to that language, but he has also tuned his ear studiously to the breadth of his audience.'b'He has done a remarkable job of expanding and refurbishing the Met\xe2\x80\x99s galleries. He has done an even more remarkable job of speaking for the works it displays \xe2\x80\x94  in interviews, speeches and on the museum\xe2\x80\x99s audio tour guides.'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean just his rolling sentences \xe2\x80\x94 as characteristic as the jut of his chin and the knot of his tie \xe2\x80\x94 but the candor and assurance of that voice, the recognition that the values you take for granted are often the hardest to explain, if only because they seem to require no explanation at all.'b'Washington'b'THE failure of the New Hampshire pre-election surveys to mirror the outcome of the Democratic race is one of the most significant miscues in modern polling history. All the published polls, including those that surveyed through Monday, had Senator Barack Obama comfortably ahead with an average margin of more than 8 percent. These same polls showed no signs that Senator Hillary Clinton might close that gap, let alone win.'b'While it will take time for those who conducted the New Hampshire tracking polls to undertake rigorous analyses of their surveys, a number of things are immediately apparent.'b'First, the problem was not a general failure of polling methodology. These same pollsters did a superb job on the Republican side. Senator John McCain won by 5.5 percent. The last wave of polls found a margin of 5.3 percent. So whatever the problem was, it was specific to Mrs. Clinton versus Mr. Obama.'b'Second, the inaccuracies don\xe2\x80\x99t seem related to the subtleties of polling methods. The pollsters who overestimated Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s margin ranged from CBS and Gallup (who have the most rigorous voter screens and sampling designs, and have sterling records in presidential elections) to local and computerized polling operations, whose methods are a good deal less refined. Everyone got it wrong.'b'Third, the mistakes were not the result of a last-minute trend going Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s way. Yes, according to exit polls the 17 percent of voters who said they made their decision on Election Day chose Mrs. Clinton a little more than those who decided in the past two or three weeks. But the margin was very small \xe2\x80\x94 39 percent of the late deciders went for Mrs. Clinton and 36 percent went for Mr. Obama. This gap is obviously too narrow to explain the wide lead for Mr. Obama that kept showing up in pre-election polls.'b'Fourth, some have argued that the unusually high turnout may have caused a problem for the pollsters. It\xe2\x80\x99s possible, but unlikely. While participation was higher than in past New Hampshire primaries, the demographic and political profile of the vote remains largely unchanged. In particular, the mix of Democrats to independents \xe2\x80\x94 54 percent to 44 percent respectively \xe2\x80\x94 is close to what it was in 2000, the most recent New Hampshire primary without an incumbent in the race.'b'To my mind all these factors deserve further study. But another possible explanation cannot be ignored \xe2\x80\x94 the longstanding pattern of pre-election polls overstating support for black candidates among white voters, particularly white voters who are poor.'b'In exploring this factor, it is useful to look closely at the nature of the constituencies for the two candidates in New Hampshire, which were divided along socio-economic lines.'b'Mrs. Clinton beat Mr. Obama by 12 points (47 percent to 35 percent) among those with family incomes below $50,000. By contrast, Mr. Obama beat Mrs. Clinton by five points (40 percent to 35 percent) among those earning more than $50,000.'b'There was an education gap, too. College graduates voted for Mr. Obama 39 percent to 34 percent; Mrs. Clinton won among those who had never attended college, 43 percent to 35 percent.'b'Of course these are not the only patterns in Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s support in New Hampshire. Women rallied to her (something they did not do in Iowa), while men leaned to Mr. Obama. Mrs. Clinton also got stronger support from older voters, while Mr. Obama pulled in more support among younger voters. But gender and age patterns tend not to be as confounding to pollsters as race, which to my mind was a key reason the polls got New Hampshire so wrong.'b'Poorer, less well-educated white people refuse surveys more often than affluent, better-educated whites. Polls generally adjust their samples for this tendency. But here\xe2\x80\x99s the problem: these whites who do not respond to surveys tend to have more unfavorable views of blacks than respondents who do the interviews.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced this myself. In 1989, as a Gallup pollster, I overestimated the support for David Dinkins in his first race for New York City mayor against Rudolph Giuliani; Mr. Dinkins was elected, but with a two percentage point margin of victory, not the 15 I had predicted. I concluded, eventually, that I got it wrong not so much because respondents were lying to our interviewers but because poorer, less well-educated voters were less likely to agree to answer our questions. That was a decisive factor in my miscall.'b'Certainly, we live in a different world today. The Pew Research Center has conducted analyses of elections between candidates of different races in 2006 and found that polls now do a much better job estimating the support for black candidates than they did in the past. However, the difficulties in interviewing the poor and the less well-educated persist.'b'Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t this problem come up in Iowa? My guess is that Mr. Obama may have posed less of a threat to white voters in Iowa because he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet the front-runner. Caucuses are also plainly different from primaries.'b'In New Hampshire, the ballots are still warm, so it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to pinpoint the exact cause for the primary poll flop. But given the dearth of obvious explanations, serious consideration has to be given to the difficulties that race and class present to survey methodology.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cPut Buyers First?

I have benefited from such service from Amazon a number of times. But I found his dig at Apple to be off-base and unnecessary. My experiences with Apple (there have been many) have been exemplary in every way.'b'Roland Valliere'b'\nKansas City, Mo., Jan. 7, 2008'b''b'In 1974, a group of economists and journalists got together in a bar and launched supply-side economics. It was a superb political and economic package. It addressed a big problem: stagflation. It had a clear policy focus: marginal tax rates. It celebrated a certain sort of personality: the risk-taking entrepreneur. It made it clear that the new, growth-oriented Republican Party would be different from the old, green-eyeshade one.'b'Supply-side economics had a good run, but continual tax cuts can no longer be the centerpiece of Republican economic policy. The demographics have changed. The U.S. is an aging society. We have made expensive promises to our seniors. We can\xe2\x80\x99t keep those promises at the current tax levels, let alone at reduced ones. As David Frum writes in \xe2\x80\x9cComeback,\xe2\x80\x9d his indispensable new book: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the face of such a huge fiscal gap, the days of broad, across-the-board, middle-class tax cutting are over.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The political situation has changed, too. Republicans used to appeal to the investor class with economic policies and the working class with values, crime and welfare policies. But that formula has broken down. The workers are walking away from the G.O.P., and the only way to win them back is by listening to their economic concerns.'b'As a result, smart Republicans are groping for a new economic model, and as they do, Republican economic policies are shifting. The entrepreneur is no longer king. The wage-earner is king. As the presidential campaign rolls into Michigan, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that Republicans are adjusting their priorities to win back the anxious middle class.'b'The Republicans who are reaching toward this new model still sound very different from Democrats. They never describe American workers as victims. They never describe globalization as a remorselessly punishing process. They argue that individuals can still control their own destinies, provided they work hard and get educated. They believe it would be a catastrophe if the U.S. abandoned free trade or adopted a European-style safety net and suffered European tax rates.'b'But they envision a different role for government than the 1980s Republicans. \xe2\x80\x9cAmericans aren\xe2\x80\x99t afraid of competing in a global economy,\xe2\x80\x9d says Douglas Holtz-Eakin, John McCain\xe2\x80\x99s economic adviser, \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re afraid they\xe2\x80\x99re doing it by themselves. They want a government that is on their side.\xe2\x80\x9d In this new model, government is sort of like Vince Lombardi, setting a context that allows individuals and families to compete.'b'There are four main spheres of policy innovation. First, a human capital agenda. The U.S. needs a more skilled work force, but for the first time in our history it is getting a generation no better educated than its parents.'b'To remedy this, Ramesh Ponnuru of The National Review proposes an increased child tax credit to reduce the stress on young families, the seedbed of human capital. Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina proposes tuition tax credits for families earning less than $75,000. The G.O.P. presidential candidates vow to spend more on scientific research and to take on special interests like the teachers\xe2\x80\x99 unions. If schools can\xe2\x80\x99t fire bad teachers and reward good ones, then nothing else we do to improve education will do any good.'b'Second, Republicans have embraced health care reform. While Democrats emphasize the uninsured, Republicans emphasize cost control. They understand that it\xe2\x80\x99s not a question of protecting health markets from government takeover. Government already controls and distorts health care. It\xe2\x80\x99s a question of straightening out the system so that it is clear who is paying and for what.'b'Mitt Romney supports private insurance enforced by a universal mandate. McCain talks about paying for outcomes rather than tests to cut down on unnecessary procedures. Mike Huckabee promotes an activist agenda to reduce obesity and prevent chronic illness.'b'Third, Republicans are putting together pieces of what you might call a resiliency agenda to help families withstand setbacks. McCain would subsidize the wages of workers who were laid off and forced to take lower-paying jobs. President Bush has proposed $3,500 personal re-employment accounts. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama supports $1,000 at-birth savings accounts, so that every American has assets to fall back on. Romney has a plan to aggressively increase savings, and Fred Thompson proposes a federal 401(k).'b'Finally, Republicans are shifting their emphasis from tax cutting to fiscal rectitude. McCain, Huckabee and Thompson emphasize spending control and dealing with the monumental problem of entitlements. Middle-class workers don\xe2\x80\x99t worry so much about investment incentives. They worry that their government is fiscally decadent and fundamentally irresponsible.'b'This spring Ross Douthat and Reihan Salam will publish \xe2\x80\x9cGrand New Party,\xe2\x80\x9d a book about efforts to win back the so-called Sam\xe2\x80\x99s Club Republicans.

Virginia Giordano'b'New York, Jan. 10, 2008'b'\xc2\x95'b'To the Editor:'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m dismayed to see women voters choose Hillary Rodham Clinton because of a desire to break through \xe2\x80\x9cthe highest and hardest glass ceiling.\xe2\x80\x9d If you wish to use your vote to counter inequality (and I\xe2\x80\x99m not advocating this), then surely you must recognize that this is an opportunity for Barack Obama to break the same glass ceiling. You must also recognize that slavery was a greater injustice than disparate treatment of women.'b'Until Senator Clinton played the gender card at several opportunities after Iowa, this race had been so beautifully run above-board, with two viable candidates duking it out on their merits, with little or no subtext of \xe2\x80\x9cmy class is more oppressed than your class.\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see the voters demand that we get back to this fight.

Feminism has long held that it\xe2\x80\x99s not right for a man to be hired, admitted to college or elected just because he\xe2\x80\x99s a man. So why should feminists vote for Mrs. Clinton just because she\xe2\x80\x99s a woman?'b'If we want people to be judged on their own merits, we have to start with our own choices.  Caroline Abels'b'Boston, Jan. 10, 2008'b'\xc2\x95'b'To the Editor:'b'Misogyny is not simply a cultural phenomenon; it\xe2\x80\x99s also a political tool. The cult of hatred the right wing has created with regard to Hillary Rodham Clinton is in direct proportion to the substantial threat she poses at the ballot box. Case in point: calling her proposal for universal health care coverage \xe2\x80\x9cHillary care\xe2\x80\x9d shifts the focus from the policy\xe2\x80\x99s merits to her character, which has been smeared relentlessly for so many years.'b'Surprisingly, Senator Clinton is quite popular here in conservative upstate New York, where talk radio, which dominates the AM dial, demonizes her incessantly. Apparently, this outpouring of Clinton hatred has offended many women and more than a few men in these rural parts, and that is a hopeful sign.'b'Michael Blaine'b'Jefferson, N.Y., Jan. 10, 2008'b'\xc2\x95'b'To the Editor:'b'Thank you for publishing Andrew Kohut\xe2\x80\x99s excellent commentary on why the polls predicted an Obama victory in New Hampshire (\xe2\x80\x9cGetting It Wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d Op-Ed, Jan. 10). If he is right that the biggest reason may have been that \xe2\x80\x9cless well-educated white people\xe2\x80\x9d  who \xe2\x80\x9cdo not respond to surveys tend to have more unfavorable views of blacks than respondents who do the interviews,\xe2\x80\x9d  this has very serious implications for the future of telephone polling.'b'Refusal rates in phone surveys have been increasing remorselessly for 30 years. For a long time we have been worried that lower response rates would bias our telephone poll results, with the near certainty that they would eventually do so. New Hampshire may be a sign that tougher times lie ahead for pollsters.  Humphrey Taylor'b'Chairman, The Harris Poll'b'Harris Interactive'b'New York, Jan. 10, 2008'b'\xc2\x95'b'To the Editor:'b'Andrew Kohut is correct that the failure of pollsters to predict Hillary  Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s win in New Hampshire lies not in a failure in methodology but in the fact that different kinds of people agree to answer pollsters\xe2\x80\x99 questions. He is probably correct that these \xe2\x80\x9cmissed\xe2\x80\x9d people are largely lower income, less educated whites. He then concludes that untapped white responders don\xe2\x80\x99t favor blacks? Why assume anything? In this instance, perhaps working-class people don\xe2\x80\x99t favor men! Perhaps they know the real deal when they see it. Perhaps they love Barack Obama and they think that Mrs. Clinton has \xe2\x80\x9cgrit\xe2\x80\x9d like them.'b'This week we  saw a woman pressed smack up against the glass ceiling with the prospect of drowning in a sea of bias. Mr. Kohut should go back to the drawing board.  Nancy F. McKenzie'b'Brooklyn, Jan. 10, 2008'b'Laikipia, 'b'Kenya'b''b'AS I write this, the crackle of gunfire is audible from the veranda of our farmhouse. Warriors of the Pokot and Samburu tribes are fighting a mile away. A bush fire engulfs the horizon. I hear the tally in blood so far is three Samburu warriors killed, while the Pokot have rustled 750 of their cattle.'b'Today I hope our farm and its workers will be spared the violence. But this was not the case two weeks ago on Boxing Day, the eve of Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s elections, when Samburu rustlers armed with AK-47\xe2\x80\x99s made off with 22 steers. The police were unable to respond, as they had to guard ballot boxes. So our neighbor Charles saved our cattle by charging his car at the raiders in a hail of bullets, which forced them to cut and run.'b'The world knows of Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s vote-rigging scandal \xe2\x80\x94 of the rioting in Nairobi; the police assaults on the supporters of the opposition leader, 'b'Raila Odinga'b'; the pogroms against traders and farmers of President 'b'Mwai Kibaki'b'\xe2\x80\x99s Kikuyu tribe. But we\xe2\x80\x99ve watched it unfold in real time in our corner of central Kenya.'b'When the Kikuyus fled the village up the road from us, local food supplies quickly dried up, hunger set in among the mob and rioting flared again. Then a Samburu witch doctor announced that it was time for his warriors, supporters of Mr. Odinga, to advance on the Pokot tribesmen, who had backed Mr. Kibaki. He said he had found a way to turn Pokot bullets into rain \xe2\x80\x94 a promise that evidently precipitated the clashes erupting around me.'b'Over the last two weeks, we\xe2\x80\x99ve stuck to our daily routines, as if it somehow might make the nightmare of what was unfolding over the horizon recede. Still, I devised an evacuation plan for our workers who were from the \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d tribes. We dug up the lawn to plant extra vegetables, not knowing how much livestock we\xe2\x80\x99ll have down the road.'b'Still, and despite all the talk of another Rwanda, I think Kenya will pull back from the brink. This is mainly thanks to the basic decency of ordinary Kenyans \xe2\x80\x94 whose priorities are to work hard, educate their children, fear God and enjoy a few Tusker beers.'b'Nobody wants to believe Kenya is a typical African basket case. Nor is anybody banking on the swift intervention of the world community: not from Washington, with its string of disastrous foreign policies, or the African Union, which has had unmitigated diplomatic failures in Darfur and Somalia. Kenyans know only they themselves can prevent fresh chaos. Despite all the claims and counterclaims among the candidates, ordinary citizens also know the entire class of Kenyan political leaders is to blame. The African saying that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen elephants fight, the grass suffers\xe2\x80\x9d applies tragically. Kenyan politicians are paid more money than many of their counterparts in the West \xe2\x80\x94 though they rarely bother to turn up at Parliament.'b'Kenyan democracy has failed because ordinary people were encouraged to believe that the process in and of itself could bring change. So Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s leaders \xe2\x80\x94 and often international observers \xe2\x80\x94 interpret democracy simply in terms of the ceremony of multiparty elections. Polls bestow legitimacy on politicians to pillage for five years until the next depressing cycle begins.'b'In the campaign rallies I attended, I saw no debate about policies, despite the country\xe2\x80\x99s immense health, education, crime and poverty problems. The Big Men arrived by helicopter to address the voters in slums and forest clearings. When they spoke English for the Western news media\xe2\x80\x99s benefit, they talked of human rights and democracy. But when they switched to local languages, it was pure venom and ethnic chauvinism. Praise-singers kowtowed to the candidates, who dozed, talked on their mobile phones and then waddled back to their helicopters, which blew dust into the faces of the poor on takeoff.'b'Mr. Odinga campaigned on a policy of federal decentralization known as majimboism. On paper, devolution of power in an African nation led by corrupt politicians seems to make sense. But on a local level, majimboism is interpreted another way: without functioning national institutions, decentralization becomes synonymous with mob rule. A few months ago a drunken power broker in a village wagged his finger and declared that after the elections all \xe2\x80\x9coutsiders\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 meaning Kikuyus and whites \xe2\x80\x94 would be kicked out and their farms taken.'b'In any case, we can be certain that the violence will simply worsen the poverty that is itself the root cause of all Kenyan crises. Already we are seeing layoffs and a potential collapse of the tourism and agricultural industries. On the political front, perhaps the best we can hope is that Big Men will reach a deal and the tribes will put away their machetes and rifles. Then the Western press will trickle home, content that democracy has been re-established, while the people of Laikipia return to their daily struggle to survive.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cBhutto\xe2\x80\x99s Deadly Legacy\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Jan. 4):'b'I agree with William Dalrymple\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan.

These free speech restrictions were especially offensive in 2004 when the Republican National Convention came to town and major antiwar rallies were blocked, supposedly to protect the lawn. Now, to avoid a court battle, Mayor Michael Bloomberg has agreed to take another look at his selective keep-off-the-grass policy.'b'The decision comes years too late, and there are no guarantees that the city will reform its policy. It is a sign of progress, though, that the Bloomberg administration has raised, at least for now, the ridiculously low cap of people who can assemble on the lawn from 50,000 to 75,000. If that temporarily opens the park to more public political expression, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good first step.'b'The city\xe2\x80\x99s agreement with Partnership for Civil Justice, which represents two groups that were denied protest permits, calls for the appointment of a panel of experts who do not work for the city. The experts are supposed to assess the durability of the grass and the stress of crowds, weather and other factors.'b'In the end, the two sides need to come up with a plan to allow robust free speech that also does its best to protect the $18 million makeover of the Great Lawn. The 13-acre expanse is an important urban oasis, and maintaining it is important. It is also, however, the most suitable site for large rallies and concerts in Manhattan.'b'The city, which has raised money for park renovations from wealthy people living nearby, has been treating the Great Lawn more as a private yard than a public space. The New York Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Opera have been welcomed, but music that appeals to New Yorkers with other tastes mostly has not.'b'The city has been particularly resistant to political demonstrations. During the 2004 convention, it relegated some 250,000 demonstrators to the streets for what turned out to be an unsatisfying march. Without a central rallying point and stage, which would have been possible on the Great Lawn, there could be no speeches, just signs carried in a procession. It was a sad spectacle that should not be repeated.'b'Mr. Bloomberg, who has been raising his national profile on issues as varied as gun control and education \xe2\x80\x94 and prompting speculation about an independent presidential run \xe2\x80\x94 should take a strong stand on another issue. The issue is free speech. He should support it.'b'We suppose we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised. Yet another player in the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s break-all-the-rules war against terrorism is trying to evade accountability.'b'Jose A.

The decision to destroy them appears to be a cynical attempt to shield interrogators and their bosses from public and legal scrutiny over what may well have been an illegal act: torture.'b'He has now been summoned to Congress to testify about his decision at a closed hearing on Wednesday.

The Justice Department is also investigating the destruction of the tapes, and Mr. Rodriguez does not want his testimony used against him.'b'We hope the House resists this request. If Mr. Rodriguez refuses to appear, he should be cited for contempt and punished appropriately. It would be his right to exercise his Fifth Amendment protections.

That critical connection has become befogged in years of hyperbolic alarms, official ineptitude, enormous spending and political sleight of hand.'b'So far, terrorism and homeland security have been treated as a melodramatic premise for campaign commercials about atrocities past rather than a way for contenders to plainly say what they\xe2\x80\x99ve learned since 9/11 \xe2\x80\x94  and what needs to be changed.'b'While intelligence specialists dispute where the next likely threats might originate, the government is awash in tens of billions of dollars being spent annually on programs that still fail to deal adequately with such obvious shortcomings as port and chemical plant security. On the stump, the candidates so far offer short shrift. There\xe2\x80\x99s no hint, for example, of what sorts of talent they have mind for the next administration to replace the serial blunderers and patronage hacks that riddle the vast homeland security bureaucracy. Such basic questions are lost in the diversionary din of outsize warnings from Republican candidates about the threat that illegal immigrants supposedly present to domestic security.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s no dearth of amorphous position papers on the Republican candidates\xe2\x80\x99 Web sites, but they barely hint at what\xe2\x80\x99s needed.

Rudy Giuliani, is campaigning as America\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate post-9/11 authority (while not incidentally making money in the private security business). He proposes greater regional and local security powers, but of course makes no mention of the man he pushed for the first homeland security czar, Bernard Kerik, New York\xe2\x80\x99s ex-police commissioner who is now under indictment.'b'The Democrats offer more detail in promising stronger infrastructure defenses.

Well, for one thing, it\xe2\x80\x99s big. The G.D.P. of the European Union is roughly comparable to that of the United States; the euro is almost as important a global currency as the dollar; and the governance of the world financial system is, for practical purposes, equally shared by the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve.'b'But there\xe2\x80\x99s another thing: it\xe2\x80\x99s important to get the facts about Europe\xe2\x80\x99s economy right because the alleged woes of that economy play an important role in American political discourse, usually as an excuse for the insecurities and injustices of our own society.'b'For example, does Hillary Clinton have a plan to cover the millions of Americans who lack health insurance? \xe2\x80\x9cShe takes her inspiration from European bureaucracies,\xe2\x80\x9d sneers Mitt Romney.'b'Or are top U.S. executives grossly overpaid?

In the mid-1970s the Continent entered a prolonged era of sluggish job creation, which contrasted with vigorous employment growth in the United States.'b'And in the 1990s, Europe lagged behind America in the adoption of new technology. For example, in 1997 fewer than 15 percent of French homes contained personal computers and fewer than 1 percent were connected to the Internet.'b'But that was then.'b'Since 2000, employment has actually grown a bit faster in Europe than in the United States  \xe2\x80\x94  and since Europe has a lower rate of population growth, this has translated into a substantial rise in the percentage of working-age Europeans with jobs, even as America\xe2\x80\x99s employment-population ratio has declined.'b'In particular, in the prime working years, from 25 to 54, the big gap between European and U.S. employment rates that existed a decade ago has been largely eliminated. If you think Europe is a place where lots of able-bodied adults just sit at home collecting welfare checks, think again.'b'Meanwhile, Europe\xe2\x80\x99s Internet lag is a thing of the past. The dial-up Internet of the 1990s was dominated by the United States. But as dial-up has given way to broadband, Europe has more than kept up.

Spicer, president and chief executive of Saint Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s Medical Center.'b'Emily Simpson 'b'\nYonkers, Jan. 6, 2008'b''b'What did Martin Tankleff look and sound like when he confessed in 1988 to bludgeoning and slashing his parents to death? Did he seem like a killer or a confused 17-year-old being pressured into admitting something that he did not do? We\xe2\x80\x99ll never know. There is no video or audio recording, just an incomplete narrative, handwritten by detectives, which Mr. Tankleff signed, quickly repudiated, and spent nearly two decades trying to undo.'b'Mr. Tankleff, now 36, was released from prison this month after a New York State appeals court overturned his murder conviction, ruling that new evidence would likely have led the jury to find him not guilty. The district attorney, Thomas Spota, then announced that he would not pursue the case. After spending half his life behind bars, Mr. Tankleff is free, and his parents\xe2\x80\x99 killer or killers presumably remain at large.'b'His confession came after hours of interrogation during which detectives lied to Mr. Tankleff, telling him that his mortally wounded father had identified his son as the attacker. \xe2\x80\x9cCould I have blacked out?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cCould I be possessed?\xe2\x80\x9d Largely on the basis of his own words, he was tried and convicted.'b'The Innocence Project, the watchdog group that helped to defend Mr. Tankleff, has long argued that false confessions are far more frequent than is commonly believed. The group claims that in more than a quarter of cases in which defendants were later exonerated by DNA evidence, they had made incriminating statements, given confessions or pleaded guilty. Suspects do this for many reasons \xe2\x80\x94 because they are coerced, threatened, frightened, drunk or high, mentally impaired or ignorant of the law. Some do it because they have been lied to.'b'The Innocence Project, many other civil liberties groups and growing numbers of police departments and prosecutors\xe2\x80\x99 offices, argue that interrogations in major criminal cases should be recorded. The practice, they say, would deter false convictions by discouraging misconduct and manipulation by the police. It would give judges and jurors a tool to assess a confession\xe2\x80\x99s authenticity. It would protect the police from false claims of abuse, create a clear record of suspects\xe2\x80\x99 statements and it would bolster public confidence in the legal system.'b'Illinois, Alaska and Minnesota are among more than 500 jurisdictions that routinely record police interrogations. A bill that would require videotaping of questioning in felony cases passed the New York State Assembly last year but stalled in the Senate. The Legislature should promptly revive and pass the bill, and Gov. Eliot Spitzer should sign it into law.'b'The Tankleff case and the recent high-profile exoneration of Jeffrey Deskovic, who spent 16 years in prison for a rape and murder he confessed to but did not commit, both argue strongly for fixing this glaring flaw in New York\xe2\x80\x99s justice system.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re about to find out how resilient Barack Obama is.'b'I was not one of those who thought, during those frantic, giddy, sleepless few days leading up to the New Hampshire primary, that Mr. Obama was on his way to a blowout win.'b'When I mentioned my skepticism to reporters at an Obama rally in Derry on Sunday, everyone insisted he was romping to victory. \xe2\x80\x9cDouble digits,\xe2\x80\x9d said one reporter.'b'This certainty was based on poll results and the size and enthusiasm of the Obama crowds. But poll results have been unreliable for decades when it comes to black candidates and white voters. And I wrote in a column that ran on election day that whenever Senator Obama would ask how many people in his overflow crowds were still undecided, about a third would raise their hands.'b'I was not predicting an Obama defeat. I just had a strong sense that the news media, feeding on itself, had lost sight of reality and that the election was bound to be close.'b'I could also sense how hard the Clinton camp was working to undermine Senator Obama\xe2\x80\x99s main theme, that a campaign based on hope and healing could unify, rather than further polarize, the country.'b'So there was the former president chastising the press for the way it was covering the Obama campaign and saying of Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s effort: \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole thing is the biggest fairy tale I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And there was Mrs. Clinton telling the country we don\xe2\x80\x99t need \xe2\x80\x9cfalse hopes,\xe2\x80\x9d and taking cheap shots at, of all people, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99d already seen Clinton surrogates trying to implant the false idea that Mr. Obama might be a Muslim, and perhaps a drug dealer to boot. It struck me that the prediction of so many commentators that Senator Obama was about to run away with the nomination, and bury the Clintons in the process, was the real fairy tale.'b'The importance of Senator Obama\xe2\x80\x99s effort was getting lost in the craziness. His message of hope and change had captured the Iowa caucuses and excited many thousands in the snowy precincts of New Hampshire.'b'The significance of his achievement did not lie in whether he would win the presidency (or any given caucus or primary) but in the fact that he might well be fashioning a positive change in the very character of the nation \xe2\x80\x94 in the way we view one another, and in our approach to the political process, and our willingness to climb off the couch and participate in it.'b'He was drawing young people into the process and exciting people across party lines.'b'The big deal was that Senator Obama, defying every stereotype, was making it easier for people, frustrated by the status quo, to dare to hope and believe in the country again. The early success of his candidacy, whether it would ultimately triumph or not, meant that the system was still open to outsiders and progressives and the young. Democracy American-style was still vital and dynamic and open to change. That was no small thing.'b'But the uncontrolled hype, with its predictions of a blowout in New Hampshire that could all but seal the nomination and shatter the Clinton dynasty, meant that even a modest victory by Senator Obama  \xe2\x80\x94  a one-  or two-  or three-point win  \xe2\x80\x94  would be characterized as a defeat.'b'And there were disturbing signs that Senator Obama himself had bought into the hype. There\xe2\x80\x99s a fine line between brash and cocky. You can\xe2\x80\x99t embark on a quest as audacious as Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s without a certain brashness. But cocky turns people off. And the senator seemed at times to stray across that line.'b'Until New Hampshire, his tone had been pitch-perfect, and often magnificent. But you knew instantly that it was a blunder during last Saturday night\xe2\x80\x99s debate, in a moment that cried out for a touch of personal grace, to dismiss Senator Clinton as \xe2\x80\x9clikable enough.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And in response to Mr. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s ranting, Mr. Obama told reporters: \xe2\x80\x9cI understand he\xe2\x80\x99s feeling a little frustrated right now.\xe2\x80\x9d The senator believed he was winning big, and he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t trying to hide it.'b'Pride, the nuns told me in grammar school, goeth before a fall. It may not be fair that the Clintons seem to be forgiven every sin while Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s margin of error is tiny at best. But it was Jack Kennedy, one of Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s important models, who liked to tell us that life is not fair.'b'Mr. Obama has one hell of a fight on his hands.

I was born the year before that climb, and while I was growing up, Sir Edmund Hillary was the last word in simple, bold heroism. I quietly set him apart in my mind, knowing that I would probably never test my own limits of physical and mental endurance, as he did. What makes the news of his death Friday at age 88 so moving, was his modesty, the sense of a civilian heroism held in reserve apart from that one great moment. He made the word \xe2\x80\x9cbeekeeper\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 his and his father\xe2\x80\x99s vocation \xe2\x80\x94 sound like an honorific.'b'Everest is not, now, a technically extreme climb, at least on some routes. It takes stamina and determination and money, and its dangers are as real as they ever were, but every year dozens of climbers \xe2\x80\x94 mountaineering tourists, many of them \xe2\x80\x94 make it to the top.'b'For Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, the Sherpa guide, it was an extreme climb, and not merely because theirs was an age of canvas, wool and leather. The mountain seemed to project defeat and death, and though it makes no sense to talk of \xe2\x80\x9ctaming\xe2\x80\x9d a peak, the fact that Hillary and Norgay reached the summit and descended, none the worse for wear, made Everest suddenly seem possible. A modern climber going up Everest has to ask whether he or she can make it \xe2\x80\x94 a matter of individual will and preparation. For Hillary and Norgay, the question was whether anyone could make it.'b'Everest has not changed since May 29, 1953, when Hillary and Norgay, who died in 1986, reached the summit, but our idea of Everest has. Since then, it has been climbed in ways that once would have seemed nonsensical. There have been, for instance, solo ascents without oxygen. And yet each of these technical variations is also an attempt to restore to Everest the inherent difficulty \xe2\x80\x94 the near-impossibility \xe2\x80\x94 it possessed when Hillary and Norgay set out.   'b'VERLYN KLINKENBORG'b''b'Nyack, N.Y.'b'IF parts of Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s victory speech Tuesday night seemed awkward and ill fitting, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably because she clothed herself in rhetorical threads borrowed from Barack Obama. With her new emphasis on \xe2\x80\x9cchange\xe2\x80\x9d and her even newer emphasis on Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s favorite political action committee (\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x9d), Mrs. Clinton proved she was able to adapt to meet the test posed to her candidacy by Mr. Obama. But she may not be able to change sufficiently to meet a more unexpected challenge from the Republicans, whose surprising presidential campaign has already altered the complexion of the primaries for  both parties.'b'For more than a year, Mrs. Clinton has based her campaign in large part on her ability to parry the kind of attack politics that Democrats feared from the Republican Party under its former chief strategist, Karl Rove. On the trail, Mrs. Clinton has assured voters that she is the only Democratic candidate who has been \xe2\x80\x9cvetted\xe2\x80\x9d and shown capable of withstanding the right-wing attack machine. But that machine has grown curiously quiet of late.'b'In the Republican races in Iowa and New Hampshire, the harsh partisan noise of the past two decades grew faint. Mrs. Clinton may be entrenched behind a political Maginot line, preparing to defeat an opponent who  is contemplating a new, more daring maneuver for victory.'b'Republican candidates with a mean streak are fading fast. Mitt Romney, the only candidate to use the word \xe2\x80\x9cinternship\xe2\x80\x9d in a political statement about Mrs. Clinton, is in trouble. Rudy Giuliani has embraced the most anti-Democratic rhetoric of any of the Republicans but has collected few votes.'b'By contrast, when Mike Huckabee mounted the stage in Des Moines to claim victory in the Iowa Republican caucuses, he offered no red meat. After securing victory by the votes of a bloc formerly known as the \xe2\x80\x9creligious right,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Huckabee demonized no Democrats or liberals or gays. Instead, he quoted G. K. Chesterton on love.'b'Then on Tuesday, John McCain seized victory in the Republican primary in New Hampshire after a campaign essentially devoid of attacks on Democrats. A signature moment was Mr. McCain\xe2\x80\x99s lengthy, thoughtful and entirely civil discussion with a war protester at one of his campaign events.'b'Mr. McCain, an expert on military policy, didn\xe2\x80\x99t make a cheap example of the civilian. Instead, he practically made a political convert. The exchange ended with the protester wishing Mr. McCain success in his race against Mitt Romney. On election night, the victorious Mr. McCain saluted the Democratic candidates as well as his Republican foes.'b'Could Hillary Clinton retool her image and campaign to prevail against a Republican who attacks with love bombs instead of wedge issues? Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign argues that her experience in the culture wars of the \xe2\x80\x9990s, her eternal war-room footing and her deep roots in party politics would be assets in what they see as a partisan death match. But she can sometimes overreach. The day before the New Hampshire primary, she took aim at Mr. Obama but hit the memory of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. instead, angering Representative James Clyburn, an influential black politician in South Carolina, home of an upcoming primary.'b'If Mr. Huckabee and Mr. McCain continue to set the tone for the Republican side, Mrs. Clinton would find it hard to escape the partisan past she unwillingly symbolizes. Her negative poll ratings are consistently higher than those of any candidate running for president. They seem more unyielding as well.'b'Given that the Republican base has shrunk since 2004, it makes strategic sense for the party\xe2\x80\x99s candidates to be campaigning in an expansive mood. This new Republican style is not a matter only for the general election, however. As partisan battle recedes, the role of the warrior in both parties is diminished. Thus, Democratic primary voters may find Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s claim to post-partisanship to be perceptive rather than na\xc3\xafve.'b'One of the most compelling, if unheralded, moments of the campaign season occurred when Barack Obama and Mike Huckabee delivered their victory speeches in Iowa. From a policy standpoint, the two men don\xe2\x80\x99t have much in common. Yet had they switched speeches, each candidate could have delivered the other\xe2\x80\x99s words with conviction, even passion. Cynics question whether there is substance beneath their rhetoric, but in presidential politics, tone is substance.'b'There is no guarantee that this strange and wonderful civility, with its hint of an underlying commonality of purpose, will endure.

Just as Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s message of compassionate conservatism appealed to many Democrats and independent-minded liberals, Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s politics of hope seems to disarm Republicans and rightward-leaning independents.'b'Unfortunately for those conservatives drawn to Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s message of unity, he almost certainly can\xe2\x80\x99t deliver on it. Just as President Bush failed to unite Washington and instead ended up contributing to its divisiveness, so Mr. Obama will eventually have to accept that conflict, rather than unity, is the natural condition of politics.'b'In a way, I have come to blame myself for believing that Mr. Bush could be a uniter and not a divider. In retrospect, it is clear that he was a divider in Texas, too. Even while working with Democrats, he destroyed the Democratic Party here with his personality.'b'When Mr. Bush announced his candidacy for governor against Ann Richards in 1993, Democrats dominated the statewide offices and held majorities in both houses of the Legislature. When he left for Washington, they held no statewide offices, had lost control of the Senate, and would soon lose control of the House. He did it through his personal popularity, which was so great that Democrats didn\xe2\x80\x99t dare to be Democrats, and soon there were few Democrats to speak of, except African-Americans and Hispanics. To this day, the party has not recovered.'b'Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s claim to have governed Texas in a bipartisan spirit was based on his record of cooperation with Democratic legislative leaders. And the good will was genuine. The leadership embraced his proposals and Governor Bush didn\xe2\x80\x99t meddle with the usual legislative initiatives, including the state budget.'b'As a presidential candidate, Mr. Bush warned Tom DeLay and other Congressional leaders not to balance the budget on the backs of the poor. After his inauguration, he received considerable Democratic support for his response to the 9/11 attacks, for the Patriot Act and for the No Child Left Behind law. But in the second year of his presidency, the notion of Mr. Bush as a uniter soon receded from memory.'b'The president campaigned vigorously during the 2002 elections to help Republicans regain control of the Senate. Differences over fundamental issues like the war in Iraq and the confirmation of judges prevented a rapprochement between the president and the Democrats, which, by the time Mr. Bush won a second term in 2004, neither party really wanted.'b'In a multiparty parliamentary system, a deft leader can form, dissolve and reorganize governing coalitions, but in the American political system, the imperative of the majority is to hold power and the imperative of the minority is to seize power for itself. It may serve the minority\xe2\x80\x99s interest to cooperate from time to time, but in principle it can advance itself only by opposing the majority.'b'In a world of bloggers and talk radio and 24/7 news cycles, Mr. Obama \xe2\x80\x94 or anyone else who goes into politics  \xe2\x80\x94 is making promises he can\xe2\x80\x99t keep when he says he wants to work with the other side. Yes, there are moments when politicians look to the common good and when both sides conclude that compromise is in their best interest. In general, however, the nature of American politics is,  and should be, adversarial.'b'For many liberals and independents, the lesson of compassionate conservatism and the Bush presidency has been that policy matters more than campaign rhetoric. Conservatives who are drawn to Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s politics of hope would be wise to remember that.'b'Congress\xe2\x80\x99s failure to pass meaningful immigration reform last year dispersed the debate to dozens of municipalities nationwide. On Monday night, the City Council in Danbury, Conn., will consider a question being asked in too many cities and towns: whether local police should become enforcers of federal immigration law.'b'Danbury\xe2\x80\x99s mayor, Mark Boughton, is championing the idea, which \xe2\x80\x94 as experience has  shown in other parts of the country \xe2\x80\x94 is a bad one. The police usually have enough to do, and if immigrants are afraid to talk to police for fear of being deported, it can cripple a department\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness in immigrant communities.'b'Proposals to deputize local police to do a job that more appropriately belongs to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have become common. The agency has trained police in several dozen localities.'b'Mr. Boughton says he wants the police to root out undocumented immigrants with criminal records,  including those wanted in their own country. His urgency is difficult to understand. Crime in Danbury, already low, dropped 8 percent  last year. Mr. Boughton is so eager \xe2\x80\x94 and so eager to preclude debate \xe2\x80\x94 that he used the city\xe2\x80\x99s emergency-alert telephone system last week to \xe2\x80\x9cpoll\xe2\x80\x9d Danbury\xe2\x80\x99s citizens on the issue. Most who responded approved, but the poll was not scientific and the calls politicized the issue even more.'b'Cities like Danbury, which  have sizable foreign-born populations, risk inflaming tensions if they make such decisions without a full public debate.  Danbury\xe2\x80\x99s citizens, starting with members of the City Council, need to ask many questions about Mr. Boughton\xe2\x80\x99s proposal. The first one should be: Why the rush?'b'Newark'b'JOSE PADILLA, the so-called dirty bomber, is expected to be sentenced by a federal judge in Miami this week, and judging from the reaction to his conviction last summer the case will be hailed by many as a triumph of the use of criminal law as the primary weapon against domestic terrorism. The White House will no doubt reiterate its view that the prosecution of Mr. Padilla, a United States citizen, upholds \xe2\x80\x9ca core American principle of impartial justice for all.\xe2\x80\x9d But the White House has been far from alone in praising the verdict.'b'Perhaps because the argument over Mr. Padilla and other detainees had centered for so long on the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s apparent reluctance to afford them any rights at all, even Mr. Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s defenders in the criminal defense bar praised the prosecution. Donna Newman, Mr. Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s first lawyer, said that the trial \xe2\x80\x9cshows you can bring forth the evidence and try someone in court.\xe2\x80\x9d Jenny Martinez, who represented him before the Supreme Court, wrote that the \xe2\x80\x9ctrial showed that our federal courts are perfectly capable of dealing with terrorism cases.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But are they? A closer look at the Padilla case and other terrorism prosecutions reveals, to the contrary, that the continued reliance on our criminal justice system as the main domestic weapon in the struggle against terrorism fails on two counts: it threatens not only to leave our nation unprotected but also to corrupt the foundations of the criminal law itself.'b'The use of the criminal law in terrorist cases has never been an easy fit. After all, the primary purpose of counterterrorism is the prevention of future acts, while the criminal law has developed primarily to punish conduct that has already occurred. The question raised by the Padilla trial is whether a case about an attack that never actually happened can be tried in the criminal courts without transforming the nature of that system itself.'b'The answer is no. In order to make the criminal justice system an effective weapon, we have already started extending the reach of criminal statutes to conduct that has never before been punishable as a crime.'b'Look, for instance, at the two charges of which Mr. Padilla has been convicted: conspiracy and the provision of material support to a terrorist organization. Before 9/11, the \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial support\xe2\x80\x9d statute was greeted rather rudely by the courts. Federal judges were divided even as to its constitutionality, with some believing that the statute penalized the freedom to associate, and others believing that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s failure to require that a defendant know that the organization had been designated a terrorist organization was a fatal due process flaw.'b'After 9/11, the courts have not been so troubled. Originally limited to providing \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial support\xe2\x80\x9d in the form of money or weapons to groups the federal government has deemed terrorist organizations, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope has now been broadened, in the cases of Mr. Padilla and of John Walker Lindh, the so-called American Taliban, so that a defendant is within its ambit by providing only himself as \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial support.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The conspiracy charge of which Mr. Padilla was convicted is also a novel application of the law. The prosecution used the charge for a new purpose: preventive detention. As Prof. Peter S. Margulies of the Roger Williams University law school perceptively told The Times after Mr. Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s conviction, the way the statute is being interpreted \xe2\x80\x9cbasically allows someone to be found guilty for something that is one step away from a thought crime.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Both charges \xe2\x80\x94 providing material support and conspiracy \xe2\x80\x94 are extremely vague, because ideas behind both strain to reach conduct that may be, in other contexts, entirely innocent.'b'The urgency involved in terrorism cases has also led courts to accept conduct by the government that might well have been disapproved in other contexts. In United States v. Lakhani, the defendant, Hemant Lakhani, bragged to an F.B.I. informant of his ability to procure everything from shoulder-held missiles to submarines. There was only one problem: it became clear over a 22-month period that Mr. Lakhani couldn\xe2\x80\x99t deliver. He was unable to find anyone to sell him the weapons.'b'So, in exasperation, the government stepped in. A  government agent arranged to be the supplier for Mr. Lakhani. The government thus not only induced the defendant to commit the crime, but enabled him to commit it. No matter. Mr. Lakhani was convicted, and sentenced to 47 years in prison by a federal district court in New Jersey.'b'The broader trouble here is that the federal court decision rejecting Mr. Lakhani\xe2\x80\x99s appeal is considered \xe2\x80\x9cprecedential\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 that is, the court sees it serving as a model. When terrorism cases are treated as ordinary criminal prosecutions, the principles of law that they come to embody will guide law-enforcement conduct and be cited by the government not just in terrorism cases but in other criminal contexts.'b'Over time, we may well transform the law of conspiracy to the point where an agreement alone is a crime. This would render thoughts punishable, reward government overreaching and erode our civil liberties. All because the criminal law is being used not primarily to punish crimes but for purposes of detaining people we are worried about.'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t question that people like Jose Padilla and Hemant Lakhani can pose an unacceptable risk to public safety. But their prosecutions should transform the debate over how to deal with domestic terrorism. They cry out for the creation of a form of preventive detention adapted to terrorism, and outside the criminal justice system.'b'Likewise, the government\xe2\x80\x99s detention of Mr. Padilla for years without filing charges or providing access to counsel was unprincipled. But considering norms of criminal law and the paucity of evidence the government had at the time, its only alternative was to leave him free. Law enforcement should have had another choice.'b'Imagine what might have happened had the government not detained Mr. Padilla back in 2002 \xe2\x80\x94 if he had carried out a large-scale bombing, killing thousands, and if it had emerged later that the government had had information implicating him and done nothing. Would that have been a risk worth taking? Scotland Yard took that risk when it put surveillance on, but failed to detain, the future London subway bombers.'b'It is time to stop pretending that the criminal justice system is a viable primary option for preventing terrorism. The Bush administration should propose and Congress should pass legislation allowing for preventive detention in future terrorism cases like that of Mr. Padilla. It is the best way to ensure both the integrity of our criminal law and the safety of our nation.'b'To the Editor:'b'In \xe2\x80\x9cToo Many Innocents Abroad\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Jan. 9), Robert L.

'b''b'Iraq will be a central challenge \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps the central challenge \xe2\x80\x94 for whoever succeeds President Bush and has to repair the profound damage he has wrought with a war that should never have been fought and has been managed so ineptly. The candidates must talk more to the American people about when troops will be withdrawn and how it will be done, as well as how they will manage relations with Iraq and the region.'b'Yet the war has receded as a major topic on the campaign trail, much to the relief of the Republican candidates, who never stray far from the party line but know that Americans overwhelmingly want the troops home.'b'One year after Mr. Bush announced that he would try to salvage his misadventure by rushing in 30,000 more troops, casualties are down.  Yet 2007 was  the most violent year in Iraq since the 2003 invasion. Mr. Bush has nothing to show in the way of political progress, which is even more important for ending the war.'b'As a result, the war continues to be a significant political disadvantage for Republicans, not to mention a constant drain in lives lost and resources squandered. Meanwhile, violence in Afghanistan has surged and Al Qaeda has strengthened along the Afghan-Pakistan border. That is the real front line of the war on terror \xe2\x80\x94 no matter how often the Republicans say it is in Iraq.'b'\xc2\x95'b'Except for Representative Ron Paul \xe2\x80\x94 who wants all troops withdrawn immediately but is hardly going to be the nominee \xe2\x80\x94 the Republican candidates are slavishly wedded to Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s policy of war without end. All oppose a pullout timetable. Even Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor who accused Mr. Bush of pursuing a foreign policy with an \xe2\x80\x9carrogant bunker mentality,\xe2\x80\x9d has promised not to withdraw troops any faster than recommended by Gen. David Petraeus, the military commander in Iraq who created the current \xe2\x80\x9csurge\xe2\x80\x9d strategy and has been cautious about force reductions.'b'Senator John McCain conducted a long and lonely crusade  to persuade Mr. Bush to beef up forces in Iraq, and sees the downturn in violence as vindication. From the start, if the United States was ever going to be successful in Iraq, it needed far more troops than Mr. Bush sent in 2003. We are encouraged that many of the candidates promise to avoid repeating such a huge mistake.'b'Even Mr. McCain acknowledges uncertainty about whether the security gains produced by the troop surge can be sustained. He said months ago he had no Plan B if the escalation failed, and there is no sign he has one now. Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s troop buildup was sold as a way to buy Iraqi politicians breathing room to finally address the tensions driving sectarian violence, including an equitable division of oil wealth and strategies to bring more Baathists and Sunnis into the Shiite-led government. Those goals have not been met, and the administration has virtually abandoned them.'b'It remains unclear what the Republicans will consider sufficient success to warrant bringing the troops home. Beyond tough-sounding talk about refusing to surrender, no Republican has ever defined victory in Iraq or given the slightest idea of how to achieve it.'b'\xc2\x95'b'The Democratic candidates all want to cut American losses in Iraq and end the war, although the issue is no longer as defining for their campaigns as it once was, because casualties are down, the administration has made a minimal, grudging effort to reduce force levels, and the economy is teetering on a recession. Their message has been compromised by the repeated failure of their party, despite a majority in Congress, to pass legislation demanding that Mr. Bush alter his Iraq policy.'b'The Democratic candidates have spent a fair amount of time debating how much support each gave to the war at the outset. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and former Senator John Edwards, like most other members of Congress, voted for the war resolution. Mr. Edwards has forcefully repudiated his vote, while Mrs. Clinton has offered unsatisfying explanations for hers. Senator Barack Obama, who was not in office at the time, rhetorically opposed the invasion. He deserves credit for that, but the focus now must be on ending the war.'b'Mr. Edwards has staked out a position that would produce a speedier and more complete withdrawal \xe2\x80\x94 within 10 months after taking office \xe2\x80\x94 than his two rivals. That would include American troops who are training the Iraqi Army and police, leaving only about 5,000 to protect the American Embassy and relief workers.'b'Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama are more realistic. They would start withdrawing troops quickly but have left open precisely how long it would take. Mr. Obama said he would give the Pentagon 16 months to withdraw, but would adjust his timetable based on conditions in Iraq. Mrs. Clinton has not assigned a specific schedule. Both candidates are willing to keep American trainers and counterterrorism units in Iraq as combat troops are brought home and have argued that any withdrawal must be done responsibly, a sentiment we firmly share.'b'\xc2\x95'b'Many important issues have not been fully examined. What is to become of the thousands of Iraqis who helped America and its coalition partners as translators, drivers and fixers and will face retribution? What will be the nature and content of a long-term agreement on future Iraqi-American relations? Will Congress have a say in it? Will the United States retain bases in Iraq or elsewhere in the region? How will a new president seek to enlist key regional countries in stabilizing Iraq? How will a new president improve on Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s failure to facilitate political conciliation? Should the United Nations be involved, as Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama suggest?'b'The Iraq war has laid bare the serious inability of American civilian agencies to quickly and coherently meet the country\xe2\x80\x99s postconflict needs, from reviving energy infrastructure to organizing federal and local governments. In Foreign Affairs magazine,  Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and Republican, proposed integrated regional commands for civilian agencies. That\xe2\x80\x99s an idea deserving consideration.'b'Another crucial question is the issue of pre-emptive war \xe2\x80\x94 or in the case of Iraq, preventive war. The United States must be prepared to use military force to pre-empt another attack on American soil. In Iraq, Mr. Bush went much further, invading a country that he imagined might someday pose a threat to the United States \xe2\x80\x94 not pre-empting an imminent threat but preventing the possibility of a threat. To justify his actions, he persuaded Americans that Saddam Hussein had chemical, biological and, especially, nuclear weapons programs \xe2\x80\x94 a claim that proved to be specious.'b'No serious candidate in 2008 can renounce the potential use of force to defend national security or in retaliation for an attack on the United States. But no voter should cast a ballot for a candidate who will not forswear  such wars of choice. We hope American voters have learned the lesson of 2000, when Mr. Bush escaped serious questioning on foreign affairs during the campaign. He then turned sensible policies on their head and bumbled his way into a disastrous war.'b'Los Angeles'b'THE movie \xe2\x80\x9cJuno\xe2\x80\x9d is a fairy tale about a pregnant teenager who decides to have her baby, place it for adoption and then get on with her life. For the most part, the tone of the movie is comedic and jolly, but there is a moment when Juno tells her father about her condition, and he shakes his head in disappointment and says, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Female viewers flinch  when he says it, because his words lay bare the bitterly unfair truth of sexuality: female desire can bring with it a form of punishment no man can begin to imagine, and so it is one appetite women and girls must always regard with caution. Because Juno let her guard down and had a single sexual experience with a sweet, well-intentioned boy, she alone is left with this ordeal of sorrow and public shame.'b'In the movie, the moment passes. Juno finds a yuppie couple eager for a baby, and when the woman tries to entice her with the promise of an open adoption, the girl shakes her head adamantly: \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a hilarious moment, and the sentiment turns out to be genuine. The final scene of the movie shows Juno and her boyfriend returned to their carefree adolescence, the baby \xe2\x80\x94 safely in the hands of his rapturous and responsible new mother \xe2\x80\x94 all but forgotten. Because I\xe2\x80\x99m old enough now that teenage movie characters evoke a primarily maternal response in me (my question during the film wasn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cWhat would I do in that situation?\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cWhat would I do if my daughter were in that situation?\xe2\x80\x9d), the last scene brought tears to my eyes. To see a young daughter, faced with the terrible fact of a pregnancy, unscathed by it and completely her old self again was magical.'b'And that\xe2\x80\x99s why \xe2\x80\x9cJuno\xe2\x80\x9d is a fairy tale. As any woman who has ever chosen (or been forced) to kick it old school can tell you, surrendering a baby whom you will never know comes with a steep and lifelong cost. Nor is an abortion psychologically or physically simple. It is an invasive and frightening procedure, and for some adolescent girls it constitutes part of their first gynecological exam. I know grown women who\xe2\x80\x99ve wept bitterly after abortions, no matter how sound their decisions were. How much harder are these procedures for girls, whose moral and emotional universe is just taking shape?'b'Even the much-discussed pregnancy of 16-year-old Jamie Lynn Spears reveals the rudely unfair toll that a few minutes of pleasure   can exact on a girl.  The very fact that the gossip magazines are still debating the identity of the father proves again that the burden of sex is the woman\xe2\x80\x99s to bear. He has a chance to maintain his privacy, but if she becomes pregnant by mistake, soon all the world will know.'b'Pregnancy robs a teenager of her girlhood. This stark fact is one reason girls used to be so carefully guarded and protected \xe2\x80\x94 in a system that at once limited their horizons and safeguarded them from devastating consequences. The feminist historian Joan Jacobs Brumberg has written that \xe2\x80\x9chowever prudish and \xe2\x80\x98uptight\xe2\x80\x99 the Victorians were, our ancestors had a deep commitment to girls.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We, too, have a deep commitment to girls, and ours centers not on protecting their chastity, but on supporting their ability to compete with boys, to be free \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps for the first time in history \xe2\x80\x94 from the restraints that kept women from achieving on the same level. Now we have to ask ourselves this question: Does the full enfranchisement of girls depend on their being sexually liberated? And if it does, can we somehow change or diminish among the very young the trauma of pregnancy, the occasional result of even safe sex?'b'Biology is destiny, and the brutally unfair outcome that adolescent sexuality can produce will never change. Twenty years ago, I taught high school in a town near New Orleans. There was a girls\xe2\x80\x99 bathroom next to my classroom, which was more convenient for me than the faculty one on the other side of campus. In the last stall, carved deeply into the metal box reserved for used sanitary napkins, was the single word \xe2\x80\x9cPlease.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Whoever had written it had taken a long time; the word was etched so deeply into the metal that she must have worked on it over several days, hiding in there on hall passes or study breaks, desperate. I never knew who wrote it, or when, but I always knew exactly what that anonymous girl meant. When I looked out over the girls moving through the hallways between classes, I wondered if she was among them, and I hoped that her prayer had been answered.'b'This is an exciting time for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. It has nearly completed a major new addition called the Broad Contemporary Art Museum. But times are not quite as exciting as the museum had hoped. Eli Broad, the financier and collector for whom that new addition is named, has announced that he will not be giving away his art after all. Instead, his foundation will keep permanent control of his collection, making loans to museums in much the way museums lend works to one another.'b'To say that the museum has been spurned is too strong a word, since Mr. Broad,  who financed the new addition and is on the board, is still likely to  play a leading role there. He has  said he will favor the museum in his lending, but many at the institution had hoped that much of his collection would come  as a gift.'b'The benefits to Mr. Broad are fairly obvious, beginning with the advantage of a tax-exempt foundation. The collection will be kept intact, and, if everything goes according to Mr. Broad\xe2\x80\x99s plan, more of its contents will be visible to the public than if it were given to a public museum. And the collection will keep growing.'b'Whether this turns out to have been a good decision will ultimately depend on the character of the foundation. If they are stored and conserved properly, if scholars have ready access to them and if they\xe2\x80\x99re made available for lending to museums, then nothing will be lost.'b'In offering to be a collaborator, not just a donor, he may be serving the public interest as well as his own.'b'To the Editor:'b'Adding 15,000 miles of designated trails in Utah comes as no surprise from a government that has allowed our most sacred national areas to be gutted.'b'As \xe2\x80\x9cNature Overrun\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 8) suggested, many federally protected lands, such as roadless areas in our national forests, are open to a host of commercial uses.

Cyanide and other chemicals used in mining poison water, land and wildlife.'b'As the number of mining claims increases, we face the growing possibility that toxic wastes from mining and outright destruction of the landscape will permanently damage even those open spaces that we as a country have promised to preserve.'b'Gina Goodhill'b'\nSacramento, Jan. 8, 2008'b''b''b'The writer is a preservation associate at Environment California, a statewide, citizen-based environmental advocacy organization. 'b''b'SHE had me at \xe2\x80\x9cWell, that hurts my feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'One clich\xc3\xa9 about Hillary Clinton is true. For whatever reason  \xe2\x80\x94  and it\xe2\x80\x99s no crime  \xe2\x80\x94  the spontaneous, outgoing person who impresses those who meet her offstage often evaporates when she steps into the public spotlight. But in the 'b'crucial debate'b' before the New Hampshire primary, the private Clinton popped out for the first time in the 2008 campaign. She parried a male inquisitor\xe2\x80\x99s questioning of her likability by being, of all things, likable.'b'Not only did Mrs. Clinton betray some (but not too many) hurt feelings with genuine humor, she upped the ante by flattering Barack Obama as \xe2\x80\x9cvery likable.\xe2\x80\x9d Which prompted the Illinois senator to match Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s most human moment to date with the most inhuman of his own. To use family-newspaper language, he behaved like a jerk  \xe2\x80\x94  or, to be more precise, like Rick Lazio, the now-forgotten adversary who cleared Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s path to the Senate by boorishly 'b'waving a paper'b' in her face during a 2000 debate.'b'Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s grudging \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re likable enough, Hillary\xe2\x80\x9d made him look like \xe2\x80\x9can ex-husband that was turning over the alimony check,\xe2\x80\x9d in the'b' formulation'b' of Paul Begala, a Clinton backer. The moment stood in stark contrast to Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s behavior in the corresponding debate just before the Iowa caucuses. There he 'b'raised his head high'b' to defend  Joe Biden\xe2\x80\x99s honor when Mr. Biden was questioned about his tic of spouting racial malapropisms.'b'Whatever the precise impact of the incessant 'b'video replays'b' of Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s condescension or of Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s later quasi tears, Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s vote speaks for itself. In her 2.6 percentage-point, 7,500-vote 'b'victory'b', Mrs. Clinton beat Mr. Obama among women voters by 'b'12 percentage points'b' only five days after he carried them by 'b'5 points'b' in Iowa. As we reopen the gender wars, let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget that it\xe2\x80\x99s 2008, not 1968. There are actually some men who are offended by sexist male behavior too. Or by the female misogyny exemplified by the South Carolina woman who 'b'asked'b' John McCain in November, \xe2\x80\x9cHow do we beat the bitch?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And so an exciting and healthy mano-a-mano battle for the Democratic presidential nomination is finally on. (The biggest losers in New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s primary, no one need be reminded, were pollsters and the press.) But if Mrs. Clinton prompted many to give her candidacy a fresh look in the New Hampshire stretch, her 'b'victory speech'b' was, to skeptics like myself,  a step back. When she talked about how \xe2\x80\x9cthe process\xe2\x80\x9d prompted her to find her \xe2\x80\x9cown voice,\xe2\x80\x9d I had to ask the same question Clinton fans ask of Mr. Obama: where\xe2\x80\x99s the beef? Though her campaign gave Madeleine Albright and Wesley Clark the hook and replaced them with a backdrop of youthful eye candy on Tuesday night, Mrs. Clinton soon retreated into the same old pro forma Clinton talking points, nominally updated from the 1990s.'b'Voice is not merely a matter of presenting a softer persona, speaking eloquently,  looking authentic on television, cracking jokes or shedding tears  \xe2\x80\x94  worthwhile attributes for any candidate, including Mr. Obama. Voice is also about content, and in this election, content may yet be king.  Though gender, race, age and likability are all factors, the fundamentals of what the public is looking for in the presidential marketplace remains more stable than our economy week after week.'b'As Mrs. Clinton would say, let\xe2\x80\x99s have a reality check. The exit poll of those who voted on Tuesday  \xe2\x80\x94  not to be confused with the pre-primary polls that misfired  \xe2\x80\x94  showed that Democrats are still looking for change (54 percent) over experience (19 percent) and that they overwhelmingly associate Mr. Obama with the former and Mrs. Clinton with the latter. By change, they don\xe2\x80\x99t mean merely a tuneup. As the 'b'Wall Street Journal-NBC News'b' survey of both Democrats and Republicans found last month, the percentage of voters who favor \xe2\x80\x9csmall adjustments\xe2\x80\x9d in America (24)  or \xe2\x80\x9cmoderate corrections\xe2\x80\x9d (29) is swamped by the 46 percent who seek \xe2\x80\x9cmajor reforms\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9cbrand-new\xe2\x80\x9d approach.'b'In Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s exit polling, 'b'half of Republican voters said'b' even they\xe2\x80\x99d had enough of President Bush. That\xe2\x80\x99s why \xe2\x80\x9cchange\xe2\x80\x9d the word, if not the deed, keeps proliferating in both parties like kudzu. In last weekend\xe2\x80\x99s twin ABC debates, Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s 14 invocations of \xe2\x80\x9cchange\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cchanges\xe2\x80\x9d were surpassed by Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 25 and nearly matched by Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s 10.'b'The question for the two top Democrats, whose specific positions on most issues vary only by increments, is who can best convince the country that they can deliver that change. Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s powerful speeches alone can\xe2\x80\x99t accomplish that, and neither can Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s born-again vow to make her emotions and campaign appearances more accessible to voters and the press.'b'In the nightmare scenario for their party, they could both fail or take each other out or self-destruct, inducing the public to settle for a Republican who can somehow persuade voters that he\xe2\x80\x99s the change agent by default. It behooves Democrats to notice that Mr. McCain\xe2\x80\x99s brand as a straight-talking rebel is so strong that even those voters in the New Hampshire G.O.P. primary who don\xe2\x80\x99t like Mr. Bush or the Iraq war gave him most of their votes despite his outspoken support of both.'b'However unpredictable the race as a whole may be, the vision thing still seems central to the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 change sweepstakes. Whether you regard it as inspirational or pablum, Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s vision has been consistent since the 2004 convention speech that introduced him to the country well before his presidential candidacy: a hopeful reconciliation of red and blue Americans joined in a united effort to address and heal the domestic and international cancers that have metastasized during the bitter partisanship of the Bush-Rove years.'b'Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s vision, so far anyway, is exactly the reverse of her opponent\xe2\x80\x99s big picture: a long itemized shopping list of government programs (few of which any Democratic candidate would disagree with) that are nakedly targeted to appeal to every Election Day constituency. This presentation of the liberal catechism reached its apotheosis in a Clinton 'b'campaign ad'b' in December. Mrs. Clinton was shown doling out Christmas presents labeled \xe2\x80\x9cUniversal Health Care\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAlternative Energy\xe2\x80\x9d before delivering the punch line, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere did I put universal pre-K?\xe2\x80\x9d (At least she stopped short of regifting us with Al Gore\xe2\x80\x99s old \xe2\x80\x9cSocial Security lockbox.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'Every politician employs pollsters, but Mrs. Clinton, tellingly, has one, 'b'Mark Penn'b', as her top campaign strategist. As Sally Bedell Smith reminds us in her book about the Clintons, \xe2\x80\x9cFor Love of Politics,\xe2\x80\x9d it was Mr. Penn who helped shape the 1996 Bill Clinton campaign in which \xe2\x80\x9csoccer moms\xe2\x80\x9d were identified and wooed with such Cracker Jack prizes as school uniforms and V-chips to monitor TV violence. For Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Senate campaign four years later, it was also Mr. Penn\xe2\x80\x99s market testing that, in Ms. Smith\xe2\x80\x99s telling, \xe2\x80\x9ccrafted anodyne, bite-sized messages for Hillary.\xe2\x80\x9d The overall message uniting the small-bore promises, such as it was, remains unchanged today: competence, experience, wonky proficiency.'b'But we\xe2\x80\x99re no longer in 2000, the lull before the 9/11 storm, let alone 1996. Nonetheless, Mr. Penn, who remains the chief executive  of the corporate P.R. giant Burson-Marsteller even as he works for the Clinton campaign, still peddles the 1.0 edition of his philosophy. In his business tome \xe2\x80\x9cMicrotrends\xe2\x80\x9d published in September, he 'b'glories in'b' \xe2\x80\x9cthe niching of America,\xe2\x80\x9d observing that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no one America anymore\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9chundreds of Americas.\xe2\x80\x9d He postulates that \xe2\x80\x9cAmericans overwhelmingly favor small, reasonable ideas over big, grandiose schemes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As a theory for marketing Burson-Marsteller 'b'corporate clients'b' like Microsoft and AT&amp;T  \xe2\x80\x94  or for selling a third Clinton term  \xe2\x80\x94  Mr. Penn\xe2\x80\x99s vision may make sense. What Mr. Obama is betting on instead is a hunger, however dreamy, for one America, not hundreds of niches, aspiring to the big, grandiose scheme of finding a common good. The defining question of his campaign is not just whether he can make this vision real but whether he has the ability as a leader to give it intellectual heft and to carry it out. We\xe2\x80\x99ll find out soon enough. Either way, the national yearning for a more perfect union is unmistakable. Such is  the decisive backlash against these divisive years in which anyone who fails to agree with the White House has been portrayed as un-American, if not with the terrorists.'b'In Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s down-to-earth micropolitics, polls often seem to play the leadership role.  That leaves her indecisive when one potential market is pitched against another. Witness her equivocation over  Iraq, driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses for illegal immigrants and even Cubs vs. Yankees. Add to this habitual triangulation the ugly campaigning of the men around her \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Penn\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'sleazy invocation'b' of \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine\xe2\x80\x9d on MSNBC, Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfairy tale\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'rant'b' falsifying Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'record on Iraq'b' \xe2\x80\x94   and you don\xe2\x80\x99t have change. You have the acrimonious 1990s that the Republicans are dying to refight, because that\xe2\x80\x99s the only real tactic they have.'b'It would be good for both her campaign and the presidential race in general if Mrs. Clinton does find her own voice. We\xe2\x80\x99ll know she has done so when it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound so uncannily like Bill Clinton and Mark Penn.'b'THE other day I felt a cold coming on. So I decided to have chicken soup to ward off the cold. Nonetheless I got the cold. This happens all the time: you think you\xe2\x80\x99re getting a cold; you have chicken soup; you get the cold anyway. So: is it possible that chicken soup gives you a cold?'b'I will confess a bias: I\xe2\x80\x99ve never understood the religious fervor that surrounds breast-feeding. There are fanatics out there who believe you should breast-feed your child until he or she is old enough to unbutton your blouse. Their success in conning a huge number of women into believing this is one of the truly grim things about modern life. Anyway, one of the main reasons given for breast-feeding is that breast-fed children are less prone to allergies. But children today are far more allergic than they were when I was growing up, when far fewer women breast-fed their children. I mean, what is it with all these children dropping dead from sniffing a peanut? This is new, friends, it\xe2\x80\x99s brand-new new, and don\xe2\x80\x99t believe anyone who says otherwise. So: is it possible that breast-feeding causes allergies?'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s much easier to write a screenplay on a computer than on a typewriter. Years ago, when you wrote a screenplay on a typewriter, you had to retype the entire page just to make the smallest change; now, on the computer, you can make large and small changes effortlessly, you can fiddle with dialogue, you can change names and places with a keystroke. And yet movies are nowhere near as good as they used to be. In 1939, when screenwriters were practically still using quill pens, the following movies were among those nominated for best picture: \xe2\x80\x9cGone With the Wind,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wizard of Oz,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Smith Goes to Washington,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWuthering Heights\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cStagecoach,\xe2\x80\x9d and that\xe2\x80\x99s not even the whole list. So: is it possible that computers are responsible for the decline of movies?'b'There is way too much hand-washing going on. Someone told me the other day that the act of washing your hands is supposed to last as long as it takes to sing the song \xe2\x80\x9cHappy Birthday.\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99m not big on hand-washing to begin with; I don\xe2\x80\x99t even like to wash fruit, if you must know. But my own prejudices aside, all this washing-of-hands and use of Purell before picking up infants cannot be good. (By the way, I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about hand-washing in hospitals, I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about everyday, run-of-the-mill hand-washing.) It can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly make sense to keep babies so removed from germs that they never develop an immunity to them. Of course, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t my original theory \xe2\x80\x94 I read it somewhere a few weeks ago, although I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember where. The New York Times? The Wall Street Journal? Who knows? Not me, that\xe2\x80\x99s for sure. So: is it possible that reading about hand-washing leads to memory loss?'b'I love Google. I love everything about it. I love the verb Google and I love the noun and sometimes I can even use the word as an adjective. For a long time, I liked to think there would some day be a person called the Google, a mixture of a researcher, an assistant and a butler, who would stand by ready to ride to the rescue at all Google moments. No more desperately trying to come up with the name of that movie Jeremy Irons was in, which lurks like a hologram while everyone makes stabs at figuring out what on earth it was called. We can never remember the name of that movie, the one about Claus von Bulow, but never mind \xe2\x80\x94 the Google is here. The Google will find the answer. But as it turns out, no Google is necessary. Somebody has a BlackBerry. The answer is seconds away! It\xe2\x80\x99s here! The movie was called \xe2\x80\x9cReversal of Fortune!\xe2\x80\x9d What a fantastic relief! On the other hand, I have to say, there was something romantic about the desperate search for an answer. On the road to trying to remember the name of Ethel Rosenberg\xe2\x80\x99s brother, for instance, you might find yourself having a brief but diverting chat about Alger Hiss\xe2\x80\x99s wife, which might in turn get you to a story about Whittaker Chambers\xe2\x80\x99s teeth, which might in turn get you to Time magazine, which might in turn get you to Friday nights at Time magazine back in the old days, which might in turn get you to sex. This meandering had its charms. It was, in fact, what used to be known as conversation. But no more. Instead, we have the answer. Ethel Rosenberg\xe2\x80\x99s brother was named David Greenglass. And that\xe2\x80\x99s that. So: is it possible that Google will mean the end of conversation as we know it?'b'IN 1972, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the publisher of The New York Times, was looking for a conservative columnist for his left-leaning Op-Ed page.'b'At a charity dinner, he wound up sitting next to William Safire, the Nixon White House speechwriter who coined Spiro Agnew\xe2\x80\x99s famous denunciation of the press as \xe2\x80\x9cnattering nabobs of negativism.\xe2\x80\x9d They soon had a deal.'b'But, as described in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Trust,\xe2\x80\x9d the authoritative history of the family that has controlled The Times for more than a century, Sulzberger neglected to involve John Oakes, his cousin and the editor of the editorial page, in the decision.  Oakes was appalled when he heard about the negotiations,  and not realizing it was too late, offered alternatives. How about Irving Kristol, he suggested.'b'More than 35 years later, Sulzberger\xe2\x80\x99s son, Arthur Jr. \xe2\x80\x94 this time in full partnership with his editorial page editor, Andrew Rosenthal \xe2\x80\x94 has hired another conservative columnist for their left-leaning Op-Ed page: Irving Kristol\xe2\x80\x99s son, William.'b'The choice of Safire, who retired in 2005, set off a storm of protest. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Times could have saved themselves about 50 grand a year if they just sent an office boy over to the White House to pick up the press releases,\xe2\x80\x9d fumed Nicholas von Hoffman of The Washington Post. Kristol\xe2\x80\x99s appointment has not fared any better. \xe2\x80\x9cPretty much the worst idea ever,\xe2\x80\x9d grumped Gawker, the New York media gossip Web site.'b'Of the nearly 700 messages I have received since Kristol\xe2\x80\x99s selection was announced \xe2\x80\x94 more than half of them before he ever wrote a word for The Times \xe2\x80\x94 exactly one praised the choice.'b'Rosenthal\xe2\x80\x99s mail has been particularly rough. \xe2\x80\x9cThat rotten, traiterous [sic] piece of filth should be hung by the ankles from a lamp post and beaten by the mob rather than gaining a pulpit at ANY self-respecting news organization,\xe2\x80\x9d said one message. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should be ashamed. Apparently you are only out for money and therefore an equally traiterous [sic] whore deserving the same treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Kristol would not have been my choice to join David Brooks as a second conservative voice in the mix of Times columnists, but the reaction is beyond reason. Hiring Kristol the worst idea ever? I can think of many worse. Hanging someone from a lamppost to be beaten by a mob because of his ideas? And that is from a liberal, defined by Webster as \xe2\x80\x9cone who is open-minded.\xe2\x80\x9d What have we come to?'b'Sulzberger told me he was surprised by the vehemence of the reaction. But Kristol is a particularly polarizing figure in a polarized age. While he holds the full range of conservative Republican views on economic and social issues, he is most identified today with ardently pushing for the war in Iraq, a war sold to the American people on the basis of weapons of mass destruction that did not exist, though a fair reading of Kristol\xe2\x80\x99s statements includes broader arguments. Today, the public widely sees the war as a mistake, but Kristol remains its aggressive, unapologetic champion. In his first column last Monday, he warned against electing a Democratic president who would \xe2\x80\x9csnatch defeat out of the jaws of victory in Iraq.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Rosenthal said: \xe2\x80\x9cSome people have said we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have hired him because he supports the war in Iraq. That\xe2\x80\x99s absurd.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That is not why I think Sulzberger and Rosenthal made a mistake, and I agree with their effort to address an Op-Ed lineup that, until Kristol came aboard, was at least six liberals against one conservative who isn\xe2\x80\x99t always all that conservative. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard all the arguments against Kristol  \xe2\x80\x94 he is \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d on Iraq, he is overexposed as editor of The Weekly Standard and a regular commentator on Fox News with nothing new to say, he is an activist with the potential to embarrass The Times with his outside involvements \xe2\x80\x94 and one of them sticks with me:'b'On Fox News Sunday on June 25, 2006, Kristol said, \xe2\x80\x9cI think the attorney general has an absolute obligation to consider prosecution\xe2\x80\x9d of The New York Times for publishing an article that revealed a classified government program to sift the international banking transactions of thousands of Americans in a search for terrorists.'b'Publication of the article was controversial \xe2\x80\x94 my predecessor as public editor first supported it and then changed his mind \xe2\x80\x94 but Kristol\xe2\x80\x99s leap to prosecution smacked of intimidation and disregard for both the First Amendment and the role of a free press in monitoring a government that has a long history of throwing the cloak of national security and classification over its activities. This is not a person I would have rewarded with a regular spot in front of arguably the most elite audience in the nation.'b'Kristol refused to talk with me about this issue, or an earlier statement that The Times was \xe2\x80\x9cirredeemable,\xe2\x80\x9d or the reaction to his appointment \xe2\x80\x94 an odd stance for someone who presumably will want others to talk to him for his column.'b'Rosenthal said Kristol\xe2\x80\x99s comment about prosecution bothered him. It was, Rosenthal said, \xe2\x80\x9ca heavy accusation that put him in a category other than a journalist.\xe2\x80\x9d But he said that Op-Ed columnists are not necessarily traditional journalists, and he did not think that \xe2\x80\x9cholding one opinion\xe2\x80\x9d should be the basis for selecting or rejecting a columnist.'b'Sulzberger said The Times wanted \xe2\x80\x9ca columnist who brought to our pages a deeply held and well articulated point of view in line with what you might call the conservative Republican movement. ... Our Op-Ed page is a marketplace of ideas. He\xe2\x80\x99ll strengthen the discussion.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That may be, but Kristol\xe2\x80\x99s first column joined the pack in its first paragraph and wrote off Hillary Clinton with finality the day before she won the New Hampshire primary. He also misattributed a quotation that had to be corrected.'b'This is a decision I would not have made. But it is not the end of the world. Everyone should take a deep breath and calm down. Safire was greeted with jeers and got off to a rocky start, calling Watergate \xe2\x80\x9ca tempest in a Teapot Dome\xe2\x80\x9d before eventually acknowledging that he had been \xe2\x80\x9cgrandly, gloriously, egregiously wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d He went on to a distinguished, 32-year career at The Times and, agree or disagree with him, he was a compelling presence on the Op-Ed page. (He still writes a column on language in the Sunday magazine.)'b'Kristol was hired on a one-year contract for what amounts to a mutual tryout. He will continue as editor of The Weekly Standard and on Fox, but Rosenthal said Kristol would not advise candidates or take any other active part in the presidential campaign. If Kristol is another Safire, he has the chance to prove it. If not, he and the newspaper will move on, and the search will resume.'b'To the Editor:'b'Now that Verlyn Klinkenborg has admitted in public to his obsession with the novels of Angela Thirkell (\xe2\x80\x9cLife, Love and the Pleasures of Literature in Barsetshire,\xe2\x80\x9d Editorial Observer, Jan. 4), I feel that it is safe for me to come out of the closet.'b'I have been reading her books for at least 20 years, keeping them hidden in a drawer of my bedside table, reading a soothing chapter or two before going to sleep. As soon as I finish the last, I return to the first.'b'Although I sometimes feel that I should be spending my time on more serious literature, I shall continue this guilty pleasure as long as the books, now dog-eared and losing their covers, remain readable.'b'Ellen Myers'b'\nBelle Mead, N.J., Jan. 4, 2008'b''b'BUENOS AIRES'b'As journalists, we like to think we do some good from time to time. For 20 years, I\xe2\x80\x99ve believed I helped two Argentine children emerge from the savagery of dictatorship, find their true family and secure better lives. Now I wonder. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a story of truth and justice \xe2\x80\x94 or neither.'b'When the military junta that ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983 seized pregnant women, it made a practice of waiting to kill them until their babies were born. The infants were then taken by childless military or police couples while the mothers were \xe2\x80\x9cdisappeared.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I was incensed in the aftermath of the dictatorship, finding myself often in rooms filled with the animal sobbing of the bereaved. But there was something about having a young woman give birth, only to slaughter her and steal her child, that took the Argentine state\xe2\x80\x99s depravity \xe2\x80\x94 and my anger \xe2\x80\x94 to a new level.'b'It was too early back in the mid-1980s to know the extent of the generals\xe2\x80\x99 crimes: the 30,000 disappeared and corpse-dumping flights out to sea. But new details were emerging. One, a suggestion that twin boys had been abducted from a murdered woman by an Argentine police officer named Samuel Miara, sent me in 1987 to the Paraguayan capital, Asunci\xc3\xb3n.'b'Miara and his wife, Beatriz, had fled to Gen. Alfredo Stroessner\xe2\x80\x99s little dominion after the Argentine junta fell. Tips questioning the twins\xe2\x80\x99 parenthood had reached the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo human-rights group.'b'I was in touch with the family of Liliana Ross, a medical student abducted on Dec. 12, 1976, never to be seen again. Liliana had been pregnant and, through an appalled midwife (later murdered), word had reached her husband, Adalberto Rossetti, that twin boys named Gustavo and Martin were born to her on April 22, 1977, in Los Olmos prison, before being taken by the Miaras.'b'The scene in Asunci\xc3\xb3n is still vivid to me: two blond boys playing soccer, the smell of mowed grass, a big German shepherd barking. And there was Miara, a swarthy man, smoking. Why would he talk to me, for my questions to him were in essence these:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAre you the guy who\xe2\x80\x99s stolen a couple of children after their mother was killed by the Argentine Army? Are these boys, whom you call Gonzalo and Mat\xc3\xadas Miara, really Gustavo and Martin Rossetti?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yet he invited me in. A troubled conscience can be a journalist\xe2\x80\x99s friend. Miara railed against \xe2\x80\x9cleftists\xe2\x80\x9d and showed me photographs of his wife in early pregnancy. (But none in late.)'b'The Wall Street Journal published my story \xe2\x80\x94 and things started to move. The Miaras were extradited in 1989. DNA tests proved the children were not theirs. Argentine justice moves slowly, but Samuel Miara was convicted of the boys\xe2\x80\x99 kidnapping in 1991 and again, on appeal, in 1995. He went to jail.'b'I heard echoes of this. But I\xe2\x80\x99d moved on. Justice delivered, I thought, a good deed done. Until I returned here this week, seeking the 30-year-old twins, and found more acrimony than reconciliation.'b'The boys were not the children of Rossetti and Ross. DNA tests proved they were born to another \xe2\x80\x9cdisappeared\xe2\x80\x9d student, Mar\xc3\xada Tolosa. She was grabbed with her husband, Juan Reggiardo, in February 1977, and gave birth to twins at Los Olmos prison on May 16, 1977. She and her husband were later murdered.'b'Rosa Roisinblit, whose own pregnant daughter was abducted in 1978 and killed after giving birth, told me the twins \xe2\x80\x94 now called Gonzalo and Mat\xc3\xadas Reggiardo Tolosa \xe2\x80\x94 had sought in vain for a stable home in the 1990s. They clung to Beatriz Miara. A spell with an uncle, Eduardo Tolosa, proved disastrous. They were placed with a \xe2\x80\x9csubstitute family.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThese children were booty of war and, somehow, the kidnappers abetted the parents\xe2\x80\x99 murder,\xe2\x80\x9d Roisinblit, the vice president of the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, told me. \xe2\x80\x9cYet the boys clung to the monsters.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the twins. One is said to carry a photo of his biological mother, the other to be inseparable from the \xe2\x80\x9cmother\xe2\x80\x9d who raised him. By all accounts, they never talk to the press. The justice I\xe2\x80\x99d helped deliver had consisted, for them, of one broken home after another.'b'But they had the truth, or something closer to it than a peaceful Paraguayan yard reeking of repressed crime. We journalists are intruders who move on. Was this intrusion worth it? For the dead, and for Argentina, I say yes. For the twins, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.'b'Truth or justice? Every society emerging from terror must choose. But truth is messier, and justice less adequate than we acknowledge. Life resides in half-tones newspapers render with difficulty, rather than in absolutes.'b'Miara is facing new charges of crimes against humanity in various prison camps. His trial is expected this year. As for the other twins, those born to Liliana Ross, they, like hundreds of other children of the disappeared, have never been found.'b'Blog: 'b'www.iht.com/passages'b'.'b'Madison, Wis.'b'WHEN most of us first laid eyes on Hillary Clinton, it was during \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d and she was sitting by her man saying she was not one of those women who would stand by him. Not long after that, she told us she didn\xe2\x80\x99t make cookies. At that remark I thought I heard the cheering of nonbaking working women everywhere, but apparently I was wrong, and quickly we the people were favored with Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s own contrite cookie recipe, which I have not yet had time to try.'b'A decade-and-a-half later, however, working women were back watching Mrs. Clinton in a New Hampshire diner: they saw her eyes well up in what looked like self-pity but what was to those women recognizably the teary, unbidden mist of exhaustion. Sympathy burst forth, even from Barack Obama (he, too, was tired).'b'Still, though we are in the midst of an awful presidency, we should not be taken in by the rosy haze that gets cast over the Clinton White House; they were not years of great accomplishment. Baghdad was strafed and embargoed; Waco was gassed and burned; in all these events, children (Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s key policy focus) were appallingly killed.'b'While polar ice caps began to melt, Al Gore was left to do who-knows-what, only to regale us later in cineplexes with the consequences of those melting caps, rendering us panicked in our powerlessness. Nafta was signed and the World Trade Organization was created, national health care went nowhere, and by the second term\xe2\x80\x99s close, the administration\xe2\x80\x99s hope of getting things done had been hijacked by Kenneth Starr and the party dress he had confiscated from someone named Monica Lewinsky.'b'So here comes another Clinton.'b'Does her being a woman make her a special case? Does gender confer meaning on her candidacy? In my opinion, it is a little late in the day to become sentimental about a woman running for president. The political moment for feminine role models, arguably, has passed us by. The children who are suffering in this country, who are having trouble in school, and for whom the murder and suicide rates and economic dropout rates are high, are boys \xe2\x80\x94 especially boys of color, for whom the whole educational system, starting in kindergarten, often feels a form of exile, a system designed by and for white girls.'b'In the progressive Midwestern city where I live, the high school dropout rate for these alienated and written-off boys is alarmingly high. Some are even middle-class, but many are just hanging on, their families torn apart by harsh economics and a merciless criminal justice system. Why does it seem to be the Republicans who are more vocal about reforming our drug laws? Why has no one in the Democratic Party campaigned to have felons who have served their time made full citizens again? Their continued disenfranchisement is a foolhardy strike against these men and their families.'b'Perfect historical timing has always been something of a magic trick \xe2\x80\x94 finite and swift. The train moves out of the station. The time to capture the imagination of middle-class white girls, the group Hillary Clinton represents, was long ago. Such girls have now managed on their own (given that in this economy only the rich are doing well). They have their teachers and many other professionals to admire, as well as a fierce 67-year-old babe as speaker of the House, several governors and a Supreme Court justice. The landscape is not bare.'b'Boys are faring worse \xe2\x80\x94 and the time for symbols and leaders they can connect with beneficially should be now and should be theirs. Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s gender does not rescue society from that \xe2\x80\x94 instead she serves as a kind of nostalgia for a time when it might have. Only her policies are what matter now, and here \xe2\x80\x94 despite some squabbling and bad advice that has caused her to \xe2\x80\x9cgo negative\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the Democrats largely agree. But inspiration is essential for living, and Mr. Obama holds the greater fascination for our children.'b'Mr. Obama came of age as a black man in America. He does not need (as he has done) to invoke his grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s life in colonial Kenya to prove or authenticate his understanding of race. His sturdiness is equal to Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s, his plans as precise and humane. But unlike her, he is original and of the moment. He embodies, at the deepest levels, the bringing together of separate worlds. The sexes have always lived together, but the races have not. His candidacy is minted profoundly in that expropriated word \xe2\x80\x9cchange.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Meanwhile, Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s scripted air of expectation might make one welcome any zeitgeisty parvenu. Her \xe2\x80\x9c35 years of experience\xe2\x80\x9d puzzle in their math. Like Rudolph Giuliani, who wants to keep voters safe from terrorism though his own mayoral bunker was beneath the World Trade Center, Mrs. Clinton wants kudos for the disaster of her failed national health plan. She counts heavily her eight years in the White House. Well, then, she\xe2\x80\x99s already been there! Good for her. Next?'b'To the Editor:'b'Imagine a primary campaign where Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama are appreciative and complimentary toward each other. Imagine them articulating their differences \xe2\x80\x94 different personal strengths, different ideas \xe2\x80\x94 without recourse to attacks on the other.'b'That way, the party could remain strong and united and the voters could choose, based on their preferences of personality and policy.'b'The prospect of the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 attacking one another is painful to me. What is gained by this? We obviously have two enormously talented imperfect front-runner candidates, and a few others as well. This is an embarrassment of riches. Let\xe2\x80\x99s savor it! And may the best person for this historical moment win!'b'Claire Basescu'b'\nNew York, Jan. 10, 2008'b''b'The presidential candidates  are only beginning to recognize   what many voters have already figured out through painful, personal experience: the economy is in trouble and unlikely to improve without some sensible government response.'b'The Republicans have been particularly slow to grasp the depth of the problem and the anxiety and pessimism Americans are feeling. Campaigning over the weekend in Michigan \xe2\x80\x94 one of the hardest-pressed states and also the site of a G.O.P.-only  primary this week \xe2\x80\x94 they doled out sympathy, but called mainly for their party\xe2\x80\x99s all-purpose fix: more tax cuts.'b'Sympathy is apt for a state with the nation\xe2\x80\x99s highest unemployment rate, and a targeted and short-term tax rebate may well be necessary. But as stimulus measures go, tax cuts are not nearly as effective as bolstered federal spending on unemployment compensation, food stamps and direct financial aid to states. None of the Republican candidates have yet to think that creatively. And they have  barely mentioned the foreclosure crisis at the root of many of today\xe2\x80\x99s economic problems.'b'The Democratic front-runners have been slow off the mark, but they\xe2\x80\x99re catching on. Last week, Hillary Clinton called for a robust short-term stimulus package, including more federal spending for jobless benefits, home heating aid and grants to states to help prevent  foreclosures. John Edwards has been pushing a similar plan for  weeks. Barack Obama announced a rescue plan  Sunday that relies more heavily on targeted tax cuts to get the economy moving, and less on direct spending.'b'The proposals from Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Edwards are closer to what\xe2\x80\x99s needed and the type of stimulus that Congressional leaders and the White House should begin to discuss as soon as President Bush returns from his Middle East trip. Even such welcome steps would need to be designed and managed carefully to ensure that they don\xe2\x80\x99t permanently add to the deficit. Spending to manage a crisis need not be paid for immediately. Lawmakers and all of the candidates will still need to explain how stimulus measures would be paid for later on, when the economy has recovered.'b'There is already pending legislation that could help blunt some of the pain. The House has passed an excellent bill to modernize the nation\xe2\x80\x99s unemployment compensation system \xe2\x80\x94 expanding the number and types of workers who qualify \xe2\x80\x94 but the Senate has yet to move. Congress should also pass a measure that would allow bankrupt homeowners to modify their mortgages under bankruptcy court protection. That would help more homeowners keep the roof over their heads, as well as be an incentive to lenders to work more diligently to modify loans before they wind up in bankruptcy court.'b'The candidates \xe2\x80\x94 especially those who still have day jobs on Capitol Hill \xe2\x80\x94 should press for swift approval of those two important measures, and be ready to press the case for  a targeted and temporary stimulus package if conditions worsen. The voters are watching and waiting.'b'Washington'b'THE security situation in Afghanistan is bad at the moment, as NATO-led forces face a growing Taliban resurgence. There are 40,000 foreign troops there now (including 14,000 from the United States), but that is not enough to maintain control of villages all over the country. The Afghan Army is slowly growing, in both size and competence, but it is still too small to  protect a frightened, war-weary population.'b'To better  the situation, the United States has recently made it a priority to improve the training of  local policemen in Afghanistan, district by district. Corruption has been an enormous problem among police departments, which are often controlled by local warlords and militias. So we are working to train both rank and file policemen and their commanders. But even if this strategy is successful, it will take years, and we may not have that much time. It makes no allowance for complicating events \xe2\x80\x94 a collapse of security in Pakistan, for example.'b'We are creating more battalions for the Afghan Army as fast as possible. But it takes time to train senior officers and staff. Time is also needed to build the mobility and technological sophistication required to compensate for the Afghan Army\xe2\x80\x99s small size.'b'A better strategy would be to institute a draft in Afghanistan. A draft would make it possible to gather a much larger military force, and far more quickly, around the core professional force already in place.'b'President Hamid Karzai and the Afghan Parliament are likely to embrace a draft as a national response to the present threat from the Taliban. Afghanistan has a long tradition of having a draft. It\xe2\x80\x99s true there would be obstacles: the old draft registers no longer exist, and it would not be acceptable today to exempt certain tribes, as once was done. Also, the Afghan government would need to find a way to pay the new force. (Historically, Afghan draftees were paid almost nothing; they served as a duty.) But Afghans can find solutions to these problems.'b'History suggests it would be possible to  organize the new, large force quickly. During the Korean War in the 1950s, the United States helped build a 700,000-man army  in a nation with a population only about two-thirds that of Afghanistan. In the Greek civil war in the 1940s, we helped build a Greek security force of 182,000 soldiers in two years. These armies were not as sophisticated as today\xe2\x80\x99s forces, and they did not require new body armor, high-tech communications equipment and armored Humvees. But they were sufficient to overcome threats greater than those Afghanistan now faces.'b'An enlarged army would strengthen Afghanistan\xe2\x80\x99s central government, thereby diminishing the power of the often corrupt local police departments. The Afghan Army has a good officer corps respected by the Afghan people.'b'The insurgency is already being fought mostly by small army units. Rather than build new battalions, we could simply add more platoons and companies. This would reduce the need to train additional senior officers and it would make it possible to promote the good officers we have already identified.'b'Once the draft began, foreign trainers would still be needed. So it would be important to challenge our NATO partners to play a larger role in training the new troops. But the numbers of trainers needed would actually be smaller than the number of foreigns battalions we currently need \xe2\x80\x94 but do not have \xe2\x80\x94 from NATO.'b'The United States should lead the way in providing additional trainers. We will have the forces we need for this as the surge in Iraq ends. In setting the example, we may well inspire the NATO nations to see how adding trainers now could enable them to reduce their forces later.'b'If we, along with NATO and other participating nations like Australia and New Zealand, begin helping the Afghans plan now, it may be possible to start training new draftees by late 2009, almost two years from now. The timing is not ideal since the extra forces are needed right away,  but this is the fastest possible way of solving the security problem in Afghanistan.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGive me a break. This whole thing is the biggest fairy tale I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus spoke Bill Clinton last Monday night, exasperated by Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s claim that he \xe2\x80\x94 unlike Hillary Clinton \xe2\x80\x94 had been consistently right (or wrong, depending on your point of view) on the Iraq war.'b'Now in fact, Obama has been pretty consistent in his opposition to the war. But Bill Clinton is right in this respect: Obama\xe2\x80\x99s view of the current situation in Iraq is out of touch with reality. In this, however, Obama is at one with Hillary Clinton and the entire leadership of the Democratic Party.'b'When President Bush announced the surge of troops in support of a new counterinsurgency strategy a year ago, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Democratic Congressional leaders predicted failure. Obama, for example, told Larry King that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe additional U.S. troops would \xe2\x80\x9cmake a significant dent in the sectarian violence that\xe2\x80\x99s taking place there.\xe2\x80\x9d Then in April, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, asserted that \xe2\x80\x9cthis war is lost, and this surge is not accomplishing anything.\xe2\x80\x9d In September, Clinton told Gen. David Petraeus that his claims of progress in Iraq required a \xe2\x80\x9cwilling suspension of disbelief.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Democrats were wrong in their assessments of the surge. Attacks per week on American troops are now down about 60 percent from June. Civilian deaths are down approximately 75 percent from a year ago. December 2007 saw the second-lowest number of U.S. troops killed in action since March 2003. And according to Lt. Gen. Ray Odierno, commander of  day-to-day military operations in Iraq, last month\xe2\x80\x99s overall number of deaths, which includes Iraqi security forces and civilian casualties as well as U.S. and coalition losses, may well have been the lowest since the war began.'b'Do Obama and Clinton and Reid now acknowledge that they were wrong? Are they willing to say the surge worked?'b'No. It\xe2\x80\x99s apparently impermissible for leading Democrats to acknowledge \xe2\x80\x94 let alone celebrate \xe2\x80\x94 progress in Iraq. When asked recently whether she stood behind her \xe2\x80\x9cwilling suspension of disbelief\xe2\x80\x9d insult to   General Petraeus, Clinton said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When Obama was asked in the most recent Democratic presidential debate, \xe2\x80\x9cWould you have seen this kind of greater security in Iraq if we had followed your recommendations to pull the troops out last year?\xe2\x80\x9d he didn\xe2\x80\x99t directly address the  question. But he volunteered that \xe2\x80\x9cmuch of that violence has been reduced because there was an agreement with tribes in Anbar Province, Sunni tribes, who started to see, after the Democrats were elected in 2006, you know what?  \xe2\x80\x94  the Americans may be leaving soon. And we are going to be left very vulnerable to the Shias. We should start negotiating now.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But Sunni tribes in Anbar announced in September 2006 that they would join to fight  Al Qaeda. That was two months before the Democrats  won  control of Congress. The Sunni tribes turned not primarily because of fear of the Shiites,  but because of their horror at Al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s atrocities in Anbar.  And the improvements  in Anbar could never have been sustained without aggressive American military efforts \xe2\x80\x94 efforts that were more effective in 2007 than they had been in 2006, due in part to the addition of the surge forces.'b'Last year\xe2\x80\x99s success, in Anbar and elsewhere, was made possible by confidence among Iraqis that U.S. troops would stay and help protect them, that the U.S. would not abandon them to their enemies. Because the U.S. sent more troops instead of withdrawing   \xe2\x80\x94 because, in other words, President Bush won his battles in 2007 with the Democratic Congress \xe2\x80\x94 we have been able to turn around the situation in Iraq.'b'And now Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s Parliament has passed a de-Baathification law \xe2\x80\x94 one of the so-called benchmarks Congress established for political reconciliation. For much of 2007, Democrats were able to deprecate the military progress and political reconciliation taking place on the ground by harping on the failure of the Iraqi government to pass the benchmark legislation. They are being deprived of even that talking point.'b'Yesterday, on \xe2\x80\x9cMeet the Press,\xe2\x80\x9d Hillary Clinton  claimed that the Iraqis are changing their ways in part because of the Democratic candidates\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9ccommitment to begin withdrawing our troops in January of 2009.\xe2\x80\x9d So the Democratic Party, having proclaimed that the war is lost and having sought to withdraw U.S. troops, deserves credit for any progress that may have been achieved in Iraq.'b'That is truly a fairy tale. And it is driven by a refusal to admit real success because that success has been achieved under the leadership of  ...  George W. Bush. The horror!'b'\xc2\x95'b'In last week\xe2\x80\x99s column, I mistakenly attributed a quotation from Michael Medved to Michelle Malkin. I regret the error.'b'The new earmark disclosure rules put into effect by Congress confirm the pre-eminence of Representative John Murtha at procuring eye-popping chunks of pork for contractors he helped put in business in Johnstown, Pa. The Pennsylvania Democrat, a power player on defense appropriations, exudes pride, not embarrassment, for delivering hundreds of millions of dollars in largesse to district beneficiaries. They, in turn, requite with hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations.'b'Mr. Murtha led all House members this year, securing $162 million in district favors, according to the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense. In all, eager members in both houses enacted  11,144 earmarks, worth $15 billion. Taxpayers may be inured to $113,000 for rodent control in Alaska or a million for Idaho\xe2\x80\x99s weed management. Mr. Murtha\xe2\x80\x99s universe is a far more complicated and costly creation of interlocking contractors who continue to feed at the public trough despite reviews questioning their performance.'b'In 1991, Mr. Murtha used a $5 million earmark to create the National Defense Center for Environmental Excellence  in Johnstown to develop anti-pollution technology for the military. Since then, it has garnered more than $670 million in contracts and earmarks. Meanwhile it is managed by another contractor Mr. Murtha helped create, Concurrent Technologies, a research operation that somehow was allowed to be set up as a tax-exempt charity, according to The Washington Post. Thanks to Mr. Murtha, Concurrent has boomed; the annual salary for its  top three executives averages $462,000.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s been no report of Mr. Murtha\xe2\x80\x99s profiting personally. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is about jobs,\xe2\x80\x9d the congressman insists. But the Murtha operation \xe2\x80\x94 which has become a model for other entrepreneurial lawmakers \xe2\x80\x94 is a gross example of quid pro quo Washington. Every one of the 26 beneficiaries of Mr. Murtha\xe2\x80\x99s earmarks in last year\xe2\x80\x99s defense budget made contributions to his campaign kitty, a total of $413,250, according to the newspaper Roll Call. The Pentagon, seeking its own goodies before Mr. Murtha\xe2\x80\x99s committee, is noticeably hesitant to challenge his projects. And we\xe2\x80\x99re not hearing a lot of objections from his colleagues \xe2\x80\x94 not after members have ladled out a fresh $15 billion for their own special interests, just in time for the coming elections.'b'IT\xe2\x80\x99S Monday morning, and you\xe2\x80\x99re having trouble waking your teenagers. You\xe2\x80\x99re not alone. Indeed, each morning, few of the country\xe2\x80\x99s 17 million high school students are awake enough to get much out of their first class, particularly if it starts before 8 a.m. Sure, many of them stayed up too late the night before, but not because they wanted to.'b'Research shows that teenagers\xe2\x80\x99 body clocks are set to a schedule that is different from that of younger children or adults. This prevents adolescents from dropping off until around 11 p.m., when they produce the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin, and waking up much before 8 a.m. when their bodies stop producing melatonin. The result is that the first class of the morning is often a waste, with as many as 28 percent of students falling asleep, according to a National Sleep Foundation poll. Some are so sleepy they don\xe2\x80\x99t even show up, contributing to failure and dropout rates.'b'Many of our presidential candidates have been relatively silent on how they plan to save our troubled education system. For those still searching for a policy that might have a positive impact, here\xe2\x80\x99s an idea: stop focusing on testing and instead support changing the hours of the school day, starting it later for teenagers and ending it later for all children.'b'Indeed, no one does well when they\xe2\x80\x99re sleep-deprived, but insufficient sleep among children has been linked to obesity and to learning issues like attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. You\xe2\x80\x99d think this would spur educators to take action, and a handful have.'b'In 2002, high schools in Jessamine County in Kentucky pushed back the first bell to 8:40 a.m., from 7:30 a.m. Attendance immediately went up, as did scores on standardized tests, which have continued to rise each year.  Districts in Virginia and Connecticut have achieved similar success. In Minneapolis and Edina, Minn., which instituted high school start times of 8:40 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. respectively in 1997, students\xe2\x80\x99 grades rose slightly and lateness, behavioral problems and dropout rates decreased.'b'Later is also safer. When high schools in Fayette County in Kentucky delayed their start times to 8:30 a.m., the number of teenagers involved in car crashes dropped, even as they rose in the state.'b'So why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t every school board moved back that first bell? Well, it seems that improving teenagers\xe2\x80\x99 performance takes a back seat to more pressing concerns: the cost of additional bus service, the difficulty of adjusting after-school activity schedules and the inconvenience to teachers and parents.'b'But few of these problems actually come to pass, according to the Center for Applied Research and Educational Improvement at the University of Minnesota. In Kentucky and Minnesota, simply flipping the starting times for the elementary and high schools meant no extra cost for buses.  Nor have after-school jobs and activities been affected as anticipated. And though team practices and matches might have to start a bit later, student participation has usually stayed the same. Some districts have even witnessed improved performance from better-rested athletes.'b'Of course, when school starts later, it has to end later. But instead of viewing this as a liability, we should see it as an opportunity to extend the day even further until 5 p.m. or later, not just for high school students but for those in elementary and middle school as well. It would help working parents if their children were on the same basic schedule.'b'But there are other reasons to start and end school at a later time. According to Paul Reville, a professor of education policy at Harvard and chairman of the Massachusetts Board of Education, \xe2\x80\x9cTrying to cram everything our 21st-century students need into a 19th-century six-and-a-half-hour day just isn\xe2\x80\x99t working.\xe2\x80\x9d He says that children learn more at a less frantic pace, and that lengthening the school day would help \xe2\x80\x9cclose the achievement gap between disadvantaged students and their better-off peers.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Massachusetts has opened more than a dozen \xe2\x80\x9cexpanded learning time\xe2\x80\x9d schools, which add about three hours to the school day. Students spend additional time on subjects like math and English, but also enjoy plentiful art, music, physical education and recess \xe2\x80\x94 all of which are being slashed at many schools.'b'Also, why not make sure there\xe2\x80\x99s built-in time for doing homework? That way, children could get their work done at school where professionals can help them, freeing them to spend time with their families when they do get home.'b'So if candidates want the parent vote, here\xe2\x80\x99s a wake-up call. Stand up for an educational policy that allows students\xe2\x80\x99 real needs \xe2\x80\x94 rather than outdated time constraints \xe2\x80\x94 to dictate how and when our children learn best.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cToo Many Innocents Abroad,\xe2\x80\x9d by Robert L.

For two years I served in the Dominican Republic, and nothing has shaped my life as powerfully.'b'And I disagree when Mr. Strauss says we could accept a smaller Peace Corps.

'b''b''b''b'Suddenly, the economic consensus seems to be that the implosion of the housing market will indeed push the U.S. economy into a recession, and that it\xe2\x80\x99s quite possible that we\xe2\x80\x99re already in one. As a result, over the next few weeks we\xe2\x80\x99ll be hearing a lot about plans for economic stimulus.'b'Since this is an election year, the debate over how to stimulate the economy is inevitably tied up with politics. And here\xe2\x80\x99s a modest suggestion for political reporters. Instead of trying to divine the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 characters by scrutinizing their tone  of voice and facial expressions, why not pay attention to what they say about economic policy?'b'In fact, recent statements by the candidates and their surrogates about the economy are quite revealing.'b'Take, for example, John McCain\xe2\x80\x99s admission that economics isn\xe2\x80\x99t his thing. \xe2\x80\x9cThe issue of economics is not something I\xe2\x80\x99ve understood as well as I should,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got Greenspan\xe2\x80\x99s book.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'His self-deprecating humor is attractive, as always. But shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we worry about a candidate who\xe2\x80\x99s so out of touch that he regards Mr. Bubble, the man who refused to regulate subprime lending and assured us that there was at most some \xe2\x80\x9cfroth\xe2\x80\x9d in the housing market, as a source of sage advice?'b'Meanwhile, Rudy Giuliani wants us to go for broke, literally: his answer to the economy\xe2\x80\x99s short-run problems is a huge permanent tax cut, which he claims would pay for itself. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'About Mike Huckabee \xe2\x80\x94  well, what can you say about a candidate who talks populist while proposing to raise taxes on the middle class and cut them for the rich?'b'And then there\xe2\x80\x99s the curious case of Mitt Romney. I\xe2\x80\x99m told that he actually does know a fair bit about economics, and he has some big-name Republican economists supporting his campaign. Fears of recession might have offered him a chance to distinguish himself from the G.O.P. field, by offering an economic proposal that actually responded to the gathering economic storm.'b'I mean, even the Bush administration seems to be coming around to the view that lobbying for long-term tax cuts isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough, that the economy needs some immediate help. \xe2\x80\x9cTime is of the essence,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Henry Paulson, the Treasury secretary, last week.'b'But Mr. Romney, who really needs to take chances at this point, apparently can\xe2\x80\x99t break the habit of telling Republicans only what he thinks they want to hear. He\xe2\x80\x99s still offering nothing but standard-issue G.O.P. pablum about low taxes and a pro-business environment.'b'On the Democratic side, John Edwards, although never the front-runner, has been driving his party\xe2\x80\x99s policy agenda. He\xe2\x80\x99s done it again on economic stimulus: last month, before the economic consensus turned as negative as it now has, he proposed a stimulus package including aid to unemployed workers, aid to cash-strapped state and local governments, public investment in alternative energy, and other measures.'b'Last week Hillary Clinton offered a broadly similar but somewhat larger proposal. (It also includes aid to families having trouble paying heating bills, which seems like a clever way to put cash in the hands of people likely to spend it.) The Edwards and Clinton proposals both contain provisions for bigger stimulus if the economy worsens.'b'And you have to say that Mrs. Clinton seems comfortable with and knowledgeable about economic policy. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the Hillary-haters will find some reason  that\xe2\x80\x99s a bad thing, but there\xe2\x80\x99s something to be said for presidents who know what they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.'b'The Obama campaign\xe2\x80\x99s initial response to the latest wave of bad economic news was, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say, disreputable: Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s top economic adviser claimed that the  long-term tax-cut plan the candidate announced months ago is just what we need to keep the slump from \xe2\x80\x9cmorphing into a drastic decline in consumer spending.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hmm: claiming that the candidate is all-seeing, and that a tax cut originally proposed for other reasons is also a recession-fighting measure \xe2\x80\x94  doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that sound familiar?'b'Anyway, on Sunday  Mr. Obama came out with a real stimulus plan. As was the case with his health care plan, which fell short of universal coverage, his stimulus proposal is similar to those of the other Democratic candidates, but tilted to the right.'b'For example, the Obama plan appears to contain none of the alternative energy initiatives that are in both the Edwards and Clinton proposals, and emphasizes across-the-board tax cuts over both aid to the hardest-hit families and help for state and local governments. I know that Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s supporters hate to hear this, but he really is less progressive than his rivals on matters of domestic policy.'b'In short, the stimulus debate offers a pretty good portrait of the men and woman who would be president. And I haven\xe2\x80\x99t said a word about their hairstyles.'b'AIDS appears to be making an alarming comeback. The Journal of the American Medical Association reports that the incidence of H.I.V. infection among gay men is shooting up, following an encouraging period of decline. The rise of infections among younger gay men, especially black and Hispanic men, is troubling, and the study carries the clear implication that people at high risk of contracting the disease are becoming less cautious.'b'Statistics gathered by New York City health officials show that new diagnoses of H.I.V. infection \xe2\x80\x94 the virus that causes AIDS \xe2\x80\x94 in gay men under age 30 rose 32 percent between 2001 and 2006. Among black and Hispanic men, the figure was 34 percent. Most troubling, the number of new diagnoses among the youngest men in the study, those between ages 13 and 19, doubled.'b'New York officials say increased alcohol and drug use may be partly responsible since they make unprotected sex more likely. Other basic precautions, including finding out whether a potential partner is infected, are also apparently being ignored.'b'The one bright spot in this bleak picture was the 22 percent decline in infections among men over 30 in the New York study. Awareness of the disease\xe2\x80\x99s devastating effects, as much as maturity, may explain the difference. A large number of these older men came of age when AIDS was all but untreatable. They may have buried friends who died after being horribly ill.'b'When the disease was new and terrifying, the gay community helped change behavior by preaching loudly against taking sexual risks. From San Francisco to New York, bathhouses notorious for promoting casual sex changed the way they did business or closed down. Condoms were encouraged, and so was H.I.V. testing. \xe2\x80\x9cSilence equals death\xe2\x80\x9d was the motto of the day.'b'Silence now seems to be winning the day. Nearly 6,000 gay men died of AIDS in the United States in 2005;  still, many young men appear to have persuaded themselves that the infection is no longer such a big deal. It is true that antiretroviral therapy has improved the outlook for anyone who becomes infected. But the treatments are still too new to know whether they can work much beyond a decade. Public health officials need to continue to distribute condoms, encourage testing and treat those who are ill. Leaders in the hardest-hit communities need to start speaking out again. The fight against AIDS is far from over.'b'The Consumer Electronics Show, held in Las Vegas last week, pitched a sleek and shiny Star Trek future where myriad clever devices would satisfy our every need.

Toshiba\xe2\x80\x99s high-definition DVD technology just suffered what could be a mortal blow when Warner Brothers announced that it would back Sony\xe2\x80\x99s rival Blu-ray standard. The battle over the DVD standard recalls the video wars of the 1980s\xe2\x80\x94 which Matsushita's VHS won over Sony\xe2\x80\x99s Betamax after it secured the backing of most studios. The tussle underscores how standards, as well as tastes, can make or break innovations. Despite lower operating costs, gas-powered refrigerators failed because giants like Westinghouse and G.E. invested in electric refrigerators and backed the spread of electric power."b'A successful innovation provides benefits that are greater than its costs \xe2\x80\x94including the hassle of adopting a new technology. Radio expanded much faster than clothes washers in the 1920s because people already had other ways to wash clothes. But washers eventually caught up as they were useful too. Still, this cost-benefit analysis is anything but simple. The MiniDisc looked like a sensible digital technology to replace the cassette tape, but it never caught on among consumers.'b'There is something breathtaking about this process at the heart of modern capitalism. The promise of a blockbuster will keep driving companies to develop yet another gadget and some will hit the jackpot with an 'b'iPod'b' or a Nintendo Wii. But most won\xe2\x80\x99t.

Plastic bags and sacks vibrate, emitting the sounds of things pulled apart, scavenged.'b'By day the rats disappear, the dogs are quiet, and men, women, children reappear. The traffic, normally chaotic, here and there is stopped by overturned garbage cans and the trash that blocks the streets. The garbage \xe2\x80\x94 thousands of tons of it \xe2\x80\x94 has gone uncollected for three weeks, because all the available landfills are full. The evil odor of decomposition and burning waste moves down the hills of refuse and slides along the streets, enters shops, doorways, houses.'b'But this city, a million people,  keeps going.  What makes people angry is not the inhabitants of the suburb of Pianura heatedly protesting the reopening of a garbage dump near their houses, but the more general acquiescence of Naples, the habit of surviving in inefficiency and disorder. Crime, in this city, has become a destiny; it has the power of things that are well known but about which there is nothing to be done.'b'The garbage in the streets is nothing new; it has decades of history behind it. That organized crime controls the garbage industry and runs a staggering number of illegal dumps,  everyone has known for a long time. That a wide range of poisons are buried in Campania, the region around Naples, and that this multiplies by the hundreds the usual risks that human life is exposed to, is known to both ordinary citizens and government officials. That illegality flourishes, and very profitably, under the umbrella of the law thanks to the intervention of politicians of every stripe is not even arguable \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s a fact, something that\xe2\x80\x99s been happening forever.'b'Take Antonio Bassolino, the former mayor of Naples and now governor of Campania. That even an honest man like him, coming from the least corrupt political tradition in Italy, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t change anything that really matters, and in fact was slowly swallowed up by the most complicitous inefficiency, is for the Neapolitan (and not only the Neapolitan) the ultimate proof that in Naples there is nothing to be done, that there remains only the quiet impotence of those who manage to get by in the rot.'b'This deep feeling makes  Prime Minister Romano Prodi\xe2\x80\x99s efforts  to clean up the mess absurd.

But nonsense that bears witness to the definitive loss of trust in institutions. A resigned loss, by people who no longer believe even in the cleanliness of other places in the world. In Naples the mountains of garbage seem the symbol of a cosmic rot. Here the rot is not only visible; it has the power of portent.'b'If you know how to look, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to understand that this stinking, polluted filth, generator of profits both legal and illegal, is not some ancient relic but very modern, and that it underlines the precariousness of every sort of order, in every part of the planet.'b'With Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s win in New Hampshire, gender issues are suddenly in the news.

Hard-core pornography is a multibillion-dollar business, having spread far beyond the stereotyped raincoat crowd to anyone with a laptop and a password.

Fifteen months ago, a gunman invaded an Amish schoolhouse in rural Pennsylvania, separated the girls from the boys, and then shot 10 of the girls, killing five.'b'The cable news channels revel in stories about women (almost always young and attractive) who come to a gruesome end at the hands of violent men.

When her own ambitions are on the line, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to reach for the sick bag.'b'On \xe2\x80\x9cMeet the Press\xe2\x80\x9d Sunday, it was the latter. Clinton refused to admit any real errors. She implied that Barack Obama is unfit to be president, without ever honestly taking responsibility for what she actually believes.'b'She broadcast her own humility: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, I\xe2\x80\x99m very other-directed. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like talking about myself.\xe2\x80\x9d She also described the central role she plays in the lives of all living creatures in the universe: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Iraqi government, they watch us, they listen to us. I know very well that they follow everything that I say.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s real problem is that she is caught in a trap, which you might call The Identity Trap.'b'Both Clinton and Obama have eagerly donned the mantle of identity politics. A Clinton victory wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just be a victory for one woman, it would be a victory for little girls everywhere. An Obama victory would be about completing the dream, keeping the dream alive, and so on.'b'Fair enough. The problem is that both the feminist movement Clinton rides and the civil rights rhetoric Obama uses were constructed at a time when the enemy was the reactionary white male establishment. Today, they are not facing the white male establishment. They are facing each other.'b'All the rhetorical devices that have been a staple of identity politics are now being exploited by the Clinton and Obama campaigns against each other. They are competing to play the victim. They are both accusing each other of insensitivity. They are both deliberately misinterpreting each other\xe2\x80\x99s comments in order to somehow imply that the other is morally retrograde.'b'All the habits of verbal thuggery that have long been used against critics of affirmative action, like Ward Connerly and Thomas Sowell, and critics of the radical feminism, like Christina Hoff Sommers, are now being turned inward by the Democratic front-runners.'b'Clinton is suffering most. She is now accused, absurdly, of being insensitive to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s talk of a \xe2\x80\x9cfairy tale,\xe2\x80\x9d which was used in the context of the Iraq debate, is now being distorted into a condemnation of the civil rights movement.

They should be judged as individuals.'b'But the entire theory of identity politics was that we are not mere individuals. We carry the perspectives of our group consciousness. Our social roles and loyalties are defined by race and gender. It\xe2\x80\x99s a black or female thing. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand.'b'Even in this moment of stress, Clinton wants to have it both ways. She wants to be emblematic of her gender and liberated from race and gender politics. As she told Tim Russert on Sunday: \xe2\x80\x9cYou have a woman running to break the highest and hardest glass ceiling.

Obama\xe2\x80\x99s campaign drew up a memo delineating all of the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 supposed racial outrages. Bill Clinton is frantically touring black radio stations to repair any wounds.'b'Meanwhile, Clinton friend Robert Johnson, a one-man gaffe machine, reminds us of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s drug use and accuses him of being like Sidney Poitier in \xe2\x80\x9cGuess Who\xe2\x80\x99s Coming to Dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d Another Clinton supporter, Gloria Steinem, notes that black men were given the vote a half-century before women.'b'This is the logical extreme of the identity politics that as been floating around this country for decades. Every revolution devours its offspring, and it seems the multicultural one does, too.'b'The final two points I\xe2\x80\x99d make are: First, this whole show seems stale and deranged to the younger set, as Obama and Clinton seemed to recognize when they damped down the feud yesterday afternoon. The interesting split is not between the feminist and civil rights Old Bulls, it\xe2\x80\x99s between the establishments of both movements, who emphasize top-down change, and the younger dissenters, who don\xe2\x80\x99t. Second, this dispute is going to be settled by the rising, and so far ignored, minority group. For all the current fighting, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be Latinos who end up determining who gets the nomination.'b'At last, a bridge to the 21st century.'b''b'Correction: 'b''b''b' An earlier version of this column mentioned Ward Churchill as a critic of affirmative action, rather than Ward Connerly. In addition, it misspelled the name of a critic of feminism: it is Christina Hoff Sommers, not Summers. 'b''b''b'Although Congress and the courts have largely frustrated the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to open up Alaska to oil and gas drilling, Vice President Dick Cheney and his industry friends remain determined to lock up as many oil and gas leases as they can before the door hits them on the way out. They are certainly not going to let the struggling polar bear stand in their way.'b'The Interior Department\xe2\x80\x99s Minerals Management Service has announced that early next month it will sell oil and gas leases on nearly 30 million acres of prime polar bear habitat in the Chukchi Sea. Meanwhile, the department\xe2\x80\x99s Fish and Wildlife Service has postponed a long-awaited decision on whether to place this iconic and troubled animal on the list of threatened species.'b'These two moves are almost certainly, and cynically, related. Listing the polar bear as threatened would trigger a range of protective actions. Delaying that listing gives the Department of Interior just enough time to move ahead with the lease sales without having to deal with the bear while avoiding an embarrassing bureaucratic squabble.'b'The listing delay was announced on a Sunday night, when few people were paying attention. H. Dale Hall, the director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, said the oil companies would have to comply with any eventual listing of the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act. But once the companies stake their claims, it would be hard to stop disruptive exploratory drilling. The delay also gives the political appointees at the Interior Department \xe2\x80\x94 notorious for meddling with science \xe2\x80\x94 time to craft a listing decision that magically excludes the oil companies from having to do much of anything to protect the bear.'b'With the possible exception of Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska, everyone agrees that the polar bear is in deep trouble. The United States Geological Survey predicts that two-thirds of the world\xe2\x80\x99s polar bears, and all of Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s, will be gone by mid-century. While the overwhelming threat is the loss of sea ice, caused in large part by global warming, invading that habitat with oil rigs would surely increase the stress on the animals.'b'Mr. Hall has been summoned before a special House subcommittee meeting this week to explain the listing delay. Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne could do the polar bear \xe2\x80\x94 and his subordinate \xe2\x80\x94 a favor by ordering a timeout and halting the lease sales for at least a year.'b'That would give his scientists more time to assess the threats to the bear and other fragile wildlife. The department could also use the time to figure out how and where drilling may safely proceed, if at all. There is no urgency to lease Alaskan waters. President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that new oil production will bring short-term relief at the pump is nonsense, since oil fields take years to develop. It is urgent to help the bears.'b'Few things are more frightening than knowing you live too far away from the nearest doctor. Yet in many rural or poor urban areas there are far too few doctors to serve the community, and the problem is getting worse.'b'Because the federal government has done too little in recent years to encourage doctors to take these less-glamorous posts, New York and other states are looking for ways to fill the gaps in medical care. Unlike some areas, New York is not lacking in medical school graduates; there are new interns out there in droves. The problem is that after they graduate, not enough of them decide to venture into the cold north upstate or the poorest urban neighborhoods.'b'New York\xe2\x80\x99s governor, Eliot Spitzer, has announced plans to create a kind of Peace Corps for doctors called \xe2\x80\x9cDoctors Across New York.\xe2\x80\x9d The idea is to help lure physicians into practicing in areas where a quarter of the state\xe2\x80\x99s population is officially underserved.'b'To make that happen, Mr. Spitzer wants to provide up to $150,000 in awards \xe2\x80\x94 for a five-year employment commitment \xe2\x80\x94 to help pay off medical school loans. Right now, the state offers a paltry $10,000 in loan forgiveness per year for two years served in one of these areas, barely a down payment on medical school debt that now averages up to $160,000.'b'Mr. Spitzer also wants to increase Medicaid reimbursement rates to doctors and clinics in these underserved areas. There could even be grants to specialists who can be persuaded to establish practices or clinics where they are most needed.'b'The Spitzer proposal is a good idea for New York. This program might still turn out to be little more than a stopgap as baby boomers age and need more care \xe2\x80\x94 while the nation\xe2\x80\x99s supply of doctors fails to keep up.

What should have been heralded as an accomplishment, however, may only serve to further reinforce the bumbling nature of President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s ill-conceived adventure in Iraq.'b'No one, it seems, has a clear sense of what the law will do. Some suggest it could actually exclude more former Baathists than it lets in \xe2\x80\x94 a sure-fire way to fuel political tensions rather than calm them.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s not what was supposed to happen. One year ago, Mr. Bush authorized a major buildup of troops as a way to create the space for Iraqis to bridge sectarian divisions and achieve benchmarks for political progress that were set in 2006. While American forces have reduced violence, Iraqis squandered the opportunity, failing to adopt a law that would guarantee equitable division of oil revenues among various groups.'b'So on Saturday when Parliament passed the long-awaited Justice and Accountability Law, we were inclined to agree with Mr. Bush that it was \xe2\x80\x9can important step toward reconciliation.\xe2\x80\x9d In a decision since regretted, American authorities dissolved the Baathist Party after the 2003 Iraq invasion and excluded most of its members from government jobs. That shredded the country\xe2\x80\x99s bureaucracy and senior military corps and embittered Sunnis, many of whom joined the insurgency. Shiites who suffered under Saddam but now dominate the government have resisted allowing their enemies to return to positions of authority. But many Baathists only joined the party out of self-preservation \xe2\x80\x94 the only way they could obtain work in their chosen professions \xe2\x80\x94 and integrating them into the work force is crucial.'b'But the new law is so riddled with caveats and loopholes that some Sunni and Shiite officials say it could actually exclude more former Baathists than it lets back into government. That includes keeping them out of militias that have assisted the Americans in combating Al Qaeda and which the Americans hoped to integrate into Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s police and military forces. As Mr. Bush praised the new law, spokesmen for the American Embassy and for the American commander were unfamiliar with it.'b'The new law appears to create the possibility of pensions for former Baathists who held top national and regional-level jobs, even if they are still excluded from employment. That\xe2\x80\x99s a plus. But that so important a law remains shrouded in mystery and confusion is inexcusable. And the fact that just more than half of the 275-member Parliament was present to vote on the measure does not inspire confidence that Shiites and Kurds really want to reach out to Sunnis.'b'Administration officials continually lower the bar for Iraq. Now they admit that the law is not perfect but say it begins to set fairer standards. Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s presidency council still must approve the law and could yet make improvements. Iraqis are going to have to do a lot better to make their country work.

Asking for identification at the polls may sound reasonable, but an Indiana law disenfranchises large numbers of people without driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses, especially poor and minority voters. If the court upholds the law, as appears likely, it will be a sad new chapter in its abandonment of voters, a group whose rights it once defended vigorously.'b'As long as there have been elections, there have been attempts to keep eligible people from voting.

In recent decades, the Supreme Court has rejected all of them.'b'The court understood that the Constitution guaranteed a robust form of democracy and saw its clear value for the nation. During the tumultuous late-1960s, Chief Justice Earl Warren declared that most of the country\xe2\x80\x99s problems could be solved through the political process if everyone \xe2\x80\x9chas the opportunity to participate on equal terms with everyone else and can share in electing representatives who will be representative of the entire community and not of some special interest.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In recent years, however, with a conservative majority in place, the court has become increasingly hostile to voters. During the oral arguments in the Bush v. Gore case in 2000, Justice Sandra Day O\xe2\x80\x99Connor showed disdain for voters who had trouble with Florida\xe2\x80\x99s disastrous punch-card ballots. After insisting that the directions \xe2\x80\x9ccouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be clearer,\xe2\x80\x9d she suggested that the court ignore the ballots of voters who had failed to master the intricacies. That is precisely what it did, by a 5-4 vote.'b'Since Bush v. Gore, disdain for voters has become the norm. The court rejected two successive challenges to gerrymandered Congressional districts. One was Tom DeLay\xe2\x80\x99s brazen redrawing of the lines in Texas, which all but guaranteed a Republican victory and made the voters seem irrelevant.'b'The justices also seem poised, if comments during oral arguments are any indication, to uphold New York\xe2\x80\x99s undemocratic process for selecting state court judges. An appeals court rightly ruled against the system of shadowy nominating conventions, which allows political machines to thwart the will of the voters and handpick judges.'b'It might seem that today\xe2\x80\x99s court is simply judicially restrained, deferring to rules adopted by the democratically elected branches. Recently, however, the court struck down parts of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law that limited \xe2\x80\x9cSwift boat\xe2\x80\x9d style attack ads on the eve of elections. It was perfectly willing to reverse a federal law when the political power of corporations and wealthy individuals was at stake.'b'The Indiana voter ID case should not be a hard one. Restrictions on voting are subject to heightened constitutional scrutiny, and the state cannot justify the enormous burdens the law imposes. There is no evidence that in-person vote fraud has ever occurred in the state, but there is considerable evidence that voters will be disenfranchised. Indiana could have deterred fraud in less harmful ways, including by accepting a wider range of ID\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'Critics of the court are already dubbing the voter ID case Bush v.

He treated everyone with respect and kindness.'b'If you\xe2\x80\x99re like most politically attuned Americans, you probably don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with my description of Mr. Romney.

The blame for this lies in the campaign he has run.'b'Early in the presidential race, Mr. Romney perceived a tactical advantage in becoming the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s social conservative. Religious conservatives and other Republicans with socially conservative views found the two early front-runners, John McCain and Rudy Giuliani, unacceptable. As someone who shares the beliefs of social conservatives, Mr. Romney saw an opportunity that he could exploit.

If the election is close, the country could end up with a rerun of 2000\xe2\x80\x99s bitterly contentious and mistrusted count. In an effort to avoid another such disaster, Representative Rush Holt, Democrat of New Jersey, plans to introduce a bill this week that would help address the weaknesses in electronic voting. Congress should pass it without delay.'b'The flaws of electronic voting machines have been thoroughly documented by academic studies and by voters\xe2\x80\x99 experiences. The machines are far too vulnerable to hacking that could change the outcomes of elections. They are also so prone to mechanical error and breakdown that there is no way to be sure that the totals they report are correct. In some cases, these machines have been known to \xe2\x80\x9cflip\xe2\x80\x9d votes \xe2\x80\x94 award votes cast for one candidate to an opponent.'b'The solution is for all votes to be recorded on paper records. Voters can then verify that their choice has been accurately reflected \xe2\x80\x94 and the paper record can be used as a backup for the electronic machines. Whenever votes are tallied on electronic machines, there should be an audit of paper records as a check on the electronic results. If the paper totals do not match the electronic tallies, something has clearly gone wrong \xe2\x80\x94 and the tally of the paper ballots can be treated as the official one.'b'As voters have learned about the problems with electronic voting, they have sensibly pressed their representatives to adopt laws requiring voter-verified paper records. Most states, including New York, Ohio and California have now done so. Mr. Holt\xe2\x80\x99s bill would make money available on an expedited basis \xe2\x80\x94 in time for this year\xe2\x80\x99s election \xe2\x80\x94 for jurisdictions that still have not.'b'In addition to money for upgrading to paper-based voting, the bill would provide funds to conduct audits of paper records. It rightly prods jurisdictions to adopt optical-scan voting, in which ballots are marked by hand, much like a standardized test, and then fed into a computer for tabulation. Optical scans are the most reliable, efficient and cost-effective technology available. The bill also allows jurisdictions to use the money to switch to simple paper ballots that are counted by hand.'b'Because the bill is opt-in \xe2\x80\x94 it does not force any jurisdiction to make changes \xe2\x80\x94 it has not drawn the entrenched opposition from local election officials that mandatory paper-record bills have met. The ultimate solution to the problem of electronic voting is a national law requiring voter-verified paper records, something Congress has been inexcusably slow in adopting. As a temporary measure, however, Mr. Holt\xe2\x80\x99s legislation is a good step forward.'b'Time to upgrade voting machines before this year\xe2\x80\x99s presidential election is short, but it is not yet too late. Congress should pass the Holt bill quickly. In the meantime, eligible states and localities should prepare to apply for the money and to put in place voting systems that voters can trust.'b'Every year, the Supreme Court hears arguments in cases that can change the nation and reshape American rights. Just last week, it heard arguments on a challenge to a harsh Indiana voter ID law, a partisan scheme to disenfranchise poor and minority voters. It was, like many legal showdowns in the court, something Americans would have been interested in observing firsthand. Yet beyond a few hundred visitors, the public was denied that opportunity because members of the court, stubbornly clinging to their clubby ways, refuse to allow their proceedings to be televised.'b'Chief Justice John Roberts even declined a news media request that he release an audio recording as soon as the argument ended, much as the court has done in a small number of high-interest cases since Bush v. Gore in 2000. As things stand, the audiotape in the voting case will not be available for the public until sometime after the start of the next Supreme Court term. This disdain for openness and transparency by an institution central to the nation\xe2\x80\x99s democracy is unacceptable.'b'The risk that some lawyers or justices may occasionally play for the cameras, or that news shows might use short snippets of oral arguments out of context are trivial concerns next to the main cost of the justices\xe2\x80\x99 ongoing camera shyness, which is to inhibit robust, timely, and well-informed discourse on the important, often vexing legal and social issues that land at the court.'b'The Supreme Court began two years ago making transcripts of oral arguments promptly available on the court\xe2\x80\x99s Web site. That is some progress, but dry transcripts are no substitute for letting Americans watch for themselves.'b'Justice Clarence Thomas told a Senate hearing last year that televising the court would have a negative impact on its argument sessions and would raise security concerns \xe2\x80\x9cas members of the court who now have some degree of anonymity would lose their anonymity.\xe2\x80\x9d We are all for protecting justices, but some loss of privacy goes with the territory, and the justices are hardly anonymous.

The two companies that reap billions from the drug had been cynically sitting on the results for more than a year.'b'The drug, Zetia, and a combination pill that contains it, Vytorin, are made by Merck and Schering-Plough and used by millions of patients. They generated more than $5 billion in sales last year. The companies sponsored a clinical trial of the drug\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness in hopes that positive results would strengthen their marketing efforts.'b'The trial was conducted in 720 European patients with genes that cause abnormally high cholesterol levels. For two years, the patients received either Zocor, an older cholesterol drug, or Vytorin, a combination of Zocor and Zetia. The assumption was that Vytorin would reduce the growth of fatty plaques \xe2\x80\x94 a risk factor for heart attacks and strokes \xe2\x80\x94 more than Zocor alone. As it turned out, the plaques grew almost twice as fast in patients taking the Vytorin.'b'There are reasons to be cautious about interpreting these results. The number of patients was relatively small. And many of them may have used different drug treatments for years before entering the trial, possibly diminishing the effectiveness of adding Zetia.'b'The companies\xe2\x80\x99 grudging release of the data has raised disturbing questions. A House committee will explore whether they withheld the results lest they interfere with sales and only released them under pressure from Congress and news media reports. Whatever the committee discovers, the experience is one more argument for why scientists involved in studies sponsored by drug companies must insist on the right to review and release data. A new law that strengthens the penalties for companies that do not release data promptly should help.'b'The findings also raise doubts about the current belief that lowering cholesterol is the key to cardiovascular health. The study showed that Vytorin reduced bad cholesterol significantly more than Zocor alone. The problem was that it failed to reduce the formation of plaque.'b'The companies are conducting three large clinical trials to test whether Vytorin can nevertheless reduce heart attacks and strokes. Results won\xe2\x80\x99t be available until at least 2011. Meanwhile, with no evidence of effectiveness in plaque-reduction, it seems clear that Zetia and Vytorin should be used sparingly, in cases where all other cholesterol drugs have failed.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cBush Urges Unity Against Iran as It Agrees to Cooperate With Nuclear Agency\xe2\x80\x9d (news article, Jan. 14):'b'President Bush continues to beat a dead horse in his attempts to persuade the Arab world to take a hostile stance against Iran.'b'The Arab states of the Gulf region are deeply tied to Iran by historical ethnic and economic ties.'b'The United Arab Emirates alone are the repository for hundreds of millions of dollars (and euros) of Iranian investment.'b'Powerful bilingual trading families span the Gulf, with members in both Iran and Arab states.

Much like the hypocrisy of the dealers who have resisted Tata\xe2\x80\x99s bid for Jaguar on the grounds that Indian ownership would erode the brand\xe2\x80\x99s prestige.'b'The sad fact is that the world has changed since Americans celebrated the egalitarian breakthrough of the Ford Model T. We know now that gas-driven automobiles do terrible damage to the environment, and the notion of loosing millions upon millions of new carbon emitters on our planet is not something to celebrate.'b'So while we admire Mr. Tata\xe2\x80\x99s business and engineering acumen in creating the Nano, we ardently wish that he would focus his talents elsewhere: creating transportation that is both affordable and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t emit ever more greenhouse gases. That would be something for the whole world to celebrate and buy.'b'Rochester'b'IN the days before Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s Republican presidential primary in Michigan, Mitt Romney and John McCain battled over what the government owes to workers who lose their jobs because of the foreign competition unleashed by free trade. Their rhetoric differed \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Romney said he would \xe2\x80\x9cfight for every single job,\xe2\x80\x9d while Mr. McCain said some jobs \xe2\x80\x9care not coming back\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 but their proposed policies were remarkably similar: educate and retrain the workers for new jobs.'b'All economists know that when American jobs are outsourced, Americans as a group are net winners. What we lose through lower wages is more than offset by what we gain through lower prices. In other words, the winners can more than afford to compensate the losers. Does that mean they ought to? Does it create a moral mandate for the taxpayer-subsidized retraining programs proposed by Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney?'b'Um, no. Even if you\xe2\x80\x99ve just lost your job, there\xe2\x80\x99s something fundamentally churlish about blaming the very phenomenon that\xe2\x80\x99s elevated you above the subsistence level since the day you were born. If the world owes you compensation for enduring the downside of trade, what do you owe the world for enjoying the upside?'b'I doubt there\xe2\x80\x99s a human being on earth who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t benefited from the opportunity to trade freely with his neighbors. Imagine what your life would be like if you had to grow your own food, make your own clothes and rely on your grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s home remedies for health care. Access to a trained physician might reduce the demand for grandma\xe2\x80\x99s home remedies, but \xe2\x80\x94 especially at her age \xe2\x80\x94 she\xe2\x80\x99s still got plenty of reason to be thankful for having a doctor.'b'Some people suggest, however, that it makes sense to isolate the moral effects of a single new trading opportunity or free trade agreement. Surely we have fellow citizens who are hurt by those agreements, at least in the limited sense that they\xe2\x80\x99d be better off in a world where trade flourishes, except in this one instance. What do we owe those fellow citizens?'b'One way to think about that is to ask what your moral instincts tell you in analogous situations. Suppose, after years of buying shampoo at your local pharmacy, you discover you can order the same shampoo for less money on the Web. Do you have an obligation to compensate your pharmacist? If you move to a cheaper apartment, should you compensate your landlord? When you eat at McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s, should you compensate the owners of the diner next door? Public policy should not be designed to advance moral instincts that we all reject every day of our lives.'b'In what morally relevant way, then, might displaced workers differ from displaced pharmacists or displaced landlords? You might argue that pharmacists and landlords have always faced cutthroat competition and therefore knew what they were getting into, while decades of tariffs and quotas have led manufacturing workers to expect a modicum of protection. That expectation led them to develop certain skills, and now it\xe2\x80\x99s unfair to pull the rug out from under them.'b'Once again, that argument does not mesh with our everyday instincts. For many decades, schoolyard bullying has been a profitable occupation. All across America, bullies have built up skills so they can take advantage of that opportunity. If we toughen the rules to make bullying unprofitable, must we compensate the bullies?'b'Bullying and protectionism have a lot in common. They both use force (either directly or through the power of the law) to enrich someone else at your involuntary expense. If you\xe2\x80\x99re forced to pay $20 an hour to an American for goods you could have bought from a Mexican for $5 an hour, you\xe2\x80\x99re being extorted. When a free trade agreement allows you to buy from the Mexican after all, rejoice in your liberation \xe2\x80\x94 even if Mr. McCain, Mr. Romney and the rest of the presidential candidates don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to.'b'Chicago'b'HE will always be a rookie to me, but Jimmy Rollins, the reigning National League most valuable player, once gave me a poignant piece of wisdom that typically would flow from mentor to mentee, not the other way around. \xe2\x80\x9cDo it afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d was his advice \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s a lesson Major League Baseball had best learn if it is to put the age of steroids behind it.'b'A healthy amount of fear can lead to great results, to people pushing themselves to the brink of their capabilities. I can recall an opening day when I was a Chicago Cub getting set to face the Florida Marlins and hearing Mark Grace explain to the young players how he still got butterflies even after all his years in the majors.'b'Yes, baseball players are afraid. Not just on opening day and not just because of the 400-page Mitchell report and not just because of a Congressional hearing on performance-enhancing drugs in baseball \xe2\x80\x94 like the one that took place Tuesday \xe2\x80\x94  but because they always have been afraid. A player\xe2\x80\x99s career is always a blink in a stare. I retired at the ripe old age of 34 following a season of sunflower seeds and only 162 at-bats. I had been a starter the year before. In this game, change happens fast.'b'Human nature wants to put the brakes on that rate of change. While your clock is ticking, faster, stronger and younger players are setting up their lockers next to yours. They usually have better sound bites and lower salaries, too. In 1998, I was the new kid in Philadelphia, battling Lenny Dysktra for the center field job. Five years later, I was mentoring another new kid, Marlon Byrd, so he could replace me. Faced with that rate of career atrophy, players are capable of rash, self-serving and often irresponsible decisions. Enter steroids.'b'There is a tipping point in a player\xe2\x80\x99s career where he goes from chasing the dream to running from a nightmare. At that point, ambition is replaced with anxiety, passion is replaced with survival. It is a downhill run and it spares no one.'b'For me, it started with a pop in 2003, while I was running out a routine ground ball in Texas. A torn tendon, two months of rehab, a Triple-A stint and 30 days of playing with a limp left me spending more time getting ready for the game than actually playing, and that changed my priorities, forever.'b'It was my first trip to the disabled list. I realized I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just roll out of bed and play anymore. All of a sudden, I felt old. It was the moment when a player is faced with the choice between aging naturally or aging artificially. I chose door number one, and two years later it was Triple-A or bust. Those who chose door number two ... well, you know the rest.'b'To explain the ice water in his veins, Michael Jordan once declared, \xe2\x80\x9cfear is an illusion.\xe2\x80\x9d But I think fear is real and every bit as much a part of baseball as popcorn and peanuts. I remember learning on my first trip to Dodger Stadium that \xe2\x80\x9cno one wants to strike out here because it is a long walk to the dugout.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The newest round of Congressional hearings danced around Miguel Tejada, the remorse of baseball leadership and a lot of could haves, should haves, and might haves. Moving forward, we must openly address not only the drug issues plaguing the sports we love, but the culture of fear that shakes our society.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re scared of failure, aging, vulnerability, leaving too soon, being passed up \xe2\x80\x94 and in the quest to conquer these fears, we are inspired by those who do whatever it takes to rise above and beat these odds. We call it \xe2\x80\x9cdrive\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cambition,\xe2\x80\x9d but when doing \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever it takes\xe2\x80\x9d leads us down the wrong road, it can erode our humanity. The game ends up playing us.'b'So let the rookie teach us all something important. Just do it, but do it ... afraid.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cWe Still Need the Big Guns,\xe2\x80\x9d by Charles J.

If the United States follows General Dunlap\xe2\x80\x99s advice and \xe2\x80\x9csubstitutes machines for the bodies of young Americans,\xe2\x80\x9d we will become more willing to go to war since our society will become even more divorced from war\xe2\x80\x99s visceral cost in human lives.'b'Does anyone think that participating in more wars that we have proved historically incapable of winning sounds like a good idea?'b'Travis Sharp'b'\nWashington, Jan. 9, 2008'b''b''b'The writer is a military policy analyst at the Center for Arms Control and Nonproliferation.'b''b'Washington'b'JOHN McCAIN has gone from Republican front-runner to road kill to front-runner again over the past year. Now, after Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s victory in  the Michigan primary on Tuesday, Mr. McCain\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy is again back up in the air \xe2\x80\x94 and with it the entire Republican presidential race.'b'There is a reason  Republican primary voters are so confused by Mr. McCain. He is a Republican who is disliked by the hard core of his party but loved by many independents and Democrats. He is almost universally regarded as a moderate and a maverick, a combination that independents love and conservatives loathe. The trouble with this widespread understanding of Mr. McCain\xe2\x80\x99s politics is that it is entirely wrong.'b'Mr. McCain\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to squabble with his fellow party members makes him look more like a moderate than he really is \xe2\x80\x94 which is why independents and Democrats turned out to vote for him in New Hampshire and Michigan. He has certainly squabbled with the conservative establishment. He initially voted against the Bush tax cuts. He denounced Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson as \xe2\x80\x9cagents of intolerance.\xe2\x80\x9d He battled with his fellow Republicans over pork-barrel spending and campaign finance reform. He feuded with the White House over torture and Guant\xc3\xa1namo.'b'But there is a radical difference between disagreeing with your fellow conservatives and fudging on basic principles. Mr. McCain has a solid record on the defining principles of the modern conservative movement \xe2\x80\x94 traditional values, the free market and national defense \xe2\x80\x94 a record that is far more solid on these core beliefs than Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'In fact, Mr. McCain\xe2\x80\x99s squabbles with his fellow conservatives have almost always been in the name of fundamental conservative principles. He opposed torture because he thought it was a violation of the American tradition of respect for human life and human rights. He opposed President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s tax cuts because he thought the goal of small government required Congress  to cut spending also.  He excoriated pork-barrel spending and unlimited campaign donations because he thinks these practices institutionalize bad (and big) government. He promoted immigration reform because he thought the \xe2\x80\x9cconservative\xe2\x80\x9d alternative (encouraging illegal immigrants to go home) is unworkable economically and dubious morally. Business interests, which have been growing disenchanted with the Republicans, would hardly disagree.'b'Mr. McCain\xe2\x80\x99s basic political insight \xe2\x80\x94 that there is a distinction between the constituencies in the conservative movement and the principles of conservative governance \xe2\x80\x94 provides the Republican Party with the best available solution to its problem this November: the unpopularity of the Republican establishment. Not only can he argue that the establishment has put expedience above  principle, but he can also tout his own record in battling that establishment.'b'The conservative movement is  engaged in a lively debate about the future of the Reagan coalition of pro-business Republicans, social conservatives and defense hawks. Ed Rollins, the former Reagan adviser who now works for Mike Huckabee, argues that the coalition is dead and that a new one must be created. Mr. Huckabee would tilt the party away from people who look like Mr. Romney and toward people who look like himself \xe2\x80\x94 blue-collar social conservatives. Pragmatists like Mr. Romney argue that they could stitch the coalition back together and then manage it better.'b'Mr. McCain offers a third way for conservatives: stick to the core principles while feuding with movement barons like James Dobson and Grover Norquist.'b'There are dangers in McCainism. Directly confronting the Republican Party\xe2\x80\x99s contradictions could plunge it into a civil war. But the prospect of a Democratic presidency \xe2\x80\x94 particularly a Hillary Clinton presidency \xe2\x80\x94 would surely avert that. A more worrisome possibility is that McCainism relies so much on a single man, one who is now 71 years old. Margaret Thatcher similarly uprooted the Conservative establishment in Britain only to leave her party with an identity crisis when she left office.'b'That said, there are still good reasons  Mr. McCain is worth the risks his candidacy would pose. His moderate image would serve him well in a general election. More important, Mr. McCain is more likely than any of his rivals to offer conservatives what they want: a vigorous pursuit of the fight against terrorism, the appointment of conservative judges, retrenchment and reform of government.'b'Over the coming months the conservative voters who are so suspicious of Mr. McCain will have to decide whether their loyalties lie with their beliefs or with their interest groups. And the independent voters who warm to him will have to ask whether they really want another conservative in the White House.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cA Hereditary Perk the Founding Fathers Failed to Anticipate,\xe2\x80\x9d by Adam Liptak (Sidebar column, Jan. 15):'b'My dad, born in Russia, had to drop out of Baldwin-Wallace to get a job. He got a huge kick out of my getting into Yale in 1974. In 2006, when my hard-working daughter got in, it occurred to me that we had suddenly become an Old Blue Family. My husband and I now have a houseguest who is dancing with Alvin Ailey. She, too, is a legacy \xe2\x80\x94 her Vietnamese mom went to Yale. (Her African-American dad went to Harvard.)'b'Maybe legacy used to mean ancestral advantage because of Old Money or Mayflower connections. But while the system is far from pretty, the legacy club does accept new members. If your son gets into Colgate, Carleton, Pomona or Princeton, your grandson may have a toe in the door. He still needs to get the rest of his body in on his own, however, and that\xe2\x80\x99s not easy.  Carol Weston'b'New York, Jan. 15, 2008'b'President Bush is discussing a new agreement with Baghdad that would govern the deployment of American troops in Iraq. With so many Americans adamant about bringing our forces home as soon as possible, a sentiment we strongly share, Mr. Bush must not be allowed to tie the hands of his successor and ensure the country\xe2\x80\x99s continued involvement in an open-ended war.'b'Given what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake in Iraq in terms of American and Iraqi lives lost, national treasure and broad national security interests, the negotiations on any new agreement must be fully transparent \xe2\x80\x94 which they are not. The national debate must be vigorous and thoughtful, and then Congress must vote on whatever deal results.'b'The White House and the Iraqi government decided in December to pursue the pact as a way to define long-term relations between the two countries, including the legal status of American military forces in Iraq. The ostensible goal is a more durable political, economic and security relationship than is possible under a United Nations resolution, the current international legal basis for the American military presence in Iraq.'b'Iraqi officials, increasingly unhappy with restrictions on sovereignty because of the presence of 160,000 foreign troops, have said that they won\xe2\x80\x99t extend the United Nations mandate beyond this year. A Washington-Baghdad deal would have to take its place for the troops to stay.'b'Formal negotiations won\xe2\x80\x99t start until February and few details are known, but already the two sides are laying down markers. The Iraqi defense minister, Abdul Qadir \xe2\x80\x94 apparently tone-deaf to the American political debate \xe2\x80\x94 told The Times\xe2\x80\x99s Thom Shanker that his nation would not be able to take full responsibility for its internal security until 2012 or be able to defend its own borders from external threat at least until 2018.'b'That is far too long for most Americans, but not for Mr. Bush, who is quite comfortable leaving American troops fighting in Iraq for another decade.'b'A related issue concerns whether the agreement would grant assurances that America would help Iraq defend against foreign aggression \xe2\x80\x94 something a senior White House official says has not been ruled out. That\xe2\x80\x99s a worrying prospect. Such guarantees could further encourage Iraqi dependence on the American military and might draw the United States into a regional conflict.'b'Among other questions still to be answered are how long the United States wants basing rights in Iraq and how it might assuage Iraqis demanding the right to try American troops and contractors accused of killing civilians and other misdeeds. (The United States almost always brings troops home for trial.)'b'Mr. Bush is rushing to complete a deal before he leaves office in January 2009. That is just as reckless and irresponsible as most of his decisions regarding Iraq. America\xe2\x80\x99s interests demand that his successor has maximum flexibility to plot a course, which we hope includes a quick and orderly withdrawal of troops.'b'One way to ensure that flexibility is to make sure that Congress approves any deal with Iraq, as leading Democrats, including Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, are insisting. The time for Congressional intervention is now.'b'After watching the subject of race intrude on the primaries last week, and become even more prominent this week, we were relieved that Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama called a truce Tuesday night.'b'The last thing Americans need is a loony debate over whether it is more important to choose the first woman or the first African-American nominee for president. That threatens to alienate voters more than they are already and obscures the fact that an American party actually managed to create that choice.'b'The presence of Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton should have made talk of race or gender academic. But Mr. Obama seized the mantle of change and upset Mrs. Clinton in Iowa in part by drawing away her support among women. By the time the campaigns got to New Hampshire, the Clinton team was panicking. Mrs. Clinton had to win or risk being out of the primaries entirely.'b'It was clearly her side that first stoked the race and gender issue. Mrs. Clinton mentioned in a debate in New Hampshire that a woman president would be a change for America. It was an offhand comment, and obviously true. But the next day, at events we attended, Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s surrogates were pushing hard the line that a woman president would be \xe2\x80\x9cthe real\xe2\x80\x9d change.'b'Mrs. Clinton followed up with her strange references to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and President Lyndon Johnson \xe2\x80\x94 and no matter how many times she tried to reframe the quote, the feeling hung in the air that she was denigrating America\xe2\x80\x99s most revered black leader.'b'Then the staff and surrogates got involved. Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s team circulated lists of supposedly racially insensitive quotes from Mrs. Clinton. Her staff and supporters, including the over-the-top former President Bill Clinton, went beyond Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s maladroit comments \xe2\x80\x94 and started blaming Mr. Obama for the mess.'b'Robert Johnson, the founder of Black Entertainment Television, compared Mr. Obama to Sidney Poitier\xe2\x80\x99s character in \xe2\x80\x9cGuess Who\xe2\x80\x99s Coming to Dinner\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a black man trying to insert himself into white society.

Hirsh'b'Washington, Jan. 16, 2008'b'By upholding New York\xe2\x80\x99s machine-dominated system for selecting judges, the Supreme Court has dealt another setback to voters. The court has once again allowed political bosses to rig elections in ways that deny voters a meaningful role. New York\xe2\x80\x99s political power brokers are no doubt cheering, but they should not be allowed to triumph. Even if New York\xe2\x80\x99s method of selecting judges is constitutional, it remains unfair and undemocratic. It needs to be replaced.'b'New York State Supreme Court justices \xe2\x80\x94 who despite their titles are trial-level judges \xe2\x80\x94 are selected through a byzantine process. Primary voters select judicial delegates, who then meet in party conventions to choose their nominees. The conventions are generally controlled by political bosses, who often steer the nominations to candidates who deliver patronage back to the party machine. It\xe2\x80\x99s a disgraceful way to choose judges. They are supposed to be above politics.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s also a system that makes the voters almost irrelevant. At the polls, they have to choose among judicial delegate slates \xe2\x80\x94 when there are competing slates at all \xe2\x80\x94 filled with unfamiliar names. It is a far cry from an actual party primary in which voters are allowed to choose among competing judicial candidates. The New York-based United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in ruling against the system, declared that it unacceptably burdened the constitutional rights of both candidates and voters.'b'The Supreme Court, unfortunately, disagreed. Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority, dismissed the idea that the right of association requires a process by which voters have a meaningful opportunity to affect an election\xe2\x80\x99s outcome. The ruling is consistent with the court\xe2\x80\x99s recent decisions upholding the right of political bosses to gerrymander political districts. These days, the only election complaints that seem to move the court are ones by corporations and wealthy individuals who object to limits on their ability to spend on elections.'b'Four justices, in concurring opinions, cast doubt on the wisdom of New York\xe2\x80\x99s method of choosing judges. Justices Anthony Kennedy and Stephen Breyer noted that if the rules \xe2\x80\x9cdo not produce both the perception and the reality of a system committed to the highest ideals of the law, they ought to be changed and to be changed now.\xe2\x80\x9d Justices John Paul Stevens and David Souter quoted Thurgood Marshall: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Constitution does not prohibit legislatures from enacting stupid laws.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A stupid \xe2\x80\x94 and undemocratic \xe2\x80\x94 law is precisely what New York has. Now that the cudgel of a court order has been removed, we hope the Legislature will summon the wisdom and integrity to fix the system voluntarily.'b'The odds of that happening are long, since the powers that be in the Legislature are the same ones that profit from the current corrupt system. It is, however, a cause that everyone who cares about a qualified and independent judiciary needs to keep fighting.'b'The big fat immigration bill that died last year in Congress was, for all its flaws, an anchor that kept debate tethered firmly to reality. Like it or not, it contained specific remedies for the border and the workplace. It had a plan for clearing backlogs in legal immigration and managing its future flow. Perhaps most critical, it dealt with the 12 million illegal immigrants already here, through a tough path to earned citizenship.'b'Unmoored from a comprehensive federal bill, the debate was pushed into the states and is now floating in the La-La Land of the presidential campaign. The Republicans have been battling over the sincerity of their sound bites and trying to make their fixation on one dimension of the problem \xe2\x80\x94 tough border and workplace enforcement \xe2\x80\x94 sound like the solution.'b'But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t, of course, because it ignores the fundamental question of what to do about the undocumented 12 million. A locked-down border won\xe2\x80\x99t affect them. There is no way to round them up and move them out all at once. Not even the most eagerly anti-immigration candidate would dare talk about detention camps. Amnesty is a Republican curse word. So what\xe2\x80\x99s the plan?'b'This is the cavernous hole in anti-immigration policy that its proponents want to cover with chain link and razor wire.

It would mean constant ID checks for everyone \xe2\x80\x94 citizens, too \xe2\x80\x94 with immigration police at the federal, state and local levels. It would mean enlisting bureaucrats and snoops to keep an eye on landlords, renters, laborers, loiterers and everyone who uses government services or gets sick.'b'Worst of all, it\xe2\x80\x99s weak on law and order. It is a free pass to the violent criminals we urgently need to hunt down and deport. Attrition means waiting until we stumble across bad people hiding in the vast illegal immigrant haystack. Comprehensive reform, by bringing the undocumented out of the shadows, shrinks the haystack.'b'Fred Thompson has been perhaps the most vocal defender of attrition. But on Wednesday, the newly restrictionist Mike Huckabee one-upped him by signing the \xe2\x80\x9cNo Amnesty\xe2\x80\x9d pledge of the nativist group NumbersUSA, formally committing to the principle that all 12 million illegal immigrants must be expelled. Americans, naturally, have no earthly idea how he would accomplish that.'b'Even if you accept the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 view of immigration policy as warfare against illegal immigrants, their tactics are the rejects of history, starting with that Vietnam-evoking \xe2\x80\x9cattrition.\xe2\x80\x9d The border wall is right from Monsieur Maginot\xe2\x80\x99s playbook \xe2\x80\x94 fortifying just one of two international borders even though at least 40 percent of illegal immigrants arrive perfectly legally and then overstay their visas.'b'The attrition fantasy is now, by default, the national immigration strategy. The government is essentially committed to expelling all illegal immigrants, not assimilating them. Instead of bringing its power to bear, Washington has gladly handed the task to a motley collection of state and local governments, each enforcing its own rules, often at cross purposes.'b'Now, attrition is threatening to become a bipartisan disaster. The SAVE Act, an enforcement-only bill, was introduced last year by a Democrat, Representative Heath Shuler of North Carolina, and the notoriously restrictionist Republicans Brian Bilbray and Tom Tancredo. It is gaining sponsors.'b'The Republican stance on immigration leaves an opening that opponents could drive a truck through. The Democratic candidates have the better position but approach the subject with eggshell timidity. They should stand up for a real debate, and a better country, by forcefully challenging the Republicans on this issue.'b'Aiken, S.C.'b'Across the past eight years, no one has worked harder at a political remake for this state\xe2\x80\x99s conservative-steeped presidential primary than Senator John McCain. He took care to pronounce the nation Christian and made peace with the Bible Belt\xe2\x80\x99s evangelical political bosses after angrily sassing them in his disastrous 2000 run here.'b'Now wooing the party machine after flourishing as its maverick, Mr. McCain reversed himself to endorse President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s deficit-feeding tax cuts after initially opposing them and is portraying the happy warrior offering expiation to the party. (He literally embraced Mr. Bush in signing on to the president\xe2\x80\x99s re-election tour four years ago.)'b'The senator can be heard this week furiously defending Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s Iraq war and drawing big cheers from crowds as he approaches the Saturday primary vote, looking for a second chance at the nomination. He\xe2\x80\x99s counting on party history since 1980 \xe2\x80\x94 aiming to be another of the New Hampshire and South Carolina double-winners who have consistently secured the nomination.'b'Significantly, he\xe2\x80\x99s remembering to defend against more of the midnight smears that staggered him in 2000. Mr. McCain is even dealing creatively with that campaign\xe2\x80\x99s vicious canard, that he fathered a black daughter out of wedlock. This time, his wife and campaign literature offer beguiling \xe2\x80\x94 strategically pro-life \xe2\x80\x94 images of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s adoption at Mother Teresa\xe2\x80\x99s clinic.'b'The McCain profile is to embody patriotism itself, just as his nearest competitor, Mike Huckabee, embraces Christianity in seeking the heavy evangelical vote. This has set up a kind of Flag-vs.-Cross showdown, with Mr. McCain building a surprising lead in state polls \xe2\x80\x94 for what they\xe2\x80\x99re worth in a year when voters seem to be rummaging through the G.O.P. possibilities, more than settling on one.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m shocked at his turnaround the last three nights,\xe2\x80\x9d said David Woodard, a political science professor and overseer of Clemson University\xe2\x80\x99s poll, which found a seven-point McCain lead suddenly blooming. \xe2\x80\x9cMy sense is McCain\xe2\x80\x99s a known commodity, and people are just kind of settling on him.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The second-look syndrome reached the point where South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s largest newspaper, The State, praised the senator\xe2\x80\x99s integrity in its endorsement. The editor apologized on his blog for preferring Mr. Bush eight years ago \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cmuch to our later regret.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'From village centers to rib joints, Mr. McCain has been relentlessly appealing to the state\xe2\x80\x99s big bloc of retired veterans and military personnel. His warm-up witness here was a teary-eyed father convinced that a McCain presidency is the only way to assure that the death of his son in Iraq was not in vain.'b'After the \xe2\x80\x9cStars and Stripes Forever\xe2\x80\x9d soundtrack died down, Mr. McCain was a study in angry resolve as he attacked Democrats for attempting to set a \xe2\x80\x9csurrender\xe2\x80\x9d date on the war. He seemed to pour his whole life\xe2\x80\x99s history as a Vietnam war hero and senator onto the hustings. \xe2\x80\x9cI will get bin Laden if I have to follow him to the gates of hell!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. McCain boomed, never mentioning his president has so far failed to do deliver on the same vow. \xe2\x80\x9cI need no on-the-job training,\xe2\x80\x9d the senator said, claiming the foreign policy moxie to defeat \xe2\x80\x9cradical Islamic extremism.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In all this, Mr. McCain is even more fascinating to watch than in 2000. In his eighth decade of life, the scarred politician with the tough-guy swagger knows that a win here is the only way the money might flow again to him to mount a serious effort in the next primaries against Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s personal fortune.'b'Mr. McCain\xe2\x80\x99s chief booster, South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s senior senator, Lindsey Graham, senses a grand opportunity. But he fears the state\xe2\x80\x99s reputation for last-minute, low-blow politicking can be lethal. He has already felt the simplistic lash of the anti-immigration issue, being booed at a party conference and hearing Mr. McCain\xe2\x80\x99s nuanced position reduced to shouts of \xe2\x80\x9cGrahamnesty!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the final hours, Mr. Graham is warily pleading with his own not to let their state be seen this time around as \xe2\x80\x9ca cesspool of politics.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To the Editor:'b'Paul Krugman (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Comeback Continent,\xe2\x80\x9d column, Jan. 11) indicates that European countries have managed to combine growth with protection of the \xe2\x80\x9csocial safety net.\xe2\x80\x9d Having just spent five months in the Benelux region of Europe, I would add that they have a sort of \xe2\x80\x9cfuture safety net\xe2\x80\x9d unlike anything found in America.'b'Their aggressive efforts to reduce waste and increase energy efficiency will give their economies an increasing advantage over ours.

European integration, in turn, has been the primary driver of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s economic revitalization.'b'Given the reality on the ground in Europe, it would be sad and ironic if American thought leaders started placing false hopes in the very same discredited economic policies that hampered Europe for decades just as their European counterparts have recognized their futility.'b'Harpriye A.

The situation actually is more complex.'b'For their taxes, Europeans receive many benefits for which most Americans must pay additional fees and payments out of pocket. Many Americans, if they have health care at all, are paying for escalating premiums and deductibles. Other Americans are saving $100,000 for each of their children\xe2\x80\x99s college education, yet European children attend for free or nearly free.'b'Millions of Americans are scraping to save the amount they will need for retirement beyond Social Security, but the European retirement system is much more generous. Many Americans pay extra for child care, or self-finance their own sick leave or parental leave after a birth, but Europeans receive all of these (and more) from their taxes.'b'When all these differences are added up, it turns out that many Americans are paying out as much as Europeans \xe2\x80\x94 we just receive a lot less for our money. The \xe2\x80\x9covertaxed European\xe2\x80\x9d is another stereotype used to scare Americans away from the European model, so it\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate that Mr. Krugman reinforced that stereotype.'b'Steven Hill'b'\nSan Francisco, Jan. 11, 2008'b''b''b'The writer is director of the political reform program for the New America Foundation.'b''b'National economic indicators may be headed downward, but the annual State of the City speech that New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg delivered Thursday was so upbeat that he proposed another round of tax breaks. The effect was perhaps a little too happy, but the mayor has earned the right to preach at least a little optimism.'b'In what the mayor termed \xe2\x80\x9ca difficult year\xe2\x80\x9d ahead, the city is staring at a possible revenue shortfall of more than $3 billion, which could rise to more than $6 billion in 2011, according to the Independent Budget Office. The numbers would likely have been much higher if not for Mr. Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s careful stewardship. Instead of spending the billions of dollars in surpluses that came his way in flush times, he paid down future obligations.'b'Mr. Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s greatest extravagance is his annual $400 property tax rebate for homeowners. It costs $250 million a year, and it does not help the huge number of New Yorkers who do not own their homes. The mayor sensibly stopped short, however, of pledging to keep the much more expensive ($1 billion) 7 percent cut in the property tax rate. That, he said, will be decided by the budget deadline in June.'b'The mayor, who has been spending more time recently on national issues, wisely focused his remarks on the formidable task of running the nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest city. He took well-earned bows for a city that is cleaner, safer and a bigger draw than ever for tourists.'b'Mr. Bloomberg acknowledged that there is still considerable work to be done, and he continues to put forward innovative solutions. Befitting someone who made his fortune in information technology, he proposed further improving services by steering citizens online. He is still fighting for congestion pricing \xe2\x80\x94 charging drivers fees to use the most clogged streets \xe2\x80\x94 to reduce traffic congestion and pollution. And in the absence of national leadership on poverty issues, he has a pilot program that aims to lift up low-income families by, among other things, paying them to keep their children in school.'b'Not all of the ideas Mr. Bloomberg put forward go down easily. He suggested that anyone arrested for a crime in New York be required to submit a DNA sample. New York is a forward-looking city, and its residents have cheered the decline in crime in recent years. But New Yorkers also value their civil liberties, something Mr. Bloomberg \xe2\x80\x94 who has done so much good for the city over the past six years \xe2\x80\x94 sometimes has a tendency to forget.'b'Mexico. Brazil. Argentina. Mexico, again. Thailand. Indonesia. Argentina, again.'b'And now, the United States.'b'The story has played itself out time and time again over the past 30 years. Global investors, disappointed with the returns they\xe2\x80\x99re getting, search for alternatives. They think they\xe2\x80\x99ve found what they\xe2\x80\x99re looking for in some country or other, and money rushes in.'b'But eventually it becomes clear that the investment opportunity wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all it seemed to be, and the money rushes out again, with nasty consequences for the former financial favorite. That\xe2\x80\x99s the story of multiple financial crises in Latin America and Asia. And it\xe2\x80\x99s also the story of the U.S. combined housing and credit bubble. These days, we\xe2\x80\x99re playing the role usually assigned to third-world economies.'b'For reasons I\xe2\x80\x99ll explain later, it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely that America will experience a recession as severe as that in, say, Argentina. But the origins of our problem are pretty much the same. And understanding those origins also helps us understand where U.S. economic policy went wrong.'b'The global origins of our current mess were actually laid out by none other than Ben Bernanke, in an influential speech he gave early in 2005, before he was named chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Bernanke asked a good question: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy is the United States, with the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest economy, borrowing heavily on international capital markets \xe2\x80\x94 rather than lending, as would seem more natural?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'His answer was that the main explanation lay not here in America, but abroad. In particular, third world economies, which had been investor favorites for much of the 1990s, were shaken by a series of financial crises beginning in 1997. As a result, they abruptly switched from being destinations for capital to sources of capital, as their governments began accumulating huge precautionary hoards of overseas assets.'b'The result, said Mr. Bernanke, was a \xe2\x80\x9cglobal saving glut\xe2\x80\x9d: lots of money, all dressed up with nowhere to go.'b'In the end, most of that money went to the United States. Why? Because, said Mr. Bernanke, of the \xe2\x80\x9cdepth and sophistication of the country\xe2\x80\x99s financial markets.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'All of this was right, except for one thing: U.S. financial markets, it turns out, were characterized less by sophistication than by sophistry, which my dictionary defines as \xe2\x80\x9ca deliberately invalid argument displaying ingenuity in reasoning in the hope of deceiving someone.\xe2\x80\x9d E.g., \xe2\x80\x9cRepackaging dubious loans into collateralized debt obligations creates a lot of perfectly safe, AAA assets that will never go bad.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In other words, the United States was not, in fact, uniquely well-suited to make use of the world\xe2\x80\x99s surplus funds. It was, instead, a place where large sums could be and were invested very badly. Directly or indirectly, capital flowing into America from global investors ended up financing a housing-and-credit bubble that has now burst, with painful consequences.'b'As I said, these consequences probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be as bad as the devastating recessions that racked third-world victims of the same syndrome. The saving grace of America\xe2\x80\x99s situation is that our foreign debts are in our own currency. This means that we won\xe2\x80\x99t have the kind of financial death spiral Argentina experienced, in which a falling peso caused the country\xe2\x80\x99s debts, which were in dollars, to balloon in value relative to domestic assets.'b'But even without those currency effects, the next year or two could be quite unpleasant.'b'What should have been done differently? Some critics say that the Fed helped inflate the housing bubble with low interest rates. But those rates were low for a good reason: although the last recession officially ended in November 2001, it was another two years before the U.S. economy began delivering convincing job growth, and the Fed was rightly concerned about the possibility of Japanese-style prolonged economic stagnation.'b'The real sin, both of the Fed and of the Bush administration, was the failure to exercise adult supervision over markets running wild.'b'It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just Alan Greenspan\xe2\x80\x99s unwillingness to admit that there was anything more than a bit of \xe2\x80\x9cfroth\xe2\x80\x9d in housing markets, or his refusal to do anything about subprime abuses. The fact is that as America\xe2\x80\x99s financial system has grown ever more complex, it has also outgrown the framework of banking regulations that used to protect us  \xe2\x80\x94  yet instead of an attempt to update that framework, all we got were paeans to the wonders of free markets.'b'Right now, Mr. Bernanke is in crisis-management mode, trying to deal with the mess his predecessor left behind. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any problems with his testimony yesterday, although I suspect that it\xe2\x80\x99s already too late to prevent a recession.'b'But let\xe2\x80\x99s hope that when the dust settles a bit, Mr. Bernanke takes the lead in talking about what needs to be done to fix a financial system gone very, very wrong.'b'Los Angeles'b'JAMIE OLIVER\xe2\x80\x99S heading up my suicide watch; so far I\xe2\x80\x99m still alive. Between the Food Network and his many cookbooks, I have managed to eat my way through three months of the writers\xe2\x80\x99 strike, the first four months of my pregnancy \xe2\x80\x94 and now the initial hours of a tentative deal between the directors\xe2\x80\x99 guild and the producers. Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting fat.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so simple to do it, I don\xe2\x80\x99t even want to show you,\xe2\x80\x9d Jamie Oliver declares in his Essex accent, before breaking down and showing me how to roast the duck. As he shoves the meat in the oven, I pay attention instead to my neighbor and his young son taking out the garbage. They can see me too \xe2\x80\x94 our tiny house is all window \xe2\x80\x94 and I sink down deeper into my burrow of blankets. But I gave up worrying about appearances months ago.

My husband, Jeremy, and I were  television writers before we were professional picket-line walkers. \xe2\x80\x9cNot good,\xe2\x80\x9d we reply, stumbling after our two 90-pound boxers. I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to think that when they say, \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s the strike?\xe2\x80\x9d they really mean, \xe2\x80\x9cWould it kill you to shower?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop grooming all at once. Although  Writers Guild of America T-shirts don\xe2\x80\x99t flatter the female form, I tried to pull myself together Monday through Thursday. Fridays, reserved for mass rallies to raise  our flagging spirits, required extra thought. Sneakers or hiking shoes? White thermal or blue?'b'These rallies are like super-saturated high school reunions. Every writer you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever worked with or slept with, admired or betrayed \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99re all there. At the first one, I elbowed my way through the crowd and right into my nemesis, who beamed at me artificially. \xe2\x80\x9cAnna, how 'b'are'b'  you?\xe2\x80\x9d She looked over my baggy ensemble, probably wondering if I was just fat or actually pregnant, and how long into my maternity leave she could steal my job.'b'As the screaming scribes erupted in a round of \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I say \xe2\x80\x98union\xe2\x80\x99 you say \xe2\x80\x98power!\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d I reeled with nausea and clutched Jeremy. He maneuvered me toward the curb, where I collapsed, all flop sweat and unfortunately exposed posterior.'b'So, no more rallies for me. Now I mostly spend Fridays burrowing and eating, like a bear. Jeremy, on the other hand, sees Fridays as a bonus day of picketing. Note: my husband is a strike captain. Every show needs someone to attend meetings, organize picketing schedules and help squelch/spread the endless rumors and conspiracy theories that surround the strike.'b'Over the past few months, Jeremy has developed a squeaky-clean fervor. He spends hours constructing resolute e-mail messages to his team, and hesitates to choose ob-gyn appointments over picketing. It\xe2\x80\x99s like living with a truant officer.'b'I used to share his passion. In those first weeks, my co-workers and I took the early shift, showing up before dawn, creeping single file like ants down Melrose Avenue. Beneath our picket signs, we played games like I Spy, but as the day wore on, we often fell into silence, hot and dejected.'b'I frequented the restroom in a nearby parking garage; the security guards let us in   if we promised to cover up our red Writers Guild shirts. In the mirror, I looked at my face, sweaty, sunburned. I exhaled, finally releasing my emerging belly. When Jeremy and I planned on having a baby, we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t planned on this.'b'We would meet up at home after our shifts and blink at each other in the brightness of our living room while our dogs, thrilled to see us in the middle of the day, hurled themselves across our bodies with bone-breaking love. We\xe2\x80\x99d never had this much time together. What to do with such freedom? We could write a screenplay together! We could have sex!'b'But instead, Jeremy would fall into a haze in front of the Internet while I complained that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t drink a bottle of wine because of my high-maintenance unborn child.'b'Sometimes, with yet another free Friday stretching out in front of me, I sit down and try to write what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been meaning to write for years. After a couple of hours, I stretch, satisfied. Back in the saddle! I look over what I\xe2\x80\x99ve done: it\xe2\x80\x99s the exact premise of the show I worked for when the strike began. I am an unoriginal hack. Maybe after eight years of laboring inside the entity that is the writers\xe2\x80\x99 room, I am no longer a writer without a room.'b'Jeremy comes home flush with union power and finds me in the middle of Jamie Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s eggplant penne recipe. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bother to tell me what happened on the line, and we sit down to dinner at the table. It\xe2\x80\x99s a nice, new custom we\xe2\x80\x99ve adopted now that there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing on television. The strike is not without its benefits. Tomorrow is Saturday. I might do laundry. And maybe, come Monday, I\xe2\x80\x99ll wear pants again.'b'People in my line of work try to answer certain questions. Why did Hillary surge after misting up in New Hampshire? Why have primary victories produced no momentum for the victors? Why did John McCain win among Republicans who oppose the Iraq war in both New Hampshire and Michigan, but lose among voters who support it?'b'The truth is that many of the theories we come up with are bogus. They are based on the assumption that voters make cold, rational decisions about who to vote for and can tell us why they decided as they did. This is false.'b'In reality, we voters \xe2\x80\x94 all of us \xe2\x80\x94 make emotional, intuitive decisions about who we prefer, and then come up with post-hoc rationalizations to explain the choices that were already made beneath conscious awareness. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople often act without knowing why they do what they do,\xe2\x80\x9d Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel Prize winner, noted in an e-mail message to me this week. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fashion of political writing this year is to suggest that people choose their candidate by their stand on the issues, but this strikes me as highly implausible.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Nobody really knows how voters think, especially during primary seasons when the policy differences are minute, but it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprising if the cognitive chain went something like this:'b'After seeing a candidate for 100 milliseconds, voters make certain sorts of judgments based on expressiveness, facial structure, carriage and attitude. Alexander Todorov of Princeton has found that he can predict 70 percent of political races just by measuring peoples\xe2\x80\x99 snap judgments of candidates\xe2\x80\x99 faces.'b'Then, having formed an impression from these thin-slice appraisals, voters rack their memory banks. Decades ago, Kahneman and Amos Tversky argued that human judgment is less a matter of calculating probabilities and more a matter of trying to fit new things into familiar patterns. Maybe John Edwards reminds one voter of the sort of person he disliked in high school. Maybe Barack Obama evokes the elevated feeling another voter felt watching John F. Kennedy.'b'It is no accident that the major candidates in the Republican field are a pastor, a businessman and a war hero. These are the three most evocative Republican leadership models. Nor is it an accident that the Democratic race is a clash between a daughter of the feminist movement, a beneficiary of the civil rights movement and a self-styled proletarian. These are powerful Democratic categories.'b'In making these associations, voters are trying to perform trait inference. They are trying to divine inner abilities from outward signs.'b'At the same time, voters embark on an emotional journey with candidates. Antonio Damasio and Joseph LeDoux have shown that emotion isn\xe2\x80\x99t the opposite of reason. We use emotion to assign value to things, thus making decision-making possible.'b'As the campaign drags on, voters see candidates at different events. Maybe at one event Mitt Romney smiled without dipping the outer edge of his eyebrows. This is a cue that the smile is fake, and produces distrust. On the other hand, maybe he vowed to bring all the manufacturing jobs back to Michigan. A voter might have known this was impossible, but appreciated the concern nonetheless.'b'As the months go on, emotions oscillate and voter preferences do, too. Voters listen to policy proposals and infer character traits. A social contagion like Obamamania might sweep the country. A global shock might set off a wave of fear, producing a powerful intellectual cascade.'b'Social tribes rally for and against certain candidates. Rush Limbaugh is currently going bananas because Mike Huckabee threatens to disrupt the community of conservative dittoheads he has spent decades cohering. Work by researchers at Stanford\xe2\x80\x99s Business School suggests that  the voting environment itself \xe2\x80\x94 in say a church or a school \xe2\x80\x94 can influence choices.'b'Each of us has an unconscious but consistent way of construing the world. Some of us light up when we see a candidate being intelligent, others when we see a candidate being friendly or sentimental. This is the mode we use every day to make sense of the world.'b'My own intuition is that this unconscious cognition is pretty effective. People are skilled at judging character. And through reading, thinking and close observation, they can educate their unconscious to make smarter and finer distinctions.'b'But if there is one lesson from this wacky primary season, it is that we analysts should be careful about imposing a false order on voter decision-making.

About 1.4 million immigrants applied for citizenship in the fiscal year that ended in September, according to government estimates. That was double the number from the same period the year before.

Fran Flanagan'b'St. Louis, Jan. 14, 2008'b'As states and cities look to their roadways to generate badly needed money, the state of New Jersey is offering an approach worth studying. Gov. Jon Corzine wants to shore up his state\xe2\x80\x99s troubled finances by sharply raising tolls. If he gets his way, the cost of driving most of the turnpike could eventually rise from $5.85 to $48, providing money for both debt reduction and public transportation. The plan has potential pitfalls, but it may well be the best solution to a difficult problem.'b'New Jersey is drowning in $32 billion in debt, a legacy in large part of previous governors and legislators who approved generous public-employee contracts, and other costly programs, without paying for them. The state also faces critically important transportation needs, including widening the traffic-clogged New Jersey Turnpike. In a high-tax state like New Jersey, coming up with additional revenue is never easy.'b'Mr. Corzine has called for raising tolls by 50 percent every four years between 2010 and 2022. One mitigating factor for New Jersey residents is that about half of the turnpike\xe2\x80\x99s drivers are from out of state. The average drive on the turnpike is only two or three exits and far cheaper than the full fare. There also may be discounts for low-income drivers and commuters who use the highways frequently. Still, it is a whopper of a toll increase.'b'New Jersey is hardly the only cash-starved jurisdiction to look on tolls as a possible salvation. Indiana and Chicago have leased some toll roads to private companies. Pennsylvania is considering such an arrangement, and California is scrambling to find revenue sources to repair its highways and bridges. Mr. Corzine is avoiding the mistakes of the worst of these plans.'b'Rather than handing the state\xe2\x80\x99s roads to an unaccountable private entity, as Indiana did in a hugely controversial 75-year lease, he is proposing to turn the highways over to a highly regulated public corporation. It would sell $38 billion in bonds, which would be paid off by toll revenue. Almost half the money would pay down the state\xe2\x80\x99s debt. The rest would go to transportation, including a large chunk for mass transit.'b'Mr. Corzine says the legislation, which has yet to be unveiled, would prohibit governors  from meddling in operations or reducing the toll increases. These are necessary safeguards. The proposal also calls for a public oversight board \xe2\x80\x94 to be appointed by the governor, with input from the State Legislature.'b'The Legislature, controlled by Mr. Corzine\xe2\x80\x99s fellow Democrats, will have to sign off. Legislators need to make sure that there are sufficient guarantees that the public corporation will work in the public interest. They should also work with Mr. Corzine on the other part of his proposal: putting in place measures to end the irresponsible spending that produced this financial mess.'b'The toll increases will hit many residents of New Jersey hard. But if the details of the plan come out right, including the protections for those least able to pay, they will be worth the pain, and New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s remedy could become a standard for other fiscally troubled states.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cDeath Across the Border Awaits Horses Spared It in the U.S.\xe2\x80\x9d (news article, Jan. 11):'b'Horses are not livestock \xe2\x80\x94 not raised for slaughter.

In fact, between the 2006 and 2008 fiscal years, the cost of appropriations earmarks appears to have dropped from $29 billion to $14.1 billion.

That is one very plausible interpretation of a disturbing increase in waiting times at emergency rooms that are often clogged with uninsured patients seeking routine charity care.'b'An analysis by researchers at the Cambridge Health Alliance and Harvard Medical School, found that the median waiting time to see a physician in hospital emergency departments jumped from 22 minutes in 1997 to 30 minutes in 2004.'b'For the sickest heart attack patients, according to results published in the journal Health Affairs, wait times more than doubled. In 1997, half of them got to see a doctor within eight minutes; in 2004 it took 20 minutes. For a quarter of the heart attack patients, the wait reached 50 minutes or more \xe2\x80\x94 a particularly disturbing lag when every minute of delay increases the likelihood of death.'b'The researchers attribute the longer waits primarily to an increase in the number of emergency room visits coupled with the closure of many emergency rooms. Both factors are driven by the lack of universal health coverage. Uninsured patients \xe2\x80\x94 and those who have no primary care doctor \xe2\x80\x94 flock to emergency rooms for routine coverage, clogging the system. Meanwhile, hospitals lose so much money dispensing charity care through emergency rooms that many collapse into bankruptcy or give up emergency care.'b'Emergency rooms are further overburdened, caring for seriously ill patients who can spend hours or even days there waiting to be admitted to inpatient or intensive care units. That is because many hospitals are either short on beds or have decided to allocate many beds to patients who pay top dollar for elective care.'b'The Institute of Medicine, a unit of the National Academy of Sciences, warned two years ago that the nation\xe2\x80\x99s emergency rooms were at a breaking point. It called for better systems to route patients to the least crowded emergency rooms and an infusion of money to bolster emergency care. The Cambridge Health Alliance doctors call for expanding insurance coverage and primary care for the poor to provide alternatives to overcrowded emergency rooms for those seeking routine care. That is the best way to ensure that all the people who truly need emergency care get it when they need it.'b'Last year, the Op-Ed page asked five writers to file regular dispatches on the presidential race.

But Mr. Gates\xe2\x80\x99s frustration is understandable given the need to fight a resurgent Taliban and Al Qaeda with too few troops and too little aid and the growing risk that the war could well be lost. Understandable, too, was the administration\xe2\x80\x99s decision to send another 3,200 marines to Afghanistan after the allies refused to meet the need.'b'The administration and NATO have begun three top-to-bottom reviews of Afghanistan policy, but they won\xe2\x80\x99t be completed for months and the threat is growing daily.

NATO has about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, but many countries seem to be losing enthusiasm for the effort. Mr. Gates added to months of rising U.S.-European tensions over the size of deployments when he told The Los Angeles Times that some NATO forces \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t know how to do counterinsurgency operations.\xe2\x80\x9d He amended his remarks, but they struck a particular nerve with Britain, Canada, Australia and the Netherlands, whose troops are taking casualties in southern Afghanistan, where insurgents are most active.'b'Much is right about American complaints that NATO countries are not fully prepared to fight. Defense budgets and troop levels are insufficient; the Europeans lack necessary weapons. Countries like France, Germany, Italy and Spain place so many restrictions on their forces in Afghanistan that they are hobbling the effort.'b'When NATO took command in Afghanistan, many members expected to focus on development and stabilization, not combat. Many European leaders still have not told their constituents why fighting the Taliban and Al Qaeda is crucial.

It was April 4, 2003, and in support of the British assault on the city of Basra in southern Iraq, four Navy patrol boats, under a Navy command in which I served, were dispatched up the Shatt al Arab, the waterway marking the Iran-Iraq border. The senior officer present \xe2\x80\x94 a Navy captain \xe2\x80\x94 was an experienced Seal who was fluent in Persian, having lived in Tehran as a teenager. We took great pains to avoid a confrontation, staying well within Iraqi territorial waters and even erecting a makeshift Iranian flag on one of the boats, which our captain felt would display our peaceful intentions.'b'The Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps responded by sending four small boats toward us at high speed, the largest being a fast Swedish-built Boghammer, which resembles a cigarette boat, outfitted with a twin-barrel machine gun on its bow. With rooster-tails of white water, the boats came barreling over to the Iraqi side of the Shatt al Arab, surrounded us, and took the tarp off of at least one multiple-rocket launcher and pointed it directly at our lead boat.'b'Our captain tried to defuse the situation by telling the Iranians over the normal commercial radio channel that we were simply exercising our right to navigate Iraqi waters, had no intention of entering Iranian territory and did not seek a confrontation. The Iranians responded by a string of obscenities in heavily accented, broken English. After several tense minutes, we were ordered by our superiors to withdraw; the Iranian boats followed us a considerable distance before breaking off and heading back to their side of the waterway.'b'This was not the end of it, however. In the two weeks after this incident, American and coalition forces stationed on the Iraqi bank of the Shatt al Arab came under repeated, harassing small-arms fire from the Iranian mainland.'b'Now we seem to be seeing a similar period of Iranian truculence. In December, the Whidbey Island, a Navy dock-landing ship, fired warning shots at small Iranian craft that came too close. Three days later the frigate Carr was forced to use its ship\xe2\x80\x99s horn to ward off three Iranian small boats, two of which were armed, according to Navy spokesmen.'b'While these incidents may not seem alarming to those who\xe2\x80\x99ve never served on a potentially vulnerable modern warship, they fit into a worrisome pattern, a two-decade-old military strategy by Iran intended to counter the United States presence in the Persian Gulf. As a professional military historian (I work for the Joint Chiefs of Staff  at the Pentagon \xe2\x80\x94 these views are my own and do not represent those of the Department of Defense), I feel that a careful look at a few events from the past will shed some light.'b'In the 1980s the Navy had to counter a broad effort by Revolutionary Guard forces, then at war with Iraq, to set mines and otherwise hamper and damage American-flagged oil carriers in the gulf. The conflict heated up in the summer of 1987, when an American-flagged tanker hit an Iranian mine. That fall, Army helicopters fired on and Seals boarded an Iranian ship laying mines in international waters. The Seals confirmed the presence of mines, detained the crew and scuttled the ship.'b'The following April, the frigate Samuel B. Roberts was blown nearly in half by an Iranian mine, leading American forces to retaliate by attacking two Iranian oil platforms that had been used as staging areas. The Navy destroyed nearly half the Iranian Navy and put a temporary end to the Revolutionary Guards\xe2\x80\x99 waterborne presence.'b'Despite that humiliation, some in Tehran came away believing that a combination of mines, missiles and the fervor of the Revolutionary Guard members manning small boats could compete with the might of the United States Navy in the confined waters of the Persian Gulf. So, off and on for 20 years, the Iranians have been initiating small incidents, testing the limits of what America will accept.'b'While the events earlier this month were ambiguous, there can be little doubt that the Iranian actions were part of this continuing pattern. Even if one believes Tehran\xe2\x80\x99s explanation that the interaction was routine and harmless, the fact is that Iranian small ships came within 500 yards of American warships. At this range, our sailors would be well within the effective range of rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns, thus neutralizing the range advantage of our more advanced weapons.'b'This is why President Bush was correct in calling Iran\xe2\x80\x99s actions \xe2\x80\x9cprovocative\xe2\x80\x9d and having the State Department place Tehran on official notice that there will be serious consequences should the small boats continue their actions.'b'To forestall another confrontation or prevent an escalation, which would not be in our interests, the United States needs to do more. Washington should begin by marshaling the support of its allies that already have ships in the gulf and might find themselves in an equally dangerous confrontation. After the 9/11 attacks, several European navies (as well as Australia\xe2\x80\x99s and Canada\xe2\x80\x99s) sent large forces to augment the United States effort in safeguarding the sea lanes of the Middle East from terrorism. The Bush administration should harness this coalition by asking them to let Tehran know through their own diplomatic channels that any attempt by the Revolutionary Guards to interfere with the free navigation of international waters will be treated no differently from a terrorist attack.'b'Iran\xe2\x80\x99s motivations are not entirely clear. It may be that this systematic harassment is an attempt to ascertain the American rules of engagement. It may also reflect increased Iranian hubris. Or it may be an initiative of local commanders acting without permission from the Tehran government, which would appear to have little to gain by blatantly threatening the United States. While the Revolutionary Guard\xe2\x80\x99s orders originate from the central government, its commanders are given considerable autonomy. Still, whatever the motivations, the United States and its allies must make clear that it is Tehran\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to control all its forces and that it will be held accountable for their actions.'b'If Iran is determined to have a clash at sea, our military response should be forceful and precise, one that would remove the threat to the sea lanes while reducing the chance of escalation and minimizing the chances of a wider war. History \xe2\x80\x94 the events of 1988 \xe2\x80\x94 suggests that such a measured use of force is not only possible but can be effective.'b'If, say, the current quarrel escalated into isolated firefights, the Iranian-held Abu Musa Island, near the Strait of Hormuz, and Farsi Island, near Kuwait, would be logical targets for a measured American military response. Both have Revolutionary Guard Corps bases and have long been key cogs in the Iranian military machine in the Persian Gulf. (And in the case of Abu Musa, Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ownership is disputed by the United Arab Emirates.)'b'While some Americans may fear limited military action would bring about Iranian escalation or terrorist attacks, in the past, Iran has tended to respond to direct action by modifying its actions and bending to American pressure. Because the American military refrained from attacking the Iranian mainland in 1988, Iran understood the limited nature of the war and acted with similar restraint. In fact, the episode seemed to do us political good within the Islamic regime, as some of the hawks who had initially advocated the military confrontation soon found themselves out of favor.'b'A full-scale war with Iran would not be in America\xe2\x80\x99s interests. But there is a world of difference between reacting to provocation by Revolutionary Guard boats and bombing sovereign territory. History shows that a tough but measured military response to Iranian harassment may lessen the odds of a much bigger clash down the road.'b'SAN FRANCISCO'b'IN December and January, college students on break come home to the Bay Area, and many of those I\xe2\x80\x99ve taught in my high school classes stop by to catch up. We sit down and talk about the weather on campus (they all went out East and some now question their wisdom), the odd proclivities of their roommates (it seems patchouli still exists and is being applied liberally) and inevitably, politics and the primaries.'b'The majority of these college students support Barack Obama, and though some of the reasons vary \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cHe looks like us,\xe2\x80\x9d one student said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cHe looks 22,\xe2\x80\x9d she said \xe2\x80\x94 for the most part, they\xe2\x80\x99re attracted to what we would expect: Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s message of change and transparency.'b'Having been credited with Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s victory in Iowa, the youth movement was feeling invincible. New Hampshire was a sobering correction. After that primary I talked to Brian, now out of college and living in Los Angeles. He has followed Mr. Obama ever since \xe2\x80\x9cThe Daily Show\xe2\x80\x9d ran a series about his Senate campaign in 2004 against Alan Keyes (\xe2\x80\x9cJust the craziest dude\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Brian). He\xe2\x80\x99s still confident in Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s chances, but after New Hampshire, he fears that the pressure to go negative will get to his candidate. For months it\xe2\x80\x99s been a constant refrain in the news media \xe2\x80\x94 to win, you have to fight more, punch harder.'b'But for a lot of young people, electing the next president shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t require the kind of campaigning that gives rise to violent analogies \xe2\x80\x94 body blows, drawing blood, war rooms.

But that\xe2\x80\x99s the problem with her message. It\xe2\x80\x99s about her, her wounds and scars. Obama talks about us, about we.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I asked Luisa why the style of campaigning was so important. She compared watching two candidates sparring in a debate, or trading catchy-but-meaningless barbs on the news, to watching her parents fight.'b'It was diminishing to both of them, and it disheartened her generally. Weren\xe2\x80\x99t adults supposed to be better than this? \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why we get apathetic about voting,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just this poisoned atmosphere, you know? It reminds us of watching our parents at their worst.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'College students expect, when they graduate, to step into a radically reinvented world. They\xe2\x80\x99ve spent four years (more or less) learning about flawed and failed societies, and imagining better and more equitable ones. And because most campuses are at best insular and at worst utterly removed from reality, when these students step into the world again, they\xe2\x80\x99re often shocked to find that very little has changed. But this election represents a distinct opportunity to achieve what every class before them has so yearned for: the world being reborn at the exact moment they are.'b'Hillary Clinton, whom my students respect a great deal, uttered the words \xe2\x80\x9cfalse hopes\xe2\x80\x9d when referring to what Mr. Obama is offering. How can hope be false? the young idealist might ask. Hope is the only horse these young people have in the race.'b'And wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it the other Clinton who liked to quote from \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cure at Troy,\xe2\x80\x9d Seamus Heaney\xe2\x80\x99s version of Sophocles\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cPhiloctetes,\xe2\x80\x9d which seems ludicrously apt right about now?'b'History says, Don\xe2\x80\x99t hope'b'On this side of the grave.'b'But then, once in a lifetime'b'The longed-for tidal wave'b'Of justice can rise up'b'And hope and history rhyme.'b'LINDA GREENHOUSE, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Times reporter who has covered the Supreme Court for nearly 30 years, is used to dealing with top-drawer legal authorities. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not always convenient that she is married to one.'b'Early in 2006, Greenhouse wrote an article about briefs filed in support of an appeal by a prisoner at Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay, Cuba, a man who was once a bodyguard and driver for Osama bin Laden. One of the two dozen briefs, not mentioned in the article, was filed by Eugene Fidell on behalf of the National Institute of Military Justice and the Bar Association of the District of Columbia. Fidell, one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s foremost experts on military law, is the president of the institute and an oft-quoted critic of the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s prisoner policies. And he happens to be Greenhouse\xe2\x80\x99s husband.'b'Last month, Greenhouse covered arguments in another major case involving Guant\xc3\xa1namo prisoners. The institute of military justice filed a brief opposing the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position in that case, too. But this time, out of what Greenhouse said was \xe2\x80\x9can excess of caution,\xe2\x80\x9d her husband did not sign it because the case was in the court she was covering.'b'A conservative blogger who takes frequent shots at Greenhouse, M. Edward Whelan III, pointed out Fidell\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in the cases and said it created a conflict of interest for the Times reporter.'b'Greenhouse and her editors disagree. Dean Baquet, the Washington bureau chief, called the conflict \xe2\x80\x9cabstract\xe2\x80\x9d and said that Fidell and his institute were minor figures in the cases. Greenhouse said her husband does not represent any prisoners, and \xe2\x80\x9cthere is to my mind a significant difference between representing a party in a case and taking a position on an issue raised by a case.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Whelan, formerly an official in the Bush administration Justice Department and a clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia, made no specific claim that Greenhouse tilted her work to favor her husband\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, saying \xe2\x80\x9cit would be impossible to separate any such bias from the broader political bias that pervades so much of Greenhouse\xe2\x80\x99s reporting.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I read each of the dozen articles that Greenhouse has written on the two cases, and I see why Whelan chose a slippery innuendo rather than specifying instances of bias. There were not any. The articles were straightforward accounts, explaining all sides clearly and, as is customary in Greenhouse\xe2\x80\x99s coverage of the court, drawing on a deep knowledge of the applicable law, going back to its roots in English common law.'b'Whelan is president of the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center. But his increasingly intemperate and personal attacks on Greenhouse indicate something other than a legitimate concern about ethics. They feel more like bullying. But even if he cannot convincingly fault Greenhouse\xe2\x80\x99s coverage of the prisoner cases, and whatever his motives, Whelan has raised a real issue that has troubled newsrooms for as long as journalists have made friendships, fallen in love or otherwise had a life outside of work. \xe2\x80\x9cAll journalists have competing loyalties,\xe2\x80\x9d said Robert M. Steele, an ethics scholar at the Poynter Institute, a journalism research center in St. Petersburg, Fla.'b'But when do those competing loyalties create real conflicts that threaten the integrity of a news organization? What do you do, for example, when a journalist\xe2\x80\x99s spouse or lover is also a newsmaker?'b'The Times has written guidelines for possible conflicts, and how they were applied in Greenhouse\xe2\x80\x99s case suggests that changes are needed in this era when all news media are under constant partisan assault and public faith in them is low.'b'The guidelines say that staffers must be sensitive to potential conflicts and discuss them with their supervisor and the standards editor. In some cases, the guidelines say, making editors aware is enough. In others, a reporter might have to withdraw from certain coverage, or change beats, or even move to a different department. The guidelines are silent on what I believe is one of the most important steps: public disclosure.'b'Greenhouse said that when the Supreme Court decided to hear its first prisoner case, she went to her bureau chief at the time, Philip Taubman, and discussed what she should do given her husband\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in that field of law. Taubman said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe agreed that if her husband represented a party in a case before the Supreme Court, she would not cover that case.\xe2\x80\x9d Otherwise, Greenhouse said, she was told to proceed.'b'Jill Abramson, the managing editor for news, said the issue was discussed by the paper\xe2\x80\x99s most senior editors, who decided it was important to give readers the benefit of Greenhouse\xe2\x80\x99s expertise. Abramson said: \xe2\x80\x9cLinda\xe2\x80\x99s professionalism over the years is unquestioned here ... and she is a very highly regarded figure in the legal community. She knows lawyers all over the country who are directly involved in the cases she is covering. Like many journalists, she can wall off the views of her close friends and her spouse.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But Lee Wilkins, a professor of journalism at the University of Missouri and editor of The Journal of Mass Media Ethics, said, \xe2\x80\x9cConflict of interest is practically the only place in ethics where perceptions matter almost as much as what is the case.\xe2\x80\x9d Like it or not, the perception is that Greenhouse is writing about something in which her husband is a player \xe2\x80\x94 and The Times isn\xe2\x80\x99t telling the public. Newspapers routinely question public officials in similar circumstances.'b'What would I have done differently?'b'First, I would not have removed Greenhouse from the story. As Wilkins said, if The Times did that, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have knowingly given our readers less than our best.\xe2\x80\x9d But after the first conversation between Greenhouse and Taubman, The Times should have clued in readers.'b'Second, I would have practiced what Steele called \xe2\x80\x9ctransparency with accountability,\xe2\x80\x9d revisiting the issue from time to time, certainly with each new case, to determine Fidell\xe2\x80\x99s level of participation and whether the initial decision should be reconsidered. Taubman recalls doing that, but when Baquet became bureau chief last March, he was not told of Taubman\xe2\x80\x99s understanding with Greenhouse. And, despite the guidelines, nobody told Craig Whitney, the standards editor.'b'Finally, I think The Times should systematically disclose more about what Steele termed the intersections between the personal and professional lives of its journalists. This could be done in biographies on the newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s Web site. Greenhouse\xe2\x80\x99s biography says, \xe2\x80\x9cShe is married to Eugene R. Fidell, a lawyer.\xe2\x80\x9d That is not enough.'b'Bill Keller, the executive editor, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI happily endorse that approach.\xe2\x80\x9d But he said he does not want to single out Greenhouse for this treatment because it would appear to be a tacit rebuke in the face of a partisan assault.'b'The point is not to punish Greenhouse, who does not deserve that. It is to make the newspaper less vulnerable to attacks like Whelan\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cWhat to Expect When You\xe2\x80\x99re Free Trading\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Jan. 16):'b'Steven E.

That year Mr. Bush aired a television commercial urging voters to keep America \xe2\x80\x9cin the hands of experience.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It might seem obvious that long service in Washington is the best preparation for the White House, but on the contrary, one lesson of American history is that length of experience in national politics is an extremely poor predictor of presidential success.'b'Looking at the 19 presidents since 1900, three of the greatest were among those with the fewest years in electoral politics. Teddy Roosevelt had been a governor for two years and vice president for six months; Woodrow Wilson, a governor for just two years; and Franklin Roosevelt, a governor for four years. None ever served in Congress.'b'They all did have executive experience (as did Mr. Clinton), actually running something larger than a Senate office. Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s something voters should think about more: governors have often made better presidents than senators. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not a good Democratic talking point, because the candidates with the greatest administrative experience by far are Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani and Mike Huckabee.'b'Alternatively, look at the five presidents since 1900 with perhaps the most political experience when taking office: William McKinley, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and George H.\xc2\xa0W. Bush. They had great technical skills \xe2\x80\x94 but not one was among our very greatest presidents.'b'The point is not that experience is pointless but that it needn\xe2\x80\x99t be in politics to be useful. John McCain\xe2\x80\x99s years as a P.O.W. gave him an understanding of torture and a moral authority to discuss it that no amount of Senate hearings ever could have conferred.'b'In the same way, Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s years as an antipoverty organizer give him insights into one of our greatest challenges: how to end cycles of poverty. That front-line experience is one reason Mr. Obama not only favors government spending programs, like early-childhood education, but also cultural initiatives like promoting responsible fatherhood.'b'Then there\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s grade-school years in Indonesia. Our most serious mistakes in foreign policy, from Vietnam to Iraq, have been a blindness to other people\xe2\x80\x99s nationalism and an inability to see ourselves as others see us. Mr. Obama seems to have absorbed an intuitive sensitivity to that problem. For starters, he understood back in 2002 that American troops would not be greeted in Iraq with flowers.'b'In politics, Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s preparation is indeed thin, though it\xe2\x80\x99s more than Hillary Rodham Clinton acknowledges. His seven years in the Illinois State Senate aren\xe2\x80\x99t heavily scrutinized, but he scored significant achievements there: a law to videotape police interrogations in capital cases; an earned income tax credit to fight poverty; an expansion of early-childhood education.'b'Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s strength is her mastery of the details of domestic and foreign policy, unrivaled among the candidates; she speaks fluently about what to do in Pakistan, Iraq, Darfur. Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s strength is his vision and charisma and the possibility that his election would heal divisions at home and around the world. John Edwards\xe2\x80\x99s strength is his common touch and his leadership among the candidates in establishing detailed positions on health care, poverty and foreign aid.'b'Those are the meaningful distinctions in the Democratic field, not Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s spurious claim to \xe2\x80\x9c35 years of experience.\xe2\x80\x9d The Democrats with the greatest Washington expertise \xe2\x80\x94 Joe Biden, Chris Dodd and Bill Richardson \xe2\x80\x94 have already been driven from the race.

A battle over race-and-gender identity politics among the Democrats, with its acrid scent from the 1960s, might be just the spark for a Republican comeback. (As long as the G.O.P.\xe2\x80\x99s own identity politics, over religion, don\xe2\x80\x99t flare up.)'b'Alas, these hopes faded on Tuesday night. First, the debating Democrats 'b'declared a truce'b', however fragile, in their racial brawl. Then 'b'Republicans in Michigan'b' reconstituted their party\xe2\x80\x99s election-year chaos by temporarily revivifying yet another candidate, Mitt Romney, who had been left for dead.'b'The playing of the race card by Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s surrogates to diminish Barack Obama was sinister. But the Clintons are hardly bigots, and the Democratic candidates all have a history of fighting strenuously for inclusiveness. By contrast, the Romney victory in Michigan is another reminder of how Republicans aren\xe2\x80\x99t even playing in the same multiracial American sandbox.'b'The conservatives who hyperventilated about the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 explosion of identity politics seemed to forget that Mr. Romney also dragged Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. into this campaign \xe2\x80\x94 claiming that he \xe2\x80\x9csaw\xe2\x80\x9d his father, a civil-rights minded governor of Michigan, march with King in the 1960s. The point of Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of the race card was to inoculate himself against legitimate charges of racial insensitivity; he had 'b'never spoken out'b' about his own church\xe2\x80\x99s discrimination against blacks, which didn\xe2\x80\x99t end until 1978. Instead, the tactic ended up backfiring. Late last month The Boston Phoenix 'b'exposed'b' this touching anecdote as a 'b'fraud'b'. George Romney and King never marched together.'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to pick on Mitt Romney \xe2\x80\x94 though heaven knows it\xe2\x80\x99s a thriving national pastime \xe2\x80\x94 but his retro persona exemplifies much of the present Republican dilemma. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just that the old Reagan coalition of social, economic and foreign-policy conservatives has fractured. A more indelible problem for the Republicans in 2008 is that their candidates are utterly segregated from reality as it is lived by the overwhelming majority of their fellow Americans. The G.O.P. presidential field\xe2\x80\x99s lack of demographic diversity by age, gender, ethnicity or even wardrobe, let alone race, is simply the leading indicator of how out of touch its brand has become.'b'Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s victory in Michigan was most of all powered by a lie far more egregious than his bogus appropriation of King. In a state 'b'decimated by unemployment'b', he posed before auto plants like an incongruously well-groomed Michael Moore, vowing to fight to bring back every last lost job. His plan? He\xe2\x80\x99d scrap the modest new fuel-efficiency standard 'b'passed with rare bipartisan unity'b' in Washington last month and give Detroit a $20 billion 'b'fund'b' for energy \xe2\x80\x9cresearch\xe2\x80\x9d (not to be confused, he claimed, with a 'b'bailout'b').'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a poignant measure of Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s despair that some voters willed themselves to believe in Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s preposterous antidote to the decades-long erosion of the American auto industry. It\xe2\x80\x99s a farcical measure of how little the other Republicans have to say about the nation\xe2\x80\x99s economic crunch that Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s con job could pass for substance.'b'Whatever the merits of the Democratic candidates\xe2\x80\x99 takes on our fiscal crisis, at least they saw the crisis coming. Though Mr. Romney officially kicked off his presidential candidacy in Michigan, he started grandstanding about the misery in that state only after all his other campaign strategies had failed and he needed a Hail Mary marketing gimmick. In his 'b'announcement speech'b' in Dearborn last February, the lone economy he mentioned was the fuel economy of the Ramblers his father manufactured at American Motors in a distant past.'b'Among Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s rivals, Mike Huckabee alone made affinity for economically struggling Americans his calling card. Unfortunately, Huckanomics is more snake oil. All federal taxes would be replaced by a national sales tax that despite its Orwellian name (the Fair Tax) would 'b'shift more'b' of the  burden to middle- and low-income Americans.'b'For the other Republicans, the downturn has been an occasion to recycle the mindless what-me-worry optimism of the pre-1929 G.O.P. presidents and Wall Street potentates since relegated to history\xe2\x80\x99s dustbin. When Maria Bartiromo, moderating a 'b'CNBC Republican debate'b' in October, asked the candidates if the nation was heading into a recession, Fred Thompson 'b'found'b' \xe2\x80\x9cno reason\xe2\x80\x9d to think so and pronounced both the near and longer-term economic future \xe2\x80\x9crosy.\xe2\x80\x9d Rudy Giuliani extolled the glories of freedom and the market before promising that \xe2\x80\x9cthe sky\xe2\x80\x99s the limit.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Even the White House halfheartedly 'b'acknowledged'b' the home-mortgage fiasco ahead of 'b'this crew'b'. Instead, the Republican candidates have largely clung to illegal immigration as Domestic Crisis No. 1, to no particular point beyond alienating Hispanic voters.'b'The election is more than nine months away, and already this obsession is blowing up in the G.O.P.\xe2\x80\x99s face with non-Hispanic voters, too. Far from proving the killer app of 2008, illegal immigration is evaporating as a national cause. In the nearly identical findings of 'b'The New York Times/CBS News'b' and 'b'ABC News/Washington Post'b' polls this month, it ranks near the bottom,  the top issue for a mere 4 to 5 percent of voters. The economy (at 20 to 29 percent) leads in both surveys, closely followed by the total of those picking some variant of \xe2\x80\x9cwar\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cIraq.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t crazy enough for Republicans to lash themselves to the listing mast of immigration, they are nonplayers on the issues that do matter most to voters. The more the economy tanks and steals Americans\xe2\x80\x99 attention from a relatively less violent Iraq, the more voters learn that the Republicans have little to offer beyond their one-size-fits-all panacea of extending the Bush tax cuts.'b'To voters who do remember Iraq, the supposed military success of the \xe2\x80\x9csurge\xe2\x80\x9d does not accrue to the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 favor either. Quite the contrary. As every poll shows, most Americans still want the troops home ASAP. Republican declarations that we are \xe2\x80\x9cwinning\xe2\x80\x9d merely lead many voters to a logical conclusion: Why not let the Iraqis take over the remaining triage so we can retrieve the $10 billion a month in taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 'b'money'b' that might benefit us at home? This is why even the poll-driven Mrs. Clinton, who has been the most cautious and ambiguous of the Democratic candidates about a withdrawal timetable, dramatically 'b'changed course'b' to expedite her Iraq exit strategy in Tuesday night\xe2\x80\x99s debate.'b'Thanks in part to the Giuliani campaign\xe2\x80\x99s one triumph \xe2\x80\x94 turning 9/11 fearmongering into a running late-night talk-show gag \xe2\x80\x94 the usual national-security card is no longer so easy for Republicans to play. Conservatives not in denial see the crackup ahead. \xe2\x80\x9c'b'All'b' the usual indicators are dismal for Republicans,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote 'b'George Will last week'b', concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cNov. 4 could be their most disagreeable day since Nov. 3, 1964,\xe2\x80\x9d when Barry Goldwater lost 44 states.'b'But might some Republican still win, especially if the Democrats are ultimately divided by race, or by the Clintons, or by their own 'b'inane new debate about Reagan'b'? Conceivably, but only if someone besides Ron Paul is brave enough to break out of the monochromatic pack.'b'That contender would seem to be John McCain. For all the often irrational anger directed at this conservative by his long-time antagonists in his own party, he is the sole G.O.P. candidate who resisted the immigrant vigilantes. He might have done better in Michigan, where he spoke honestly about the grim prospects for the auto industry, had he backed up his prognosis with remedies less glib than a vague 'b'pledge to retrain workers'b' at community colleges. Education policy of any kind is M.I.A. on the McCain campaign Web site.'b'His ardor for the war, however, has not done him in. He handily won the growing Republican antiwar vote in both Michigan and New Hampshire. Apparently many still remember that Mr. McCain was bitterly against President Bush before he was for him.'b''b'Exit'b' 'b'polls'b' find that among voters in Republican primaries, as many as half have turned against the president. David Frum, the onetime Bush speechwriter, laments in his provocative new book \xe2\x80\x9cComeback\xe2\x80\x9d that by 2008 his former boss \xe2\x80\x9chad led his party to the brink of disaster\xe2\x80\x9d and cost it \xe2\x80\x9ca generation of young Americans.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At the 'b'last Republican debate'b', the candidates invoked Reagan nearly three dozen times and Mr. Bush just once. \xe2\x80\x9cI take my inspiration from Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Romney on his Michigan 'b'victory night'b', in a typical example of the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 circumlocutions about the incumbent president.'b'This, too, is laughably out of touch with reality as practiced in most American living rooms. Imagine if Mr. McCain\xe2\x80\x99s Straight Talk Express stopped taking detours around the one figure who 'b'unites'b' 60-plus percent of the populace in ire. Imagine if he started talking straight about how he\xe2\x80\x99d clean up the White House mess. That might at least break the ice with the vast majority of voters who look at the G.O.P. presidential field and don\xe2\x80\x99t see Ronald Reagan so much as also-rans for \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bucket List.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As the economy weakens, consumers hunt for bargains. Sometimes, however, a bargain can be a literal steal,  and a dangerous one at that. The World Customs Organization estimates that 7  percent of goods traded in the world are counterfeit \xe2\x80\x94 a black market that increasingly includes pharmaceuticals, electronics and other products that must be safe enough to use.'b'With some $200 billion worth of those pirated or counterfeited goods coming into the United States  each year, already weak regulatory agencies are overwhelmed. That means that far too often the burden falls on the buyer to avoid getting stuck with, or hurt by, hazardous fakes. That is not always easy, and the horror stories in recent years have included pet food that harmed or killed hundreds of pets in the United States. More recently, counterfeit batteries have been recalled because they tend to overheat and even explode.'b'Consumer Reports  offered a good primer this month  on how to spot the dangerous fakes. Like others who talk about the three Ps \xe2\x80\x94 price, place and packaging \xe2\x80\x94  the magazine\xe2\x80\x99s editors warn that a superlow price should be the first clue. Buyers should also be wary of retailers who fail to provide a receipt or pay sales tax. Flimsy packaging or misspelled words offer more signals. Underwriters Laboratory, which gives a seal of approval to electronics, now uses an expensive, difficult-to-copy hologram. Plenty of holiday lights or power strips with bogus UL seals still make it past  customs agents.'b'Some people in Congress want to tighten penalties on counterfeiters, a good but modest move. More to the point,  the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Food and Drug Administration need more money. And businesses that often avoid acknowledging the fake trade, for fear of damaging their brand, should be more open with consumers about how to tell the difference between real and unreal. Until then, buyer beware.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cDoctors Where They\xe2\x80\x99re Needed\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 15):'b'Kudos on your article for recognizing Gov.

He  has also given up, for now, his effort to use the economy\xe2\x80\x99s deepening woes as an excuse to extend his tax cuts for the wealthy past their 2010 expiration date.'b'Still, Congressional Democrats face a battle with the administration to draft a final package that will quickly help those Americans most in need  and provide the most economic bang for the buck.'b'Urged  by testimony on Thursday by Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Bush seems to have acknowledged that extending his tax cuts would do little to mitigate an economic slowdown in 2008 and 2009. On Friday, Mr. Bush called for a package of tax rebates and investment incentives amounting to about $145 billion \xe2\x80\x94 or 1 percent of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s economic output \xe2\x80\x94 to be rolled out as soon as possible.'b'The White House says it embraces some sound principles for an effective fiscal boost \xe2\x80\x94 that they  be temporary and timely, hitting the economy this year, while it is weak. But what we know of the package does not meet a fundamental requirement: that it put cash into the hands of low- and moderate-income people, who need it most and are most likely to spend it right away.'b'The White House has provided few details, but in conversations with lawmakers, he mulled provisions to  let businesses partly deduct   new capital investments, coupled with income-tax rebates of $800 for individuals, or $1,600 for households. The idea, Mr. Bush said on Friday, was to let people \xe2\x80\x9ckeep more of their own money.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The package has obvious flaws. Research on the investment incentives provided after the 2001 recession suggest that tax cuts for businesses will not have much short-term effect on investment, providing little immediate benefit to the economy.'b'Tax rebates for consumers do provide effective economic stimulus. Rebate checks sent after the 2001 recession \xe2\x80\x94 $300 for qualifying individuals and $600 for families \xe2\x80\x94 were spent relatively quickly, according to research, providing the economy with a shot in the arm. Twenty percent to 40 percent of the rebate was spent within three months,  one study found.'b'But in its embrace of the notion that relief means letting people keep their own money, the White House\xe2\x80\x99s proposal excludes those who have no money to keep \xe2\x80\x94 about 45 million families earning too little to pay income taxes and to qualify for a rebate. Yet these are exactly the people who should be helped, not only because of their dire need but also because they would be most likely to  spend quickly whatever assistance they got.'b'There are more effective and progressive ways to provide an economic stimulus. Democrats have suggested a flat tax credit for all workers, regardless of whether they pay income taxes. To help the worst-off Americans, they have proposed extending unemployment insurance and increasing food stamp benefits.'b'Fortunately, a compromise looks possible. Things have gotten so bad  that the White House appears to have decided that it needs bipartisan support. Some Congressional Republicans have signaled that they could support extending unemployment insurance. Democrats should not give in on the core principle of progressivity. A plan that excludes the 45 million families who need relief the most is an inadequate relief plan.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cResponding to Recession,\xe2\x80\x9d by Paul Krugman (column, Jan. 14):'b'Candidates looking for an integrated economic stimulus package: look no further!

Even so, it would be hard to frame the problem more dramatically than two recent articles in The Times detailing the disastrous environmental, economic and human consequences of often illegal industrial fishing.'b'Sharon LaFraniere showed how mechanized fishing fleets from the European Union and nations like China and Russia \xe2\x80\x94 usually with the complicity of local governments \xe2\x80\x94 have nearly picked clean the oceans off Senegal and other northwest African countries. This has ruined coastal economies and added to the surge of suddenly unemployed migrants who brave the high seas in wooden boats seeking a new life in Europe, where they are often not welcome.'b'The second article, by Elisabeth Rosenthal, focused on Europe\xe2\x80\x99s insatiable appetite for fish \xe2\x80\x94 it is now the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest consumer. Having overfished its own waters of popular species like tuna, swordfish and cod, Europe now imports 60 percent of what it consumes. Of that, up to  half is contraband, fish caught and shipped in violation of government quotas and treaties.'b'The industry, meanwhile, is organized to evade serious regulation. Big factory ships from places like Europe, China, Korea and Japan stay at sea for years at a time \xe2\x80\x94 fueling, changing crews, unloading their catch on refrigerated vessels. The catch then enters European markets through the Canary Islands and other ports where inspection is minimal. After that, retailers and consumers neither ask nor care where the fish came from, or whether, years from now, there will be any fish at all.'b'From time to time, international bodies try to do something to slow overfishing. The United Nations banned huge drift nets in the 1990s, and recently asked its members to halt bottom trawling, a particularly ruthless form of industrial fishing, on the high seas. Last fall, the European Union banned fishing for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, where bluefin have been decimated.'b'The institution with the most potential leverage is the World Trade Organization. Most of the world\xe2\x80\x99s fishing fleets receive heavy government subsidies for boat building, equipment and fuel, America\xe2\x80\x99s fleet less so than others. Without these subsidies, which amount to about $35 billion annually, fleets would shrink in size and many destructive practices like bottom trawling would become uneconomic.'b'The W.T.O. has never had a reputation for environmental zeal. But knowing that healthy fisheries are important to world trade and development, the group has begun negotiating new trade rules aimed at reducing subsidies. It produced a promising draft in late November, but there is no fixed schedule for a final agreement.'b'The world needs such an agreement, and soon. Many fish species may soon be so depleted that they will no longer be able to reproduce themselves. As 125 of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most respected scientists warned in a letter to the W.T.O. last year, the world is at a crossroads. One road leads to tremendously diminished marine life. The other leads to oceans again teeming with abundance. The W.T.O. can help choose the right one.'b'IN 1983, Ronald Reagan signed a bill honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. with a federal holiday. Reagan opposed it, but back then, in the olden times of checks and balances, the vote by 338 representatives and 78 senators establishing the holiday threatened certain veto override.'b'So there was the president in the White House Rose Garden pretending to enjoy turning this drain on the Gross National Product into law. Perhaps he comforted himself that the American people, who can turn something as dead serious as Memorial Day into a clambake, would somehow find a way to use a football season Monday venerating a murder victim to sleep off their beer and nachos hangovers of the preceding afternoon.'b'Still, there\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasing symmetry in Reagan forking over a day to Dr. King. Both men owe their reputations to the Sermon on the Mount.

Reagan cribbed from the Gospel of Matthew via the Puritan John Winthrop to dream up his \xe2\x80\x9cshining city on a hill\xe2\x80\x9d legacy.

On Nov. 17, 1957, in Montgomery\xe2\x80\x99s Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, he concluded the learned discourse that came to be known as the \xe2\x80\x9cloving your enemies\xe2\x80\x9d sermon this way: \xe2\x80\x9cSo this morning, as I look into your eyes and into the eyes of all of my brothers in Alabama and all over America and over the world, I say to you: \xe2\x80\x98I love you.

That is hands down the most beautiful, strange, impossible, but most of all radical thing a human being can say. And it comes from reading the most beautiful, strange, impossible, but most of all radical civics lesson ever taught, when Jesus of Nazareth went to a hill in Galilee and told his disciples, \xe2\x80\x9cLove your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Bible is a big long book and Lord knows within its many mansions of eccentricity finding justification for literal and figurative witch hunts is as simple as pretending \xe2\x80\x9cenhanced investigation technique\xe2\x80\x9d is not a synonym for torture.

(All that wretch-like-me, original sin talk meant I spent my entire childhood believing I was as depraved as Charles Manson when in reality I might have been the best-behaved 9-year-old of the 20th century.)'b'Because I am a culturally Christian atheist the same way my atheist Reform friends are culturally Jewish, I look forward to Martin Luther King\xe2\x80\x99s Birthday \xe2\x80\x94 when the news momentarily replaces the rants of the faith-based spitfires with clips of what an actually Christlike Christian sounds like \xe2\x80\x94 with the kind of fondness with which my pal Ben looks back on the decent, affectionate ideal that was his summer camp.'b'I have become just another citizen whose only religion is the freedom of religion and as such I patrol the wall of separation between church and state like some jumpy East German guarding Checkpoint Charlie back before Ronald Reagan single-handedly tore it down.'b'Which is why I am relieved that journalists and voters keep asking Mike Huckabee, the Republican presidential candidate, what he meant 10 years ago when he told a meeting of his fellow Baptists, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope we answer the alarm clock and take this nation back for Christ.\xe2\x80\x9d That is a curiously unconstitutional opinion for someone seeking the job of defending the Constitution, not to mention historically inaccurate considering the mostly deist founders were about as spiritual as the original cast of \xe2\x80\x9cHair.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But I am also relieved when Mr. Huckabee occasionally blurts out some Sunday School sentiment about how he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think a poor child should have to sleep in a car.

Dr. King told him not to, that it would just get everybody killed. \xe2\x80\x9cSomebody got to have some sense on this highway,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Every now and then I meet someone in Manhattan who has never driven a car. Some confess it sheepishly, and some announce it proudly. For some it is just a practical matter of fact, the equivalent of not keeping a horse on West 87th Street or Avenue A. Still, I used to wonder at such people, but more and more I wonder at myself.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve been driving now for some 40 years, right through what will come to be thought of as the heart of the Internal Combustion Era. There is no learnable skill \xe2\x80\x94 aside perhaps from reading and writing \xe2\x80\x94 that is more a part of me than driving. My senses have completely engulfed the automobile, like the tendrils of a vining plant. Or perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s the other way around, and the automobile has completely encased my senses.'b'That first time behind the wheel, probably in 1965, I could feel myself manipulating the machine through an unimaginable series of linkages with a clumsy device called the steering wheel. The car \xe2\x80\x94 a Dodge from the late 1950s, without power steering \xe2\x80\x94 felt more like a fallout shelter than something mobile. I had very little sense of where it began or ended. I was keenly aware of what it prevented me from seeing. A highway was just a linear succession of blind spots. As for backing up, how could you really trust what the mirrors told you unless you got out and checked? The transmission \xe2\x80\x94 manual, of course \xe2\x80\x94 was an instrument of betrayal. To drive down the road, those first few times, was to lurch through a series of unrelated states of being.'b'And now? I understand the richness of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csecond nature.\xe2\x80\x9d The car\xe2\x80\x99s mirrors are no longer a Cubist experiment in perception. They have joined together in a panoramic view of the past, of where I have just been. I feel the road through the tires\xe2\x80\x99 treads as though they were my fingerprints. When I learned to drive, I was taught to prize continuity above everything: to feel the drift of the car, to understand inertia, to ease into and out of a stop, to emulate the smooth orbital passage of the planet. Speed has turned into an extension of my consciousness.'b'How \xe2\x80\x9cnatural\xe2\x80\x9d all this is becomes apparent when you realize how few people \xe2\x80\x94 still far, far too many but still miraculously few \xe2\x80\x94 are killed in accidents every year. If there were not some profound intuitive fit between us and these machines, we would be dying by the millions. Yes, there are too many people who drive while drunk or fall prey to road rage. But for most of us our behavior in cars reveals our innate orderliness, our willingness to get along with one another while still, soundly, keeping a wary eye out for the drivers around us.'b'Driving is the cultural anomaly of our moment. Someone from the past, I think, would marvel at how much time we spend in cars and how our geographic consciousness is defined by how far we can get in a few hours\xe2\x80\x99 drive and still feel as if   we\xe2\x80\x99re close to home. Someone from the future, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, will marvel at our blindness and at the hole we have driven ourselves into, for we are completely committed to an unsustainable technology.'b'And it has all come to pass in just a couple of generations. My dad was born in the mid-1920s, just as the automotive moment was becoming inevitable. And now here I am, always wondering how much longer we will be driving, certain that every time I start the engine in my diesel pickup I am firing up a dinosaur technology. You could ask for no clearer sign of the bind we are in than Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s campaign promise to reinvigorate Detroit in an era of $100-a-barrel oil. America is full of people like me, who remember when gas was 21 cents a gallon, which is the price of admission to climate change.'b'I see that now. But try explaining that to me when I was 13 and learning to drive on the back roads of Iowa.'b'In his victory speech after winning the South Carolina primary Saturday night, John McCain acknowledged the economic challenges we face, and then said: \xe2\x80\x9cBut nothing is inevitable in our country. We are the captains of our fate.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'McCain comes from a generation that, in its youth, was made to memorize poetry. And when I was able to get in touch with him Sunday  in Florida, he told me that one of the poems he had memorized in school was William Ernest  Henley\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cInvictus\xe2\x80\x9d (1875). McCain actually recited snatches of the poem in our cellphone conversation \xe2\x80\x94 not something he does every day on the campaign trail, he pointed out.'b'In any case, here\xe2\x80\x99s Henley\xe2\x80\x99s Victorian warhorse:'b''b'Out of the night that covers me,'b'\n  Black as the pit from pole to pole,'b'\nI thank whatever gods may be'b'\n  For my unconquerable soul.'b''b''b''b''b''b'In the fell clutch of circumstance'b'\n  I have not winced nor cried aloud,'b'\nUnder the bludgeonings of chance'b'\n  My head is bloody, but unbow\xe2\x80\x99d.'b''b''b''b''b''b'Beyond this place of wrath and tears'b'\n  Looms but the horror of the shade,'b'\nAnd yet the menace of the years'b'\n Finds, and shall find me, unafraid.'b''b''b''b''b''b'It matters not how strait the gate,'b'\n  How charged with punishments the scroll,'b'\nI am the master of my fate:'b'\n  I am the captain of my soul.'b''b''b''b''b'The young Henley had written this  following the amputation of his foot because of  tubercular infection. He lived until age 53, apparently unbow\xe2\x80\x99d and unafraid, a productive poet, critic and editor. (The one-legged Henley also served as an inspiration for his close friend Robert Louis Stevenson\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cTreasure Island\xe2\x80\x9d character Long John Silver.)'b'One can see why  \xe2\x80\x9cInvictus\xe2\x80\x9d might have appealed to the young  McCain. One can see why snatches of it might have stuck in his mind while a prisoner of war, and after. But his allusion to  its coda reminds us of what\xe2\x80\x99s so distinctive about McCain as a contemporary political figure: He\xe2\x80\x99s not thoroughly modern.'b'In this he differs from his competitors. Mitt Romney is the very model of a modern venture capitalist. Mike Huckabee is the very model of a modern evangelical. Rudy Giuliani is the very model of a modern can-do executive. They are impressive modern men all. But John McCain is a not-so-modern type.  One might call him a neo-Victorian \xe2\x80\x94 rigid, self-righteous and moralizing, but (or rather and) manly, courageous and principled.'b'Maybe a dose of this type of neo-Victorianism is what the 21st century needs. A fair number of Republican and independent voters seem to think so, if one can infer as much from their support of McCain at the polls. But, amazingly, a  neo-Victorian straightforwardness might also turn out to be strategically smart.'b'McCain has been the only Republican candidate who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t tried to out-think the process. Perhaps out of sheer necessity, after his campaign imploded last summer, he simply picked himself up and made his case to the voters in the various states.'b'Meanwhile, the other G.O.P. candidates are  creatures of our modern age of analysis and meta-analysis, and their campaigns have sometimes been too clever by half.  Rudy Giuliani believed it would look bad to contest states he might not win. He therefore pulled back from Iowa, New Hampshire, Michigan and South Carolina \xe2\x80\x94 and in the process surrendered his lead in Florida and nationally.'b'Conservatives were excited about Fred Thompson last spring. But Thompson apparently decided it would be too simple to strike while the iron was hot. He never recovered. And Mike Huckabee, after an extraordinary run in the fall, brought on experienced campaign pros, changed his position on immigration, raised the issue of the Confederate flag \xe2\x80\x94 and lost South Carolina.'b'Meanwhile, trying to be clever,  Mitt Romney left  South Carolina and headed to Nevada, thinking he could get more attention  for his expected victory in the caucus there. If he had stayed and campaigned  in South Carolina, he still would have won Nevada. And he might have cost McCain enough votes that McCain would have lost South Carolina to Huckabee, a much better outcome for the Romney campaign.'b'Yesterday, on \xe2\x80\x9cFox News Sunday,\xe2\x80\x9d using his most up-to-date talking points, Romney claimed to be an outside-the-Beltway candidate, by contrast with John McCain, \xe2\x80\x9cwho has been in Washington all [his] life.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Romney might have paused before charging McCain with being a prisoner of Washington. In the late 1960s and early 70s, while Romney was a missionary in France and a law and business student at Harvard, McCain wasn\xe2\x80\x99t living the good life here in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital. He was \xe2\x80\x9ctied up at the time,\xe2\x80\x9d as he once reminded the audience in a Republican candidates\xe2\x80\x99 debate, tied up and perhaps reciting to himself lines from \xe2\x80\x9cInvictus.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ve long grown used to candidates\xe2\x80\x99 cherry-picking each other\xe2\x80\x99s records to score points in a campaign.  But the new Congressional ethics law, and the role Senator Barack Obama played in passing it, have been belittled in troubling ways that are worth noting.'b'Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton voted for the ethics measure, but has lately suggested that it was neither a landmark change nor particularly controversial. Wrong on both counts.'b'No ethics law is perfect, and much depends on the vigor with which the changes are enforced. But there was a big cultural shift in the legislation\xe2\x80\x99s ban on gifts, meals and travel paid for by lobbyists, and provisions requiring greater disclosure of lawmakers\xe2\x80\x99 pet projects and making it harder for former lawmakers to capitalize on their Capitol Hill connections.'b'The measure ultimately passed the Senate by a lopsided 83-to-14 vote, hardly surprising because few lawmakers want to go on record against cleaning up Congress, especially in the aftermath of the Jack Abramoff scandal. The hard part was assembling and passing a strong package of rules against intense resistance within Congress and from lobbyists.'b'With Senator Russ Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, Mr. Obama played a central role in this effort. Forcing fellow members of Congress to disclose the names of lobbyists who bundle campaign donations is not the sort of thing that endears you to your colleagues.'b'At a debate before the New Hampshire primary, Charles Gibson, the news anchor, and former Senator John Edwards poked fun at the fact that the ban on lobbyists\xe2\x80\x99 buying meals does not prevent lobbyists from providing food and drinks to lawmakers at stand-up receptions. Mrs. Clinton cited that comment approvingly last week on \xe2\x80\x9cMeet the Press.\xe2\x80\x9d As they all surely know, there is a big difference between attending a crowded  reception and pressing a cause at intimate sit-down meals.'b'Mocking the ethics law simply fuels a cynicism that can only make future ethics battles harder.'b'Historical narratives matter. That\xe2\x80\x99s why conservatives are still writing books denouncing F.D.R. and the New Deal; they understand that the way Americans perceive bygone eras, even eras from the seemingly distant past, affects politics today.'b'And it\xe2\x80\x99s also why the furor over Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s praise for Ronald Reagan is not, as some think, overblown. The fact is that how we talk about the Reagan era still matters immensely for American politics.'b'Bill Clinton knew that in 1991, when he began his presidential campaign. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Reagan-Bush years,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared, \xe2\x80\x9chave exalted private gain over public obligation, special interests over the common good, wealth and fame over work and family. The 1980s ushered in a Gilded Age of greed and selfishness, of irresponsibility and excess, and of neglect.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Contrast that with Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s recent statement, in an interview with a Nevada newspaper, that Reagan offered a \xe2\x80\x9csense of dynamism and entrepreneurship that had been missing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Maybe Mr. Obama was, as his supporters insist, simply praising Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s political skills. (I think he was trying to curry favor with a conservative editorial board, which did in fact endorse him.) But where in his remarks was the clear declaration that Reaganomics failed?'b'For it did fail. The Reagan economy was a one-hit wonder. Yes, there was a boom in the mid-1980s, as the economy recovered from a severe recession. But while the rich got much richer, there was little sustained economic improvement for most Americans. By the late 1980s, middle-class incomes were barely higher than they had been a decade before \xe2\x80\x94 and the poverty rate had actually risen.'b'When the inevitable recession arrived, people felt betrayed \xe2\x80\x94 a sense of betrayal that Mr. Clinton was able to ride into the White House.'b'Given that reality, what was Mr. Obama talking about? Some good things did eventually happen to the U.S. economy \xe2\x80\x94 but not on Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s watch.'b'For example, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what \xe2\x80\x9cdynamism\xe2\x80\x9d means, but if it means productivity growth, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any resurgence in the Reagan years. Eventually productivity did take off \xe2\x80\x94 but even the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s own Council of Economic Advisers dates the beginning of that takeoff to 1995.'b'Similarly, if a sense of entrepreneurship means having confidence in the talents of American business leaders, that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen in the 1980s, when all the business books seemed to have samurai warriors on their covers. Like productivity, American business prestige didn\xe2\x80\x99t stage a comeback until the mid-1990s, when the U.S. began to reassert its technological and economic leadership.'b'I understand why conservatives want to rewrite history and pretend that these good things happened while a Republican was in office \xe2\x80\x94 or claim, implausibly, that the 1981 Reagan tax cut somehow deserves credit for positive economic developments that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen until 14 or more years had passed. (Does Richard Nixon get credit for \xe2\x80\x9cMorning in America\xe2\x80\x9d?)'b'But why would a self-proclaimed progressive say anything that lends credibility to this rewriting of history \xe2\x80\x94 particularly right now, when Reaganomics has just failed all over again?'b'Like Ronald Reagan, President Bush began his term in office with big tax cuts for the rich and promises that the benefits would trickle down to the middle class. Like Reagan, he also began his term with an economic slump, then claimed that the recovery from that slump proved the success of his policies.'b'And like Reaganomics \xe2\x80\x94 but more quickly \xe2\x80\x94 Bushonomics has ended in grief. The public mood today is as grim as it was in 1992. Wages are lagging behind inflation. Employment growth in the Bush years has been pathetic compared with job creation in the Clinton era. Even if we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a formal recession \xe2\x80\x94 and the odds now are that we will \xe2\x80\x94 the optimism of the 1990s has evaporated.'b'This is, in short, a time when progressives ought to be driving home the idea that the right\xe2\x80\x99s ideas don\xe2\x80\x99t work, and never have.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not just a matter of what happens in the next election. Mr. Clinton won his elections, but \xe2\x80\x94 as Mr. Obama correctly pointed out \xe2\x80\x94 he didn\xe2\x80\x99t change America\xe2\x80\x99s trajectory the way Reagan did. Why?'b'Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d say that the great failure of the Clinton administration \xe2\x80\x94 more important even than its failure to achieve health care reform, though the two failures were closely related \xe2\x80\x94 was the fact that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t change the narrative, a fact demonstrated by the way Republicans are still claiming to be the next Ronald Reagan.'b'Now progressives have been granted a second chance to argue that Reaganism is fundamentally wrong: once again, the vast majority of Americans think that the country is on the wrong track. But they won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to make that argument if their political leaders, whatever they meant to convey, seem to be saying that Reagan had it right.'b'A dozen troubled men and women from Hempstead, N.Y., got an unusual break this month. They had been caught on tape selling drugs, and as repeat offenders faced serious prison time. But after attending a community meeting, at which they endured the scoldings of neighbors and promised a prosecutor that they would stay out of trouble and take advantage of social services like drug treatment, they walked free.'b'It sounds a little like the prayer-meeting scene from \xe2\x80\x9cGuys and Dolls,\xe2\x80\x9d in which a cynical bunch of gamblers grit their teeth through a public show of piety to pay off a bet. A few lawyers, police officers and a local columnist instantly accused the Nassau County district attorney, Kathleen Rice, of rewarding criminals, presumably out of a touchy-feely preference for second and third chances over tough justice.'b'Ms. Rice, however, is no storefront missionary. She was elected in 2005 on a promise to bring fresh ideas and new energy to an office that had been on autopilot for years. Since then she has been aggressive and innovative in tackling chronic problems like drunken driving, which she has pursued with high-profile prosecutions and a policy of refusing all plea bargains.'b'The Hempstead initiative was inspired by the work of David  Kennedy, a criminal-justice expert who, while at Harvard,  developed an acclaimed strategy for reducing violent crime in Boston that was later used in  other cities. The idea is to bring multiple forces to bear, not just cops and courts. In Boston, gang leaders were summoned to \xe2\x80\x9ccall-ins,\xe2\x80\x9d meetings with ministers and prosecutors, and told to obey the law or face long sentences. The resulting plunge in violent crime \xe2\x80\x94 one gun death in two and a half years \xe2\x80\x94 was called the \xe2\x80\x9cBoston miracle.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Hempstead, which has struggled for years with poverty and drug crime, could use something similar. Its residents complained for years about a notorious open-air drug market to no great effect. Dealers and buyers would be arrested, but sent through the wash-rinse-repeat cycle of justice, which was never enough to set them straight.'b'There remains an iron fist in Ms. Rice\xe2\x80\x99s velvet glove. The suspects in her program were, she says, caught red-handed by hidden cameras. The statute of limitations for their crimes is five years, and she vows that those who slip up could  quickly find themselves behind bars. For now, they have one last chance to try to repair their lives under the watchful eyes of social service agencies, the police, and their families and neighbors.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cSex and the Teenage Girl,\xe2\x80\x9d by Caitlin Flanagan (Op-Ed, Jan. 13):'b'We can diminish the trauma of teenage pregnancy, first and foremost by diminishing its incidence. \xe2\x80\x9cAbstinence only\xe2\x80\x9d should be \xe2\x80\x9cuse protection.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Birth control, including the pill, should be available to students through the school nurse, and it should be free.

Many soldiers have scarcely seen their families in recent years. But a much larger American army, the one that's spent this century shopping, is even more overextended and its pain is now coming home to roost."b'Nobody ever made money exhorting people to save. But U.S. banks and financial institutions have spent huge amounts in recent years telling people debt is good and savings are dumb.'b'Their ads - to the effect that "good daughters go into debt to take their mothers on vacation," as Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard law professor, put it - paid off handsomely as consumers went on a debt-financed shopping spree. Consumption has driven the U.S. economy; the only problem is consumers ran out of money years ago even as they did not run out of credit cards.'b'And here we are, with the rainy day our grandparents always droned on about appearing in the form of a deluge, and no savings stashed for it, and President George W. Bush, the debt-spender par excellence, conjuring up a $150-billion stimulus package that evokes the injection of steroids into a prone athlete wrecked by a marathon.'b'This "shot in the arm," as Bush put it, may dampen a little pain. But this patient will be in intensive care for a long time.'b'As Stephen Roach, the chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, said to me: "The very low U.S. savings rate, and related huge balance of payments deficit to attract funds from overseas, are not sustainable things." The adjustment is likely to be long and painful.'b'Think of it as getting the sacrifice of U.S. soldiers and the obliviousness of U.S. shoppers a little more in sync. The non-relation between expensive wars and exempt non-warriors, a mirage Bush has fostered, has become unsustainable.'b"Roach estimated U.S. net national savings at a tiny 1.4 percent of national income and household debt at 133 percent of personal disposable income. That last figure means middle class families are tapping into home equity - borrowing against their homes - to buy their kids socks. And if they can't pay the resulting never-sleeping debt, they lose not a room or two, but the house."b'Headlines in recent weeks have focused on the international investors - from Japan to Kuwait - riding to the rescue of such American symbols as Citigroup and Merrill Lynch. The Asian financial crisis of the 1990s has gone into reverse.'b'This turnabout has provided eloquent evidence of the Asian-tilted power shift of the past decade and of the way countries from Korea to Singapore have built up dollar war chests as the United States has plunged into debt.'b"Beneath the staggering U.S. corporate losses - over $100 billion since the credit crisis began - lie the individuals suckered into taking on debts they won't be able to pay, whatever Bush hands back in tax rebates."b'As my colleague Floyd Norris has written of ballooning (and now plunging) property prices: "The only way prices got so high was that people who could not afford to buy those homes were given mortgages they could not hope to repay unless home prices kept rising."'b'A staggering number of these mortgages were either interest-only or so-called "negative amortization" contracts that left the principal owed either unreduced or mounting after monthly payments.'b'"The median American family is going into what looks like a recession owing more than 100 percent of its income," Warren said. No wonder Citigroup just set aside $4.1 billion to cover possible defaults on home-equity loans, credit cards and auto loans - shoes that have yet to drop.'b'A weak dollar, outsized personal debt, a massive current account deficit, cash-strapped banks and Asian governments purchasing U.S. Treasury bonds to finance the national debt are not signs of American strength. Nor are they necessarily signs of American decline, because inherent U.S. vitality remains enormous.'b'But as Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations, suggested: "We could be seeing a secular shift in confidence in the dollar as a store of value as the impression grows that the United States, to some degree, is losing control of its destiny."'b'I expect the United States to bounce back, but not quickly. The central fact confronting the next president will be the new limits on U.S. power, both military and economic.'b'The central challenge will be the provision of needed reforms, primarily universal health care, that begin to alleviate the financial strains on median American families and allow them to get back to saving rather than leveraging assets in a phony consumption boom.'b"This won't be easy. But then it wasn't easy for Franklin Delano Roosevelt in a far worse situation in 1933."b'Readers are invited to comment at my blog: 'b'www.iht.com/passages.'b''b'According to a federal district judge in California, the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s own research predicted that its sonar training exercises off the California coast will cause widespread harm \xe2\x80\x94 and possibly permanent injury or death \xe2\x80\x94 to nearly 30 species of marine mammals, including five species of endangered whales. That still didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop the Bush administration from rejecting the judge\xe2\x80\x99s carefully crafted plan to protect these animals from avoidable harm.'b'There is little doubt that the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s mid-frequency active sonar is an effective tool for locating quiet-running submarines and that training is needed in shallow, offshore waters where sound propagates differently than in the open ocean. The rub is that the sonar, which generates extremely intense underwater sound, is harmful to marine mammals that depend on their own sensitive acoustical systems to feed, communicate and navigate. The waters off Southern California are teeming with vulnerable species.'b'Early this month,  Judge Florence-Marie Cooper issued a tough set of mitigation measures \xe2\x80\x94 such as shutting off the sonar when mammals are too close \xe2\x80\x94 that the Navy must take to avoid a ban on its training activities. That seemed reasonable, especially given the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s own analysis of the potential harm. Last Wednesday, however, President Bush attempted to override the court order by granting the Navy waivers, on national security grounds, from two environmental laws on which the decision was based. That led the judge to stay some restrictions while leaving others in place.'b'Now the fight will resume in court over whether the White House overstepped its authority in granting the waivers. From our perspective this looks less like a matter of national security than of convenience for the Navy, which resists efforts to constrain its activities no matter the harm to marine life.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cHow Voters Think,\xe2\x80\x9d by David Brooks (column, Jan. 18):'b'Notwithstanding the opinions of a Nobel Prize winner and several other behavioral experts, I disagree with the contention that Americans are so influenced by emotion when voting.'b'Before any presidential candidates become entrenched in the primaries, party leaders seek out and encourage qualified people to run for office.

Bill and Hillary Clinton have worked hard at turning that posture into a negative, aggressively courting the black vote, while at the same time spotlighting (directly and through surrogates) the fact that Mr. Obama is black.'b'The result has been a churning of the issue of race to no constructive effect, even during last night\xe2\x80\x99s debate sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus Institute.'b'This was probably inevitable. In South Carolina the Confederate flag is flying right out there in the open and Pitchfork Ben is on display for all to see. But in most other places, the hostility to blacks remains on the down-low. No one wants to deal with it.'b'Despite big and important advances over the past several decades, including Senator Obama\xe2\x80\x99s crossover campaign, racism remains alive and well in much of the country. And yet no one \xe2\x80\x94 not Bill Clinton, the man touted (absurdly) as the first black president; or Hillary Clinton, who\xe2\x80\x99s running for president; or Barack Obama, the first black person with a real shot at the White House \xe2\x80\x94 is willing to talk honestly and openly about it.'b'For more than a decade, Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s powerful and secretive intelligence service has fueled a treacherous dynamic in South Asia by supporting Islamic militants in Afghanistan and Kashmir. Now comes the distressing, but not surprising, news that the ISI, or Inter-Services Intelligence, has lost control of some of these Taliban and Al Qaeda-linked networks. The militants have turned on their former patrons and helped carry out a record number of suicide attacks inside Pakistan in 2007, including possibly the one that killed Benazir Bhutto.'b'The report in The New York Times last week is one more alarming sign of instability in the nuclear-armed state that is supposed to be America\xe2\x80\x99s leading ally in the war on terrorism. It further confirms the failings of President Pervez Musharraf\xe2\x80\x99s government in fighting extremists, despite $10 billion in American aid since 9/11.'b'It apparently seemed like a good idea in the 1990s for the ISI to back militants as a proxy force to compete with India in Kashmir and to exert influence in neighboring Afghanistan. (The United States contributed to the problem in the 1980s when it also funneled funds through ISI to militants fighting Soviet forces in Afghanistan.) Now it is a grave threat to Pakistan. The insurgency recently has begun spilling out of the lawless tribal areas along the Afghan border and into the city of Peshawar.'b'Mr. Musharraf has rejected the idea of unilateral moves by the United States to chase Taliban and Qaeda militants on Pakistani soil. But Adm. William J. Fallon, the American commander of the Central Command, said that Pakistani officials are receptive to having American troops train and advise their forces in counterinsurgency. He said the assistance will be \xe2\x80\x9cmore robust.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The United States, already bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan, must be extremely careful about further military entanglement in Pakistan. As a long-term solution, it must encourage political and legal reforms in the tribal areas and spend as quickly as possible a new $750 million allocation by Congress that could improve the lives of Pakistanis and deprive militants of new converts. Other aid must be heavily focused on building democratic institutions.'b'The Times also reported that the ISI manipulated Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s last national election. Many Pakistanis already suspected as much and fear it could be repeated in the Feb. 18 parliamentary vote. The only way for Mr. Musharraf to regain any credibility is by ensuring that the election is free and fair.'b'Jailed activists must be released. Ousted judges must be restored. Journalists must be able to report freely. International monitors must have maximum access to assess the voting. And Mr. Musharraf must work cooperatively with whatever leaders the election produces.

Instead, ever more paranoid, he directed his staff to develop a strategy for countering \xe2\x80\x9cWestern propaganda.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s his own worst enemy and increasingly Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s as well.'b'LAST month, 'b'Harvard'b' reached into its deep pockets \xe2\x80\x94 its endowment is $35 billion \xe2\x80\x94 and changed the way it calculates student financial aid. The aim, its press release says, is \xe2\x80\x9cto make Harvard College more affordable for families across the income spectrum.\xe2\x80\x9d Last week, 'b'Yale'b', whose $22.5 billion endowment is growing even faster than Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s, followed suit. Yale\xe2\x80\x99s president, Richard Levin, said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want students to have to choose \xe2\x80\x9cbetween Yale and Harvard based on cost.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Who will benefit? Mostly the people Harvard calls \xe2\x80\x9cmiddle- and upper-middle income families,\xe2\x80\x9d by which it means those earning  $120,000 to  $180,000 each year. Yale stretches its new plan to include families earning $200,000. (The median family income in the United States is around $50,000.)'b'Next year, each of these institutions will add more than $20 million to what they now spend on financial aid, reducing the cost of a college year for families earning $180,000 to $18,000, from $30,000. That\xe2\x80\x99s good news for students at Harvard or Yale. But it\xe2\x80\x99s bad news for many hoping to attend other private four-year colleges \xe2\x80\x94 and for the nation in general.'b'The problem is that most colleges will feel compelled to follow Harvard and Yale\xe2\x80\x99s lead in price-discounting. Yet few have enough money to give more aid to relatively wealthy students without taking it away from relatively poor ones.'b'Most colleges already tend to favor the affluent  because their budgets require it. More than 90 percent of America\xe2\x80\x99s private colleges have endowments less than 1 percent the size of Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s. Giving an upper-middle-class applicant even a generous partial scholarship puts less strain on their budgets than giving a full scholarship to a student whose family can afford to pay nothing.'b'In 2004, Lawrence Summers, then Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s president, pointed out that three-fourths of the students at selective colleges come from the top income quartile and only 9 percent from the bottom two quartiles combined. And as Donald Heller, a professor of education at Pennsylvania State University, has shown in a number of studies, colleges are increasingly awarding grant money in the form of so-called merit scholarships not based on financial need. More of this assistance is going to students in the top income quartile than to any other income group.'b'It is understandable that Harvard and Yale want to make themselves more affordable. But the way they\xe2\x80\x99re going about it sets an example that is likely to make it even harder for low-income students to attend the best college for which they are qualified. Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s stated motive is to stop prospective students from \xe2\x80\x9cvoting with their feet\xe2\x80\x9d by choosing public universities or other private colleges. But surely this is not a very serious problem for a university that each year turns away hundreds of high school valedictorians and whose yield (the percentage of admitted applicants who enroll) is around 80 percent.'b'At Yale, Mr. Levin has acknowledged that another motive for the new policy is to blunt the growing pressure on wealthy universities to spend more income from their endowments. But is supporting upper-middle-class students the wisest way to dispense the additional money?'b'In fact, the new policy represents a step backward from the leadership that some elite colleges previously exerted. During the Summers presidency, Harvard focused on the problems of needy students by combining increased financial aid and  recruitment in low-income areas, raising  its percentage of students eligible for federal Pell grants to 11.9 percent in 2006, from 9.4 percent in 2004. Harvard demonstrated to other colleges that there is undiscovered talent in the two bottom income quartiles.'b'In a society that claims to believe in equal opportunity, our top universities should lead by example. The scandalous fact is that between 2004 and 2006 \xe2\x80\x94 an era of enormous private wealth accumulation \xe2\x80\x94 27 of the 30 top-ranked American universities and 26 of the top 30 liberal arts colleges saw a decline in the percentage of low-income (Pell-grant-eligible) students. The problem Mr. Summers described is only growing  worse. While some upper-middle-class families have to sacrifice in order to pay for college and may deserve more financial help, most of their children find a way to attend college. Low-income students earn bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degrees at less than one-third the rate of high-income students.'b'Only a few colleges can afford to make tuition affordable for both the poor and the affluent. For every college to become accessible to talented students regardless of income, the federal government must create enhanced grant programs, progressive tax incentives and programs that reduce the debt of graduates who spend time in public service. Otherwise, America will be the loser, no matter who wins the Harvard-Yale game.'b'The munificence of American corporate titans warms the heart, sort of. The Chronicle of Philanthropy reports that the top 50 donors gave $7.3 billion to charity last year \xe2\x80\x94 about $150 million per head. Excluding Warren Buffett\xe2\x80\x99s $43.5 billion burst of generosity in 2006, last year\xe2\x80\x99s  giving easily beat the record set the year before.'b'This is great news for many worthy causes. Last year\xe2\x80\x99s top donor, William Barron Hilton of hotel fame, pledged $1.2 billion to his father\xe2\x80\x99s foundation, which supports efforts to prevent blindness worldwide, curb drug abuse among the young and help the homeless, among other things. Other donors targeted cancer research and children\xe2\x80\x99s health clinics.'b'Yet we\xe2\x80\x99d be so much happier about all the good things America\xe2\x80\x99s moneyed elite pay for if the government made needed public investments.'b'The flip side of American private largess is the stinginess of the public sector. Philanthropic contributions in the United States \xe2\x80\x94 about $300 billion in 2006 \xe2\x80\x94 probably exceed those of any other country. By contrast, America\xe2\x80\x99s tax take is nearly the lowest in the industrial world. Federal, state and local tax collections amount to just more than 25.5 percent of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s economic output. The Finnish government collects 48.8 percent. As a result, the United States spends less on social programs than virtually every other rich industrial country, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The Finnish government probably has money to build children\xe2\x80\x99s health clinics.'b'Critics of government spending argue that America\xe2\x80\x99s private sector does a better job making socially necessary investments. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. Public spending is allocated democratically among competing demands. Rich benefactors can spend on anything they want, and they tend to spend on projects close to their hearts.'b'A study last year of 8,000 gifts of $1 million or more to 4,000 nonprofits found that 44 percent went to higher education, 16 percent to medical institutions and 12 percent to arts and cultural organizations. Only 5 percent were dedicated to social service groups. Nonprofit groups that rely on the largess of the wealthy are doing fine. The Cincinnati Ballet met its 2007 target of $1.1 million in just five months, the Chronicle said. Giving is down at Lighthouse Ministries, which serves the needy in Florida.'b'Philanthropic contributions are usually tax-free. They directly reduce the government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to engage in public spending. Perhaps the government should demand a role in charities\xe2\x80\x99 allocation of resources in exchange for the tax deduction. Or maybe the deduction should go altogether. Experts estimate that tax breaks motivate 25 percent to 30 percent of contributions.'b'In any event, social needs, like those health clinics, are not about charity. They are a necessity. America needs a government that can and will pay for them.'b'Politicians have mostly skirted poverty as a political issue since President Lyndon Johnson declared war on it more than four decades ago.

Mr. Bloomberg has created an antipoverty laboratory, putting in place 31 initiatives so far, including an innovative program of giving cash payments to parents who keep their children healthy and in school.'b'The official poverty line is itself one of the main things the mayor wants to do something about. The federal government currently puts it at income of $20,650 a year for a family of four, a calculation set at three times the annual cost of basic groceries. Mr. Bloomberg wants to break free of that archaic formula, and he seems unafraid that the new metric could reveal that there are even more poor New Yorkers than we thought.'b'The mayor, who made his personal fortune analyzing data, seems inclined to factor in what households spend on the real big-ticket items of urban life. That includes housing, child care and utilities \xe2\x80\x94 expenses that did not loom as large 40 years ago. Food, meanwhile, now claims a smaller proportion of income \xe2\x80\x94 about one-seventh \xe2\x80\x94 thanks in part to mass production.'b'Mr. Bloomberg, who is working with the National Academy of Sciences and other experts, appears to be leaning toward factoring in housing costs and counting assistance, like food stamps, as income. The resulting yardstick should not only be more reliable, it should also help gauge the success of investments that New York is making \xe2\x80\x94 about $150 million, mostly in private funds \xe2\x80\x94 to help the poor. It could also provide a model for cities that have struggled with poverty.'b'Mr. Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s war on poverty is operating on a small scale, and it has gotten far less attention than his well-publicized campaigns for gun control and against smoking.

What should we do with a big surplus? Tax cuts. How do we beat back global terrorism? Tax cuts. Increase  energy independence? Rebuild New Orleans? Expand  health insurance coverage? Tax cuts, tax cuts, tax cuts.'b'Now comes another question that becomes more pressing each day that the markets lose ground \xe2\x80\x94 one to which taxes have long been at least part of the answer. How do we stimulate the economy to prevent or shorten a recession? One way would be to repeal the Bush tax cuts two years early, in 2009.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s true that more tax cuts this year could help head off a recession in the short run. Washington could send taxpayers rebate checks or give businesses temporary breaks for new investments in equipment. President Bush is likely to propose both as part of his $150 billion package of emergency measures.'b'Similar efforts in 2001 and 2002 had mixed results at best, but so long as the tax breaks are temporary, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do much long-term economic harm either. That said, the president\xe2\x80\x99s proposal would leave out 37 percent of households because they do not earn enough to pay income taxes. A credit against payroll taxes or, better still, increasing transfers to the low-income families  most likely to spend the money \xe2\x80\x94 say, by temporarily increasing food stamps \xe2\x80\x94 would do more to energize the economy.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s bipartisan agreement that something along these lines should be done, but the president has also argued for an extension of his tax cuts,  now scheduled to expire at the end of 2010. This idea has met with less support. It would accomplish nothing in the short run, and most of the benefits would go to the very rich \xe2\x80\x94 the group least likely to spend a tax windfall.'b'But if they were repealed in a year, the Bush tax cuts could spur a burst of economic activity in 2008. If people knew that their tax rates were going up next year, they\xe2\x80\x99d work to make sure that more of their income is taxed at this year\xe2\x80\x99s  lower rates. Investors would likewise have a giant incentive to cash out their capital gains now to avoid paying higher taxes later. In 1986, stock sales doubled as taxpayers rushed to avoid the capital gains tax rate increase scheduled for 1987. If people pour their stock gains into yachts and fast cars, that\xe2\x80\x99s pure fiscal stimulus.'b'The money involved could be considerable. Capital gains in 2007 were something like $700 billion, representing well over $1 trillion in asset sales. It looks as if gains will be much lower in 2008, but a looming tax increase could easily spur an additional $500 billion in sales. If only 20 percent of that translated into extra spending, we\xe2\x80\x99d have as much or more short-term stimulus as we could get from the package Congress and the president are considering.'b'Best of all, this is one stimulus proposal that would reduce the deficit \xe2\x80\x94 the single largest threat to the economy\xe2\x80\x99s long-term health.

Whether there is a recession (two quarters of negative growth) is less important than the fact that the economy will operate well below its potential, and unemployment will grow. The country needs a stimulus, but anything we do will add to our soaring deficit, so it is important to get as much bang for the buck as possible. The optimal package would contain one fast-acting measure along with others that could lead to increased spending if and only if the economy goes into a steep downturn.'b'We should begin by strengthening the unemployment insurance system, because money received by the unemployed would be spent immediately.'b'The federal government  should also provide some assistance to states and localities, which are already beginning to feel the pinch, as property values have fallen. Typically, they respond by cutting spending, and this acts as an automatic destabilizer. Federal assistance should come in the form of support for rebuilding crucial infrastructure.'b'More federal support for state education budgets would also strengthen the economy in the short run and promote growth in the long run, as would spending to promote energy conservation and lower emissions. It may take some time to put these kinds of well-designed expenditure programs into place, but this slowdown looks as if it will last longer than some of the other downturns in recent memory. Housing prices have a long way to fall to return to more normal levels, and if Americans start saving more than they have been, consumption could remain low for some time.'b'The Bush administration has long taken the view that tax cuts (especially permanent tax cuts for the rich) are the solution to every problem. This is wrong. Tax cuts in general perpetuate the excessive consumption that has marked the American economy. But middle- and lower-income Americans have been suffering for the last seven years \xe2\x80\x94 median family income is lower today than it was in 2000. A tax rebate aimed  at lower- and middle-income households makes sense, especially since it would be fast-acting.'b'Something should be done about foreclosures,  and appropriately designed legislation allowing those who have been victims of predatory lending to stay in their homes would stimulate the economy. But we should not spend too much on this.

The cuts were not intended  to stimulate the economy, and they did so only to a limited extent. To keep the economy going, the Federal Reserve was forced to lower interest rates to an unprecedented extent and then look the other way as America engaged in reckless lending.

The next day, the Department of Agriculture asked farmers to keep their cloned animals off the market  until consumers have time to get over their anticloning prejudice. That is one prejudice I plan to hold on to. I will not be eating cloned meat.'b'The reason has nothing to do with my personal health or safety. I think the clearest way to understand the problem with cloning is to consider a broader question: Who benefits from it? Proponents will say that the consumer does, because we will get higher quality, more consistent foods from cloned animals. But the real beneficiaries are the nation\xe2\x80\x99s large meatpacking companies \xe2\x80\x94 the kind that would like it best if chickens grew in the shape of nuggets. Anyone who really cares about food \xe2\x80\x94 its different tastes, textures and delights \xe2\x80\x94 is more interested in diversity than uniformity.'b'As it happens, the same is true for anyone who cares about farmers and their animals. An agricultural system that favors cloned animals has no room for farmers who farm in different ways. Cloning, you will hear advocates say, is just another way of making cows. But every other way \xe2\x80\x94 even using embryo transplants and artificial insemination \xe2\x80\x94 allows nature to shuffle the genetic deck. A clone does not.'b'To me, this striving for uniformity is the driving and destructive force of modern agriculture. You begin with a wide array of breeds, a truly diverse pool of genes. As time passes, you impose stricter and stricter economic constraints upon those breeds and on the men and women who raise them. One by one, the breeds that don\xe2\x80\x99t meet the prevailing economic model are weeded out. By the beginning of the 21st century, you\xe2\x80\x99ve moved from the broad base of a genetic pyramid to its nearly vanishing peak, which is to say that the genetic diversity present in the economically acceptable breeds of modern livestock is minute. Then comes cloning, and we leave behind all variation.'b'Cloning is not unnatural. It is natural for humans to experiment, to try anything and everything. Nor is cloning that different from anything else we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in modern agriculture. It is another way of shifting genetic ownership from farmers to corporations. It is another way of creating still greater economic and genetic concentration in an industry that has already pushed concentration past the limits of ethical and environmental acceptability.'b'It always bears repeating that humans are only as rich as the diversity that surrounds them, whether we mean cultural or economic diversity. The same is true of genetic diversity, which is an essential bulwark against disease. These days there is less and less genetic diversity in the animals found on farms, and farmers themselves become less and less diverse because fewer and fewer of them actually own the animals they raise. They become contract laborers instead.'b'It is possible to preserve plant and crop diversity in seed banks. But there are no animal banks. Breeds of animals that are not raised die away, and the invaluable genetic archive they represent vanishes. This may look like a simple test of economic efficiency. It is really a colossal waste, of genes and of truly lovely, productive animals that are the result of years of human attention and effort. From one perspective, a cloned animal looks like a miracle of science. But from another, it looks like what it is: a dead end.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cThe New \xe2\x80\x98Old Boys\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d (Generations column, regional sections, Jan. 20):'b'Unfortunately, Kate Stone Lombardi\xe2\x80\x99s evidence to suggest the evolution of a network where professional women help other women is more anecdotal than it is the norm.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked in finance for 15 years and have never been able to identify a single reliable mentor or networking partner, and not for lack of trying.'b'To make matters worse, the majority of my thirtysomething friends and colleagues have opted to leave the work force to stay home with their children.'b'It seems that the generation of women who preceded my generation are either of the mind-set that nobody helped them break through the glass ceiling and so they can ignore any type of sisterhood, or they are just too exhausted trying to \xe2\x80\x9chave it all\xe2\x80\x9d that they simply have no time for mentoring.'b'In college I thought I could have any type of career I wanted.

African-Americans have stuck with the Democrats through a lot worse than a fight over who said what about Ronald Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s legacy.'b'And you can\xe2\x80\x99t deny the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 double-teaming is throwing Barack off his game. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell who I\xe2\x80\x99m running against sometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d he complained during Monday\xe2\x80\x99s debate.'b'But in the process, they\xe2\x80\x99re ruining the central selling point of her campaign, the story that explains why she\xe2\x80\x99s the one a dispirited country should trust to make things better.'b'Every candidacy has one. Barack\xe2\x80\x99s is about the child of a white woman from Kansas and a black man from Kenya whose very lineage makes him the vehicle for a transcendent national unity. Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s isn\xe2\x80\x99t how the smart girl from Illinois who overcame every obstacle fate could throw at her to become the first woman president. Instead, it\xe2\x80\x99s a version of the story we love best of all, about second chances and the American capacity to turn failure into redemption.'b'She admits she messed up during her early first lady years. The health care plan was a disaster. Travelgate is still too embarrassing to go near. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, we made so many mistakes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said last summer, waving away the woes of 1993 and 1994 in one fell swoop, all the while referring to the first Clinton presidency in the first person plural.'b'Her biggest error was taking a major policy role in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s administration. During the 1992 campaign many people, including me, were offended when the public seemed to want to limit Hillary to the adoring gaze and cookie-baking role. But the public was onto something. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s gender that was the problem, it was her status as spouse.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s almost never a good idea for the boss to bring a husband/wife into management. It muddies up the lines of authority, and it lets personal relationships contaminate the professional ones. As every sentient being on the planet knows, the Clintons have an extremely complicated marriage, and sticking it smack in the middle of the chain of command caused chaos.'b'The implicit promise of Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s presidential candidacy was that she had learned from Clinton I. In her, Americans would have a candidate who had been in the very center of White House decision-making. And the very fact that so much had gone wrong was added value. She is nothing if not a good learner, and \xe2\x80\x94 the story went \xe2\x80\x94 she had discovered at great price where all the landmines lay, both in the presidency and her own character. And she had forged a separate political identity in seven years in the Senate. During an era when the challenges to a new president could be sudden and overwhelming \xe2\x80\x94 and here Hillary isn\xe2\x80\x99t ashamed to play the terror card \xe2\x80\x94 she was uniquely prepared to hit the ground running and achieve the greatest do-over in American history.'b'Now, Bill\xe2\x80\x99s role as Chief Attack Dog undermines all that. If he\xe2\x80\x99s all over her campaign, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be all over her administration. Instead of the original promise of the thoroughly educated Hillary, we\xe2\x80\x99re being offered the worst-case scenario \xe2\x80\x94 that the pair of them are going to return to Pennsylvania Avenue and recreate the old Clinton chaos.'b'A lot of people are O.K. with that. (After all, we\xe2\x80\x99ve lived for seven years with a disciplined Oval Office that runs like clockwork while it spreads chaos everywhere else.) Only it\xe2\x80\x99s not change, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a breakthrough moment in American history. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a nervous decision that we\xe2\x80\x99d rather go back than risk going forward.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a story, all right, with Bill at the center. If Hillary expects anybody to get misty-eyed about the first woman president at the inauguration, she\xe2\x80\x99s got to send him home and go back to the original plotline.'b'The Beijing Olympics this summer were supposed to be China\xe2\x80\x99s coming-out party, celebrating the end of nearly two centuries of weakness, poverty and humiliation.'b'Instead, China\xe2\x80\x99s leaders are tarnishing their own Olympiad by abetting genocide in Darfur and in effect undermining the U.N. military deployment there. The result is a growing international campaign to brand these \xe2\x80\x9cThe Genocide Olympics.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is not a boycott of the Olympics. But expect Darfur-related protests at Chinese Embassies, as well as banners and armbands among both athletes and spectators. There\xe2\x80\x99s a growing recognition that perhaps the best way of averting hundreds of thousands more deaths in Sudan is to use the leverage of the Olympics to shame China into more responsible behavior.'b'The central problem is that in exchange for access to Sudanese oil, Beijing is financing, diplomatically protecting and supplying the arms for the first genocide of the 21st century. China is the largest arms supplier to Sudan, officially selling $83 million in weapons, aircraft and spare parts to Sudan in 2005, according to Amnesty International USA. That is the latest year for which figures are available.'b'China provided Sudan with A-5 Fantan bomber aircraft, helicopter gunships, K-8 military training/attack aircraft and light weapons used in Sudan\xe2\x80\x99s proxy invasion of Chad last year. China also uses the threat of its veto on the Security Council to block U.N. action against Sudan so that there is a growing risk of a catastrophic humiliation for the U.N. itself.'b'Sudan feels confident enough with Chinese backing that on Jan. 7, the Sudanese military ambushed a clearly marked U.N. convoy of peacekeepers in Darfur. Sudan claimed the attack was a mistake, but diplomats and U.N. professionals are confident that this was a deliberate attack ordered by the Sudanese leaders to put the U.N. in its place.'b'Sudan has already barred units from Sweden, Norway, Nepal, Thailand and other countries from joining the U.N. force. It has banned night flights, dithered on a status-of-forces agreement, held up communications equipment and refused to allow the U.N. to bring in foreign helicopters. The growing fear is that the U.N. force will be humiliated in Sudan as it was in Rwanda and Bosnia, causing enormous damage to international peacekeeping.'b'Another possible sign of Sudan\xe2\x80\x99s confidence: an American diplomat, John Granville, was ambushed and murdered in Khartoum early this month. Many in the diplomatic and intelligence community believe that such an assassination could not happen in Khartoum unless elements of the government were involved.'b'Chinese officials argue that they are engaging in quiet diplomacy with Sudan\xe2\x80\x99s leaders and that this is the best way to seek a solution in Darfur. They note that Sudan has other backers, and that China\xe2\x80\x99s influence is limited.'b'It is true that since the start of the \xe2\x80\x9cGenocide Olympics\xe2\x80\x9d campaign ('b'www.dreamfordarfur.org'b') a year ago, China has been more helpful, and it\xe2\x80\x99s only because of Chinese pressure on Khartoum that U.N. peacekeepers were admitted to Darfur at all. But the basic reality is that China continues to side with Sudan \xe2\x80\x94 it backed Sudan again after it ambushed the U.N. peacekeepers \xe2\x80\x94 and Sudan feels protected enough that it goes on thumbing its nose at the international community.'b'Just a few days ago, Sudan appointed Musa Hilal, a founding leader of the Arab militia known as the janjaweed, to a position in the central government. This is the man who was once quoted as having expressed gratitude for \xe2\x80\x9cthe necessary weapons and ammunition to exterminate the African tribes in Darfur.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Other countries also must do much more, but China is crucial. If Beijing were to suspend all transfers of arms and spare parts to Sudan until a peace deal is reached in Darfur, then that would change the dynamic. President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan would be terrified \xe2\x80\x94 especially since he is now preparing to resume war with South Sudan \xe2\x80\x94 and would realize that China is no longer willing to let its Olympics be stained by Darfuri blood.'b'Without his Chinese shield, Mr. Bashir would be more likely to make concessions to Darfur rebels and negotiate seriously with them, and he would no longer have political cover to resume war against South Sudan. That would make long-term peace more likely in Darfur and also in South Sudan.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m a great fan of China\xe2\x80\x99s achievements, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve often defended Beijing from unfair protectionist rhetoric spouted by American politicians. But those of us who admire China\xe2\x80\x99s accomplishments find it difficult to give credit when Beijing simultaneously underwrites the ultimate crime of genocide.'b'China deserves an international celebration to mark its historic re-emergence as a major power. But so long as China insists on providing arms to sustain a slaughter based on tribe and skin color, this will remain, sadly, The Genocide Olympics.'b'The neglect and mistreatment of the 1.5 million Palestinians trapped in the Gaza Strip is a disgrace, and a very dangerous one. They are pawns in the struggle among Hamas, which controls Gaza and uses the territory to bombard Israel daily; its rivals in the Fatah movement that run the Palestinian Authority and the West Bank; and Israel. If something isn\xe2\x80\x99t done quickly to address the Gazans\xe2\x80\x99 plight, President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s Annapolis peace process could implode.'b'It is no wonder that tens of thousands of Palestinians rushed out of Gaza into Egypt on Wednesday after a metal border wall was toppled. Life for Gazans, never easy, has been worsening since Hamas seized control last summer, and most international aid \xe2\x80\x94 except humanitarian assistance \xe2\x80\x94 was cut off. Hamas has turned a deaf ear to the Gazans\xe2\x80\x99 plight, refusing to negotiate peace or accept Israel\xe2\x80\x99s right to exist.'b'Life got truly desperate last week when Israel, reacting to a sustained and intense barrage of rocket fire, blockaded Gaza and stopped all shipments except emergency supplies. When the border wall was breached on Wednesday, Gazans went on a buying spree in Egypt, stocking up on fuel, medicine, soap, cigarettes, cement, chickens and goats.'b'We are deeply concerned about the many innocent Israelis who live along the border with Gaza and must suffer through the constant bombardment. But Israel\xe2\x80\x99s response \xe2\x80\x94 shutting off power and other essential supplies \xe2\x80\x94 is a collective punishment that will only feed anger and extremism.'b'Mr. Bush has said that he is committed to negotiating a peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians before he leaves office next year. Allowing Gaza to fester or to erupt into an all-out military confrontation is the surest way to bury that dream.'b'New, more vigorous strategies are required. Arab states, who for years have pleaded the Palestinian case and have thrown their support behind the Annapolis peace process, must use their influence (and their oil profits) to pressure Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s leaders to halt rocket attacks, renounce terrorism and align with Fatah in pursuit of a peace deal.'b'Egypt, whose stature as a peacemaker has withered under President Hosni Mubarak, should take immediate, robust steps to shut down the tunnels that allow arms and money to flow to militants in Gaza. It should also accept more responsibility for securing the common border. No Israeli prime minister can sign a peace deal if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make Israel more secure.'b'The Bush administration, the Israelis and many in Fatah have hoped that squeezing Gaza ever more tightly would force Palestinians there to turn away from Hamas. This week\xe2\x80\x99s chaos is proof of that strategy\xe2\x80\x99s high risks.'b'Tony Blair, the former British prime minister who is now the Western envoy for Palestinian economic development, needs to come up with an aid strategy that ensures Gazans aren\xe2\x80\x99t forced to suffer \xe2\x80\x94 without rewarding Hamas. Mr. Bush needs to appoint a high-level envoy to deal with this and the dozens of other crises waiting to boil over. Gaza is a reminder that nothing in the peace effort can be ignored or taken for granted.'b'Here is a simple rule for life: the food you eat is only as safe as the environment it comes from. This is narrowly true, in that food from a dirty kitchen is likely to be unsafe. But it\xe2\x80\x99s also true in the broadest sense. A good example is the tuna in sushi. Many New Yorkers have come to love the convenience, taste and aesthetic appeal of sushi. But as The Times reported Wednesday after testing tuna from 20 Manhattan stores and restaurants, sushi made from bluefin tuna may contain unacceptable levels of mercury, which acts as a neurotoxin. Every piece of that tuna, glistening on its bed of rice, is a report on the worrisome state of the oceans.'b'Bluefin tuna contain higher levels of mercury than other species of tuna because they live longer and, like humans, accumulate more mercury in their body tissues. The trouble for sushi-lovers is that it is very hard to tell what kind of tuna you\xe2\x80\x99re getting, whether you\xe2\x80\x99re dining at an exclusive restaurant or picking up some sushi at the market on the way home from work.'b'The owners of the establishments whose tuna was tested, including some very familiar names, said they would talk to their suppliers, and the suppliers will no doubt talk to their fishermen. For all this talk, no one is going to be able to find a mature bluefin tuna that is mercury-free, at least not until the oceans are mercury-free.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s easy enough to understand the transfer of mercury from fish to diner. If you regularly eat as few as six pieces of tuna sushi a week, you may be consuming more mercury than the levels considered acceptable by the Environmental Protection Agency. What is harder to keep in mind is how mercury is transferred from the environment to the fish themselves.'b'Though some mercury in the atmosphere occurs naturally, roughly two-thirds is produced by industrial sources \xe2\x80\x94 especially coal-burning power plants. It settles into the water in a form called methylmercury, is absorbed by bacteria and then makes its way up to the very top of the food chain \xe2\x80\x94  to humans. It is a reminder of how interconnected all life on earth really is. The mercury that worries us in the tuna we eat is the very residue of the way we live. The only way to reduce the one is to improve the other.'b'New York has long treated traffic gridlock like it does the weather \xe2\x80\x94 as something outside of its control. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t, though. London proved as much when it adopted congestion pricing, charging drivers to use certain streets. Traffic moved faster, tailpipe emissions went down and the fees collected went to improve public transportation. New York is right to want the same results, and this month, congestion pricing took another welcome step forward.'b'For a long time, Mayor Michael Bloomberg had the only plan on the table. It called for charging most cars $8 and trucks $21 to drive on the city\xe2\x80\x99s busiest streets during weekdays. He got a promise of more than $350 million in federal aid, which could do a lot to expand public transportation. Now, a 17-member commission has come up with four alternative proposals. Some would improve on the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s vision, while others should simply be discarded.'b'One of the proposals makes the sensible suggestion of shrinking the congestion zone to the area where traffic is worst: extending from the southern tip of Manhattan only to 60th Street, rather than 86th Street, which is the border in Mayor Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s plan. It would not charge drivers who stay within the zone. That is fair, and it would be expensive to extract fees from those already there. It would make up lost revenue by charging taxi riders an extra $1 per fare, increasing the cost of parking meters in the zone and taking away parking tax exemptions for people who live in the zone.'b'Another proposal makes the unworkable suggestion of rationing entry to the city each day based on the last digit of license plates. There are other duds, including the idea \xe2\x80\x94 sure to die in Albany \xe2\x80\x94 of putting tolls on toll-free bridges over the East and Harlem Rivers. An $8 surcharge on taxi rides, part of another proposal, is another nonstarter. We do like that proposal\xe2\x80\x99s call to limit the number of parking permits given to city workers.'b'The commission\xe2\x80\x99s proposals go to Albany next week. Legislators will have until the end of March to pass a plan that sufficiently reduces gridlock, or face the loss of those promised federal funds. New York needs to keep pushing congestion pricing forward \xe2\x80\x94 and it needs to do it right.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cFixing a Budget at the Toll Booth\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 19):'b'While Gov. Jon S. Corzine is to be commended for trying to solve the very serious problem of New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s crippling indebtedness, his proposed solution of taxing only Garden State Parkway and New Jersey Turnpike drivers is undemocratic, unnecessarily punitive and strange. His choice to skip the obvious step of raising the state\xe2\x80\x99s unusually low gas tax is inexplicable.'b'The beauty of the gas tax is that it is equitably distributed based on an exact mathematical formula of passenger miles driven per vehicle divided by that specific vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s mileage per gallon of gas. An added benefit of an increased gas tax is that it would also encourage the use of more fuel-efficient vehicles statewide and resultantly contribute to less fuel emissions into the environment.'b'Most citizens support a democratic rise in the gas tax as a more fair alternative to Governor Corzine\xe2\x80\x99s peculiar idea of maintaining a few toll roads that are the equivalent of a \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty box.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Glen Handler'b'\nVerona, N.J., Jan. 21, 2008'b''b'\xc2\x95'b'To the Editor:'b'Gov. Jon S. Corzine\xe2\x80\x99s plan to solve New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s budget problems by raising tolls on the New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway is ill considered as well as unfair. If the cost of driving most of the Turnpike were to eventually rise from $5.85 to $48, drivers would avoid the road like the plague; cars, trucks and semis would clog and pollute alternate roads, most of which are congested already.'b'Needless to say, the cost of maintenance on the non-toll roads would rise dramatically. Or does the governor propose turning all New Jersey highways into toll roads?'b'There is no easy answer to New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s budget woes, but it is clearly unfair to attempt to do it all on the backs of drivers, particularly commuters, senior citizens and truckers, who use the toll roads. Since New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s gasoline tax is lower than in many other states, raising that tax might be the way to go.'b'The casinos in Atlantic City could probably contribute more to the state if the governor has the stomach to fight the lobbyists.

By the time the toll increases are due to take effect, at least three non-gasoline automobiles are scheduled to be available to the public.'b'One is the Honda Clarity, which will run on hydrogen. The other two, the Tesla and the Chevrolet Volt, are both electric. Others are in the works. Perhaps they could be charged a lower toll in order to encourage the purchase of cars that not only run cleanly, but also would reduce our importation of petroleum.'b'David Zinkin'b'\nPrinceton, N.J., Jan. 19, 2008'b''b'Evidence is accumulating that the best treatment for Type 2 diabetes related to obesity may well be the most drastic: stomach-shrinking surgery, perhaps accompanied by intestinal rearrangements. That such extreme remedies would even be considered is a measure of how intractable the intertwined epidemics of obesity and diabetes have become in the United States.'b'Diabetes of all types is a vicious disease that kills some 73,000 Americans each year, making it the fifth-leading cause of death in this country. It is characterized by an inability to produce or use insulin, with the result that blood glucose levels soar, damaging the kidneys, blood vessels in the eyes and nerves in the feet.'b'There is no cure, only the hope that it can be controlled by strict dieting, drugs and a lifetime of careful living. Unfortunately, many patients are unable to comply with the onerous regimen, pounds lost are ultimately regained and legions of patients suffer heart attacks, blindness, kidney failure or foot amputations.'b'Against that discouraging backdrop, a new study by Australian researchers, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, seems to promise extraordinary results, albeit with many caveats about the preliminary nature of the findings in a relatively small group of patients who had mild cases of the disease.'b'The study involved 60 patients who were obese and had recently developed Type 2 diabetes, by far the most prevalent kind. Half were given conventional treatments, including diet, exercise and medicines. The rest got conventional treatment plus surgery in which a band is placed around the stomach to constrict its size and limit eating.'b'In almost three-quarters of those who had surgery, all signs of diabetes disappeared. Only 13 percent of those given conventional therapy had complete remissions. The difference was because of weight loss. Patients in the medically treated group lost only 1.7 percent of their weight, on average. Those in the surgically treated group lost 20.7 percent. There were no serious complications from the minimally invasive procedure.'b'Other studies have shown that gastric bypass surgery, a riskier operation in which the stomach is stapled and the intestinal tract rearranged, is even more effective, achieving remission in a matter of days or weeks, well before substantial weight loss has occurred. This is apparently because the operation causes metabolic changes that lower blood glucose levels beyond what weight loss alone can accomplish.'b'Some experts predict that surgery will become a common treatment for diabetes in coming years. Before that happens, it will be essential to see how patients fare over an extended period and get a better fix on which patients are most likely to benefit from costly surgeries that always bear some risk.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cTrapped in Gaza\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 24):'b'The treatment of the Gazans is, as you say, a disgrace. But who is to blame for the disgrace? Here, two crucial facts have a way of conveniently disappearing.'b'First, the cause of the Gazans\xe2\x80\x99 ordeal is not the inevitable and measured Israeli response to an unrelenting rocket bombardment of Hamas rockets from Gaza; the cause is the bombardment, and that bombardment will continue as long as Hamas deems it essential to its war of attrition on Israel\xe2\x80\x99s very existence.'b'The notion of a measured response needs emphasis here; any other state being forced to die the death of a thousand cuts would long ago have declared total war against its would-be destroyers.'b'Second, the ordinary citizens of Gaza are not mere \xe2\x80\x9cpawns\xe2\x80\x9d in the war of Hamas on the existence of Israel. They have been turned into human shields by the very same Hamas they elected to represent and protect them, but whose hatred of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s existence they share.'b'This blindness is the Gazans\xe2\x80\x99 tragedy.

If the Annapolis initiative crumbles, it will be because for too long the Palestinians have tried to avoid the reality that there are consequences for actions \xe2\x80\x94 and in particular, actions that are under their control.'b'David M. Hirsch'b'\nProvidence, R.I., Jan. 24, 2008'b''b'We have strong disagreements with all the Republicans running for president. The leading candidates have no plan for getting American troops out of Iraq. They are too wedded to discredited economic theories and unwilling even now to break with the legacy of President Bush. We disagree with them strongly on what makes a good Supreme Court justice.'b'Still, there is a choice to be made, and it is an easy one. Senator John McCain of Arizona is the only Republican who promises to end the George Bush style of governing from and on behalf of a small, angry fringe. With a record of working across the aisle to develop sound bipartisan legislation, he would offer a choice to a broader range of Americans than the rest of the Republican field.'b'We have shuddered at Mr. McCain\xe2\x80\x99s occasional, tactical pander to the right because he has demonstrated that he has the character to stand on principle. He was an early advocate for battling  global warming and risked his presidential bid to uphold fundamental American values in the immigration debate. A genuine war hero among Republicans who proclaim their zeal to be commander in chief, Mr. McCain argues passionately that a country\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of prisoners in the worst of times says a great deal about its character.'b'Why, as a New York-based paper, are we not backing Rudolph Giuliani? Why not choose the man we endorsed for re-election in 1997 after a first term in which he showed that a dirty, dangerous, supposedly ungovernable city could become clean, safe and orderly? What about the man who stood fast on Sept. 11, when others, including President Bush, went AWOL?'b'That man is not running for president.'b'The real Mr. Giuliani, whom many New Yorkers came to know and mistrust, is a narrow, obsessively secretive, vindictive man who saw no need to limit police power. Racial polarization was as much a legacy of his tenure as the rebirth of Times Square.'b'Mr. Giuliani\xe2\x80\x99s arrogance and bad judgment are breathtaking. When he claims fiscal prudence, we remember how he ran through surpluses without a thought to the inevitable downturn and bequeathed huge deficits to his successor. He fired Police Commissioner William Bratton, the architect of the drop in crime, because he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t share the limelight. He later gave the job to Bernard Kerik, who has now been indicted on fraud and corruption charges.'b'The Rudolph Giuliani of 2008 first shamelessly turned the horror of 9/11 into a lucrative business, with a secret client list, then exploited his city\xe2\x80\x99s and the country\xe2\x80\x99s nightmare to promote his presidential campaign.'b'The other candidates offer no better choices.'b'Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s shape-shifting rivals that of Mr. Giuliani. It is hard to find an issue on which he has not repositioned himself to the right since he was governor of Massachusetts. It is impossible to figure out where he stands or where he would lead the country.'b'Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, is an affable, reassuring Baptist minister who talks about a softer Christian conservativism. His policies tell the real story. To attract Republican primary voters, he has become an anti-immigrant absolutist. His insertion of religion into the race, herding Mr. Romney into a defense of his beliefs, disqualified him for the Oval Office.'b'Mr. McCain was one of the first prominent Republicans to point out how badly the war in Iraq was being managed. We wish he could now see as clearly past the temporary victories produced by Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s unsustainable escalation, which have not led to any change in Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s murderous political calculus. At the least, he owes Americans a real idea of how he would win this war, which he says he can do. We disagree on issues like reproductive rights and gay marriage.'b'In 2006, however, Mr. McCain stood up for the humane treatment of prisoners and for a ban on torture. We said then that he was being conned by Mr. Bush, who had no intention of following the rules. But Mr. McCain took a stand, just as he did in recognizing the threat of global warming early. He has been a staunch advocate of campaign finance reform, working with Senator Russ Feingold, among the most liberal of Democrats, on groundbreaking legislation, just as he worked with Senator Edward Kennedy on immigration reform.'b'That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make him a moderate, but it makes him the best choice for the party\xe2\x80\x99s presidential nomination.'b'There is roughly a 100 percent chance that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to spend much of this year talking about the subprime mortgage crisis, the financial markets and the worsening economy. The only question is which narrative is going to prevail, the Greed Narrative or the Ecology Narrative.'b'The Greed Narrative goes something like this: The financial markets are dominated by absurdly overpaid zillionaires. They invent complex financial instruments, like globally securitized subprime mortgages that few really understand. They dump these things onto the unsuspecting, sending destabilizing waves of money sloshing around the globe. Economies melt down. Regular people lose jobs and savings. Meanwhile, the financial insiders still get their obscene bonuses, rain or shine.'b'The morality of the Greed Narrative is straightforward. A small number of predators destabilize the economy and reap big bonuses. The financial system is fundamentally broken. Government should step in and control the malefactors of great wealth.'b'The Ecology Narrative is different. It starts with the premise that investors and borrowers cooperate and compete in a complex ecosystem. Everyone seeks wealth while minimizing risk. As Jim Manzi, a software entrepreneur who specializes in applied artificial intelligence, has noted, the chief tension in this ecosystem is between innovation and uncertainty. We could live in a safer world, but we\xe2\x80\x99d have to forswear creativity.'b'The United States has generally opted for financial innovation. This has worked out pretty well. The U.S. has enjoyed 25 years of strong economic growth, in part because capital has been efficiently allocated to companies that can use it well.'b'Financial instruments like adjustable-rate and subprime mortgages have allowed millions of people to get homes they could not otherwise purchase, and research shows that most of these tools have been used intelligently.'b'Hedge funds have proliferated to help investors manage risk. These things exist precisely because investors want to smooth out volatility. In the old days, a blow to, say, the Texas economy could have dried up lending in Texas, but now funds flow globally, and money from one part of the world can shore up weakness in another.'b'As Sebastian Mallaby of the Council on Foreign Relations has pointed out, time and again hedge funds have dampened market instability. If a currency, a company or a stock market starts to spiral downward, deep-pocketed funds, smelling bargains, will come in and stabilize its assets. If a company\xe2\x80\x99s price is rising to unsustainable levels, contrarian funds bet against the hype.'b'Most of the time, the complex new instruments diversify risk and serve the public good. But life requires trade-offs, and, as we\xe2\x80\x99re being reminded this week, the innovation process involves a painful adolescence.'b'When a new instrument enters the market, it takes a while before people understand and institutionalize it. Whether the product is high-yield bonds or mortgage-backed securities, there\xe2\x80\x99s a tendency to get carried away.'b'In the first stage of this adolescence, investors look around and see everybody else making money off some new instrument. As Nicholas Bloom of Stanford notes: \xe2\x80\x9cThey assume they are fine because they see everyone else buying it.\xe2\x80\x9d Individual bankers have a special incentive to get in on the ride because their yearly bonus is determined by how they do in the short term.'b'Then there\xe2\x80\x99s a moment when people realize how stupid they have been. They\xe2\x80\x99ve bought a pile of subprime mortgages without really knowing what they\xe2\x80\x99ve purchased. The ratings agencies suddenly don\xe2\x80\x99t look so reliable. The cycle of overconfidence becomes a cycle of underconfidence because nobody knows who is holding worthless paper.'b'Then, finally, maturity sets in. Those who have lost great gobs of money get fired. People still find the new product useful, but within parameters and with greater safeguards.'b'The lesson of the Ecology Narrative is that, in most cases, the market corrects itself. Maybe this year banks will change their pay structure so there\xe2\x80\x99s not so much emphasis on short-term results. Maybe companies will change their boards to improve scrutiny over complex new instruments. In short, markets adapt.'b'People who embrace the Ecology Narrative don\xe2\x80\x99t like the offensive bonuses that get handed out on Wall Street. They just don\xe2\x80\x99t see any way the government can curtail them without rending the fabric of the ecosystem. They don\xe2\x80\x99t like the periodic crises, but don\xe2\x80\x99t see how government can prevent them without clamping down on innovation. The challenge is to give people the means to withstand the perturbations.'b'The Ecology Narrative is not morally satisfying. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bet on its popularity as a backlash against Wall Street and finance sweeps across a recession-haunted country. But the Ecology Narrative has one thing going for it.

That is not remotely the case this year.'b'The early primaries produced two powerful main contenders: Hillary Clinton, the brilliant if at times harsh-sounding senator from New York; and Barack Obama, the incandescent if still undefined senator from Illinois. The remaining long shot, John Edwards, has enlivened the race with his own brand of raw populism.'b'As Democrats look ahead to the primaries in the biggest states on Feb. 5, The Times\xe2\x80\x99s editorial board strongly recommends that they select Hillary Clinton as their nominee for the 2008 presidential election.'b'We have enjoyed hearing Mr. Edwards\xe2\x80\x99s fiery oratory, but we cannot support his candidacy. The former senator from North Carolina has repudiated so many of his earlier positions, so many of his Senate votes, that we\xe2\x80\x99re not sure where he stands. We certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t buy the notion that he can hold back the tide of globalization.'b'By choosing Mrs. Clinton, we are not denying Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s appeal or his gifts. The idea of the first African-American nominee of a major party also is exhilarating, and so is the prospect of the first woman nominee. \xe2\x80\x9cFirstness\xe2\x80\x9d is not a reason to choose. The times that false choice has been raised, more often by Mrs. Clinton, have tarnished the campaign.'b'Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton would both help restore America\xe2\x80\x99s global image, to which President Bush has done so much grievous harm. They are committed to changing America\xe2\x80\x99s role in the world, not just its image.'b'On the major issues, there is no real gulf separating the two. They promise an end to the war in Iraq, more equitable taxation, more effective government spending, more concern for social issues, a restoration of civil liberties and an end to the politics of division of George W. Bush and Karl Rove.'b'Mr. Obama has built an exciting campaign around the notion of change, but holds no monopoly on ideas that would repair the governing of America. Mrs. Clinton sometimes overstates the importance of r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9. Hearing her talk about the presidency, her policies and answers for America\xe2\x80\x99s big problems, we are hugely impressed by the depth of her knowledge, by the force of her intellect and by the breadth of, yes, her experience.'b'It is unfair, especially after seven years of Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s inept leadership, but any Democrat will face tougher questioning about his or her fitness to be commander in chief. Mrs. Clinton has more than cleared that bar, using her years in the Senate well to immerse herself in national security issues, and has won the respect of world leaders and many in the American military. She would be a strong commander in chief.'b'Domestically, Mrs. Clinton has tackled complex policy issues, sometimes failing. She has shown a willingness to learn and change. Her current proposals on health insurance reflect a clear shift from her first, famously disastrous foray into the issue. She has learned that powerful interests cannot simply be left out of the meetings. She understands that all Americans must be covered \xe2\x80\x94 but must be allowed to choose their coverage, including keeping their current plans. Mr. Obama may also be capable of tackling such issues, but we have not yet seen it. Voters have to judge candidates not just on the promise they hold, but also on the here and now.'b'The sense of possibility, of a generational shift, rouses Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s audiences and not just through rhetorical flourishes. He shows voters that he understands how much they hunger for a break with the Bush years, for leadership and vision and true bipartisanship. We hunger for that, too. But we need more specifics to go with his amorphous promise of a new governing majority, a clearer sense of how he would govern.'b'The potential upside of a great Obama presidency is enticing, but this country faces huge problems, and will no doubt be facing more that we can\xe2\x80\x99t foresee. The next president needs to start immediately on challenges that will require concrete solutions, resolve, and the ability to make government work. Mrs. Clinton is more qualified, right now, to be president.'b'We opposed President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s decision to invade Iraq and we disagree with Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s vote for the resolution on the use of force. That\xe2\x80\x99s not the issue now; it is how the war will be ended. Mrs. Clinton seems not only more aware than Mr. Obama of the consequences of withdrawal, but is already thinking through the diplomatic and military steps that will be required to contain Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s chaos after American troops leave.'b'On domestic policy, both candidates would turn the government onto roughly the same course \xe2\x80\x94 shifting resources to help low-income and middle-class Americans, and broadening health coverage dramatically. Mrs. Clinton also has good ideas about fixing the dysfunction in Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s No Child Left Behind education program.'b'Mr. Obama talks more about the damage Mr. Bush has done to civil liberties, the rule of law and the balance of powers. Mrs. Clinton is equally dedicated to those issues, and more prepared for the Herculean task of figuring out exactly where, how and how often the government\xe2\x80\x99s powers have been misused \xe2\x80\x94 and what must now be done to set things right.'b'As strongly as we back her candidacy, we urge Mrs. Clinton to take the lead in changing the tone of the campaign. It is not good for the country, the Democratic Party or for Mrs. Clinton, who is often tagged as divisive, in part because of bitter feeling about her husband\xe2\x80\x99s administration and the so-called permanent campaign. (Indeed, Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s overheated comments are feeding those resentments, and could do long-term damage to her candidacy if he continues this way.)'b'We know that she is capable of both uniting and leading. We saw her going town by town through New York in 2000, including places where Clinton-bashing was a popular sport. She won over skeptical voters and then delivered on her promises and handily won re-election in 2006.'b'Mrs. Clinton must now do the same job with a broad range of America\xe2\x80\x99s voters. She will have to let Americans see her power to listen and lead, but she won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to do it town by town.'b'When we endorsed Mrs. Clinton in 2006, we were certain she would continue to be a great senator, but since her higher ambitions were evident, we wondered if she could present herself as a leader to the nation.'b'Her ideas, her comeback in New Hampshire and strong showing in Nevada, her new openness to explaining herself and not just her programs, and her abiding, powerful intellect show she is fully capable of doing just that.

Uncontrolled immigration has replaced weapons of mass destruction as the supreme security concern.'b'What the Republican Party desperately needs is a domestic program that responds to the values and needs of the tens of millions of American families making around $70,000 a year. That\xe2\x80\x99s not an impossible order. But it will take some new thinking by our presidential candidates and other leaders to meet it.'b'House Democrats and the White House have reached an agreement on an economic stimulus plan. Unfortunately, the plan  \xe2\x80\x94  which essentially consists of nothing but tax cuts and gives most of those tax cuts to people in fairly good financial shape  \xe2\x80\x94  looks like a lemon.'b'Specifically, the Democrats appear to have buckled in the face of the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s ideological rigidity, dropping demands for provisions that would have helped those most in need. And those happen to be the same provisions that might actually have made the stimulus plan effective.'b'Those are harsh words, so let me explain what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.'b'Aside from business tax breaks  \xe2\x80\x94 which are an unhappy story for another column  \xe2\x80\x94  the plan gives each worker making less than $75,000 a $300 check, plus additional amounts to people who make enough to pay substantial sums in income tax. This ensures that the bulk of the money would go to people who are doing O.K. financially  \xe2\x80\x94  which misses the whole point.'b'The goal of a stimulus plan should be to support overall spending, so as to avert or limit the depth of a recession. If the money the government lays out doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get spent  \xe2\x80\x94  if it just gets added to people\xe2\x80\x99s bank accounts or used to pay off debts  \xe2\x80\x94  the plan will have failed.'b'And sending checks to people in good financial shape does little or nothing to increase overall spending. People who have good incomes, good credit and secure employment make spending decisions based on their long-term earning power rather than the size of their latest paycheck. Give such people a few hundred extra dollars, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll just put it in the bank.'b'In fact, that appears to be what mainly happened to the tax rebates affluent Americans received during the last recession in 2001.'b'On the other hand, money delivered to people who aren\xe2\x80\x99t in good financial shape  \xe2\x80\x94  who are short on cash and living check to check  \xe2\x80\x94  does double duty: it alleviates hardship and also pumps up consumer spending.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why many of the stimulus proposals we were hearing just a few days ago focused in the first place on expanding programs that specifically help people who have fallen on hard times, especially unemployment insurance and food stamps. And these were the stimulus ideas that received the highest grades in a recent analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.'b'There was also some talk among Democrats about providing temporary aid to state and local governments, whose finances are being pummeled by the weakening economy. Like help for the unemployed, this would have done double duty, averting hardship and heading off spending cuts that could worsen the downturn.'b'But the Bush administration has apparently succeeded in killing all of these ideas, in favor of a plan that mainly gives money to those least likely to spend it.'b'Why would the administration want to do this? It has nothing to do with economic efficacy: no economic theory or evidence I know of says that upper-middle-class families are more likely to spend rebate checks than the poor and unemployed. Instead, what seems to be happening is that the Bush administration refuses to sign on to anything that it can\xe2\x80\x99t call a \xe2\x80\x9ctax cut.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Behind that refusal, in turn, lies the administration\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to slashing tax rates on the affluent while blocking aid for families in trouble  \xe2\x80\x94  a commitment that requires maintaining the pretense that government spending is always bad. And the result is a plan that not only fails to deliver help where it\xe2\x80\x99s most needed, but is likely to fail as an economic measure.'b'The words of Franklin Delano Roosevelt come to mind: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have always known that heedless self-interest was bad morals; we know now that it is bad economics.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And the worst of it is that the Democrats, who should have been in a strong position  \xe2\x80\x94  does this administration have any credibility left on economic policy?  \xe2\x80\x94  appear to have caved in almost completely.'b'Yes, they extracted some concessions, increasing rebates for people with low income while reducing giveaways to the affluent. But basically they allowed themselves to be bullied into doing things the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s way.'b'And that could turn out to be a very bad thing.'b'We don\xe2\x80\x99t know for sure how deep the coming slump will be, or even whether it will meet the technical definition of a recession. But there\xe2\x80\x99s a real chance not just that it will be a major downturn, but that the usual response to recession \xe2\x80\x94  interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve \xe2\x80\x94  won\xe2\x80\x99t be sufficient to turn the economy around. (For more on this, see my blog at 'b'krugman.blogs.nytimes.com'b'.)'b'And if that happens, we\xe2\x80\x99ll deeply regret the fact that the Bush administration insisted on, and Democrats accepted, a so-called stimulus plan that just won\xe2\x80\x99t do the job.'b'New York has never had a more fiscally fluent mayor than Michael Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire. As he unveiled his preliminary $58.5 billion budget this week, the mayor warned of challenges ahead, but he also predicted that he could successfully steer the city through another downturn. There are a lot of uncertainties, but we take comfort in knowing that Mr. Bloomberg has prepared New York to weather bad times.'b'The $4.6 billion in boom-time surpluses he salted away will help balance budgets this year and next. Predictions of huge future shortfalls \xe2\x80\x94 $4.2 billion in 2010 and $5.6 billion in 2011 \xe2\x80\x94 meant the mayor had to begin cutting, but thankfully not slashing, services.'b'Next year\xe2\x80\x99s spending will actually increase slightly because of obligations like Medicaid and pension costs, leaving less for other programs. Still, as Mr. Bloomberg looks for ways to save about $1.5 billion this year and next, we wish he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t decided to shortchange senior programs, summer jobs for teenagers and libraries. We would also like to see details of his plan to decrease education spending by more than $300 million next year. Even from an education budget of $17 billion, it could hurt.'b'Mr. Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to cut funds for 1,000 police officer positions, while dire sounding, is more like bookkeeping. The force that has kept crime so low is not at full strength, so its size will not really change.'b'The mayor seems eager to keep a $400 property tax rebate for homeowners, even though most New Yorkers rent and don\xe2\x80\x99t reap the reward. He sounds less committed to, and more pragmatic about his promised, $1 billion, 7 percent property tax reduction. That may have to be revoked to replenish city coffers. We applaud his one proposed tax increase: 50 cents more for a pack of cigarettes. That is both sound fiscal and health policy, and we urge the mayor to press hard for Albany\xe2\x80\x99s approval.'b'Preliminary budgets are built on best guesses, and the mayor and the City Council have until July to negotiate a final plan. All signs \xe2\x80\x94 from the subprime mortgage crisis to Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s faltering fortunes \xe2\x80\x94 point to a need for prudence.

If there\xe2\x80\x99s a crash, everybody dies, right? Most airline passengers apparently feel this way. More than half of passengers in a large study by the National Transportation Safety Board admitted to routinely ignoring the flight attendants, heeding no more than half of their little spiel. But what the flight attendants say can very well save lives, because in any airplane accident, passengers are five times more likely to survive than to die.'b'Look at what happened at Heathrow Airport in London last week. A Boeing 777 crash-landed, tearing off the landing gear and damaging the airplane beyond repair. Yet there were only 13 minor injuries among the 152 passengers.'b'In 23 of the 27 DC-10 airplanes destroyed in accidents, 90 percent of the passengers have survived. In one 1989 crash in Sioux City, Iowa \xe2\x80\x94 a crash so violent that the plane broke into multiple sections and a fireball erupted \xe2\x80\x94 185 of the 296 passengers and crew members survived, including a baby placed on the floor (as instructed).'b'The flight attendants have reason to tell you, first of all, to keep your seat belt fastened. People have broken their necks bouncing off the ceiling when a plane suddenly drops a few hundred feet in severe turbulence. But for anyone buckled in, a sudden drop, however stomach-churning, poses no danger.'b'Passengers are often disturbed when they look out the window in mild turbulence and see the wings flapping like a bird\xe2\x80\x99s. But the wings of a large commercial jet have never flapped so violently as to fall off. During certification, the wings of 777 are bent upward 24 feet \xe2\x80\x94 the flexibility required to pull out of an emergency dive.'b'Modern aircraft are built sturdily enough to hold together even with blast damage. In 1986, a Trans World Airlines jet flying over Greece withstood the explosion of a bomb in a piece of luggage. Four passengers were killed, but the plane landed safely, and the other 117 people on board survived. In 1988, after an explosive decompression caused by metal fatigue ripped an 18-by-14-foot hole in the top of the first-class section of a 737 flying over Hawaii, one flight attendant standing nearby was lost. But the passengers were protected by their seat belts.'b'Other perfectly survivable occurrences include violent engine shuddering, sputtering flames and engine shutdown. Even planes with only two engines are perfectly able to fly with just one. The likeliest outcome is a safe landing at the closest airstrip. In 1965, a 707 landed safely at a California air base after an engine fire had burned off 30 feet of one wing. (The engine fire suppression systems on today\xe2\x80\x99s airplanes would probably have kept that from happening.) In February 2005, one of the four engines on a British Airlines 747 shut down shortly after takeoff from Los Angeles, yet the plane still flew safely to England \xe2\x80\x94 causing only a little controversy over the British pilots\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of American flight safety rules.'b'After an emergency landing or a crash during takeoff, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to get out of the plane as soon as possible. Fuel can easily leak and ignite, so a post-crash fire is a real danger. But evacuating a plane full of people is surprisingly easy, as long as passengers don\xe2\x80\x99t panic. When certifying the design of a new aircraft, the Federal Aviation Administration requires that it be possible to evacuate the plane within 90 seconds even with unrehearsed passengers and half the exits blocked.'b'This is exactly what happened in 2005 when an Airbus landing in Toronto overran the runway and crashed. The flight attendants escorted out 309 passengers and crew members in less than two minutes, even though four of the eight exits were unusable and many passengers paused on the way out to pick up carry-on bags and aim cellphone cameras. The plane then exploded in flames, burning the top half away and leaving the hull looking like a filleted fish.'b'It was not surprising, after the recent crash landing in London, how easily the flight attendants directed passengers and crew onto the emergency exit slides. Fortunately, few of us ever have the opportunity to witness how well trained the flight attendants are. But we should still pay attention to what they say.'b'Coinciding with this month\xe2\x80\x99s 35th anniversary of the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling that legalized abortion, a new study shows that the United States continues to make progress on reducing the abortion rate. The progress would be greater if more was done to avoid unintended pregnancies.'b'Between 2000 and 2005, the last year in the study by the Guttmacher Institute, the number of abortions performed yearly dropped from 1.3 million to 1.2 million, the fewest since 1974. The proportion of pregnancies ending in abortion also declined significantly.'b'Abortion opponents like the National Right to Life Committee seized upon the numbers as vindication for their strategy of demonizing abortion and making it harder for women to obtain one. Many states now mandate counseling sessions beforehand. But a harder look at the data suggests another explanation.'b'Almost two-thirds of the decline in the total number of abortions can be traced to eight jurisdictions with few or no abortion restrictions \xe2\x80\x94 New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, California, Oregon, Washington State and the District of Columbia. These are places, notes the Guttmacher Institute\xe2\x80\x99s president, Sharon Camp, that have shown a commitment to real sex education, largely departing from the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s abstinence-only approach. These jurisdictions also help women avoid unintended pregnancies by making contraception widely available.'b'The lesson: prevention works. Restrictions on abortion serve mainly to hurt poor women by postponing abortions until later in pregnancy. While shifting social mores may change some people\xe2\x80\x99s behavior, the best practical strategy for reducing abortions is to focus on helping women avoid unwanted pregnancies.'b'One of the most intriguing findings of the abortion study has to do with RU-486, which allows women to safely terminate a pregnancy in its first weeks without surgery. Guttmacher Institute researchers found that a significant decline in the number of abortion providers over the past decade is being offset by an increase in providers that offer the drug.'b'This growing access, along with refinements in ultrasound imaging help explain the positive trend toward earlier abortions. It has long been true that nearly 90 percent of abortions in this country occur in the first trimester, but the number that occur within the first eight weeks of pregnancy has increased sharply.'b'Still, in 2005 about one in five pregnancies ended in abortion, emphasizing the need for a national emphasis on better sex education and access to contraception.'b'To the Editor:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne Argument, 12 Million Holes\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 18), about immigration, does not discuss the enforcement paradox that brought us to the current crisis.'b'For decades, migrant workers came north for several months each year to harvest seasonal crops, sending their wages home to their families.

The Republicans repaid them by announcing they would block any further attempts to reach a compromise.'b'It is now up to the House to protect Americans\xe2\x80\x99 rights. Mr. Bush has already started issuing the ritual claims that if his bill is not passed instantly, Osama bin Laden will be telephoning his agents in the United States and no one will know. Let us be clear, Mr. Bush has always had the authority to order emergency wiretaps \xe2\x80\x94 and get court approval after the fact. That has never been the problem with FISA.'b'The House should vote to extend last summer\xe2\x80\x99s flawed rules for at least 30 days and go on recess, forcing the Senate to do the same thing, and then bring the whole matter to a conference committee. There will then be plenty of time for a real debate.'b'Lawmakers and the rest of the nation should bear this in mind: Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s version of this law does not make intelligence-gathering more robust. Opponents like Senators Christopher Dodd and Patrick Leahy want to spy on Al Qaeda, too. They\xe2\x80\x99re just not willing to do it in a way that undermines the very democracy that the spies, Congress and the president are supposed to be protecting.'b'Evanston, Ill.'b'SENATOR Hillary Clinton has based her campaign on experience \xe2\x80\x94 35 years of it by her count. That must include her eight years in the White House.'b'Some may debate whether those years count as executive experience. But there can be no doubt that her husband had the presidential experience, fully. He has shown during his wife\xe2\x80\x99s campaign that he is a person of initiative and energy. Does anyone expect him not to use his experience in an energetic way if he re-enters the White House as the first spouse?'b'Mrs. Clinton claims that her time in that role was an active one. He can hardly be expected to show less involvement when he returns to the scene of his time in power as the resident expert. He is not the kind to be a potted plant in the White House.'b'Which raises an important matter. Do we really want a plural presidency?'b'This is not a new question. It was intensely debated in the convention that formulated our Constitution. The Virginia Plan for the new document submitted by Edmund Randolph and the New Jersey Plan submitted by William Paterson left open the number of officers to hold the executive power.'b'Some (like Hugh Williamson of North Carolina) argued for a three-person executive, each member coming from a different region of the country. More people argued (like George Mason of Virginia) for a multiple-member executive council.'b'The objection to giving executive power to a single person came from the framers\xe2\x80\x99 experience with the British monarchy and the royal governors of the colonies. They did not want another monarch.'b'But as the debate went forward a consensus formed that republican rule would check the single initiative of a president. In fact, accountability to the legislature demanded that responsibility be lodged where it could be called to account. A plural presidency would leave it uncertain whom to check. How, for instance, would Congress decide which part of the executive should be impeached in case of high crimes and misdemeanors? One member of the plural executive could hide behind the other members.'b'James Wilson of Pennsylvania made the argument for a single officeholder with typical depth and precision: \xe2\x80\x9cTo control the executive, you must unite it. One man will be more responsible than three. Three will contend among themselves till one becomes the master of his colleagues. In the triumvirates of Rome, first Caesar, then Augustus, are witnesses of this truth. The kings of Sparta and the consuls of Rome prove also the factious consequences of dividing the executive magistracy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Wilson and his allies carried the day; and their argument is as good now as when they embedded it in the Constitution.'b'One problem with the George W. Bush administration is that it has brought a kind of plural presidency in through the back door. Vice President Dick Cheney has run his own executive department, with its own intelligence and military operations, not open to scrutiny, as he hides behind the putative president.'b'No other vice president in our history has taken on so many presidential prerogatives, with so few checks. He is an example of the very thing James Wilson was trying to prevent by having one locus of authority in the executive. The attempt to escape single responsibility was perfectly exemplified when his counsel argued that Mr. Cheney was not subject to executive rules because he was also part of the legislature.'b'We have seen in this campaign how former President Clinton rushes to the defense of presidential candidate Clinton. Will that pattern of protection be continued into the new presidency, with not only his defending her but also her defending whatever he might do in his energetic way while she\xe2\x80\x99s in office? It seems likely. And at a time when we should be trying to return to the single-executive system the Constitution prescribes, it does not seem to be a good idea to put another co-president in the White House.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cPlan to Replace Bridge Prompts Lawsuits\xe2\x80\x9d (New Jersey and the Region, Jan. 20):'b'The New Jersey Department of Transportation wants to tear down the 74-year-old drawbridge connecting Highlands and Sea Bright and replace it with a 65-foot-high fixed-span bridge.

The old drawbridge will come down to make way for a wide, highway-style bridge.

When a presidential candidate starts confiding to his audience that he could give his speech in his sleep, as Rudy has been doing, it may be time to consider another line of work.'b'Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s Florida primary is supposed to be the Giuliani firewall, his explanation for why he kept coming in third or fourth or fifth everywhere else. Of course he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get any votes in Michigan! How could anybody expect him to do well in Iowa? He had to campaign in Florida!'b'After a while, it began to take on the eerie quality of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shining.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s only at 15 percent in some of the polls \xe2\x80\x94 could he really have been campaigning here for a month and a half? Cue a picture of the candidate sitting in a basement somewhere, writing \xe2\x80\x9cAll work and no play makes Rudy a dull boy\xe2\x80\x9d on the walls.'b'At first, Giuliani\xe2\x80\x99s unusual strategy seemed unusual but not entirely irrational. He would win over Florida by proving that he loved it more than any other state, the way John McCain loved New Hampshire and Mitt Romney loved Michigan. But many commentators have pointed out \xe2\x80\x94 really very unkindly \xe2\x80\x94 that the longer Giuliani stayed in Florida, the lower his standing in the state polls. Perhaps it would have been wiser for him to make his stand in a place where people had barely heard of him.'b'They say Guam is quite lovely this time of year.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe reality is we are getting support,\xe2\x80\x9d said the candidate in answer to the inevitable question. He says \xe2\x80\x9cthe reality is ...\xe2\x80\x9d very, very often. Almost as often as he says \xe2\x80\x9cvery, very.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Those of us who live in New York found it rather peculiar that Giuliani was a front-runner at all, given his deeply mixed record running the city. Now, the idea that Florida might take him out of the race is somewhat disappointing. There\xe2\x80\x99s still so much about him we haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet had a chance to share with the national electorate. Did we ever mention the time he tried to stop the city elections because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think that New York could get along without him?'b'Rudy was thrown off his game by the public\xe2\x80\x99s shift from worrying about terrorism to worrying about the economy, and a dwindling interest in hearing him talk about where he was when the terrorists attacked New York. He\xe2\x80\x99s tried to rebound by vigorously promoting a national catastrophe fund to reduce the cost of home insurance in hurricane-prone Florida. This is not, in general, an idea that fiscal conservatives cotton to. It\xe2\x80\x99s so dicey, in fact, that even Mitt Romney has been hesitant about adopting it as a pander-point.'b'Giuliani has turned hurricanes into nature\xe2\x80\x99s way of saying Al Qaeda. (\xe2\x80\x9cAll of us are subject to the impact of natural disasters ... and of course acts of terrorism, which I remember living through.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'Perhaps he can pull it off. Florida is one of those places that makes participating in elections as easy as ordering a drive-thru hamburger. People have been casting their votes for almost two weeks now. Maybe a lot of them voted for Rudy and then were embarrassed to admit it to the pollsters, once they discovered he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really very popular after all.'b'Still, his campaign has a definite pall over it, and his many hangers-on have to be wondering whether another pathetic showing here would damage the Rudy brand. Are corporations still going to pay him $100,000 for lecturing about leadership and 9/11 now that they know he\xe2\x80\x99s done it for free on the pool deck at the Rosen Centre Hotel in Orlando and Paisano\xe2\x80\x99s Gourmet Pizza in Port St. Lucie? (More critically from the minions\xe2\x80\x99 perspective, are they still going to provide, as the speaking contract requires, \xe2\x80\x9cfirst-class travel expenses for up to five people?\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'Are they still going to hire his firm, Giuliani Partners, to do whatever it is Giuliani Partners is supposed to do, now that the glow of hanging out with America\xe2\x80\x99s Mayor has faded? Before the terrorist attack, after all, Rudy Giuliani was just a lame-duck mayor with abysmal approval ratings, a tabloidy personal life and uncertain job prospects. What 9/11 has given, 1/29 could taketh away.'b'Perhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s refrained from saying anything unpleasant about any of his competitors in Florida. Mitt Romney and John McCain are torn between trying to go in for the kill and their desire to avoid looking like Barack and Hillary.

But what struck me during an interview in his quiet office in an exquisitely restored City Hall was not the fact of the endorsement, but the manner in which the mayor expressed it.'b'He went out of his way to praise the Democratic field, including some of the candidates who have dropped out, like Senators Joseph Biden and Chris Dodd. He talked about his fondness for Bill and Hillary Clinton and said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s tough when you have to choose between friends.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The mayor\xe2\x80\x99s thoughtful, respectful, generous assessment of the field echoed the tone that had prevailed until recently in the Democratic primary campaign. That welcome tone has been lost, undermined by a deliberate injection of ugliness, and it would be very difficult to make the case that the Clintons have not been primarily to blame.'b'Bill Clinton, in his over-the-top advocacy of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy, has at times sounded like a man who\xe2\x80\x99s gone off his medication. And some of the Clinton surrogates have been flat-out reprehensible.'b'Andrew Young, for instance.'b'This week, while making the remarkable accusation that the Obama camp was responsible for raising the race issue, Mr. Clinton mentioned Andrew Young as someone who would bear that out. It was an extremely unfortunate reference.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s what Mr. Young, who is black and a former ambassador to the United Nations, had to say last month in an interview posted online: \xe2\x80\x9cBill is every bit as black as Barack. He\xe2\x80\x99s probably gone with more black women than Barack.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He then went on to make disgusting comments about the way that Bill and Hillary Clinton defended themselves years ago against the fallout from the former president\xe2\x80\x99s womanizing. That\xe2\x80\x99s coming from the Clinton camp!'b'And then there was Bob Kerrey, the former senator and another Clinton supporter, who slimed up the campaign with the following comments:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s probably not something that appeals to him, but I like the fact that his name is Barack Hussein Obama, and that his father was a Muslim and that his paternal grandmother is a Muslim. There\xe2\x80\x99s a billion people on the planet that are Muslims, and I think that experience is a big deal.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Pressing the point, Mr. Kerrey told CNN\xe2\x80\x99s John King: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve watched the blogs try to say that you can\xe2\x80\x99t trust him because he spent a little bit of time in a secular madrassa. I feel quite the opposite.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Get it?'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with the fact that Mr. Obama never attended a madrassa, and that there is no such thing as a secular madrassa. A madrassa is a religious school. Beyond that, the idea is to not-so-slyly feed the current frenzy, on the Internet and elsewhere, that Senator Obama is a Muslim, and thus potentially (in the eyes of many voters) an enemy of the United States.'b'Mr. Obama is not a Muslim. He\xe2\x80\x99s a Christian. And if he were a Muslim, it would not be a legitimate reason for attacking his candidacy.'b'The Clinton camp knows what it\xe2\x80\x99s doing, and its slimy maneuvers have been working. Bob Kerrey apologized and Andrew Young said at the time of his comment that he was just fooling around. But the damage to Senator Obama has been real, and so have the benefits to Senator Clinton of these and other lowlife tactics.'b'Consider, for example, the following Web posting (misspellings and all) from a mainstream news blog on  Jan. 13:'b'\xe2\x80\x9comg people get a grip. Can you imagine calling our president barak hussien obama ... I cant, I pray no one would be disrespectful enough to put this man in our whitehouse.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s campaign was always going to be difficult, and the climb is even steeper now. There is no reason to feel sorry for him. He\xe2\x80\x99s a politician out of Chicago who must have known that campaigns often degenerate into demolition derbies.'b'Still, it\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate to ask, given the destructive developments of the last few weeks, whether the Clintons are capable of being anything but divisive. The electorate seems more polarized now than it was just a few weeks ago, and the Clintons have seemed positively gleeful in that atmosphere.'b'It makes one wonder whether they have any understanding or regard for the corrosive long-term effects  \xe2\x80\x94  on their party and the nation  \xe2\x80\x94  of pitting people bitterly and unnecessarily against one another.'b'What kind of people are the Clintons? What role will Bill Clinton play in a new Clinton White House? Can they look beyond winning to a wounded nation\xe2\x80\x99s need for healing and unifying?'b'These are questions that need to be answered.

The former mayor goes for New Yorkers\xe2\x80\x99 souls. He tells them that they must never, ever forget to worry.'b'Terrorism is right outside the door. The mayor is the man to fight it. Osama bin Laden is at large. The guy who tamed New York will find him. Hurricanes? Hizzoner can get the insurance man to pay up.

Also, his parents are former New Yorkers.'b'The refugees from the city who refuse to wear Rudy stickers are a little harder to find. Some, of course, are Democrats, the Bickersons, as one elderly Republican labeled them. The Democratic Party has punished Florida for moving its primary up to Tuesday, and even if a million Democrats vote, they will just be taking part in a humongous straw poll. At this point, none of their delegates will count at the summer convention.'b'The Democratic Party feud is one (of several) that should have been settled long ago, but Mr. Giuliani and the other Republicans are savoring their Florida stage cleared of rivals from the other party. The G.O.P. debate on Thursday night, a sleepy love fest, still enjoyed the full media spotlight.'b'Mr. Giuliani, however, was not the centerpiece of that debate. The polls have been wrong a few times this year, but they still matter. According to them, he is jockeying for a dismal third place in field of five.'b'As a result, the mayor who once planned to surf the Florida vote straight into the Oval Office seems uncharacteristically unsteady. In a state full of Republican retirees, his 9/11 pitch has been losing ground to Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s 401(k) pitch. At a Romney rally on Thursday in Boca Raton, Debra Targett, a financial planner from Boynton Beach, explained that she likes her candidate\xe2\x80\x99s business sense. \xe2\x80\x9cI researched him like a stock,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a four or five star.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If Mayor Giuliani somehow wins in Florida, he can bounce home for the New York primary a week later. If he loses, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to feel too sorry for anybody who spent his January in Florida.'b'Contract scandals, F.B.I. investigations and flooded highways don\xe2\x80\x99t generally have a brighter side, but in Connecticut, they just may.'b'With the state\xe2\x80\x99s highways inching ever closer to gridlock in recent years, a major project was undertaken to install a new drainage system and widen Interstate 84, which enters Connecticut from upstate New York and winds through Danbury, Waterbury and Hartford. It made traffic a nightmare, but commuters looked forward to clear roadways when it was done.'b'Well, not quite. It turns out that the state Department of Transportation, a notoriously hidebound agency, had arranged for contractors to both build and inspect the system. Surprise! When everything was finished, virtually every detail was constructed wrong, rendering the highway prone to washouts and sinkholes, and leaving taxpayers on the hook for tens of millions of dollars, not to mention mired in more slowdowns as the work is redone. The state is suing, the F.B.I. is   investigating, and Gov. M. Jodi Rell called for a top-to-bottom study last year of how the D.O.T. conducts business.'b'Preliminary results of the study are in, and they are not pretty. The department, decimated by early retirements several years ago, has a management model based on the Soviet Union\xe2\x80\x99s. It takes as long as seven months to hire a low-level clerk. Any attempt to innovate, or even attend a meeting on innovation, requires the permission of so many higher-ups that few employees bother. Information on the agency Web page is years out of date. The department lets itself be pushed around by little towns that fight change and dole out commuter parking permits like country club memberships.'b'The good news? Ms. Rell is searching for someone to head the agency, and we encourage her to be bold so the transportation apparatchiks learn revolutionary thinking. Maybe Mikhail Gorbachev is available.'b'IN the wake of George W. Bush, even a miracle might not be enough for the Republicans to hold on to the White House in 2008. But what about two miracles? The new year\xe2\x80\x99s twin resurrections of Bill Clinton and John McCain, should they not evaporate, at last give the G.O.P. a highly plausible route to victory.'b'Amazingly, neither party seems to fully recognize the contours of the road map. In the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 case, the full-throttle emergence of Billary, the joint Clinton candidacy, is measured mainly within the narrow confines of the short-term horse race: Do Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s red-faced eruptions and fact-challenged rants enhance or diminish his wife as a woman and a candidate?'b'Absent from this debate is any sober recognition that a Hillary Clinton nomination, if it happens, will send the Democrats into the general election with a new and huge peril that may well dwarf the current wars over race, gender and who said what about Ronald Reagan.'b'What has gone unspoken is this: Up until this moment, Hillary has successfully deflected rough questions about Bill by 'b'saying'b', \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m running on my own\xe2\x80\x9d or, as she 'b'snapped'b' at Barack Obama in the last debate, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m here; he\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xe2\x80\x9d This sleight of hand became officially inoperative once her husband became a co-candidate, even to the point of 'b'taking over entirely'b' when she vacated South Carolina last week. With \xe2\x80\x9ctwo for the price of one\xe2\x80\x9d back as the 'b'unabashed modus operandi'b', both Clintons are in play.'b'For the Republicans, that means not just a double dose of the one steroid, Clinton hatred, that might yet restore their party\xe2\x80\x99s unity but also two fat targets. Mrs. Clinton 'b'repeatedly talks'b' of how she\xe2\x80\x99s been \xe2\x80\x9cvetted\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cthere are no surprises\xe2\x80\x9d left to be mined by her opponents. On the \xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x9d show Friday, she 'b'joked'b' that the Republican attacks \xe2\x80\x9care just so old.\xe2\x80\x9d So far. Now that Mr. Clinton is ubiquitous, not only is his past back on the table but his post-presidency must be vetted as well. To get a taste of what surprises may be in store, you need merely revisit the Bill Clinton questions that Hillary Clinton has avoided to date.'b'Asked by Tim Russert at a 'b'September debate'b' whether the Clinton presidential library and foundation would disclose the identities of its donors during the campaign, Mrs. Clinton said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t up to her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your recommendation?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Russert countered. Mrs. Clinton replied: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about my private conversations with my husband, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to consider that.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Not so happy, as it turns out. The names  still have not been made public.'b'Just before the holidays, investigative reporters at both 'b'The Washington Post'b' and 'b'The New York Times'b' tried to find out why, with no help from the Clintons. The Post uncovered a plethora of foreign contributors, led by Saudi Arabia. The Times found an overlap between library benefactors and Hillary Clinton campaign donors, some of whom might have an agenda with a new Clinton administration. (Much as one early library supporter, Marc Rich\xe2\x80\x99s ex-wife, Denise, had an agenda with the last one.) \xe2\x80\x9cThe vast scale of these secret fund-raising operations presents enormous opportunities for abuse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Representative Henry Waxman, the California Democrat whose legislation to force disclosure 'b'passed overwhelmingly'b' in the House but remains stalled in the Senate.'b'The Post and Times reporters couldn\xe2\x80\x99t unlock all the secrets. The unanswered questions could keep them and their competitors busy until Nov. 4. Mr. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s increased centrality to the campaign will also give The Wall Street Journal a greater news peg to 'b'continue'b' its reportorial 'b'forays'b' into the unraveling financial partnership between Mr. Clinton and the swashbuckling billionaire Ron Burkle.'b'At \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Rock\xe2\x80\x99s Fort Knox,\xe2\x80\x9d as the Clinton library has been 'b'nicknamed'b' by frustrated researchers, it\xe2\x80\x99s not merely the heavy-hitting contributors who are under wraps. Even by the glacial processing standards of the National Archives, the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 White House papers have emerged slowly, in part because Bill Clinton 'b'exercised his right'b' to insist that all communications between him and his wife be \xe2\x80\x9cconsidered for withholding\xe2\x80\x9d until 2012.'b'When Mrs. Clinton was asked by Mr. Russert at an 'b'October debate'b' if she would lift that restriction, she again escaped by passing the buck to her husband: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s not my decision to make.\xe2\x80\x9d Well, if her candidacy is to be as completely vetted as she guarantees, the time for the other half of Billary to make that decision is here.'b'The credibility of a major Clinton campaign plank, health care, depends on it. In that same debate, Mrs. Clinton told Mr. Russert that \xe2\x80\x9call of the records, as far as I know, about what we did with health care\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9calready available.\xe2\x80\x9d As Michael Isikoff of Newsweek 'b'reported weeks later'b', this is a bit off; he found that 3,022,030 health care documents were still held hostage. Whatever the pace of the processing, the gatekeeper charged with approving each document\xe2\x80\x99s release is the longtime Clinton loyalist Bruce Lindsey.'b'People don\xe2\x80\x99t change. Bill Clinton, having always lived on the edge, is back on the precipice. When he repeatedly complains that the press has given Mr. Obama a free ride and over-investigated the Clintons, he seems to be tempting the fates, given all the reporting still to be done on his post-presidential business. When he says, 'b'as he did on Monday'b', that \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever I do should be totally transparent,\xe2\x80\x9d it\xe2\x80\x99s almost as if he\xe2\x80\x99s setting himself up for a fall. There\xe2\x80\x99s little more transparency at \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Rock\xe2\x80\x99s Fort Knox\xe2\x80\x9d than there is at Giuliani Partners.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Republicans are not going to have any compunctions about asking anybody anything,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Clinton lectured Mr. Obama. Maybe so, but Republicans are smart enough not to start asking until after she has secured the nomination.'b'Not all Republicans are smart enough, however, to recognize the value of John McCain should Mrs. Clinton emerge as the nominee. He\xe2\x80\x99s a bazooka aimed at most every rationale she\xe2\x80\x99s offered for her candidacy.'b'In a McCain vs. Billary race, the Democrats will sacrifice the most highly desired commodity by the entire electorate, change; the party will be mired in d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 1990s all over again. Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s spiel about being \xe2\x80\x9ctested\xe2\x80\x9d by her \xe2\x80\x9c35 years of experience\xe2\x80\x9d won\xe2\x80\x99t fly either. The moment she attempts it, Mr. McCain will run an ad about how he was being tested when those 35 years began, in 1973. It was 'b'that spring'b' when he emerged from five-plus years of incarceration at the Hanoi Hilton while Billary was still bivouacked at Yale Law School. And can Mrs. Clinton presume to sell herself as best equipped to be commander in chief \xe2\x80\x9con Day One\xe2\x80\x9d when opposing an actual commander and war hero? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.'b'Foreign policy issue No. 1, withdrawal from Iraq, should be a slam-dunk for any Democrat. Even the audience at Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s G.O.P. 'b'debate in Boca Raton'b' cheered Ron Paul\xe2\x80\x99s antiwar sentiments. But Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s case is undermined by her record. She voted for the war, just as Mr. McCain did, in 2002 and was still defending it in February 2005, when she 'b'announced'b' from the Green Zone that much of Iraq was \xe2\x80\x9cfunctioning quite well. \xe2\x80\x9d Only in November 2005 did she 'b'express'b' the serious misgivings 'b'long pervasive'b' in her own party. When Mr. McCain 'b'accuses her'b' of now advocating \xe2\x80\x9csurrender\xe2\x80\x9d out of political expediency, her flip-flopping will back him up.'b'Billary can\xe2\x80\x99t even run against the vast right-wing conspiracy if Mr. McCain is the opponent. 'b'Rush Limbaugh'b' and 'b'Tom DeLay'b' hate Mr. McCain as much as they hate the Clintons. And they hate him for the same reasons Mr. McCain wins over independents and occasional Democrats: his sporadic (and often mild) departures from conservative orthodoxy on immigration and campaign finance reform, torture, tax cuts, climate change and the godliness of Pat Robertson. Since Mr. McCain doesn\xe2\x80\x99t kick reporters like dogs, as the Clintons do, he will no doubt continue to enjoy an advantage, however unfair, with the press pack on the Straight Talk Express.'b'Even so, Mr. McCain hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet won 'b'a clear majority'b' of Republican voters in any G.O.P. contest. He\xe2\x80\x99s depended on the kindness of independent voters. Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s Florida primary, which is open exclusively to Republicans, is his crucial test. If he fails, his party remains in chaos and Mitt Romney could still inherit the earth.'b'That would be a miracle for the Democrats, but they can hardly count on it. If Mr. Obama has not met an unexpected Waterloo in South Carolina  \xe2\x80\x94  this column went to press before Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s vote  \xe2\x80\x94  the party needs him to stop whining about the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 attacks, regain his wit and return to playing offense. Unlike Mrs. Clinton, he would unambiguously represent change in a race with any Republican. If he vanquishes Billary, he\xe2\x80\x99ll have an even stronger argument to take into battle against a warrior like Mr. McCain.'b'If Mr. Obama doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fight, no one else will. Few national Democratic leaders have the courage to stand up to the Clintons. Even in defeat, Mr. Obama may at least help wake up a party slipping into denial. Any Democrat who seriously thinks that Bill will fade away if Hillary wins the nomination  \xe2\x80\x94  let alone that the Clintons will escape being fully vetted  \xe2\x80\x94  is a Democrat who, as the man said, believes in fairy tales.'b'THE idea that 'b'cholesterol'b' plays a key role in heart disease is so tightly woven into modern medical thinking that it is no longer considered open to question. This is the message that emerged all too clearly from the recent news that the drug Vytorin had fared no better in clinical trials than the statin therapy it was meant to supplant.'b'Vytorin is a combination of cholesterol-lowering drugs, one called Zetia and the other a statin called 'b'Zocor'b'. Because the two drugs lower LDL cholesterol by different mechanisms, the makers of Vytorin (Merck and Schering-Plough) assumed that their double-barreled therapy would lower it more than either drug  alone, which it did, and so do a better job of slowing the accumulation of fatty plaques in the arteries \xe2\x80\x94 which it did not.'b''b'Heart disease'b' specialists who were asked to comment on this turn of events insisted that the result implied nothing about their assumption that LDL cholesterol is dangerous, only about whether it is always medically effective to lower it.'b'But this interpretation is based on a longstanding conceptual error embedded in the very language we use to discuss heart disease. It confuses the cholesterol carried in the bloodstream with the particles, known as lipoproteins, that shuttle that cholesterol around. There is little doubt that certain of these lipoproteins pose dangers, but whether cholesterol itself is a critical factor is a question that the Vytorin trial has most definitely raised. It\xe2\x80\x99s a question that needs to be acknowledged and addressed if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make any more headway in preventing heart disease.'b'To understand the distinction between cholesterol and lipoproteins it helps to know something of the history of cholesterol research.'b'In the 1950s, two hypotheses competed for attention among heart disease researchers. It had been known for decades that cholesterol was a component of atherosclerotic plaques, and people who have a genetic disorder that causes extremely high cholesterol levels typically have clogged arteries and heart attacks. As new technology enabled them to look more closely at lipoproteins, however, researchers began to suspect that these carrier molecules might play a greater role in cardiovascular disease than the cholesterol inside them. The cholesterol hypothesis dominated, however, because analyzing lipoproteins was still expensive and difficult, while cholesterol tests were easily ordered up by any doctor.'b'In the late 1960s, biochemists created a simple technique for measuring, more specifically, the cholesterol inside the different kinds of lipoproteins \xe2\x80\x94 high-density, low-density and very low-density. The 'b'National Institutes of Health'b' financed a handful of studies to determine whether these \xe2\x80\x9ccholesterol fractions\xe2\x80\x9d could predict the risk of cardiovascular disease. In 1977, the researchers reported their results: 'b'total cholesterol'b' turned out to be surprisingly useless as a predictor. Researchers involved with the Framingham Heart Study found that in men and women 50 and older, \xe2\x80\x9ctotal cholesterol per se is not a risk factor for 'b'coronary heart disease'b' at all.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The cholesterol in low-density lipoproteins was deemed a \xe2\x80\x9cmarginal risk factor\xe2\x80\x9d for heart disease. Cholesterol in high-density lipoproteins was easily the best determinant of risk, but with the correlation reversed: the higher the amount, the lower the risk of heart disease.'b'These findings led directly to the notion that low-density lipoproteins carry \xe2\x80\x9cbad\xe2\x80\x9d cholesterol and high-density lipoproteins carry \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d cholesterol. And then the precise terminology was jettisoned in favor of the common shorthand. The lipoproteins LDL and 'b'HDL'b' became \xe2\x80\x9cgood cholesterol\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbad cholesterol,\xe2\x80\x9d and the lipoprotein transport vehicle was now conflated with its cholesterol cargo. Lost in translation was the evidence that the causal agent in heart disease might be abnormalities in the lipoproteins themselves.'b'The truth is, we\xe2\x80\x99ve always had reason to question the idea that cholesterol is an agent of disease. Indeed, what the Framingham researchers meant in 1977 when they described LDL cholesterol as a \xe2\x80\x9cmarginal risk factor\xe2\x80\x9d is that a large proportion of people who suffer heart attacks have relatively low LDL cholesterol.'b'So how did we come to believe strongly that LDL cholesterol is so bad for us? It was partly due to the observation that eating 'b'saturated fat'b' raises LDL cholesterol, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve assumed that saturated fat is bad for us. This logic is circular, though: saturated fat is bad because it raises LDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol is bad because it is the thing that saturated fat raises. In clinical trials, researchers have been unable to generate compelling evidence that saturated fat in the 'b'diet'b' causes heart disease.'b'The other important piece of evidence for the cholesterol hypothesis is that statin drugs like Zocor and 'b'Lipitor'b' lower LDL cholesterol and also prevent heart attacks. The higher the potency of statins, the greater the cholesterol lowering and the fewer the heart attacks. This is perceived as implying cause and effect: statins reduce LDL cholesterol and prevent heart disease, so reducing LDL cholesterol prevents heart disease. This belief is held with such conviction that the 'b'Food and Drug Administration'b'  now approves  drugs to prevent heart disease, as it did with Zetia, solely on the evidence that they  lower LDL cholesterol.'b'But the logic is specious because most drugs have multiple actions. It\xe2\x80\x99s like insisting that aspirin prevents heart disease by getting rid of headaches.'b'One obvious way to test the LDL cholesterol hypothesis is to find therapies that lower it by different means and see if they, too, prevent heart attacks. This is essentially what the Vytorin trial did and why its results argue against the hypothesis.'b'Other such tests have likewise failed to confirm it. A recent trial of torcetrapib, a drug that both raises HDL and lowers LDL cholesterol, was halted midstream because the drug seemed to cause heart attacks and strokes rather than prevent them. 'b'Estrogen'b' replacement therapy also lowers LDL cholesterol, but it too has failed to prevent heart disease in clinical trials. The same goes for eating less saturated fat.'b'So it is reasonable, after the Vytorin trial, to question the role of LDL cholesterol in heart disease. Not whether statins help prevent heart disease, but whether they work exclusively, or at all, by this mechanism.'b'There are numerous other ways in which statins might be effective. They reduce inflammation, which is now considered a risk factor for heart disease. They act to keep artery walls healthy. And statins act on lipoproteins as much as on the cholesterol inside them. They decrease the total number of low-density and very low-density lipoproteins in the blood, including the smallest and densest form of LDL, which is now widely believed to be particularly noxious.'b'Because medical authorities have always approached the cholesterol hypothesis as a public health issue, rather than as a scientific one, we\xe2\x80\x99re repeatedly reminded that it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be questioned. Heart attacks kill hundreds of thousands of Americans every year, statin therapy can save lives, and skepticism might be perceived as a reason to delay action. So let\xe2\x80\x99s just trust our assumptions, get people to change their diets and put high-risk people on statins and other cholesterol-lowering drugs.'b'Science, however, suggests a different approach: test the hypothesis rigorously and see if it survives. If the evidence continues to challenge the role of cholesterol, then rethink it, without preconceptions, and consider what these other pathways in cardiovascular disease are implying about cause and prevention. A different hypothesis may turn out to fit the facts better, and one day help prevent considerably more deaths.'b'All the talk in Washington in the last few days about the $150 billion economic stimulus plan agreed to by the White House and the House obscures a vitally important and very worrisome fact.'b'The current slowdown is layered on top of deep-rooted economic problems that are not addressed by a stimulus package. If the nation\xe2\x80\x99s leaders do not start showing the political will to do more than dole out popular tax breaks during an election year, short-term fixes could actually make the long-term problems worse.'b'In the plan agreed to  Thursday, the administration\xe2\x80\x99s worst ideas, including a push to deny tax rebates to lower-income Americans, were ditched. Money will reach many of the cash-strapped people most likely to spend it.'b'Unfortunately, bolstered spending for unemployment benefits and food stamps was also omitted from the plan, in favor of granting businesses outsized tax writeoffs for new investments. That is a blunder because direct relief spending is a more powerful stimulus than business tax breaks, and is better aimed at the neediest. Worse, short-shrifting the jobless and the poor now virtually guarantees that if the economy continues to deteriorate, policy makers will be forced to provide more relief later, driving up the total cost of the stimulus.'b'Therein lies the bigger problem. Coming to the rescue \xe2\x80\x94 whether handing out money or extending jobless benefits \xe2\x80\x94 is the easiest thing for any politician to do. The real art and skill of fiscal stimulus is to boost the economy as much as possible in the near term without weakening its long-term prospects.'b'A package that creates the potential need for continued relief down the line sets the stage for long-term budget problems, not for a healthy recovery.'b'Stimulus is necessary. But the flip side of fiscal stimulus is fiscal tightening. The economic crises of the moment are built on seven years of Bush-era tax-cut-and-spend policies, which made for worsening budget prospects even before the current slowdown.'b'According to the Congressional Budget Office, if the nation keeps on the path it is on, federal debt will exceed the size of the economy in the lifetimes of many people reading this editorial, and certainly within their children\xe2\x80\x99s lifetimes. Approaching a debt load that large would slam the brakes on economic activity, making today\xe2\x80\x99s slowdown look benign. How lawmakers \xe2\x80\x94 and candidates \xe2\x80\x94 act and communicate now will send a signal of their ability to see us not only through the current turmoil but to a more stable future. So far, the signals are about how much they  want to dole out.'b'To be effective leaders, politicians also need to explain that stimulus \xe2\x80\x94 which promotes spending \xe2\x80\x94 is the opposite of what is needed long term. Going forward, the nation must increase savings, not consumption. That will be painful.'b'Higher private savings requires delayed gratification by individuals. Higher government savings requires higher taxes or reduced government benefits, or a combination of both. Yet, savings, which have been neglected as a policy imperative throughout the Bush years, are the only means of ultimately digging out of the hole the nation is in already, even before the extent of the slowdown is known.'b'Our immediate problem \xe2\x80\x94 how to best use stimulus to buoy spending \xe2\x80\x94 is the easy part.'b'The new United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur is not off to an encouraging start. The five-year-long genocide has already killed some 200,000 people and driven two and a half million more from their homes. What is urgently needed to save those who remain are more peacekeepers, better equipment and a lot less obstruction from Sudan.'b'The joint force took over this month from an earlier African Union force of 7,000 that was  too small and too poorly equipped. The new one was supposed to be the largest international peacekeeping force ever authorized, with nearly 20,000 more soldiers and police officers, modern helicopters and other advanced equipment.'b'By the start of this year, barely a tenth of those additional forces were in place, and much of the needed new equipment had not arrived. When the peacekeepers were quickly attacked by Sudanese forces, they had to withdraw without returning fire.'b'While claiming that it will cooperate, Khartoum has repeatedly tried to hobble the force: refusing to accept some non-African peacekeepers, trying to limit the peacekeepers\xe2\x80\x99 use of helicopters and demanding other untenable restrictions. Last week, Sudan\xe2\x80\x99s president,  Omar Hassan al-Bashir, chose a notorious leader of the janjaweed, the militias that have carried out most of the killing, to be a senior government adviser.'b'Nobody pretends that bringing a stable peace to Darfur will be easy. The conflict involves not just the janjaweed and the Sudanese Army but also rival Darfur rebels and militias. Underlying it all is a desperate competition between nomads and farmers for land and water in a parched region. There is no hope at all until a credible and credibly armed peacekeeping force is deployed.'b'The world\xe2\x80\x99s leaders say they care desperately about Darfur\xe2\x80\x99s suffering. But caring is not enough. What is needed is troops, equipment and a lot more diplomatic pressure on Sudan. The word of the United Nations is on the line, and so are the lives of Darfur\xe2\x80\x99s people.'b'MIAMI'b'I expected more of Rudy.'b'Not a better message. It figured that he would snowbird his strategy, taking his New York subtext of blacks-want-to-mug-you-and-I-can-protect-you down to Florida and switching it to Arabs-want-to-kill-you-and-I-can-save-you.'b'And I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t surprised that he continued to run on fear and divisiveness, zeroing in on Florida the way he used to target Staten Island, Bay Ridge, Queens and parts of Manhattan where the elderly lived. Hizzoner always focused on those who supported him and ignored those who didn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'I simply expected that Rudy would rise to greater heights as he fell behind, that he would self-immolate in a dramatic way befitting a man who loves opera and the \xe2\x80\x9cGodfather\xe2\x80\x9d movies. I longed for the Manhattan diva to reprise Maria Callas doing one of her famous Donizetti mad scenes that he loved so much.'b'Watching him in colorful Miami in his funereal dark suit, I wondered, where\xe2\x80\x99s the red meat? I missed his showman\xe2\x80\x99s appreciation for pouncing on the news of the day and grabbing headlines with some outrageous, provocative aria. Surely, The New York Times\xe2\x80\x99s McCain endorsement  \xe2\x80\x94 harshly branding America\xe2\x80\x99s Mayor \xe2\x80\x9ca narrow, obsessively secretive, vindictive man\xe2\x80\x9d who spurred racial polarization and exploited 9/11 for his business and political purposes \xe2\x80\x94 gave Rudy the lyrics for an operatic rant against The Times that could have replaced his milquetoast stump speech and delighted conservative audiences.'b'And how could he pass up the chance to mock his old nemesis Hillary, the feminist icon who is totally dependent on her husband to do the heavy lifting?'b'It was Mitt Romney who scored the best Hillary line at the Boca debate. When Tim Russert asked him, \xe2\x80\x9cHow would you run against Hillary and Bill Clinton in November,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitt replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI frankly can\xe2\x80\x99t wait, because the idea of Bill Clinton back in the White House with nothing to do is something I just can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine. I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine the American people can imagine.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The audience laughed and Russert tried to pin down Mitt to see if he was implying any East Wing shenanigans. It does conjure up a disquieting image of Hillary in the Oval and Bill rambling around next door in the study right near 'b'that 'b'pantry. Romney has slyly used the word \xe2\x80\x9cintern\xe2\x80\x9d at least twice talking about Hillary, saying he had more business experience than she did  and the White House was \xe2\x80\x9cnot a place for a president to be an intern.\xe2\x80\x9d But slick Mitt slid away from Russert, replying, \xe2\x80\x9cI just think that we want to have a president, not a whole \xe2\x80\x94 a team of husband and wife thinking that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to run the country.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Previewing a Republican race in the fall, he went on: \xe2\x80\x9cShe is Washington to the core. She\xe2\x80\x99s been there too long. Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s been there too long. The last thing America needs is sending the Clintons back to Washington.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he stole an Obama line, to go along with the Obama change mantra he snitched and put on posters, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cLook, sending the same people back to Washington expecting a different result is not going to get America on track.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Facing possible catastrophe  last week, Rudy stolidly stuck with peddling a plan for a national catastrophe  fund that would make property owners\xe2\x80\x99 insurance more affordable to Floridians whose rates have been driven up by hurricanes. (Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the man who attacks Hillary for socialized medicine worry that this is socialized homeowners\xe2\x80\x99 insurance?)'b'His deep investment in one state and a one-dimensional message do not seem to have paid dividends. He needs to quit talking about 9/11 and dial 911. His numbers have dropped by half in the year he has campaigned  here. The more he has wooed, the less he has won. His campaign may have always been doomed, given that he was  unacceptable to so many other Republicans. But the final act seems sad \xe2\x80\x94 sputtering, stalling and dying like a bad engine on an old car.'b'Could it be over before the fat lady sings? If early-bird voters don\xe2\x80\x99t save him and he comes in third here, will he get out of the race so he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t suffer the indignity of losing New York, a scene so melodramatically implausible that even Verdi wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t try to pull it off?'b'One top Democrat, shocked that Rudy had run a race so minimalist that it would make a front-porch campaign look expansive, wondered if it was really some ploy to pump up his business. And perhaps his low-energy windup was meant to maintain dignity for Giuliani Partners.'b'At a Rudy rally in Boca on Thursday, there were snowbirds and transplanted New Yorkers. Some, naturally, loved Rudy and some, naturally, loathed him.'b'Ed Wenger, 65, a retired aerospace executive who used to live in Long Island, hailed the former mayor as \xe2\x80\x9cfantastic.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHe turned Times Square from a hooker\xe2\x80\x99s paradise to Disneyland,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Nearby, Norman Korowitz, 66, a snowbird, retired guidance counselor and Billary fan from Suffolk County, called Rudy \xe2\x80\x9can optical illusion.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s Bernie Kerik\xe2\x80\x99s partner,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd family values? He makes Bill Clinton look like a young upstart.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'TODAY and for the past two Sundays, The Times has devoted front-page play and  pages of inside space to a continuing  investigative series called \xe2\x80\x9cWar Torn,\xe2\x80\x9d about veterans of Iraq or Afghanistan who have killed or been charged with killings after returning home.'b'It is an important and tragic subject to which an investigative team has devoted more than eight months of reporting, including research into local news reports and court records, and extensive interviews with some of the veterans, their families, victims\xe2\x80\x99 families and law enforcement officials often sympathetic toward both the victims and their killers.'b'But The Times made some missteps at the beginning of the series, and critics have pounced, accusing it of demonizing veterans and exaggerating the problem even as some mental health professionals have thanked the newspaper.'b'The first part, which dominated the top of Page One on Jan. 13, featured a photo montage of 24 young men, some in military uniform, some in prison garb. The article began with the story of Matthew Sepi, a 20-year-old plagued by nightmares from Iraq, who went looking for beer to help him sleep and wound up killing a gang member and wounding another with an AK-47 in a dangerous neighborhood.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTown by town across the country, headlines have been telling similar stories,\xe2\x80\x9d the article said. \xe2\x80\x9cTaken together they paint the patchwork picture of a quiet phenomenon, tracing a cross-country trail of death and heartbreak.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The article said the newspaper had found 121 such cases, many of which appeared to involve \xe2\x80\x9ccombat trauma and the stress of deployment \xe2\x80\x94 along with alcohol abuse, family discord and other attendant problems.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Times was pointing out terrible examples of something the military itself acknowledges: large numbers of veterans are returning from Afghanistan and Iraq with psychological problems. And, as the initial article said, a Pentagon task force found last year that the military mental health system was poorly prepared to deal with this wave of distress.'b'The Times was immediately accused \xe2\x80\x94 in The New York Post and the conservative blogosphere, and by hundreds of messages to the public editor \xe2\x80\x94 of portraying all veterans as unstable killers. It did not.'b'But, the first article used colorfully inflated language \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9ctrail of death\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 for a trend it could not reliably quantify, despite an attempt at statistical analysis using squishy numbers. The article did not make clear what its focus was. Was it about killer vets, or about human tragedies involving a system that sometimes fails to spot and treat troubled souls returning from combat?'b'Finally, while many of the 121 cases found by The Times appeared clearly linked to wartime stresses, others seemed questionable. One involved a Navy Seabee accused of arranging her ex-husband\xe2\x80\x99s murder during a bitter child custody battle, and another involved a soldier who was acquitted of reckless homicide in a car crash after a jury concluded that his blood alcohol level was below the legal limit and that many other accidents had happened on the same stretch of road.'b'Some readers wanted to know how the rate of homicides by veterans compared with the civilian rate. Several bloggers did back-of-the-envelope calculations and said the homicide rate for returning veterans was lower than the rate for the general population. So, what\xe2\x80\x99s the problem, they wondered. I asked Martin T. Wells, a professor of statistical sciences at Cornell University, to take a stab at a comparative calculation. The homicide rate for returning combat veterans could be better or worse than the civilian rate, he determined, depending entirely on how many of the 1.6 million military personnel who have been deployed in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars actually saw combat, a number the Pentagon does not have.'b'The journalists most responsible for the series \xe2\x80\x94 reporters Lizette Alvarez and Deborah Sontag and their editor, Matthew Purdy \xe2\x80\x94 argued against trying to make a comparison to civilian homicide rates. The military does not accept people with mental problems or records of serious crimes \xe2\x80\x94 the likeliest killers in the civilian population \xe2\x80\x94 so its rate is likely to be lower and the comparison irrelevant.'b'But they implicitly invited the comparison with a calculation of their own: Based primarily on news reports, their article said the number of homicides involving active-duty military personnel and new veterans was 89 percent higher in the six years since the wars began than in the six years before. And that increase came, the article said, even though \xe2\x80\x9cthe American homicide rate has been, on average, lower.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It seems analytically shaky to compare admittedly incomplete news reports from two periods and express the difference as a precise 89 percent \xe2\x80\x94 especially, as a Pentagon spokesman said in The Times, given that the news media may not have been as sensitive to the military status of accused killers in the period before the wars.'b'Purdy urged me not to get lost in the numbers as I looked at the first two articles.  I agree with that, but I believe The Times tangled itself in numbers right at the start. Bill Keller, the executive editor, said the newsroom\xe2\x80\x99s computer-assisted reporting unit normally screens articles with statistical analyses. Some of the problems might have been avoided if someone in the unit had read the first article before it was published. But Terry Schwadron, the editor who oversees the unit, which created a database for the 121 cases, said that did not happen.  \xe2\x80\x9cI read the story in the paper, and I shared some concerns\xe2\x80\x9d with Purdy, he said.'b'Purdy defended the series. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is an intimate exploration of a devastating cost of the war that merits national attention and focus but has not received it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, because \xe2\x80\x9cit is playing out in one community at a time ... with no comprehensive attention from the military.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Keller agreed.  \xe2\x80\x9cI believe this series is an important public service that explores in riveting detail the emotional stresses war places on this important community and the problems the military faces in coping with those stresses,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'The individual stories the series has told so far are indeed sad, powerful and important. One hopes they will goad the military to figure out what went wrong and what needs fixing.'b'But the questionable statistics muddy the message. A handful of killings caused by the stresses of war would be too many and cause for action. Sometimes, trying to turn such stories into data \xe2\x80\x94 with implications of statistical proof and that old journalistic convention, the trend \xe2\x80\x94 harms rather than helps.'b'HIGH finance, like some unreliable common stock, goes lower and lower. How did so many experts misjudge so badly? How could the supposedly \xe2\x80\x9ccontained\xe2\x80\x9d subprime mortgage problem metastasize into a global financial panic (some days to the down side, other days to the up side)? And after this drama, what?'b'Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, inadvertently warned of the coming troubles four years ago. Speaking to fellow economists in Washington, he described the peace and quiet that, for 20 years, had been gradually settling over the American economy. Compared to the 1970s, recessions were mild and scarce, he noted. Inflation, that bane of yesteryear, was dormant. Economic growth was no longer spasmodic but smooth and almost predictable. The name he gave to these manifold blessings was the Great Moderation,  and he thanked the Fed, in which he then served as a governor under Alan Greenspan, for helping to bring them about.'b'But it was actually the Great Complacency that Mr. Bernanke had put his finger on. In finance, to borrow from the economist Hyman Minsky, nothing is so destabilizing as stability. The paradox is easily explained. Profit-seeking people will take more financial risk when they believe the coast is clear. By taking bigger chances, however, they unwittingly make the world unsafe all over again.'b'Anxious people don\xe2\x80\x99t ordinarily get in over their heads; it\xe2\x80\x99s the confident ones who do. And nothing builds confidence like the belief that a greater power has conquered the business cycle and laid inflation low. In such happy circumstances, a calculating human will take out a bigger mortgage, build a bigger hedge fund or attempt a gaudier corporate buyout. That is, he or she will borrow more money, or, as they say on Wall Street, lay on more leverage.'b'So Americans proceeded to borrow. Over the past decade, household indebtedness, expressed as a percentage of the value of household assets, has shot up into record territory. Watching house prices levitate, people did what they could have been expected to do. They borrowed heavily against the accretion in value they had already seen as well as the gains they hopefully anticipated.'b'There was a rub, however, and this, too, our seers and experts failed to predict. The truth was that house prices were soaring beyond the reach of the average home buyer. Bridging this widening gap brought out the worst in just about everyone who had anything to do with money from 2003 to 2007.'b'Striving so mightily to make one and one add up to three or four or five, Wall Street, Main Street and Washington collectively brought us to the impasse of 2008, in which a debt crisis is superimposed on a downturn in the economy, which is overlaid on a bear market in real estate, which is conjoined with a persistent and worrying weakness in the overseas value of the dollar. As for the crackup in complex mortgage-backed securities, now at the center of the debt predicament, the global bank UBS has justly called it \xe2\x80\x9cthe biggest failure of ratings and risk management ever.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We should not forget Main Street in this 360-degree indictment of American financial practices. Fitch Ratings, shocked by the frequency of early defaults in supposedly safe mortgage structures, belatedly delved into the details of 45 individual loans it considered representative. \xe2\x80\x9cThe result of the analysis was disconcerting at best,\xe2\x80\x9d the ratings agency admitted in a study released at the end of November, \xe2\x80\x9cas there was the appearance of fraud or misrepresentation in almost every file.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It would be asking a lot of an ordinary mortal to hew to the literal truth in a mortgage application when, to the applicant, it seemed as if the money was being offered free. And for 12 full months, from mid-2003 to mid-2004, the Fed set its interest rate, the so-called overnight federal funds rate, at just 1 percent. It took this extraordinary step to ward off the risk of falling prices, or deflation, it said. It would not tolerate too little inflation, it explained, but wanted just enough. At the time, the cost of living was rising by 2 percent a year.'b'Last week, as the Fed delivered its emergency cut of three-quarters of 1 percent, dropping the funds rate to 3.5 percent, the cost of living was rising on the order of 4 percent a year. Yet inflation was almost an afterthought in the press release in which the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank\xe2\x80\x99s policy-making arm, explained its surprise intervention: \xe2\x80\x9cThe committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, but it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If stability leads to instability, it follows that instability will eventually restore tranquillity. But first must come the tallying up of the errors, misjudgments and outright criminality that blossomed during the Great Moderation. Mr. Bernanke, in an attempt to limit the damage and hasten the healing, is likely to keep the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s rate low \xe2\x80\x94 lower, even, than the measured inflation rate.'b'As for mortgages, the experts had agreed that house prices couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fall as stock prices sometimes do, and they structured their loans without a thought to any such coast-to-coast distress. If house prices do continue to fall, there will be many more defaults, and a correspondingly urgent cry for low and lower mortgage rates.'b'Nor will the credit crisis bypass corporate America. Complacent as the mortgage lenders, investment bankers designed balance sheets as if steep and prolonged recession was not just unlikely but impossible.'b'To lubricate the machinery of lending and borrowing, Mr. Bernanke is likely to make dollars increasingly plentiful. The trouble is that, while the Fed is America\xe2\x80\x99s central bank, the dollar is the world\xe2\x80\x99s currency. It lines the vaults of central banks of America\xe2\x80\x99s creditors, especially the up-and-coming states of Asia and the oil-soaked principalities of the Middle East.'b'Such institutions hold dollars by choice, and not a few of them chafe at the greenback\xe2\x80\x99s steady loss of purchasing power. For some, Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s hasty rate cut might be the last straw.'b'As just about nobody predicted the present troubles, humility is what becomes today\xe2\x80\x99s forecaster the most. So I will offer up a humble forecast. Inflation will, at length, make its way up from the bottom of the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s worry list to the very top. Not for years has it seemed to matter that the dollar is only a piece of paper. But, before very long, that homely fact will push itself back to the fore.'b'OVER the years, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been deeply moved by the people who\xe2\x80\x99ve told me they wished they could feel inspired and hopeful about America the way people did when my father was president. This sense is even more profound today. That is why I am supporting a presidential candidate in the Democratic primaries, Barack Obama.'b'My reasons are patriotic, political and personal, and the three are intertwined. All my life, people have told me that my father changed their lives, that they got involved in public service or politics because he asked them to. And the generation he inspired has passed that spirit on to its children. I meet young people who were born long after John F. Kennedy was president, yet who ask me how to live out his ideals.'b'Sometimes it takes a while to recognize that someone has a special ability to get us to believe in ourselves, to tie that belief to our highest ideals and imagine that together we can do great things. In those rare moments, when such a person comes along, we need to put aside our plans and reach for what we know is possible.'b'We have that kind of opportunity with Senator Obama. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t that the other candidates are not experienced or knowledgeable. But this year, that may not be enough. We need a change in the leadership of this country \xe2\x80\x94 just as we did in 1960.'b'Most of us would prefer to base our voting decision on policy differences. However, the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 goals are similar. They have all laid out detailed plans on everything from strengthening our middle class to investing in early childhood education. So qualities of leadership, character and judgment play a larger role than usual.'b'Senator Obama has demonstrated these qualities throughout his more than two decades of public service, not just in the United States Senate but in Illinois, where he helped turn around struggling communities, taught constitutional law and was an elected state official for eight years. And Senator Obama is showing the same qualities today. He has built a movement that is changing the face of politics in this country, and he has demonstrated a special gift for inspiring young people \xe2\x80\x94 known for a willingness to volunteer, but an aversion to politics \xe2\x80\x94 to become engaged in the political process.'b'I have spent the past five years working in the New York City public schools and have three teenage children of my own. There is a generation coming of age that is hopeful, hard-working, innovative and imaginative. But too many of them are also hopeless, defeated and disengaged. As parents, we have a responsibility to help our children to believe in themselves and in their power to shape their future. Senator Obama is inspiring my children, my parents\xe2\x80\x99 grandchildren, with that sense of possibility.'b'Senator Obama is running a dignified and honest campaign. He has spoken eloquently about the role of faith in his life, and opened a window into his character in two compelling books. And when it comes to judgment, Barack Obama made the right call on the most important issue of our time by opposing the war in Iraq from the beginning.'b'I want a president who understands that his responsibility is to articulate a vision and encourage others to achieve it; who holds himself, and those around him, to the highest ethical standards; who appeals to the hopes of those who still believe in the American Dream, and those around the world who still believe in the American ideal; and who can lift our spirits, and make us believe again that our country needs every one of us to get involved.'b'I have never had a president who inspired me the way people tell me that my father inspired them. But for the first time, I believe I have found the man who could be that president \xe2\x80\x94 not just for me, but for a new generation of Americans.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cAn Iraq Veteran\xe2\x80\x99s Descent; a Prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s Hard Choice\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cWar Torn\xe2\x80\x9d series, front page, Jan. 20), your incisive and sensitive article about Lance Cpl.

But if those hospitals want to analyze what impact the checklists might have in reducing infections, that counts as research and they must first seek approval from institutional review boards.'b'These review boards were set up to protect patients from being harmed \xe2\x80\x94 by risky drugs or treatments \xe2\x80\x94 in the course of medical research. Seeking approval is a cumbersome process that could delay studies for months. Surely, as the nation\xe2\x80\x99s health care system works to reform dysfunctional practices, this makes no sense. The rules intended to protect patients could instead slow organizational reforms that would benefit the patients.'b'This bizarre outcome came to light when Johns Hopkins researchers coordinated a study of whether bloodstream infections acquired in intensive care units could be reduced if doctors and nurses followed common-sense procedures to wash their hands, wear sterile garb and wash a patient\xe2\x80\x99s skin with antiseptic before inserting a catheter. The results in 67 cooperating hospitals in Michigan were astonishing. Infection rates dropped by two-thirds, and the procedures saved an estimated 1,500 lives and almost $200 million.'b'Then an anonymous critic complained to federal regulators that the study had not been approved by an institutional review board and had failed to obtain the informed consent of human subjects. The Office for Human Research Protections, a unit of the federal Department of Health and Human Services,  forced Johns Hopkins to suspend further research until review board approval was obtained. It stressed that hospitals were free to follow the procedures if the goal was to improve patient care, and they could even monitor their infection rates. But once a research component is added, federal laws and regulations require that human subjects be protected by review board oversight.'b'The regulators apparently reasoned that there was at least a small chance that the procedures under study could backfire and increase the rate of infections, and a possibility that doctors and nurses might suffer adverse consequences if their performance or comments angered colleagues or employers.'b'The Bush administration \xe2\x80\x94 which has eviscerated many regulations for no good reason \xe2\x80\x94 has ample justification this time to revise a regulation in the interests of health care reform. It needs to make evaluations of programs to improve the quality of health care easier, not harder. If it does not, Congress will need to step in with legislation to expedite such studies.'b'DAVOS, Switzerland'b'With the American presidential campaign in full swing, the obvious way to change the world might seem to be through politics.'b'But growing numbers of young people are leaping into the fray and doing the job themselves. These are the social entrepreneurs, the 21st-century answer to the student protesters of the 1960s, and they are some of the most interesting people here at the World Economic Forum (not only because they\xe2\x80\x99re half the age of everyone else).'b'Andrew Klaber, a 26-year-old playing hooky from Harvard Business School to come here (don\xe2\x80\x99t tell his professors!), is an example of the social entrepreneur. He spent the summer after his sophomore year in college in Thailand and was aghast to see teenage girls being forced into prostitution after their parents had died of AIDS.'b'So he started Orphans Against AIDS ('b'www.orphansagainstaids.org'b'), which pays school-related expenses for hundreds of children who have been orphaned or otherwise affected by AIDS in poor countries. He and his friends volunteer their time and pay administrative costs out of their own pockets so that every penny goes to the children.'b'Mr. Klaber was able to expand the nonprofit organization in Africa through introductions made by Jennifer Staple, who was a year ahead of him when they were in college. When she was a sophomore, Ms. Staple founded an organization in her dorm room to collect old reading glasses in the United States and ship them to poor countries. That group, Unite for Sight, has ballooned, and last year it provided eye care to 200,000 people ('b'www.uniteforsight.org'b').'b'In the \xe2\x80\x9960s, perhaps the most remarkable Americans were the civil rights workers and antiwar protesters who started movements that transformed the country. In the 1980s, the most fascinating people were entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, who started companies and ended up revolutionizing the way we use technology.'b'Today the most remarkable young people are the social entrepreneurs, those who see a problem in society and roll up their sleeves to address it in new ways. Bill Drayton, the chief executive of an organization called Ashoka that supports social entrepreneurs, likes to say that such people neither hand out fish nor teach people to fish; their aim is to revolutionize the fishing industry.

Ms. Salti argues that entrepreneurs can stimulate the economy, give young people a purpose and revitalize the Arab world. Girls in particular have flourished in the program, which has had excellent reviews and is getting support from the U.S. Agency for International Development. My hunch is that Ms. Salti will contribute more to stability and peace in the Middle East than any number of tanks in Iraq, U.N. resolutions or summit meetings.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you can capture the youth and change the way they think, then you can change the future,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'Another young person on a mission is Ariel Zylbersztejn, a 27-year-old Mexican who founded and runs a company called Cinepop, which projects movies onto inflatable screens and shows them free in public parks.

Five years ago, the United States Commission on Civil Rights examined the government\xe2\x80\x99s centuries-old treaty obligations for the welfare of Native Americans and found Washington spending 50 percent less per capita on their health care than is devoted to felons in prison and the poor on Medicaid.'b'A bipartisan bill to begin repairing this shameful situation is now on the Senate floor. It takes aim at such long neglected needs as the plight of urban Indians, who account for two-thirds of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s 4.1 million tribal population. Most of the American Indians and Alaska natives living in cities are either ineligible for, or unable to reach, the limited help of the Indian Health Service\xe2\x80\x99s reservation-based programs.

From a few dozen animals released in Yellowstone in 1995, the wolf population has grown to about 1,500 in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming. This remarkable comeback means that later this year the gray wolf will be removed from the list of endangered species, at which point its fate will be entrusted to federally approved state management plans that conservationists warn are unacceptably weak.'b'Yet the wolves could find themselves in trouble even before they are removed from the endangered list. At the same time it was negotiating the state management plans, the Bush administration was quietly revising an important rule in the Endangered Species Act. The purpose of the rule is to give states flexibility in managing reintroduced species. As revised by the administration, it would require only that each state protect 20 breeding pairs and 200 total wolves. That could allow as many as 900 recently protected wolves to be slaughtered.'b'The revised rule is aimed not at protecting cattle or sheep but at protecting elk and deer for hunters. In our view, hunters would be wise to oppose this. The question for them is whether they want to hunt in what passes for nature, complete with a predator like the wolf, or in what passes for a game farm.'b'Since the gray wolf was reintroduced, studies have shown its importance to the balance of nature. What matters isn\xe2\x80\x99t just the presence of wolves in the landscape, though that is profound in itself, as anyone who has seen a wolf pack crossing Yellowstone can attest. What matters is the effect they have on their ecosystem: suppressing coyotes, changing the behavior of elk and benefiting grizzly bears, which routinely take over the kills wolves make. The wolf has had to wait eons for humans to become wise enough to coexist with it. That can\xe2\x80\x99t happen until this cynical loophole in the Endangered Species Act is closed.'b'What is to be done with the bankers? From the savings and loan meltdown in the 1980s to the current housing-led seizure, financial institutions have proved unable to curb their appetite for risky assets \xe2\x80\x94 blowing up the bank and spreading economic mayhem.'b'After every crisis, regulators say they will cure the financial system of the recent folly, reassuring the public that the caustic asset du jour \xe2\x80\x94 Latin American debt, Internet stocks, mortgages in Florida \xe2\x80\x94 will never again be allowed to bring the banks down.'b'Yet the recurrence of disasters suggests that the risky cravings of the masters of the universe are uncurbed. All that happens is that the next crisis takes a somewhat different form from the last, using some newly noxious financial product that used to be considered safe as, um, houses.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not just that a rogue junior trader at a French bank can  chalk up losses of more than $7 billion without anybody noticing. The subprime strategies that last year wiped out about  $22 billion at Merrill Lynch, $20 billion at Citigroup and $9 billion at Morgan Stanley were devised and encouraged at the very top.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like a smart banker motivated by an otherworldly bonus to get around the most carefully written regulatory limits on his or her ability to make money. Say regulators demand that banks maintain a big cushion of capital as a share of their loans, as a form of insurance in case the bets go bad. All a wily banker has to do is move the risky investment to a \xe2\x80\x9cstructured investment vehicle\xe2\x80\x9d and claim it is not on the balance sheet. And there are other tricks.'b'Bankers\xe2\x80\x99 recklessness would merely be a problem for shareholders to solve if   banks lost only their shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 money. But banks, as we painfully relearn every few years, spread the damage widely. That\xe2\x80\x99s why the government not only explicitly guarantees bank deposits, but also offers implicit guarantees that banks will be bailed out in times of trouble.'b'Regulation certainly needs tightening to mitigate the worst kind of irresponsible, often predatory lending that led to our current mess. But there is a part of the problem that regulators do not touch: bankers have an incentive to bet the bank every time around. That\xe2\x80\x99s because of how they are paid.'b'In a good year, top bankers\xe2\x80\x99 pay would shame Croesus. But they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to return past bonuses when the year is bad. Merrill fired its chief, Stanley O\xe2\x80\x99Neal, and Citigroup dispensed with Charles Prince. But Morgan Stanley\xe2\x80\x99s John Mack is hanging on. None have returned the untold millions they made in all those years when their banks were stuffing themselves with subprime loans.'b'A better alignment of rewards with the long-term performance of the bank and its investments could reduce the incentive to maximize profit in the short run and shrug off the possibility that the bet sours just around the corner.'b'One approach would be to pay a large share of all bankers\xe2\x80\x99 remuneration with restricted stock that vested over several years. To impose discipline on individual bankers, Raghuram Rajan, the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, suggests that banks should hold a big chunk of bankers\xe2\x80\x99 pay in escrow to be paid out over a long period. Compensation  could then be made contingent on the long-term success of each banker\xe2\x80\x99s strategies.'b'Bankers who had to forfeit substantial portions of their pay if their investments turned bad down the road might discipline their craving for things like subprime mortgage-laced collateralized debt obligations, which provided extremely high returns until wobbles in the housing market turned them into virtually worthless pieces of paper.'b'Remuneration is tricky terrain. Banks might resist reconfiguring bankers\xe2\x80\x99 pay out of fear that their top talent would jump ship. But regulators could encourage bankers to voluntarily rejigger their compensation schemes. Just as changes in the tax code in the 1990s prompted a surge in equity-based pay, other changes might encourage bankers to think about the long-term consequences of their actions.'b'If banks do not want to address the problem, they risk Congressional action. For many members of Congress, regulating bankers\xe2\x80\x99 livelihoods to keep them from ruining everybody else\xe2\x80\x99s may seem like an attractive move.'b'To the Editor:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cApplications to Colleges Are Breaking Records\xe2\x80\x9d (news article, Jan. 17) suggests several possible reasons for the increase, but does not recognize the contribution to these numbers of the canceled early admission programs.'b'In 2006, Harvard, Princeton and Virginia collectively admitted 2,500 students who applied to their early admission programs.

A Bush is in the White House, the economy is a mess, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a candidate who, in the view of a number of observers, is running on a message of hope, of moving past partisan differences, that resembles Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign 16 years ago.'b'Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that\xe2\x80\x99s a fair characterization of the 1992 Clinton campaign, which had a strong streak of populism, beginning with a speech in which Mr. Clinton described the 1980s as a \xe2\x80\x9cgilded age of greed.\xe2\x80\x9d Still, to the extent that Barack Obama 2008 does sound like Bill Clinton 1992, here\xe2\x80\x99s my question: Has everyone forgotten what happened after the 1992 election?'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s review the sad tale, starting with the politics.'b'Whatever hopes people might have had that Mr. Clinton would usher in a new era of national unity were quickly dashed. Within just a few months the country was wracked by the bitter partisanship Mr. Obama has decried.'b'This bitter partisanship wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the result of anything the Clintons did. Instead, from Day 1 they faced an all-out assault from conservatives determined to use any means at hand to discredit a Democratic president.'b'For those who are reaching for their smelling salts because Democratic candidates are saying slightly critical things about each other, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth revisiting those years, simply to get a sense of what dirty politics really looks like.'b'No accusation was considered too outlandish: a group supported by Jerry Falwell put out a film suggesting that the Clintons had arranged for the murder of an associate, and The Wall Street Journal\xe2\x80\x99s editorial page repeatedly hinted that Bill Clinton might have been in cahoots with a drug smuggler.'b'So what good did Mr. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s message of inclusiveness do him?'b'Meanwhile, though Mr. Clinton may not have run as postpartisan a campaign as legend has it, he did avoid some conflict by being strategically vague about policy. In particular, he promised health care reform, but left the business of producing an actual plan until after the election.'b'This turned out to be a disaster. Much has been written about the process by which the Clinton health care plan was put together: it was too secretive, too top-down, too politically tone-deaf. Above all, however, it was too slow. Mr. Clinton didn\xe2\x80\x99t deliver legislation to Congress until Nov. 20, 1993 \xe2\x80\x94 by which time the momentum from his electoral victory had evaporated, and opponents had had plenty of time to organize against him.'b'The failure of health care reform, in turn, doomed the Clinton presidency to second-rank status. The government was well run (something we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned to appreciate now that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen what a badly run government looks like), but \xe2\x80\x94 as Mr. Obama correctly says \xe2\x80\x94 there was no change in the country\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental trajectory.'b'So what are the lessons for today\xe2\x80\x99s Democrats?'b'First, those who don\xe2\x80\x99t want to nominate Hillary Clinton because they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to return to the nastiness of the 1990s \xe2\x80\x94 a sizable group, at least in the punditocracy \xe2\x80\x94 are deluding themselves. Any Democrat who makes it to the White House can expect the same treatment: an unending procession of wild charges and fake scandals, dutifully given credence by major media organizations that somehow can\xe2\x80\x99t bring themselves to declare the accusations unequivocally false (at least not on Page 1).'b'The point is that while there are valid reasons one might support Mr. Obama over Mrs. Clinton, the desire to avoid unpleasantness isn\xe2\x80\x99t one of them.'b'Second, the policy proposals candidates run on matter.'b'I have colleagues who tell me that Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of health insurance mandates \xe2\x80\x94 which are an essential element of any workable plan for universal coverage \xe2\x80\x94 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter, because by the time health care reform gets through Congress it will be very different from the president\xe2\x80\x99s initial proposal anyway. But this misses the lesson of the Clinton failure: if the next president doesn\xe2\x80\x99t arrive with a plan that is broadly workable in outline, by the time the thing gets fixed the window of opportunity may well have passed.'b'My sense is that the fight for the Democratic nomination has gotten terribly off track. The blame is widely shared. Yes, Bill Clinton has been somewhat boorish (though I can\xe2\x80\x99t make sense of the claims that he\xe2\x80\x99s somehow breaking unwritten rules, which seem to have been newly created for the occasion). But many Obama supporters also seem far too ready to demonize their opponents.'b'What the Democrats should do is get back to talking about issues \xe2\x80\x94 a focus on issues has been the great contribution of John Edwards to this campaign \xe2\x80\x94 and about who is best prepared to push their agenda forward.

One deadlock in every 100 votes can hardly be characterized as \xe2\x80\x9croutine.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The contention that enforcement action is slow and ineffective also flies in the face of basic facts.

It is likely to have the same non-reaction to a third sanctions resolution now being considered by the United Nations Security Council. The proposal opens up a potentially significant new penalty by urging states to inspect cargo on Iranian ships and aircraft if they are suspected of transporting prohibited nuclear-related items. But it still lacks real economic bite.'b'We were surprised, and somewhat reassured, that America and Europe managed to get China and Russia to sign on to any resolution. All of the key players \xe2\x80\x94 except the United States \xe2\x80\x94 have strong economic reasons not to put the squeeze on Iran. And President Bush has made things a lot harder: raising the specter of World War III even as his intelligence community was reporting that Iran had abandoned its secret weapons program, if not its nuclear ambitions.'b'So the fact that the major powers are still talking about even limited sanctions may surprise some in Tehran. But apparently  even Moscow and Beijing have no doubts about the danger of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s overt nuclear efforts. The longer Iran defies the Security Council and continues to enrich uranium, the closer its scientists get to mastering the skills for building a weapon. Without stronger punishments and stronger incentives, Iran is unlikely to halt its efforts.'b'Even if the resolution is adopted, European, Asian and gulf states \xe2\x80\x94 which all say they\xe2\x80\x99re fearful of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear appetites \xe2\x80\x94 should make their own effort to tighten economic screws. They can start by ordering their banks to stop dealing with Iranian banks Melli and Saderat. America\xe2\x80\x99s crackdown on the banks last year has  raised Iran\xe2\x80\x99s cost  of doing international business.'b'Russia and the Arab states must also stop trying to have it both ways with Iran.

Last  week another close American ally, Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s President Hosni Mubarak,  had his first-ever chat on the phone about regional issues with  the Iranian president.'b'As for incentives, that\xe2\x80\x99s Washington\xe2\x80\x99s department. Just talking about better relations is clearly not enough to get Tehran\xe2\x80\x99s attention.

Quite the contrary. In Charleston, on Wednesday, he disingenuously remarked: \xe2\x80\x9cAs far as I can tell, neither Senator Obama nor Hillary have lost votes because of their race or gender. They are getting votes, to be sure, because of their race or gender \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s why people tell me Hillary doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a chance of winning here.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Really? Who was telling him that?'b'Hillary was ahead in South Carolina polls as recently as early December. And in fact, women made up 61 percent of the Democratic electorate in South Carolina, blacks 55 percent. If Obama was getting votes because of race and Hillary because of gender,  Hillary had a perfectly good chance to win. Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s excuse is unconvincing and unseemly.'b'Then on Saturday, in Columbia, pre-spinning his wife\xe2\x80\x99s imminent defeat, Clinton reminded reporters out of the blue that \xe2\x80\x9cJesse Jackson won South Carolina twice, in \xe2\x80\x9984 and \xe2\x80\x9988.

The Obama campaign is nothing like Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s. Obama isn\xe2\x80\x99t running on Jackson-like themes. Obama rarely refers to Jackson.'b'Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s comment alludes to one thing, and to one thing only: Jackson and Obama are both black candidates. The silent premise of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s comment is that Obama\xe2\x80\x99s victory in South Carolina doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really count. Or, at least, Clinton is suggesting, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean any more than Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s did.'b'But of course \xe2\x80\x94 as Clinton knows very well \xe2\x80\x94 Jesse Jackson didn\xe2\x80\x99t win (almost all-white) Iowa. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t come within a couple of points of prevailing in (almost all-white) New Hampshire. Nor did he, as Obama did, carry white voters in rural Nevada. And Saturday, in South Carolina, even after Bill Clinton tried to turn Obama into Jackson, Hillary defeated Obama by just three to two among white voters'b'So Bill Clinton has been playing the race card, and doing so clumsily. But why is he playing any cards? He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to be in the game. But just as Hillary was supposed to be finding her own voice, Bill decided to barge in, and to do so with a vengeance. This has been no favor to Hillary.'b'The proof is in the South Carolina results. Bill Clinton became the dominant story in the last few days of that campaign. According to the exit polls, about one in five South Carolina Democrats decided whom to vote for in the last three days. Among those late deciders, Hillary Clinton received only  21 percent of the vote compared with 27 percent overall.   In South Carolina, many of those falling off from Clinton seemed to go to Edwards. Next week, with Edwards much less of a factor, won\xe2\x80\x99t many such voters go all the way to Obama?'b'Right now, Hillary Clinton is ahead in the polls in almost all the big states voting.  She is a tough and capable campaigner, and she may be able to hold on to those leads. But it is now clear that  putting her in the White House brings a hyperactive Bill back in with her. Who needs it? Liberals and Democrats can get basically the same policies without the Clinton baggage, and in choosing Obama, they can nominate a more electable candidate.'b'So Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s advantage in the polls will, I suspect, erode. The erosion could be hastened by the expected endorsement of Obama by Ted Kennedy on Monday. It could be helped further  along if Al Gore hops aboard the Obama bandwagon later in the week. Meanwhile, Tom Daschle, the Senate Democratic leader during most of the Clinton presidency, is actively supporting Obama. Talk to Democrats in D.C., and  it\xe2\x80\x99s amazing how many who know the Clintons well \xe2\x80\x94 many of whom worked in the Clinton administration \xe2\x80\x94 are eager that they  not return to the White House.'b'This week, the Clinton team will dump every bit of opposition research it has  on Obama. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see how Obama responds.'b'But the moment of truth could come at the Democratic debate Thursday, in Los Angeles. Edwards may have dropped out by then. If so, it will be a one-on-one showdown. Even if he\xe2\x80\x99s there, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be effectively a bystander. Will Obama hold his own?'b'I\xe2\x80\x99d say that even if you\xe2\x80\x99ve (understandably) skipped the previous debates, this is one to tune into. I had a dinner scheduled Thursday night.

Bush prepares to deliver his final State of the Union address, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth revisiting the first speech he gave to a joint session of Congress. His valedictory words tonight will provide an opportunity to reflect on the kind of president Mr. Bush was. The speech delivered seven years ago points to the very different sort of president he might have been.'b'Mr. Bush began his February 2001 address by hailing the new spirit of cooperation he hoped would characterize his relations with Congress. \xe2\x80\x9cTogether we are changing the tone in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared. The new president\xe2\x80\x99s top priority would be education. He intended to marry the liberal desire for more federal money to the conservative demand for higher standards.'b'The rest of the speech was similarly moderate in tone and substance. Mr. Bush planned to use part of the enormous fiscal surplus he inherited for a broad-based tax cut. But he also wanted to expand Medicare benefits, preserve Social Security, extend access to health care and protect the environment. He concluded with an exhortation to bipartisanship \xe2\x80\x94 in Spanish. \xe2\x80\x9cJuntos podemos,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTogether we can.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Bush seemed genuinely to want to be the kind of president indicated by that first address. He meant to build a broad coalition on the model of his  governorship in Texas, where he worked closely with Democrats in the Legislature, made his chief cause correcting racial disparities in education, and was re-elected in 1998 by an almost 40 percentage point margin, including 27 percent of the black vote and at least a third of Latinos. I always sort of liked that George W. Bush. Whatever happened to him?'b'Mr. Bush never completely abandoned the compassionate conservatism we glimpsed that night seven years ago. His second speech to Congress, nine days after Sept. 11, 2001, reflected his instinctive response to the attacks, which was to appeal for national unity in a non-partisan manner. Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s third speech to Congress (his first formal State of the Union address, in 2002) is remembered for its reference to the \xe2\x80\x9caxis of evil.\xe2\x80\x9d But the president also boasted about his cooperation with such Democrats as George Miller and Ted Kennedy on education policy. His strongest emphasis was on public service. He proposed doubling the size of the Peace Corps and called on every American to commit at least 4,000 hours \xe2\x80\x94 two full working years \xe2\x80\x94 to community service.'b'The following year, in 2003, Mr. Bush pressed his case for invading Iraq and uttered the infamous 16 words (\xe2\x80\x9cThe British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa\xe2\x80\x9d). But alongside that disingenuous indictment, Mr. Bush presented Congress with a new raft of centrist-minded initiatives: $450 million to minister to the needs of children of prisoners, $600 million to treat drug addicts, $1.2 billion for hydrogen-powered cars, $10 billion in new money to fight AIDS in Africa and the Caribbean.'b'And so on, in each subsequent speech. In 2004, Mr. Bush used weasel words to describe the missing Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. He claimed to have disrupted \xe2\x80\x9cdozens of weapons of mass destruction-related program activities.\xe2\x80\x9d But when he turned to domestic matters, the president unveiled a new science and math program for low-income students and a program to help former prisoners re-enter society. He included an eloquent plea for the kind of immigration reform that would \xe2\x80\x9creflect our values and benefit our economy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To this day, Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s compassionate conservatism has never vanished completely. Some of Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s signature programs, like his initiative to provide AIDS drugs to Africans, have had meaningful effects. But others haven\xe2\x80\x99t lived up to their rhetorical promise. What about that special training for defense lawyers in capital cases (pledged in his 2005 State of the Union address)? The initiative to encourage mentoring for at-risk children (2006)? The grants to extend health insurance coverage (2007)? Such gestures tended to linger in the air only as long as it took Mr. Bush to make them.'b'So often with Mr. Bush, compassionate government began and ended with the heartfelt public avowal. He was too distracted by war and foreign policy, and too bored by the processes of government to know if the people working for him were following through on his proposals.'b'And of course, Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s left hand acted as if it didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what his right hand was doing. After his first year in office, Democrats burned by his political strategy of polarization were disinclined to work with him on shared goals.'b'The Compassionate Conservative will surely pay us a final visit tonight. He remains an appealing character, but a largely fictional one. I wonder how the last seven years might have turned out if he had actually existed. In the final year of a failed presidency, I bet Mr. Bush does too.'b'To the Editor:'b'To have a meaningful debate over public policy you need to have real arguments, not fear-mongering.'b'In \xe2\x80\x9cDebt Relief Made Harder for Homeowners\xe2\x80\x9d (Business Day, Jan. 12), Steve Bartlett, president and chief executive of Financial Services Roundtable, an association in Washington representing the nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest lenders and securities dealers, claimed that legislation that allows a bankruptcy judge to adjust the interest rate and valuation of primary residences would \xe2\x80\x9cdrive up rates on new mortgages for everyone else and further disrupt the global securities market.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There may be a legitimate reason why the country\xe2\x80\x99s biggest banking institutions would oppose this legislation. but those reasons are not it. There is no data that supports the contention that bankruptcy changes being contemplated in Congress would do either.'b'The legislation that could help contain the current mortgage mess and help over 600,000 homeowners avoid foreclosure applies to existing loans only. Therefore, by definition, it could not affect future interest rates because it would not apply to future loans.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s focus on stopping foreclosures, helping keep people in their homes and protecting our economy with a debate based on solid public policy and legitimate reasoning.'b'Jack Kemp'b'\nWashington, Jan. 16, 2008'b''b''b'The writer is the former secretary of housing and urban development.'b''b'GREELEYVILLE, South Carolina \xe2\x80\x93 Something is stirring in the U.S.A.. Even in this depressed corner of the country, a place where trains no longer stop and poor families get water from shallow wells, you feel it. A political campaign has become a movement with Barack Obama at its head.'b'Campaigns are planned. But movements are full of impromptu decisions like the one that delivered Bryant Jones, 25, to this backwater. A few days ago, Jones, who is white and has always leaned Republican, jumped in his car and drove seven hours from Washington D.C. to campaign for Obama, a black Democrat.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was his all-encompassing message that got to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Jones, a student at George Washington University said. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel uplifted by him.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Obama swept to victory in South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic presidential primary, taking 55 percent of the vote, more than double Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s score. He did so with over 80 percent of the black vote in a heavily African-American state with a charged racial history, and about a quarter of the white vote.'b'Those are the raw numbers. They are heartening to Obama, who has the wind at his back, but not dispiriting to Clinton, who is looking to contests in states with different social make-ups. Did she take a bullet in South Carolina in order to racialize her fight with Obama going into February 5, when 22 states hold nominating contests?'b'Certainly, Bill Clinton lost no opportunity to inject race, alluding to Jesse Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s victories here in the 1984 and 1988 Democratic primaries, as if to minimize the significance of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s win and clothe him in Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s marginal mantle. The \xe2\x80\x9cfirst black president,\xe2\x80\x9d as he was once called, seemed intent on setting the limits of the first African-American with a real shot at the White House.'b'Obama, in victory, took a different tack. \xe2\x80\x9cThe choice in this election is not between regions or religions or genders. It\xe2\x80\x99s not about rich versus poor, young versus old, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not about black versus white. This election is about the past versus the future.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'These lines reprised the unifying theme of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s breakthrough speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention while adding a note that has been critical to his youth-driven momentum: equating Clinton with the status quo.'b'Certainly, the lure of a different future drew Jones, the young independent of Republican sympathies now wearing Obama buttons.'b'Jones is from Idaho. He made clear he\xe2\x80\x99d voted for Bush at least once. But he\xe2\x80\x99s now had it with \xe2\x80\x9cmy-way-or-the-highway politics\xe2\x80\x9d and the same old faces.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m 25 and for my entire life a Bush or a Clinton has been in the executive office, either as vice-president or president\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe United States is not about dynasties.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He\xe2\x80\x99s drawn to Obama\xe2\x80\x99s environmental proposals, his honesty, and what he called \xe2\x80\x9cthe fact he symbolizes for me that we are at a point where we do not have to think about skin color.\xe2\x80\x9d Other Idaho Republican friends were also leaning toward Obama, Jones said.'b'This young man represents something important. A new generation \xe2\x80\x93 for whom race is an issue overcome and baby-boomers are old folk fighting arcane battles and post-9/11 thinking must cede to post-post-9/11 creativity \xe2\x80\x93 is hungry for hope and willing to come even to places as hopeless as Greeleyville to demonstrate that.'b'Obama rightly mocks those who dismiss him as a na\xc3\xafve \xe2\x80\x9chopemonger\xe2\x80\x9d and say he has to be \xe2\x80\x9cseasoned\xe2\x80\x9d in order to \xe2\x80\x9cboil all the hope out of him.\xe2\x80\x9d This war-stretched, recession-menaced country is confronted by \xe2\x80\x9cthe fierce urgency of now,\xe2\x80\x9d as Martin Luther King put it. A Republican-leaning white kid feels that urgency and makes a political leap, as have myriad others.'b'In the makeshift Obama campaign center in Greeleyville, I also stumbled on seven Harvard students who\xe2\x80\x99d driven for 16 hours to get out the vote for their post-baby-boom candidate. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m here because I believe Obama has a chance at greatness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kishore Kuchibhotla, 27, who\xe2\x80\x99s studying for a biophysics doctorate.'b'Hannah Fried, 26, a law student, said: \xe2\x80\x9cClinton is what our country has been. She\xe2\x80\x99s not where we\xe2\x80\x99re going, which is more diverse, more global, with fewer expectations about what it means to be black or white. Obama gets this from his upbringing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When campaigns become movements, barriers fall. Crumbling Greeleyville has surely never before seen seven Harvard students being offered fried pig skins before going to canvass in African-American homes with well water \xe2\x80\x93 and then heading back for class Monday.'b"This little town suggests Obama has indeed assembled \xe2\x80\x9cthe most diverse coalition of Americans we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in a long, long time,\xe2\x80\x9d as he put it. It's now set to include Senator Edward Kennedy. If that growing coalition is beyond race, as I believe, rather than vulnerable to race, as the Clintons seems to have bet, South Carolina will prove no aberration."b'IN his State of the Union address Monday evening, President Bush asked Congress to permanently extend the federal laws permitting religious nonprofit organizations to compete for federal grants.'b'Seven years ago this week, Mr. Bush started his faith-based initiative. He promised to build on these \xe2\x80\x9ccharitable choice\xe2\x80\x9d laws, which were begat by bipartisan compromises between President Bill Clinton and Senator John Ashcroft. \xe2\x80\x9cGovernment cannot be replaced by charities,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Bush declared, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it should welcome them as partners, instead of resenting them as rivals.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The president\xe2\x80\x99s original plan called for making federal grants and vouchers more readily available to the thousands of religious nonprofit organizations that provide job training, affordable housing, after-school programs and other social services. The initiative prescribed $8 billion in tax credits and new spending, including at least $700 million in a \xe2\x80\x9ccompassion fund\xe2\x80\x9d to benefit exemplary programs. It was designed so that small congregations and ministries that had long served needy neighbors on shoestring budgets \xe2\x80\x94 and not just large, national religious charities \xe2\x80\x94 could get their fair share of government aid.'b'It did not happen. The number of faith-based organizations receiving a federal grant rose from 665 in 2002 to only 762 in 2004, according to a Rockefeller Institute study. A program that was projected to finance mentoring for 100,000 children of prisoners has so far paid for only 33,000, according to the White House. Over the past six years, federal grants to faith-based programs have shifted away from the local \xe2\x80\x9carmies of compassion\xe2\x80\x9d praised by Mr. Bush and toward large, national organizations with religious affiliations.'b'Every nonpartisan study has concluded that the initiative has not delivered the grants, vouchers, tax incentives and other support for faith-based organizations that the president originally promised.'b'In a book published last year, Michael Gerson, Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s former speechwriter, concludes: \xe2\x80\x9cThe faith-based initiative was not tried and found wanting. It was tried and found difficult \xe2\x80\x94 then tried with less and less energy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'President Bush has promised much. It will be left to the next president to deliver on those promises. The good news is that every major presidential candidate seems open to doing just that.'b'Hillary Clinton has declared that there is no contradiction between \xe2\x80\x9csupport for faith-based initiatives and upholding our constitutional principles.\xe2\x80\x9d John McCain has supported the idea especially as it relates to improving educational programs for disadvantaged children. Barack Obama describes faith-based programs as a \xe2\x80\x9cuniquely powerful way of solving problems\xe2\x80\x9d especially where former prisoners and substance abusers are concerned. When he was governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney created his own faith-based office.'b'Politicians from both parties have come to realize that faith-based programs are indispensable even if they are not miraculous. America\xe2\x80\x99s churches, synagogues, mosques and other congregations supply dozens of major social services \xe2\x80\x94 like day care, homeless shelters and anti-violence programs  \xe2\x80\x94 worth billions of dollars each year, as Ram Cnaan, a professor of social work at the University of Pennsylvania, has proved in several studies. Dr. Cnaan is not even counting the work done by inner-city religious schools and other local faith-based programs. From coast to coast, the primary beneficiaries of these services are low-income children and families who are not otherwise affiliated with the religious nonprofit organizations that serve them.'b'The Constitution is no longer a potential obstacle to a successful faith-based initiative in the White House. In several cases decided since 2001, the Supreme Court has clarified that even \xe2\x80\x9cpervasively sectarian\xe2\x80\x9d religious nonprofit organizations remain tax-exempt and can receive government social service grants on the same basis as secular nonprofit organizations. Their eligibility is constitutionally secure so long as they do not proselytize or engage in sectarian instruction; serve all persons without regard to religion; follow applicable federal anti-discrimination laws; and use public monies only to serve grant-specified secular purposes.'b'Increasingly, governors and mayors, with or without Washington\xe2\x80\x99s help, are on the case. Since 2001, governors by the dozens and over a hundred mayors have started faith-based initiatives on their own. In numerous places, the initiatives have persisted through changes in administrations and party control \xe2\x80\x94 further evidence for the emerging political consensus in favor of using public dollars to support faith-based organizations. The ideological disputes that infect inside-the-Beltway debates over the separation of church and state have little life in cities where what gets accomplished (or not) in juvenile justice, health care and other social services is a visible, life-and-death drama.'b'In Monday night\xe2\x80\x99s address, President Bush rightly focused attention on the faith-based saints in the Gulf Coast. Religious nonprofit organizations have led the physical and financial recovery in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. That includes giants like Catholic Charities and the Salvation Army, universities like Loyola, and many among the roughly 900 local congregations (down from 1,500 before the levees broke) that have revived themselves since August 2005. Blessed by federal and state government support, religious groups in New Orleans have built thousands of houses, opened neighborhood health clinics and provided cash assistance to the destitute and the homeless.'b'Faith-based initiatives have a centrist past that can be prologue. The first \xe2\x80\x9cfaith center\xe2\x80\x9d in the federal government was in the Department of Housing and Urban Development under President Clinton.'b'Surveys by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life find that large majorities among Democrats, Republicans and independents favor using federal money to support the work of faith-based organizations. Support remains steadfast among Americans of every race, class, region and religion.'b'And among the 4 in 10 adults who describe themselves as born-again or evangelical Christians, big changes are under way that will help the next president promote faith-based initiatives. Some prominent evangelical leaders remain focused on abortion or gay marriage, or oppose sacred places serving civic purposes with government support. But Pew surveys find that over two-thirds of evangelicals favor permitting churches and other houses of worship to apply for federal grants. Since 2001, new conservative Christian leaders \xe2\x80\x94 like Rick Warren, the author of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Purpose-Driven Life\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 have commanded attention from the news media, developed robust domestic and international social service ministries, and avoided being seduced into single-issue or partisan politics.'b'Younger evangelicals are keenly interested in alleviating poverty. Only 40 percent of 18- to 29-year-old evangelicals identify themselves as Republicans, down from 55 percent in 2005, a Pew survey last year found. A slight majority (51 percent) now say they are either independents (32 percent, up from 26 percent in 2005) or Democrats (19 percent, up from 14 percent in 2005).'b'On Jan. 19, 2005, Mrs. Clinton, speaking before clergy members in Boston, captured the spirit that is likely to prevail in the White House, no matter who is elected: \xe2\x80\x9cBut I ask you, who is more likely to go out onto a street to save some poor, at-risk child than someone from the community, someone who believes in the divinity of every person, who sees God at work in the lives of even the most hopeless and left-behind of our children? And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we need to not have a false division or debate about the role of faith-based institutions, we need to just do it and provide the support that is needed on an ongoing basis.\xe2\x80\x9d Amen.'b'The suburbs are dead. People always say that, and if you live in suburbia you expect to hear it, particularly from teenagers who are convinced that growing up there comes at some cost to their souls. Still it is remarkable to hear that dire diagnosis from the leaders of the two counties that make up Long Island, America\xe2\x80\x99s emblematic suburb, and home of the original Levittown.'b'The county executives, Thomas Suozzi of Nassau and Steve Levy of Suffolk, will tell anyone who listens that there is no better place to live. But speaking last week before a group of fellow politicians, businesspeople and academics, the two leaders were just as emphatic in insisting that Long Island\xe2\x80\x99s defining trait \xe2\x80\x94 a house with one family and two cars, and another house next door, and another, and another \xe2\x80\x94 was defunct.'b'Long Islanders might be doing O.K., but the postwar vision that brought them there, the dream of paving the potato fields, watering the lawn and worshiping the car, was over.'b'Their supporting evidence was the Long Island Index, an annual survey by a nonprofit foundation that examined Nassau and Suffolk through a host of statistical lenses and found a lot to be grim about, including crushing taxes and a lagging economy. The prime source of malaise, the report asserted, was Long Island\xe2\x80\x99s staggering housing costs, which were causing an exodus of young people and keeping employers from moving in.'b'Mr. Suozzi, Mr. Levy and other speakers argued that Long Island\xe2\x80\x99s future was no longer bucolic and sprawling, but dense, urban and vertical. They said that the land of parkways and subdivisions could shake off its blahs only by building up \xe2\x80\x94 by filling neglected downtowns with taller buildings, apartments, townhouses, stores and parking garages, and enhancing mass transit.'b'Mr. Suozzi and Mr. Levy have seen the future, and the future is Westchester County, where the John Cheever suburbs have a newly revived city in the middle, White Plains, with gleaming hotels and condos and enough of the buzz and sheen of gentrification and tax-generation to make any budget-writing politician happy.'b'But is that what regular Long Islanders really want?'b'The authors of the Long Island Index found a few joyous nuggets. One is that a significant number of Long Islanders (38 percent) said they could see themselves living someday in a downtown apartment, condo or townhouse, forsaking the old Levittown ideal for something walkable, interesting and, above all, affordable. Half of the respondents could imagine a child or parent doing so. Sixty-one percent supported building more homes and apartments in some downtowns, and 49 percent said they would favor taller downtown buildings \xe2\x80\x94 up to four stories, from two.'b'From these modest statistics, some optimists have detected a sea change in Long Island attitudes. I\xe2\x80\x99m not so sure.'b'The two county executives are right to recognize that Long Island, hemmed by sea and Sound, cannot grow outward. They know that an economy needs businesses, businesses need workers and workers need a place to live that isn\xe2\x80\x99t their parents\xe2\x80\x99 basement and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t swallow half their salaries.'b'This argument has been made over and over, but with no appreciable effect. Long Island is a land of bedrooms, not an incubator of urban-planning concepts, and for every smart-growth PowerPoint or op-ed article favoring townhouses, you will have at least 50 enraged citizens who will show up at a public hearing to denounce it.'b'Here are some other statistics from the same report that hint at the mountain of Not In My Backyard feeling that pro-density forces will have to wear down if they are going to build anything close to the 200,000 units that some experts say Long Island will need in the next 25 years to solve its housing crisis.'b'Fifty-nine percent of Long Islanders could 'b'never 'b'imagine themselves living in an apartment. Asked which type of neighborhood they preferred \xe2\x80\x94 one where you could walk to stores or one that required driving \xe2\x80\x94 56 percent said they would rather drive. Meanwhile, only 7 percent agreed that \xe2\x80\x9ccreating ethnically and economically diverse neighborhoods\xe2\x80\x9d was the major advantage of building more affordable housing. Asked what the worst 'b'disadvantage 'b'was, 20 percent said \xe2\x80\x9cbringing in the wrong kinds of people.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The pollsters asked respondents to choose their favorite downtown on Long Island, and the winner wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even a downtown. The top vote-getter, at 20 percent, was \xe2\x80\x9cthe mall.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Perhaps the most telling moment before Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic presidential primary in Florida, came last week when Senator Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s supporters carried around a cardboard cutout of their candidate to smile, stiffly, at potential supporters.'b'Because Florida\xe2\x80\x99s legislators insisted on leapfrogging their primary to be one of the first in the nation, the Democratic Party took all of Florida\xe2\x80\x99s convention delegates away. And the real Mr. Obama and his chief rival, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, agreed to limit their efforts in Florida to fund-raising, and forswore campaigning there \xe2\x80\x94 at least in the flesh.'b'Things are slightly better for the Republicans, whose Florida winner will gain only half of their party\xe2\x80\x99s normal delegates. Voters have seen more of their G.O.P. candidates (we\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to them to say whether they liked it or not). All this is merely the latest kink in a presidential primary season that is far more messed up than usual.'b'What is extraordinary is how enthusiastic about this primary election Florida\xe2\x80\x99s voters appear to be. By Sunday, more than 400,000 Democrats had already cast early ballots \xe2\x80\x94 four times more than voted early in 2004. The challenge for the leadership of both parties is to ensure that such passion continues through the conventions and November, whether or not the delegate ban \xe2\x80\x94 or in the Republican case, the semi-ban \xe2\x80\x94 remains in place.'b'Right now, most political experts figure that eventually the parties will relent, and that the full slates of delegates from all states will be seated at the conventions. That would be good for the enthusiasm factor.'b'But we can see other troubles ahead. Suppose that going into the Democratic convention, no candidate has enough delegates for a clear win. A bitter fight by the candidates to seat their delegates or unseat their rivals\xe2\x80\x99 won\xe2\x80\x99t do the party or the nation any good.'b'The fault here, of course, lies with the legislators and the party leaders who insisted on pushing to the head of the pack. There is a bigger problem, and that is with the whole state by state \xe2\x80\x94  Iowa and New Hampshire always go first \xe2\x80\x94  primary system. The most sensible method for organizing these primaries would be to cluster them by region. And then take turns every four years for selecting the region that gets to vote first.'b'Perhaps it could be another early test for presidential nominees. If candidates could figure out how to make the primaries regional and rational, that should be a good predictor of how they would lead the nation.'b'To the Editor:'b'Your timely Jan. 21 editorial, \xe2\x80\x9cUntil All the Fish Are Gone,\xe2\x80\x9d correctly underscores the growing negative environmental and social effects of overfishing. What once seemed simply a conservation concern is now a global issue with tremendous social and economic ramifications.'b'We are fast approaching a critical crossroads in the future of our oceans. But unlike many other global issues, where business and the environmental community are often at odds, here we completely agree on a solution.'b'Members of the World Trade Organization are now negotiating new trade rules to reduce the government subsidies that promote overfishing. These subsidies provide fleets with money, fuel and incentives to fish longer, harder and farther than ever before. As a result, fish populations are declining, along with the quality of life of people around the world who depend on fishing for food and livelihood.'b'Reducing fishing subsidies is the single greatest action that can be taken to protect the world\xe2\x80\x99s oceans.'b'Will the W.T.O. members seize the opportunity to stop overfishing and begin restoring the health of the oceans, and in turn, the health of mankind?

How different it might have been if Mr. Bush meant what he said about compassionate conservatism or even followed the fiscal discipline of old-fashioned conservatism. How different if he had made a real effort to reach for the bipartisanship he promised in 2002 and so many times since.'b'Then he could have used last night\xe2\x80\x99s speech to celebrate a balanced budget, one in which taxes produce enough money to pay for the nation\xe2\x80\x99s genuine needs, including health care for poor children and a rebuilt New Orleans. Instead, Mr. Bush called \xe2\x80\x94 again \xe2\x80\x94 for his tax cuts to be permanent and threatened to veto bills that contained excessive pork-barrel spending, an idea absent from his agenda when Republicans held Congress.'b'Had Mr. Bush been doing his job right just in the last few weeks, he could have used this speech to celebrate a genuinely bipartisan agreement on a sound economic stimulus plan. In addition to the tax rebates agreed on already between the White House and the House, Mr. Bush could have announced sensible proposals for extending unemployment benefits and a temporary increase in food stamps for the most vulnerable citizens.'b'Those aren\xe2\x80\x99t just Democratic ideas. The independent Congressional Budget Office ranks those stimulus policies as far more effective than rebates.'b'If Mr. Bush had let compassion and good sense trump ideology, he would have been able to use last night\xe2\x80\x99s speech to celebrate the expansion of health insurance to tens of millions of children with working parents. Mr. Bush vetoed an expansion of the S-chip program, and he did not even agree to pay for all of the existing coverage because he thought a relative handful of parents might switch from private to public insurance if they were offered government assistance to buy it.'b'In 2003, the president proposed the Medicare prescription drug benefit, his signature achievement in health insurance reform. It barely squeaked past conservative Republicans in Congress, and Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s appetite for making health care accessible and affordable for all Americans vanished.'b'Mr. Bush has included a call for immigration reform in all of his previous State of the Union addresses. But he has never matched that rhetoric with strong ideas or political passion.

Afghanistan\xe2\x80\x99s good war was quickly overshadowed \xe2\x80\x94 and shortchanged \xe2\x80\x94 by Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s Iraq folly. Six years later, the United States and its allies are still fighting and dying in Afghanistan and the Taliban is back in force.'b'He was not even able to assure Americans that there is an end in sight to the Iraq war. Instead, he made the same empty promise he has made every year: When Iraq can defend itself, American troops will come home.

But 2007 was still the most violent year in Iraq since the 2003 invasion and \xe2\x80\x94 more important \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Bush has little to show in the way of political reconciliation, the only guarantor of a lasting peace. Mr. Bush has made no real effort to seek the help of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors to help stabilize the country.'b'In the end, when it comes to Iraq, Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s annual addresses will be remembered most for his false claims \xe2\x80\x94 the fictitious \xe2\x80\x9caxis of evil,\xe2\x80\x9d nonexistent aluminum tubes and African uranium, dangerous weapons that did not exist. No president can want that as his legacy.'b'Mr. Bush still has a year left \xe2\x80\x94 and many serious problems to address.

All the suppressed suspicions of Clintonian narcissism came back to the fore. Are these people really serving the larger cause of the Democratic Party, or are they using the party as a vehicle for themselves?'b'And then Monday, something equally astonishing happened. A throng of Kennedys came to the Bender Arena at American University in Washington to endorse Obama. Caroline Kennedy evoked her father. Senator Edward Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s slightly hunched form carried with it the recent history of the Democratic Party.'b'The Kennedy endorsements will help among working-class Democrats, Catholics and the millions of Americans who have followed Caroline\xe2\x80\x99s path to maturity. Furthermore, here was Senator Kennedy, the consummate legislative craftsman, vouching for the fact that Obama is ready to be president on Day One.'b'But the event was striking for another reason, having to do with the confluence of themes and generations. The Kennedys and Obama hit the same contrasts again and again in their speeches: the high road versus the low road; inspiration versus calculation; future versus the past; and most of all, service versus selfishness.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWith Barack Obama, we will turn the page on the old politics of misrepresentation and distortion,\xe2\x80\x9d Senator Kennedy declared. \xe2\x80\x9cWith Barack Obama, there is a new national leader who has given America a different kind of campaign \xe2\x80\x94 a campaign not just about himself, but about all of us,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'The Clintons started this fight, and in his grand and graceful way, Kennedy returned the volley with added speed.'b'Kennedy went on to talk about the 1960s. But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk much about the late-60s, when Bill and Hillary came to political activism. He talked about the early-60s, and the idealism of the generation that had seen World War II, the idealism of the generation that marched in jacket and ties, the idealism of a generation whose activism was relatively unmarked by drug use and self-indulgence.'b'Then, in the speech\xe2\x80\x99s most striking passage, he set Bill Clinton afloat on the receding tide of memory. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was another time,\xe2\x80\x9d Kennedy said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen another young candidate was running for president and challenging America to cross a New Frontier.\xe2\x80\x9d But, he continued, another former Democratic president, Harry Truman, said he should have patience. He said he lacked experience. John Kennedy replied: \xe2\x80\x9cThe world is changing. The old ways will not do!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The audience at American University roared. It was mostly young people, and to them, the Clintons are as old as the Trumans were in 1960. And in the students\xe2\x80\x99 rapture for Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s message, you began to see the folding over of generations, the service generation of John and Robert Kennedy united with the service generation of the One Campaign. The grandparents and children united against the parents.'b'How could the septuagenarian Kennedy cast the younger Clintons into the past? He could do it because he evoked the New Frontier, which again seems fresh. He could do it because he himself has come to live a life of service.'b'After his callow youth, Kennedy came to realize that life would not give him the chance to be president. But life did ask him to be a senator, and he has embraced that role and served that institution with more distinction than anyone else now living \xe2\x80\x94 as any of his colleagues, Republican or Democrat, will tell you. And he could do it because culture really does have rhythms. The respect for institutions that was prevalent during the early \xe2\x80\x9960s is prevalent with the young again today. The earnest industriousness that was common then is back today. The awareness that we are not self-made individualists, free to be you and me, but emerge as parts of networks, webs and communities; that awareness is back again today.'b'Sept. 11th really did leave a residue \xe2\x80\x94 an unconsummated desire for sacrifice and service. The old Clintonian style of politics clashes with that desire. When Sidney Blumenthal expresses the Clinton creed by telling George Packer of The New Yorker, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a question of transcending partisanship. It\xe2\x80\x99s a question of fulfilling it,\xe2\x80\x9d that clashes with the desire as well.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not clear how far this altered public mood will carry Obama in this election. But there was something important and memorable about the way the 75-year-old Kennedy communed and bonded with a rapturous crowd half a century his junior.'b'The old guy stole the show.'b'On a quiet Wednesday morning last August, Senators Chris Dodd and Chuck Hagel held a news conference in Washington to discuss what they felt was a critical issue: the nation\xe2\x80\x99s deteriorating infrastructure.'b'The press was not impressed. Only a handful of reporters showed up to listen to their contention that a real crisis was at hand. That evening, during rush hour, the Interstate 35W bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis collapsed, plunging vehicles 60 feet into the river and killing 13 people.'b'There is usually not much about infrastructure stories to turn readers or viewers on. But the catastrophe in New Orleans and the bridge collapse in Minneapolis are tragic evidence of the peril that goes hand in hand with neglect of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s roads, bridges, levees, transit systems, water treatment facilities and so on.'b'Just two weeks before the Minneapolis bridge collapse, an underground steam pipe in Midtown Manhattan exploded, sending a geyser of filth and asbestos-laden debris into the air.

While it may be accepted wisdom that the American economy  has been in much better shape lately than it was in the past, the fact is that there are more Americans living in poverty today than during the last official recession in 2001.'b'Over the last seven years, nearly five million Americans slipped out of the middle class and into poverty; median household income for working-age Americans declined by nearly $2,500; 8.6 million Americans lost their health insurance; three million manufacturing jobs disappeared; and more than three million workers lost their pensions.'b'True, some of the richest Americans have not had it so good since the Roaring Twenties. But while the wealthiest .01 percent realized an average one-year increase in their income of $4.4 million from 2004-5, the bottom 90 percent of Americans saw their average income decline by $172.'b'While stock market gyrations have caused the White House and mainstream media to pay more attention to the economy lately, we must look beyond the canyons of Wall Street to the rest of America where 37 million Americans live in poverty; 47 million Americans lack health insurance, and 36 million Americans struggle to put food on the table.'b'The current economic crisis will not end when the stock market steadies itself if wages for regular people continue to fall and the middle class continues to shrink. Sadly, that is no mirage.'b'Bernie Sanders'b'\nU.S. Senator from Vermont'b'\nWashington, Jan. 24, 2008'b''b''b'Butte, Mont.'b'WE have all seen the pictures on television and in magazines of emaciated children looking at us with gaunt faces and empty eyes. The images are moving and disturbing, but if they do not lead to an effective response, they are used in vain.'b'Malnutrition can be fatal. Every year, it contributes to the death of five million children under the age of 5. But more of the same kind of food aid impoverished countries now receive will do nothing to reduce these deaths. We need to focus on the food quality, not just the quantity.'b'I recently spent a year running a nutritional program in Niger, where, along with other parts of Africa and South Asia, the most cases of childhood malnutrition are found. While there, I became convinced that large numbers of deaths among acutely malnourished children can be prevented by using an innovative nutrient-dense ready-to-use food that is revolutionizing the treatment and prevention of acute malnutrition. If we are to combat malnutrition, we must increase the use of this food and expand the range of products.'b'As any parent knows, children grow and develop at breakneck speed until age 3, and sound nutrition is vital to a healthy life. We nurture growth in our own children by providing a varied diet that contains milk (either through breast-feeding or formula), other dairy products and nutritious supplements \xe2\x80\x94 just think of the baby food choices available to families in any American supermarket.'b'For years, it has been difficult to deliver the nutrient value of milk in communities in Africa and Asia that do not produce or have the resources to buy milk. Without refrigeration and clean water, powdered milk and baby formula are prone to bacterial contamination and cause more harm than good.'b'Ten years ago, Andr\xc3\xa9 Briend, a French scientist, devised a paste of powdered milk, ground peanuts, oil, sugar, vitamins and minerals that solves the problems of preparation, storage and contamination because it is prepared without water. The paste, known as ready-to-use food, can be made locally; children can eat it directly from individual foil packets. More important, most children can be treated at home, rather than being hospitalized. This vastly increases  the number of children who can be reached. In Niger, I saw how ready-to-use food enabled thousands to recover from malnutrition.'b'In 2006, my colleagues at Doctors Without Borders and I treated more than 150,000 malnourished children worldwide \xe2\x80\x94 in Niger, more than 9 out of 10 recovered. But these numbers are a small fraction of those in need. Under United Nations and United States guidelines, only 3 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s 20 million malnourished children \xe2\x80\x94 those with the severest forms of malnutrition and the highest risk of death \xe2\x80\x94 have access to ready-to-use food.'b'These conditions are too limiting. Children shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to deteriorate to the point of severe malnutrition to \xe2\x80\x9cqualify\xe2\x80\x9d for ready-to-use food, which is far more nutritious than the fortified blended flours prescribed and supplied by the United States and other international donors for moderately malnourished children. Yes, ready-to-use food may cost more, but it provides the milk that fortified flours do not.'b'The United States is the largest single donor of food aid in the world, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t provide enough of what young children really need. As the farm bill progresses through Congress, there has been much debate on improving the delivery of food aid. But Congress must also address the quality of this aid.'b'If ready-to-use food is distributed more widely and replaces blended flours, fewer children will die of malnutrition. It\xe2\x80\x99s what the children staring at us in those harrowing images need and deserve.'b'AT  the suggestion of the federal Department of Homeland Security, New York City Council members have drafted legislation requiring anyone who has or uses a detector that measures chemical, biological or radioactive agents to get a license from the Police Department.'b'The purpose of the bill is to reduce unwarranted anxiety and damage from false alarms of terrorist attacks. Proponents say police officers need to know where detectors are and make sure they\xe2\x80\x99re reliable. But the bill, which appears to be the first of its kind in the country and a model for other cities, could stifle the collection of environmental information vital to the public good.'b'The problem is that the bill as written would cover all \xe2\x80\x9cenvironmental sensors,\xe2\x80\x9d and in the extreme interpretation even laboratory analyses, used by students, teachers, researchers, activists, unions and many other groups. Their work has far more to do with ecology, education, public health and worker safety than with terrorism. These sensors allow them to measure things like greenhouse gases in order to document air pollution.'b'There are many examples of nongovernmental groups collecting important environmental data based on laboratory analyses. Indeed, the original identification of PCB contamination of the Hudson River did not come from the government but from a study by Sports Illustrated magazine that included data on striped bass collected from the river by a private citizen, Robert H. Boyle.'b'When a steam pipe exploded in Midtown Manhattan last year, scientists were able to quickly allay fears that asbestos was in the air. In the wake of 9/11, private groups using both hand-held particle sensors and samples that were analyzed in laboratories enabled us to better understand the health risks of the disaster. Future environmental and public health research will rely increasingly on sensors that immediately measure contaminant levels.'b'The hassle of getting a license that the police could deny or delay on any grounds \xe2\x80\x94 or simply not have time to process \xe2\x80\x94 could hamper or stop the flow of environmental data. It certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a wise use of our tax dollars to have them spent on issuing permits for monitors that have nothing to do with identifying terrorist activities.'b'Reducing false alarms may be a worthy purpose, but pushing through this legislation without clearly defining standards and policies doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense. For example, the bill defines a biological agent as any microorganism or product of a microorganism that can cause \xe2\x80\x9cdeath, disease or other biological malfunction in a living organism, deterioration or poisoning of food or water, or deleterious alteration of the environment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Such biological agents flood into local waters when rain storms make sewers overflow. So, conceivably, a high school class wanting to measure the presence of fecal matter in river water would need a license. These definitions are simply too broad to be useful.'b'This bill relies upon judicious enforcement to counterbalance the all-encompassing language. Even though we believe that the current city administration would use the law rationally, once such a vaguely worded statute is passed, it opens the door for abuse. If it passes here, Homeland Security will probably use it as a model for other cities.'b'Since Sept. 11, 2001, the nation has looked to New York City on security issues. We must set the example. Restriction of environmental information is rarely in the public\xe2\x80\x99s interest. The ability of scientists and citizens to gather data quickly and efficiently should be fostered, not suppressed.'b'The City Council should seek more public input and take its time in refining this legislation. It should expand the definition of detectors into different classes and make it clear that the legislation is applicable only to the class of real-time detectors that measure biological, chemical and radiological agents that would pose a danger to the public from terrorist activities or weapons of mass destruction. All other types of detectors should be exempted.'b'Indeed, one could consider not having any permits at all, even for those designed to detect terrorist attacks. And instead the legislation should focus on reporting procedures that would keep false alarms from snowballing into panic. That, after all, is what proponents say the purpose is.'b'In recent decades, and to much public acclaim, Congress passed a series of landmark laws designed to ensure equal rights for all Americans. Lately, and without much notice, the 'b'Supreme Court'b' has been gutting them.'b'Senator 'b'Edward Kennedy'b', Democrat of Massachusetts, has introduced a pair of bills designed to undo the damage done by the court\xe2\x80\x99s badly reasoned decisions. Congress should pass both without delay.'b'One of the most troubling rulings was in the case of Lilly Ledbetter, a supervisor at a Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company plant who was paid less than her male colleagues after she was given smaller raises over several years. The court\xe2\x80\x99s conservative majority ruled that Ms. Ledbetter had not met the 180-day deadline to file her complaint. It insisted that the 180 days ran from the day the company had made the original decision to give her a smaller raise than the men.'b'The ruling made no sense, since Ms. Ledbetter was being discriminated against when she made her complaint. As a practical matter, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted in a strongly worded dissent, it would have been exceptionally difficult for Ms. Ledbetter to complain when she was first given a lower raise than the male supervisors because Goodyear, like many employers, kept salaries and raises confidential.'b'The Fair Pay Restoration Act, one of Senator Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s bills, would undo the injustice of the Ledbetter decision by establishing that the 180-day deadline runs from when a worker receives the unequal pay, not when the employer decided to discriminate. It would make clear that each discriminatory paycheck restarts the clock.'b'Mr. Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s other bill, the Civil Rights Act of 2008, would reverse more bad decisions. One of these is a 2001 ruling that says that people who are discriminated against in programs using federal funds can sue only for intentional discrimination, not for actions that have a discriminatory effect. This decision dramatically scaled back protections against discrimination of all kinds.'b'The civil rights bill would also strengthen age discrimination laws, which the court has repeatedly and shamefully weakened. It would make clear that, contrary to the court\xe2\x80\x99s recent interpretation, federal law barring age discrimination requires the same standard of proof as cases of race, gender and other forms of discrimination. Another provision of the bill would give students in schools that receive federal funds greater protection against harassment.'b'In the House of Representatives, John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, has introduced a companion bill to the Senate civil rights bill. The House has already passed its own version of the fair pay law.'b'Conservatives like to say that the court\xe2\x80\x99s conservative justices believe in applying the law, not making it. But in recent years, the court\xe2\x80\x99s majority has been reading federal anti-discrimination laws far more narrowly than Congress intended \xe2\x80\x94 not applying the law, but unmaking it.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cThe State of the Union\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 29):'b'Because my spirits reached a low point after having watched President Bush ramble on for nearly an hour in an attempt to put a positive glow on his years as president, I needed someone to verify whether my negative feelings were a result of contrariness or whether they had merit.

More than any of his predecessors, the current chief executive has used the pronouncements in a passive-aggressive way to undermine the power of Congress.'b'Over the last seven years, Mr. Bush has issued hundreds of these insidious documents declaring that he had no intention of obeying a law that he had just signed. This is not just constitutional theory. Remember the detainee treatment act, which Mr. Bush signed and then proceeded to ignore, as he told C.I.A. interrogators that they could go on mistreating detainees?'b'This week\xe2\x80\x99s statement was attached to the military budget bill, which covers everything except the direct cost of the war. The bill included four important provisions that Mr. Bush decided he will enforce only if he wants to.'b'The president said they impinged on his constitutional powers. We asked the White House to explain that claim, but got no answer, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll do our best to figure it out.'b'The first provision created a commission to determine how reliant the government is on contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan, how much waste, fraud and abuse has occurred and what has been done to hold accountable those who are responsible. Congress authorized the commission to compel government officials to testify.'b'Perhaps this violated Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s sense of his power to dole out contracts as he sees fit and to hold contractors harmless. The same theory applies to the second provision that Mr. Bush said he would not obey: a new law providing protection against reprisal to those who expose waste, fraud or abuse in wartime contracts.'b'The third measure Mr. Bush rejected requires intelligence officials to respond to a request for documents from the Armed Services Committees of Congress within 45 days, either by producing the documents or explaining why they are being withheld. Clearly, this violates the power that Mr. Bush has given himself to cover up an array of illegal and improper actions, like his decisions to spy on Americans without a warrant, to torture prisoners in violation of the Geneva Conventions and to fire United States attorneys apparently for political reasons.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s glaringly obvious why Mr. Bush rejected the fourth provision, which states that none of the money authorized for military purposes may be used to establish permanent military bases in Iraq.'b'It is more evidence, as if any were needed, that Mr. Bush never intended to end this war, and that he still views it as the prelude to an unceasing American military presence in Iraq.'b'The Senate Finance Committee is set to produce an economic stimulus bill that, on balance, improves on the bill passed by the House on Tuesday. Among other things, the Senate version would extend unemployment benefits as needed for laid-off workers.'b'Extensions are one of the best ways to give an economic shot in the arm. And yet, in his speech on Monday, President Bush warned that changes to the House bill could derail the stimulus effort. Welcome to Washington, where even in the face of impending recession, the needs of ordinary Americans can take a back seat to ideology.'b'There are two ways to do fiscal stimulus: direct government spending, like extending unemployment benefits, bolstering food stamps and providing more aid to state governments; and tax cuts, generally rebates to individuals and tax breaks for businesses. Measure for measure, direct spending always gives a faster, bigger result than tax cuts. Among the tax options, rebates targeted to low-  and middle-income people are far more effective than business tax breaks.'b'For Mr. Bush and many Republicans, however, tax cuts are always the answer. So the House bill, produced in negotiations between the White House and House leaders, eschews direct government aid. Instead, it provides tax rebates for lower-  to upper-middle income Americans while excluding high-income earners, as demanded by Democrats, and tax breaks for business favored by Republicans. That ideological balance is not the best possible deal for everyday Americans.'b'The Senate proposal is not perfect, but it\xe2\x80\x99s better. In addition to extending jobless benefits, it would send larger rebates to more lower-income people. The Senate rebate would also go to rich Americans, who don\xe2\x80\x99t need it. That would be poor stimulus, but it should make the plan politically palatable to Republicans who reflexively demand tax cuts for the rich. The Senate proposal includes roughly the same business tax breaks as the House bill.'b'The House deserves credit for passing a stimulus bill speedily, and the Senate does, too, for quickly improving on the effort. Senate leaders must now steer the proposal toward a vote, expected as early as Thursday, without letting the bill become bloated. Then, lawmakers can come together to create a worthy final bill for Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s signature.'b'Look into the eyes of 'b'Vladimir Putin'b', the president of Russia, and what you see is a K.G.B.-trained mind that apparently cannot tolerate leaving any detail of an election to chance.'b'What else could explain the latest ugly twist in Russia\xe2\x80\x99s rigged presidential election: the forced withdrawal of former Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov for allegedly invalid signatures on his nominating petitions?'b'Most people who manipulate elections usually try to pretend otherwise. Mr. Putin does not even bother. Even though he, or a chosen proxy, could easily have won a fair election, he was not about to take the chance.'b'Critics and potential rivals now understand that if they challenge him they face legal harassment and perhaps even physical danger. Independent news outlets have been systematically stifled.'b'The results were evident in last month\xe2\x80\x99s parliamentary elections, judged to be far from free and fair by European monitors. Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s party claimed it won nearly two-thirds of the vote.'b'There has never been any doubt that Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s designated successor, 'b'Dmitri Medvedev'b', would win the March 2 presidential election. And the loyal Mr. Medvedev has already promised to name Mr. Putin as his prime minister. As further insurance, a campaign of official harassment drove the leading democratic challenger, Garry Kasparov, out of the presidential race.'b'A more pragmatic autocrat might have stopped there. The unthreatening candidacy of Mr. Kasyanov, like that of the three other remaining candidates, served only to add a little democratic gloss to this electoral travesty.'b'Western leaders have long been tempted to make excuses for Mr. Putin.

The national average for all wages rose by about 18 percent.'b'That, Chief Justice Roberts notes, \xe2\x80\x9chas left federal trial judges \xe2\x80\x94 the backbone of our system of justice \xe2\x80\x94 earning about the same as (and in some cases less than) first-year lawyers at firms in major cities, where many of the judges are located.\xe2\x80\x9d Federal judges\xe2\x80\x99 salaries also lag well behind many law school deans, senior law professors and even senior government lawyers.'b'In December, the House Judiciary Committee approved, by an overwhelming 28-5 vote, a bill that would raise the pay of federal trial judges to $218,000 a year, with comparable raises for other judges. That may seem too much, especially given the current economic downturn, and a smaller increase might be easier politically. But judges have been losing ground on pay for so many years that, in fairness, the large increase is more a salary restoration than a raise.'b'In exchange for the increase, Americans are entitled to an improvement in ethical standards. Senator Russ Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, is right to propose strict curbs on the expense-paid junkets financed by private interests with business before the courts. Justified as educational \xe2\x80\x9cseminars,\xe2\x80\x9d these freebies have soiled the court system\xe2\x80\x99s reputation. Sadly, the judiciary has shown itself incapable of effective self-policing.'b'In a presidential campaign that has involved battles over everything from Iraq to driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses, one sweeping topic has gone curiously unexamined: Does it diminish American democracy if we keep the presidency in the same two families that have held it since 1989?'b'If Hillary Rodham Clinton serves two terms, then for 28 years the presidency will have been held by a Bush or a Clinton. By that point, about 40 percent of Americans would have lived their entire lives under a president from one of these two families.'b'Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that make our democracy seem a little, er, Pakistani?'b'Naturally, views on this are influenced by politics. Clintonians who dismissed George W. Bush as a dynastic puppet see nothing wrong with another Clinton in the Oval Office. On the other hand, Obama fans who shiver at the prospect of a Clinton dynasty bask in endorsements from an even greater dynasty, that of the Kennedys.'b'Granted, nobody should be barred from the presidency because of his or her family connections. Franklin Roosevelt was an excellent president even though he certainly enjoyed a leg up because of his association with his distant cousin, Teddy Roosevelt. Yet shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t there be a presumption against family members of former presidents  \xe2\x80\x94  albeit a presumption that can be overcome if it were, say, Bobby Kennedy against Richard Nixon?'b'We Americans snicker patronizingly as \xe2\x80\x9cdemocratic\xe2\x80\x9d Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Singapore, India and Argentina hand over power to a wife or child of a former leader. Yet I can\xe2\x80\x99t find any example of even the most rinky-dink \xe2\x80\x9cdemocracy\xe2\x80\x9d confining power continuously for seven terms over 28 years to four people from two families.

We should evaluate candidates on their own merits and not drag in their families. We punish ourselves if we spurn the best person because of his or her family background.'b''b'Yet we have faced this trade-off frequently over the last 215 years and regularly inclined on the side of fresh blood. In 1796, George Washington\xe2\x80\x99s skill and popular mandate seemed invaluable at a perilous time in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s infancy. Yet we overwhelmingly believe that it was good for American democracy that he stepped down after two terms.'b'As Thomas Jefferson put it: \xe2\x80\x9cin no office can rotation be more expedient\xe2\x80\x9d than in the presidency.'b'We remember John Quincy Adams as intelligent and diligent, but his presidency is diminished by the hint of dynastic succession and is seen as emblematic of a parochial time when America was ruled by an incestuous elite. Some day, I suspect we may detect the same narrowness in the rise of the Bush Dynasty and, if there is one, in the Clinton Dynasty.'b'We added the 22nd Amendment, limiting presidents to two terms, on the rationale that levers of power should turn over to keep our democracy healthy. Many Democrats today would consider Bill Clinton intrinsically the best person to serve as president for the next eight years. And yet, even if there weren\xe2\x80\x99t a 22nd Amendment, we would shy away from that; we prefer the risk of an unproven president to the risk of stasis and aristocracy.'b'A tongue-in-cheek Web site called Bush-Clinton Forever is already proposing Jeb Bush in 2017, Chelsea Clinton in 2025, Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s son George P.

She has an utter mastery of domestic and foreign policy, and among the Democrats she knows military and security issues in particular better than anyone else. And if the concern is to bring in fresh currents into the political system, what better way than electing a woman president?'b'Certainly, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to see why voters nostalgic for peace and prosperity might yearn for a Clinton Restoration. Maybe we want another political dynasty, but we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t back into one without discussion  \xe2\x80\x94 again.'b'When she is asked about the propriety of keeping the White House so long in the hands of two families, Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s standard response is that she agrees ... that it was a mistake to elect President Bush in 2000.'b'Mrs. Clinton has proven herself an excellent senator, and presumably would make a superior president.

You cannot run a campaign with the slogan: \xe2\x80\x9cVote for Hillary  \xe2\x80\x94  Think of All She\xe2\x80\x99s Been Through.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And while it seems unlikely, Barack might consider admitting once in a while that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible for a person to reach for a greater tomorrow while voting for somebody else.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about the past versus the future,\xe2\x80\x9d he said yesterday, railing at some people (no names were mentioned, but we\xe2\x80\x99re really running out of alternatives) who are willing to settle for small change, who \xe2\x80\x9clook backwards and try to build a bridge back to the 20th century.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'See, that is the sort of thing that makes Hillary voters depressed. Everybody wants to be a change agent. But Barack is making Clintonites feel like an elderly aunt who won\xe2\x80\x99t let the kids play their newfangled music in the talent show.'b'In Colorado yesterday, Caroline Kennedy once again passed the torch to a new generation at an Obama rally that drew an estimated 18,000 people to the University of Denver arena, an overflow room and an overflow overflow room. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s give a shout-out to all the folks who are still outside on the lacrosse field,\xe2\x80\x9d Barack urged the early birds who made it into the actual event.'b'The Kennedy-Obama connection is central to the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s message, which is that the American people have been wandering in the desert for more than a generation, waiting for another leader who could show them how to reach for the stars. But J.F.K.\xe2\x80\x99s grand achievement was the raising of expectations, not the follow-through. His administration was a decidedly mixed bag, during which people spent a great deal of time building nuclear fallout shelters.'b'Some of the Democratic resistance to Obama\xe2\x80\x99s magic comes from people who are wary of politicians who want to win their hearts. Every great candidate has golden moments when the campaign merges perfectly into the zeitgeist of the people. But sooner or later it passes, and you\xe2\x80\x99re left with a tired, flawed human being making a pitch to crowds of slightly deflated citizens. One of Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s selling points is that we\xe2\x80\x99re pre-deflated. We\xe2\x80\x99ve known her so well for so long.'b'The Obama let-down would be way harder to handle. Earlier this week, his campaign visited Barack\xe2\x80\x99s sort-of ancestral home in El Dorado, Kan., a small town outside Wichita where the community college gym was rocking.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAn hour-and-a-half wait. It was well worth it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hardy Stegall of nearby Pretty Prairie.'b'It was Obama\xe2\x80\x99s first visit. His grandparents, the Dunhams, kept chasing the American dream west until they wound up in Hawaii. Stanley Dunham started out in El Dorado, where he managed a furniture store and, family legend has it, once decked the high school principal. At the rally, Obama told the story of how Stanley married a young woman from the right side of the tracks and how their daughter  married a man from Kenya, who left her a young single mother whose son is running for president.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTheir journey, like so many others, speaks to a simple truth ... the future is what we decide it is going to be,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI never thought he\xe2\x80\x99d come here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stegall, almost beside himself with pleasure.'b'And to tell the truth, I never imagined sitting in a gym in small-town Kansas, watching people whoop for a black, Hawaii-born, grandson-of-a-son of the Kansas soil who promised to bring their hometown values with him to the White House.'b'We may remember this as a great campaign, people. Presuming they don\xe2\x80\x99t screw it up.'b'Whether or not the Federal Reserve\xe2\x80\x99s recent dramatic interest rate cuts are the right medicine for today\xe2\x80\x99s stalling economy \xe2\x80\x94 and the jury is very much out on that \xe2\x80\x94 it is clear that the Fed has used up a big chunk of its recession-fighting ammunition in a very short span of time. In just over a week, it has slashed its benchmark interest rate by a total of 1.25 percentage points, to 3 percent. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t leave a lot of room to cut further without opening the door to a potentially nasty upsurge in prices, which are already rising at a worrisome rate, and a possible disorderly decline in the dollar.'b'For now, however, the Fed has obviously concluded (and we hope it\xe2\x80\x99s right) that it\xe2\x80\x99s more important to try to mitigate current conditions than to worry about hypothetical concerns. Economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2007 slowed to a barely perceptible 0.6 percent. Housing is already in a recession, and manufacturing is headed down. Foreclosures are rising. Lending is constrained. Consumers are pulling back in the face of job uncertainty and a reduced ability to borrow against their homes.'b'The next employment report, due Friday, will provide more evidence of the extent to which jobs and paychecks \xe2\x80\x94 the linchpins of Americans\xe2\x80\x99 economic well-being \xe2\x80\x94 are at risk. Last month\xe2\x80\x99s report was grim: Employment in the private sector contracted and the ranks of the unemployed swelled.'b'With so much going wrong, even aggressive rate cuts are unlikely to turn things around anytime soon. Lower rates won\xe2\x80\x99t loosen lending as long as lenders are preoccupied with mounting losses on securities and existing loans and fearful of more to come. Anxious, debt-burdened and unemployed consumers are unlikely to spend freely.'b'In short, no matter what the Fed does, it will take time, certainly a period of retrenchment, and quite likely of recession, to work off the excesses of the bubble years. That means foreclosures and financial ruin for some, joblessness and belt-tightening for others and less vibrant and less viable communities for many.'b'The damage, now becoming apparent, demands that policy makers take stock of how the economy arrived at this place. The bubbles in housing and mortgages would not have been possible were it not for the progressive deterioration in regulation over the past several decades, culminating for all practical purposes in a  regulatory collapse during the Bush years. The antiregulatory ethos, in turn, derived its potency from a pervasive ideology that markets are self-regulating and self-correcting and therefore best handled with incentives and voluntary best practices, rather than rules and boundaries.'b'The task of reinforcing the regulatory apparatus of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s economy is as formidable a challenge as managing the downturn, and ultimately of more lasting importance.'b'To the Editor:'b'In \xe2\x80\x9cChina\xe2\x80\x99s Genocide Olympics\xe2\x80\x9d (column, Jan. 24), Nicholas D.

Powell testified about the genocide in Darfur? The suspicion is inescapable that Western governments\xe2\x80\x99 evasion of responsibility will only be abetted by efforts to channel public outrage into such ultimately futile gestures as placard-waving and armband-wearing at next summer\xe2\x80\x99s Beijing Games.'b'Worse, in the event that China\xe2\x80\x99s government did bring pressure to bear to stop the violence in Darfur before the Olympics, who can doubt that the killing would resume as soon as the athletes left Beijing and the world\xe2\x80\x99s attention had turned elsewhere?'b'Popular campaigns to \xe2\x80\x9cshame\xe2\x80\x9d China give comfort to the United States, NATO and other governments that have done little or nothing to back up with action their oft-professed concern for the people of Darfur.'b'Until the American public demands an end to the games in Washington, it will be hypocritical and counterproductive to target the Beijing Olympics.'b'Martin Daly'b'Waterville, Me., Jan. 24, 2008'b''b'The writer is the author of a book about the history of the Darfur genocide.'b''b'Chicago'b'THE House of Representatives passed a bill on Tuesday that would try to stimulate the economy, in part, by sending  \xe2\x80\x9ctax rebates\xe2\x80\x9d to more than 100 million families. The logic of a tax rebate is that people will spend more money if they have more to spend. Unfortunately, psychology may interfere with that logic.'b'Research on decision-making demonstrates that describing a financial windfall as a \xe2\x80\x9crebate\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 instead of something equally accurate \xe2\x80\x94 increases the likelihood that people will save it. If Congress and President Bush want to increase consumer spending, they should have pitched these $600 and $1,200 checks as \xe2\x80\x9ctax bonuses\xe2\x80\x9d instead.'b'Changing the way that  identical income is described can  significantly affect how people  spend it. In an experiment I conducted at Harvard with my colleagues Dennis Mak and Lorraine Chen Idson, participants were  given a $50 check. They were told that this money came from a faculty member\xe2\x80\x99s research budget, financed  indirectly through tuition dollars. Roughly half of the participants had this money described as a \xe2\x80\x9crebate,\xe2\x80\x9d whereas the others had it described as a \xe2\x80\x9cbonus.\xe2\x80\x9d When unexpectedly contacted one week later, participants who got  a \xe2\x80\x9crebate\xe2\x80\x9d  reported spending less than half of what those who got  a \xe2\x80\x9cbonus\xe2\x80\x9d  reported spending ($9.55 versus $22.04, respectively).'b'We observed this same pattern in other experiments when participants were asked to keep a written record of their spending, as well as in experiments in which the participants were allowed to purchase items in the lab. \xe2\x80\x9cRebates\xe2\x80\x9d are understood to be returns from money already spent. A rebate, psychologically speaking, is the return of a loss of one\xe2\x80\x99s own money rather than a pure gain provided by someone else, so it is unlikely to be seen as extra spending money.'b'Getting a rebate is more like being reimbursed for travel expenses than like getting a year-end bonus. Reimbursements send people on trips to the bank. Bonuses send people on trips to the Bahamas.'b'This is more than merely a matter of political spin. Decisions depend very heavily on how people\xe2\x80\x99s options are described.'b'People are more willing to treat 600 people infected with a deadly virus when they are told the treatment will save 200 of those lives, than when they are told that it will kill 400 of them. People are more likely to donate to a charity when the cost is described in terms of pennies per day instead of dollars per year. And more people say they could live on 80 percent of their income than say that they could save 20 percent of their income.'b'Descriptions are the psychological equivalent of a camera lens. Psychologists use the term \xe2\x80\x9cframing effects\xe2\x80\x9d to describe their influence. An investment banker who is delighted by saving $5 on a pair of shoes but disgusted by receiving $1,000 for a year-end bonus has experienced the power of framing effects.'b'If the current proposal for tax rebates sounds familiar, it\xe2\x80\x99s because we have indeed been here before. In 2001, Congress and President Bush returned $38 billion to taxpayers in the form of $300 to $600 tax rebates, with the hope that Americans  would stimulate the economy by spending them. But research conducted by two University of Michigan economists, Matthew Shapiro and Joel Slemrod,  found that only 28 percent of the people in a national survey reported that they spent most of their rebate checks soon after receiving them. In a country where the personal savings rate has become negative by some accounts, people seem remarkably able to save at the very time their government needs them to spend.'b'In another experiment my colleagues and I conducted, taxpayers asked to recall the 2001 tax rebate reported that it seemed more like \xe2\x80\x9cextra income\xe2\x80\x9d when researchers described it as a tax bonus but more like \xe2\x80\x9creturned income\xe2\x80\x9d when it was described as a tax rebate.'b'This is exactly the kind of difference in perceptions that would increase spending of bonuses relative to rebates. Describing the checks as rebates highlights that this is simply one\xe2\x80\x99s own money being returned. A bonus, however, is extra cash to be spent.'b'Under the House plan, the checks that would arrive in people\xe2\x80\x99s mailboxes would go to those who pay the least income taxes, or even pay no income tax at all. Saying the checks are bonuses \xe2\x80\x94 or anything else that would call to mind thoughts of receiving a gift rather than getting a reimbursement \xe2\x80\x94 may not only be a more effective description for this stimulus package, but it may also be more accurate.'b'A hamburger can be described as 10 percent fat, but you had better call it 90 percent lean if you want your dinner guests to eat it. Politicians are thought to be expert spin doctors, able to choose  the right words to fit any occasion, but they do not seem to be paying  attention to how to  sell the stimulus package so that  consumers  spend with patriotic abandon.'
