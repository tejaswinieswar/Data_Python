b'Christchurch, New Zealand'b'IT seems so distant, 1999. Bill Clinton had survived impeachment, his popularity hardly dented, Sept. 11 was just another date and music fans were enjoying a young singer named Britney Spears.'b'But there was a particular unease in the air. The so-called Y2K problem, the inability of computers to read dates beyond 1999 threatened to turn Jan. 1, 2000 into a nightmare. The issue had first been noticed by programmers in the 1950s, but had been ignored. As the turn of the century loomed, though, it seemed that humankind faced a litany of horrors.'b'Haywire navigation controls might cause aircraft to fall from the skies. Electricity grids, water systems and telephone networks would be knocked out, while nuclear power plants would be subject to meltdown. Savings and pension accounts would be wiped out in a general bank failure. A cascade of breakdowns in communication and commerce would create vast shortages of food and medicine, which would, in turn, produce riots, lawlessness and social collapse. Even worse, ICBMs might rise from their silos unbidden, spreading death across the globe.'b'Y2K problems would not be limited to mainframe computers that governed the information systems of the modern world, but were going to affect millions of tiny computer chips found everywhere. Thanks to these wonky microprocessors, elevators would die, G.P.S. devices would stop working and dishwashers would dry the food onto the plates before trying to rinse it off. Even ordinary cars might spontaneously accelerate to fatal, uncontrollable speeds, with brakes failing to respond.'b'The Y2K catastrophe was promoted with increasing shrillness toward century\xe2\x80\x99s end: headlines proclaimed a \xe2\x80\x9ccomputer time bomb\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ca date with disaster.\xe2\x80\x9d Vanity Fair\xe2\x80\x99s January 1999 article \xe2\x80\x9cThe Y2K Nightmare\xe2\x80\x9d caught the sensationalist tone, claiming that \xe2\x80\x9cfolly, greed and denial\xe2\x80\x9d had \xe2\x80\x9cmuffled two decades of warnings from technology experts.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Among the most reviled of the Y2K deniers was Bill Gates, who not only declared that Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s PCs would take the date turnover in stride, but had the audacity to blame those who \xe2\x80\x9clove to tell tales of fear\xe2\x80\x9d for the worldwide anxiety. Mr. Gates\xe2\x80\x99s denialism was ignored as governments and corporations set in place immensely expensive schemes to immunize systems against the Y2K bug.'b'They weren\xe2\x80\x99t the only ones keen to get in on the end-time spirit. The Rev. Jerry Falwell suggested that Y2K would be the confirmation of Christian prophecy, \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s instrument to shake this nation, to humble this nation.\xe2\x80\x9d The Y2K crisis might incite a worldwide revival that would lead to \xe2\x80\x9cthe rapture of the church.\xe2\x80\x9d Along with many survivalists, Mr. Falwell advised stocking up on food and guns.'b'So the scene was set here in New Zealand for midnight on Dec. 31, 1999. We are just west of the dateline, and thus would be the first to experience not only popping Champagne corks and fireworks, but the Y2K catastrophe, if any. As clocks hit midnight, Champagne and skyrockets were the only explosions of interest, since telephones, ATMs, cars, computers and airplanes worked just fine. The head of the government\xe2\x80\x99s Y2K Readiness Commission declared victory: \xe2\x80\x9cNew Zealand\xe2\x80\x99s investment in planning and preparation has paid off.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Confident that our millions were well spent, we waited for news of the calamities sure to hit countries that had ignored Y2K. Asia, a Deutsche Bank official had predicted, was going to be \xe2\x80\x9cburnt toast\xe2\x80\x9d on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day \xe2\x80\x94 not just the lesser-developed areas of Vietnam and China, but South Korea, which by 1999 was a highly computer-dependent society. South Korea, one computer expert told me, had a national telephone system similar to British Telecom\xe2\x80\x99s. But where the British had wisely sunk millions of pounds into Y2K remediation, South Korea had done next to nothing.'b'However, exactly 10 years ago today, as the date change moved on through the Far East, India, Russia, the Middle East and Europe, it became apparent that it made little difference whether you lived in Britain, which at great expense had revamped many of its computer systems, or the lackadaisical Ukraine, which had ignored the issue.'b'With minor glitches that would have gone unnoticed any other day of the week, the world kept ticking on. It must have been galling for computer-conscientious Germans to observe how life continued its pleasurable path for feckless Italians, who had generally paid no attention to Y2K. There were problems, to be sure: in Australia, a bus-ticket machine stamped the wrong date, while in Britain a tide gauge in Portsmouth Harbor failed. Still, the South Korean phone system came through unscathed.'b'By the time midnight reached the United States, where upward of $100 billion had been spent on Y2K fixes, there was little anxiety. Indeed, the general health of American information systems, fixed and not, became clearer in the new year. The Small Business Administration calculated that 1.5 million businesses had undertaken no Y2K remediation. On Jan. 3, it received about 40 phone calls from businesses that had experienced minor faults, like cash registers that misread the year \xe2\x80\x9c2000\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c1900\xe2\x80\x9d (which seemed everywhere the single most common error caused by Y2K).'b'KNOWING our computers is difficult enough. Harder still is to know ourselves, including our inner demons. From today\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, the Y2K fiasco seems to be less about technology than about a morbid fascination with end-of-the-world scenarios. This ought to strike us as strange. The cold war was fading in 1999, we were witnessing a worldwide growth in wealth and standards of living, and Islamic terrorism was not yet seen as a serious global threat. It should have been a year of golden weather, a time for the human race to relax and look toward a brighter, more peaceful future. Instead, with computers as a flimsy pretext, many seemed to take pleasure in frightening themselves to death over a coming calamity.'b'No doubt part of the blame must go to those consultants who took businesses and governments for an expensive ride in the lead-up to New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day. But doom-laden exaggerations about Y2K fell on ears that were all-too receptive. The Y2K fiasco was about more than simple prudence.'b'Religions from Zoroastrianism to Judaism to Christianity to U.F.O. cults have been built around notions of sin and the world\xe2\x80\x99s end. The Y2K threat resonated with those ideas. Human beings have constructed an enormous, wasteful, unnatural civilization, filled with sin \xe2\x80\x94 or, worse in some minds, pollution and environmental waste. Suppose it turned out that a couple of zeros inadvertently left off old computer codes brought crashing down the very civilization computers helped to create. Cosmic justice!'b'The theme of our fancy inventions ultimately destroying us has been a favorite in fiction at least since Mary Shelley\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cFrankenstein.\xe2\x80\x9d We can place alongside this a continuous succession of spectacular films built on visions of the end of the world. Such end-time fantasies must have a profound, persistent appeal in order to keep drawing wide-eyed crowds into movie theaters, as historically they have drawn crowds into churches, year after year.'b'Apocalyptic scenarios are a diversion from real problems \xe2\x80\x94 poverty, terrorism, broken financial systems \xe2\x80\x94  needing intelligent attention. Even something as down-to-earth as the swine-flu scare has seemed at moments to be less about testing our health care system and its emergency readiness than about the fate of a diseased civilization drowning in its own fluids. We wallow in the idea that one day everything might change in, as St. Paul put it, the \xe2\x80\x9ctwinkling of an eye\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 that a calamity might prove to be the longed-for transformation. But turning practical problems into cosmic cataclysms takes us further away from actual solutions.'b'This applies, in my view, to the towering seas, storms, droughts and mass extinctions of popular climate catastrophism. Such entertaining visions owe less to scientific climatology than to eschatology, and that familiar sense that modernity and its wasteful comforts are bringing us closer to a biblical day of judgment. As that headline put it for Y2K, predictions of the end of the world are often intertwined with condemnations of human \xe2\x80\x9cfolly, greed and denial.\xe2\x80\x9d Repent and recycle!'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s the season when pundits traditionally make predictions about the year ahead. Mine concerns international economics: I predict that 2010 will be the year of China. And not in a good way.'b'Actually, the biggest problems with China involve climate change. But today I want to focus on currency policy.'b'China has become a major financial and trade power. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t act like other big economies. Instead, it follows a mercantilist policy, keeping its trade surplus artificially high. And in today\xe2\x80\x99s depressed world, that policy is, to put it bluntly, predatory.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s how it works: Unlike the dollar, the euro or the yen, whose values fluctuate freely, China\xe2\x80\x99s currency is pegged by official policy at about 6.8 yuan to the dollar. At this exchange rate, Chinese manufacturing has a large cost advantage over its rivals, leading to huge trade surpluses.'b'Under normal circumstances, the inflow of dollars from those surpluses would push up the value of China\xe2\x80\x99s currency, unless it was offset by private investors heading the other way. And private investors are trying to get into China, not out of it. But China\xe2\x80\x99s government restricts capital inflows, even as it buys up dollars and parks them abroad, adding to a $2 trillion-plus hoard of foreign exchange reserves.'b'This policy is good for China\xe2\x80\x99s export-oriented state-industrial complex, not so good for Chinese consumers. But what about the rest of us?'b'In the past, China\xe2\x80\x99s accumulation of foreign reserves, many of which were invested in American bonds, was arguably doing us a favor by keeping interest rates low  \xe2\x80\x94  although what we did with those low interest rates was mainly to inflate a housing bubble. But right now the world is awash in cheap money, looking for someplace to go. Short-term interest rates are close to zero; long-term interest rates are higher, but only because investors expect the zero-rate policy to end some day. China\xe2\x80\x99s bond purchases make little or no difference.'b'Meanwhile, that trade surplus drains much-needed demand away from a depressed world economy. My back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that for the next couple of years Chinese mercantilism may end up reducing U.S. employment by around 1.4 million jobs.'b'The Chinese refuse to acknowledge the problem. Recently Wen Jiabao, the prime minister, dismissed foreign complaints: \xe2\x80\x9cOn one hand, you are asking for the yuan to appreciate, and on the other hand, you are taking all kinds of protectionist measures.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed: other countries are taking (modest) protectionist measures precisely because China refuses to let its currency rise. And more such measures are entirely appropriate.'b'Or are they? I usually hear two reasons for not confronting China over its policies. Neither holds water.'b'First, there\xe2\x80\x99s the claim that we can\xe2\x80\x99t confront the Chinese because they would wreak havoc with the U.S. economy by dumping their hoard of dollars. This is all wrong, and not just because in so doing the Chinese would inflict large losses on themselves. The larger point is that the same forces that make Chinese mercantilism so damaging right now also mean that China has little or no financial leverage.'b'Again, right now the world is awash in cheap money. So if China were to start selling dollars, there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to think it would significantly raise U.S. interest rates. It would probably weaken the dollar against other currencies  \xe2\x80\x94  but that would be good, not bad, for U.S. competitiveness and employment. So if the Chinese do dump dollars, we should send them a thank-you note.'b'Second, there\xe2\x80\x99s the claim that protectionism is always a bad thing, in any circumstances. If that\xe2\x80\x99s what you believe, however, you learned Econ 101 from the wrong people  \xe2\x80\x94  because when unemployment is high and the government can\xe2\x80\x99t restore full employment, the usual rules don\xe2\x80\x99t apply.'b'Let me quote from a classic paper by the late Paul Samuelson, who more or less created modern economics: \xe2\x80\x9cWith employment less than full ... all the debunked mercantilistic arguments\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x94  that is, claims that nations who subsidize their exports effectively steal jobs from other countries  \xe2\x80\x94  \xe2\x80\x9cturn out to be valid.\xe2\x80\x9d He then went on to argue that persistently misaligned exchange rates create \xe2\x80\x9cgenuine problems for free-trade apologetics.\xe2\x80\x9d The best answer to these problems is getting exchange rates back to where they ought to be. But that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what China is refusing to let happen.'b'The bottom line is that Chinese mercantilism is a growing problem, and the victims of that mercantilism have little to lose from a trade confrontation. So I\xe2\x80\x99d urge China\xe2\x80\x99s government to reconsider its stubbornness. Otherwise, the very mild protectionism it\xe2\x80\x99s currently complaining about will be the start of something much bigger.'b'During the middle third of the 20th century, Americans had impressive faith in their own institutions. It was not because these institutions always worked well. The Congress and the Federal Reserve exacerbated the Great Depression. The military made horrific mistakes during World War II, which led to American planes bombing American troops and American torpedoes sinking ships with American prisoners of war.'b'But there was a realistic sense that human institutions are necessarily flawed. History is not knowable or controllable. People should be grateful for whatever assistance that government can provide and had better do what they can to be responsible for their own fates.'b'That mature attitude seems to have largely vanished. Now we seem to expect perfection from government and then throw temper tantrums when it is not achieved. We seem to be in the position of young adolescents \xe2\x80\x94 who believe mommy and daddy can take care of everything, and then grow angry and cynical when it becomes clear they can\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'After Sept. 11, we Americans indulged our faith in the god of technocracy. We expanded the country\xe2\x80\x99s information-gathering capacities so that the National Security Agency alone now gathers four times more data each day than is contained in the Library of Congress.'b'We set up protocols to convert that information into a form that can be processed by computers and bureaucracies. We linked agencies and created new offices. We set up a centralized focal point, the National Counterterrorism Center.'b'All this money and technology seems to have reduced the risk of future attack. But, of course, the system is bound to fail sometimes. Reality is unpredictable, and no amount of computer technology is going to change that. Bureaucracies are always blind because they convert the rich flow of personalities and events into crude notations that can be filed and collated. Human institutions are always going to miss crucial clues because the information in the universe is infinite and events do not conform to algorithmic regularity.'b'Resilient societies have a level-headed understanding of the risks inherent in this kind of warfare.'b'But, of course, this is not how the country has reacted over the past week. There have been outraged calls for Secretary Janet Napolitano of the Department of Homeland Security to resign, as if changing the leader of the bureaucracy would fix the flaws inherent in the bureaucracy. There have been demands for systemic reform \xe2\x80\x94 for more protocols, more layers and more review systems.'b'Much of the criticism has been contemptuous and hysterical. Various experts have gathered bits of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab\xe2\x80\x99s biography. Since they can string the facts together to accurately predict the past, they thunder, the intelligence services should have been able to connect the dots to predict the future.'b'Dick Cheney argues that the error was caused by some ideological choice. Arlen Specter screams for more technology \xe2\x80\x94 full-body examining devices. \xe2\x80\x9cWe thought that had been remedied,\xe2\x80\x9d said Senator Kit Bond, as if omniscience could be accomplished with legislation.'b'Many people seem to be in the middle of a religious crisis of faith. All the gods they believe in \xe2\x80\x94 technology, technocracy, centralized government control \xe2\x80\x94 have failed them in this instance.'b'In a mature nation, President Obama could go on TV and say, \xe2\x80\x9cListen, we\xe2\x80\x99re doing the best we can, but some terrorists are bound to get through.\xe2\x80\x9d But this is apparently a country that must be spoken to in childish ways. The original line out of the White House was that the system worked. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, little Johnny.'b'When that didn\xe2\x80\x99t work the official line went to the other extreme. \xe2\x80\x9cI consider that totally unacceptable,\xe2\x80\x9d Obama said. I\xe2\x80\x99m really mad, Johnny. But don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make it all better.'b'Meanwhile, the Transportation Security Administration has to be seen doing something, so it added another layer to its stage play, \xe2\x80\x9cSecurity Theater\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 more baggage regulations, more in-flight restrictions.'b'At some point, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth pointing out that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the centralized system that stopped terrorism in this instance. As with the shoe bomber, as with the plane that went down in Shanksville, Pa., it was decentralized citizen action. The plot was foiled by nonexpert civilians who had the advantage of the concrete information right in front of them \xe2\x80\x94  and the spirit to take the initiative.'b'For better or worse, over the past 50 years we have concentrated authority in centralized agencies and reduced the role of decentralized citizen action. We\xe2\x80\x99ve done this in many spheres of life. Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s wise, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s not. But we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that these centralized institutions are going to work perfectly or even well most of the time. It would be nice if we reacted to their inevitable failures not with rabid denunciation and cynicism, but with a little resiliency, an awareness that human systems fail and bad things will happen and we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to lose our heads every time they do.'b'In the last 100 years, only three New York City mayors have served three terms. After spending more than $100 million to become the fourth, Michael Bloomberg boasted on election night that he would challenge the conventional wisdom, and the historical record, that third-term mayors are too tired and too jaded to serve the city or themselves terribly well.'b'Mr. Bloomberg, who will be sworn in on Friday, has already accomplished a good deal and is always eager to prove the pundits wrong. This time, it will be harder.'b'The political climate is a lot less welcoming. If the mayor isn\xe2\x80\x99t tired, many New Yorkers are tired of him, especially after he helped overturn term limits \xe2\x80\x94  a misguided but popular city law. His re-election was a squeaker, for all the money and the army of advisers.'b'Mr. Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s biggest personal challenge will be to tame his imperious nature. The city has serious problems, starting with the economy, and he will have to deliver bad news to New Yorkers in coming months.'b'That means that the mayor will have to work harder than he has in the past to rally support from the City Council (many members already see him as a lame duck). And he will have to concentrate more on rallying public support. He will need to reach out, to hold more town hall meetings, to be accessible and allow New Yorkers to give their unvarnished opinions. And when they do, he needs to listen. This is not Mr. Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s strong suit, but he will have to get better at it.'b'The mayor\xe2\x80\x99s biggest policy challenge this year will be wrestling with a $4.1 billion deficit in his next city budget. Tax revenues are disappointing, and the state\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal situation is catastrophic, which means that support from Albany will only go down.'b'Next year\xe2\x80\x99s budget is due at the end of June, but Mr. Bloomberg wisely has already started cutting. He has targeted $550 million in savings for this fiscal year and is planning to reduce spending by $1.2 billion in the following one. New Yorkers will soon start to feel the squeeze \xe2\x80\x94 with fewer new parks and playgrounds, leaner school budgets, less child care support and personnel cuts, including uniformed forces.'b'As a businessman, the mayor has the right skills to keep the $60 billion budget balanced. As a billionaire, who thrives in Manhattan\xe2\x80\x99s social stratosphere, he has to be especially careful about how  he explains the need for sacrifices by others. He should take extra care to ensure that cuts do not weigh heaviest on the needy and make certain that struggling families and city businesses both have a decent chance to survive. It will be a tough balancing act, financially and politically.'b'New York City schools are better today in many crucial ways than when Mr. Bloomberg took over. The old, ineffective Board of Education shed chancellors with dizzying frequency. After the State Legislature finally scrapped the board and gave the mayor control of the schools, he brought much-needed stability. He has also swept away the bureaucratic underbrush, strengthened the teacher corps and increased teachers\xe2\x80\x99 salaries.'b'Shortly after the November election, the mayor directed the schools chancellor, Joel Klein, to start using student performance data to determine teacher tenure. It is a sound approach, as long as it is done carefully and fairly. That directive also sent an important signal to the teachers\xe2\x80\x99 unions that Mr. Bloomberg is now ready to demand more for their enhanced salaries. He also wants bad teachers out of the classroom and off the payroll. In all, the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s education policies have been a good thing for students, but he and his school officials still have to spend more time listening to concerned parents.'b'Like all mayors, Mr. Bloomberg wants his share of monuments. He already has waterfront parks, two finished stadiums, a slew of high rises and tantalizing possibilities on Governors Island. Going forward, it will be hard for the public to stomach any big giveaways like Yankee Stadium, which, at the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s urging, got billions of dollars of support, including taxpayer-backed debt, tax breaks and the use of city parkland.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a time for singles, not home runs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mitchell Moss, a professor at New York University and informal adviser to the mayor. Mr. Bloomberg should use his business acumen to push for more developments with housing for moderate-income residents and public workers. The next time some bigwig wants a stadium or a fat new zoning change, the mayor should take care to demand more parks and public facilities as part of the deal. The bottom line for any development should be that it helps out more than the developer\xe2\x80\x99s bottom line.'b'Given his history \xe2\x80\x94 the anti-smoking campaign, the advances against trans fats and the calorie counts in restaurants \xe2\x80\x94 Mayor Bloomberg can be expected to aim in the right direction on health care. Other areas worthy of more focus are asthma, obesity and diabetes.'b'The environment is a tougher climb. The latest report on air quality from the city\xe2\x80\x99s health department is especially alarming: it showed unhealthy levels of pollution in high-population areas throughout the city. Mr. Bloomberg should revive his fight in Albany for some form of congestion pricing.'b'Cars are a big problem, but so are all of those buildings spewing black smoke. The Council approved an initiative that helps move toward Mr. Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s goal of cutting 30 percent of the city\xe2\x80\x99s carbon output by 2030. But it only requires large buildings to audit their energy use, not upgrade the equipment if they find problems. The hope is that once they see the numbers, owners will decide to invest in improvements to save both energy and money. That may work. But if the economy improves for real estate, the mayor should revive his idea of requiring owners to do what is needed to clear the air.'b'We have confidence in Mr. Bloomberg. He is a smart leader with sound priorities. The next four years will test his political skills \xe2\x80\x94 his ability to work with a State Legislature that would try anyone\xe2\x80\x99s patience and Washington politicians who take more money from the city than they give back. Most of all, he will have to persuade all New Yorkers that, even in a time of sacrifices, he is truly on their side.'b'Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t hear a lot about the top United Nations representative in Afghanistan, but the job is a critically important one. The mission\xe2\x80\x99s responsibilities include strengthening governance, combating corruption, monitoring and protecting human rights and assuring fair and independently supervised elections.'b'The current representative, Kai Eide, has been a disappointment. He has been too quiet about President Hamid Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s corrupt associates and too tolerant of the lax accounting practices at United Nations development programs. He was too slow, even slower than Washington, to condemn Mr. Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s blatant rigging of the August presidential election. Mr. Eide has announced that he will be leaving soon. Choosing the right successor is vitally important. Securing and rebuilding Afghanistan is an international, not just an American, responsibility. Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, is currently considering three candidates: Staffan de Mistura of Sweden, Jean-Marie Gu\xc3\xa9henno of France and Ian Martin of Britain. Of these, we believe Mr. Gu\xc3\xa9henno has most clearly demonstrated the qualities necessary for what is a very tough job.'b'The next representative must be someone who can work smoothly with the top NATO commander, Gen. Stanley McChrystal of the United States, and Washington\xe2\x80\x99s ambassador, Karl Eikenberry. The representative must also have an independent mind and enough international stature to challenge them if they\xe2\x80\x99re going wrong, and must be strong enough to stand up to President Karzai when necessary \xe2\x80\x94 and diplomatic enough to work with him.'b'He must demand tighter accounting from United Nations development agencies. And he must be willing and able to goad Security Council members to back up their fine resolutions with additional pledges of badly needed peacekeepers, trainers, civilian specialists and long-term development aid.'b'Mr. Gu\xc3\xa9henno amply demonstrated many of the right qualities when he served as under secretary general for peacekeeping operations from 2000 to 2008. He took over a discredited and demoralized department and rebuilt it. He also built a productive relationship with Washington (not easy during the George W. Bush years) and other Security Council members.'b'Mr. de Mistura has worked for the United Nations for nearly 40 years, serving in Bosnia, Kosovo, Somalia, Rwanda, Lebanon, Afghanistan and, from 2007 to 2009, as the top United Nations official in Iraq. That\xe2\x80\x99s an impressive range of experience, but we are concerned that his low-key style and bureaucratic instincts are not the ones needed now in Afghanistan. Mr. Martin, who has held senior positions with the United Nations in Nepal and East Timor and led Amnesty International, is an effective advocate, but he lacks Mr. Gu\xc3\xa9henno\xe2\x80\x99s stellar international stature. Either could grow into the top Afghan job. Mr. Gu\xc3\xa9henno is ready for it today.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ve been getting and sending a lot of holiday greetings, but one we have yet to hear is: \xe2\x80\x9cHave a Very New Year!\xe2\x80\x9d Perhaps it sounds too ambiguous for a real felicitation; safer to wish upon each other happiness rather than newness. But what if the newness of the new year was more than a calendrical trope? What if we rolled into January as if we were rolling into undiscovered country \xe2\x80\x94 ties cut, wagons loaded, oxen hitched?'b'For all of the toasts and vows, it is easy to dismiss the new year as an artificial made-for-Champagne-purveyors boundary. If we move past it \xe2\x80\x94 and our limited resolutions \xe2\x80\x94 quickly it is because life has a profound continuity that has little reference to the calendar\xe2\x80\x99s pages. For most of us, time falls into different, and largely private, patterns. It\xe2\x80\x99s more natural to measure time by how long you\xe2\x80\x99ve lived in the same apartment or worked at a job, how long a relationship has endured and how old the children have grown, how large the trees you planted years ago have gotten.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s one thing the new year always offers: a look back across the plains into the past before we move onward into the future. It is a holiday that insists upon our temporality and reminds us that time is, in fact, the strangest thing. No one ever sat you down, when you were young, and explained the workings of time the way the safe way to cross a street was explained. You just grew into it, into the way we trail the past behind us while the future comes rushing forward.'b'It also offers possibility.

King Abdullah II attaches great importance to changing the electoral law as an important step to enhancing the political life in the country and encouraging political participation by all Jordanians. The outgoing parliament was not expected to change an electoral law that represented the basis of electing its own members.

But I am a Jets fan. And being a New York Jets football fan is an illness. So keep that in mind, and please be kind as you read this.'b'There was a single moment of glory on Jan. 12, 1969, when the great 'b'Joe Namath'b', with his white shoes and long hair and a right arm that could write poetry with a football, led the Jets to the greatest upset in pro football history: defeating the mighty Colts of Baltimore in the 'b'Super Bowl'b', 16-7.'b'Google it.

You can spend the rest of your life trying to experience it again.'b'I should have known the following December that something freakish was afoot. All the Jets had to do was win one more game \xe2\x80\x94  just defeat the Kansas City Chiefs \xe2\x80\x94  to go back to the Super Bowl. Behind 6-3 in the fourth quarter, the defending world champions had a first down on the Chiefs\xe2\x80\x99 1-yard line. The 1-yard line!'b'It was cold. The wind was blowing. And the beginning of decades of unimaginable, humiliating futility for Jets fans was upon us. The Jets could not advance the ball that 1 yard.'b'They tried and tried and tried again. It never happened. They got within a foot of the goal line, but they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t cross it. They lost, and the Chiefs went to the Super Bowl.'b'There is something otherworldly about the perennial ineptitude of this franchise. Gerald Eskenazi, a former sportswriter for The Times, called his history of the team \xe2\x80\x9cGang Green: An Irreverent Look Behind the Scenes at Thirty-Eight (Well, Thirty-Seven) Seasons of New York Jets Futility.\xe2\x80\x9d That was in 1998, and nothing has changed since then.'b'I bring this up because now, more than four, long decades after their one brief moment in the sun, Jets fans are setting themselves up for yet another brutal disappointment. A couple of weeks ago, the coach, Rex Ryan, mistakenly thought that his team, playing terribly, had blown any chance to make the playoffs. It turned out that he was wrong.'b'Then the Jets went on to beat the undefeated Indianapolis Colts, and if they beat the Cincinnati Bengals in a nationally televised game on Sunday night they will enter the postseason countdown to the Super Bowl.'b'And that\xe2\x80\x99s the specialty of this team. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just that it\xe2\x80\x99s been bad for most of the past half-century. The insidious aspect is that time and again the Jets rise from the ashes of their awfulness, just enough to offer the hope that something wonderful is about to happen. And the fans get all pumped and crazy, and then the roof caves in.'b'We should know better, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t help ourselves.'b'There was the time, for example, when my heroes were playing the Dolphins in Miami and the winner of that game would go on to the Super Bowl. The Jets had a good team that year, and I figured they had Miami\xe2\x80\x99s number. But the weather gods opened the skies over South Florida and it rained for days. It poured. The Dolphins refused to protect the field with a tarpaulin. The result was a vast basin of mud that paralyzed the Jets\xe2\x80\x99 high-powered offense. Miami won 14-0.'b'Things often happen with the Jets that seem inexplicable. After one of their typically dismal seasons, they fired the coach, Pete Carroll, who had lost his last five games. He was replaced with a coach, Rich Kotite, who had lost his last seven.'b'The owner, the late Leon Hess, said he had made the switch because he wanted to \xe2\x80\x9cwin now.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen. Kotite was a spectacularly terrible coach.'b'Jets fans have come to take a certain twisted pride in their team\xe2\x80\x99s horrendous history, competing to see who has the worst and most vivid memories. Years ago, whenever I had trouble sleeping, I\xe2\x80\x99d listen to Joe Benigno, who then was the overnight guy on WFAN sports radio and as big a Jets fan as I am. He\xe2\x80\x99d tell hilarious stories of his extreme anguish over the team\xe2\x80\x99s amazing capacity to find creative ways to lose. The bigger the game, the more innovative the effort.'b'So here we go again.'b'Long-suffering Jets fans will be glued to their televisions on Sunday night, hoping for the win that will shoot their team into the playoffs. So we can begin praying again for the miracle that never happens.'b'It is time to take the challenge.

Museums everywhere are having trouble making ends meet, what with the overblown expansions they\xe2\x80\x99ve made, the decline in investment income and the steep drop-off in contributions from foundations and individuals. Many have cut staff, frozen pay, trimmed exhibition schedules and slowed or stopped acquisitions. For some, that may not be enough: the American Folk Art Museum, to cite one example, recently admitted that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t making debt payments.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s next? In some corners, there\xe2\x80\x99s fear that museum officials will do what is absolutely forbidden by art-world rules: raise operating cash with a sale of artwork. Already some respected figures \xe2\x80\x94 David Gordon, former head of the Milwaukee Art Museum, and Richard Armstrong, director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, for example \xe2\x80\x94 are saying that the rule against selling art for any purpose other than buying more art is wrong.'b'But the mere mention of art sales for operating money turns some purists purple with apoplexy, and could restart the uproar that occurred last year when Brandeis University bruited but backtracked from the idea of selling works from its Rose Art Museum, eventually prompting Jehuda Reinharz, the university president, to step down. Just before that, the National Academy Museum sold two Hudson River School paintings to pay its bills, eliciting tough sanctions from the normally hands-off Association of Art Museum Directors.'b'Many people don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the problem. If the choice is between allowing a museum to fail (or make crippling cutbacks) and selling some art, what\xe2\x80\x99s the big deal? Sell art! Most museums, after all, hold many works they have no room to display and stuff them into back rooms and off-site storage facilities. If museums are allowed to cull their collections to raise money to buy more art, why can\xe2\x80\x99t they sell those very same pieces to solve their financial problems?'b'The big deal is this: The strict constructionists believe that once selling art to cover operating costs is allowed, it will become the first resort in bad times, not the last.'b'On that score, they may be right. It\xe2\x80\x99s human nature to test the line and, having gotten away with something, to do it again. Some museum trustees and other large donors are themselves stretched, relatively speaking, by this recession and can\xe2\x80\x99t or won\xe2\x80\x99t increase their gifts. Yet no one knows when the economy will restore investment portfolios and bank accounts to their previous health. The money has to come from somewhere.'b'Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s best to amend the unwritten sales ban, but not end it. What if a museum had to argue its case for de-accessioning art before an impartial arbitrator?'b'This neutral party would need to be schooled in art, art law and nonprofit regulations.'b'Moreover, the museum would need to open its financial books completely, so that the arbitrator could see that all other reasonable avenues of fund-raising, as well as cutbacks, had already been exhausted. And it would need to open its cataloguing records and storerooms, to show that the departure of the works in question would not irreparably damage the collection and that no donor agreements would be violated.'b'Most important, as part of any deal permitting the sale of art, the de-accessioning museum would have to offer the works to other museums first. If it received no offers, it could sell the pieces via a public auction \xe2\x80\x94 and any American museum would then have the opportunity to match a winning bid if it promised to keep the work in a public collection.'b'Who would administer this system? There\xe2\x80\x99s no regulatory agency for art museums. For large museums, the Association of Art Museum Directors could step up to the plate. For university museums, the Association of College and University Museums and Galleries could do the job. Likewise, the American Association of Museums, which accredits a larger spectrum of museums, might need to play a role. Each would hire professional arbitrators when necessary.'b'If those groups wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do the job, it could fall to a state agency, a charities bureau or the attorney general\xe2\x80\x99s office, whichever oversees nonprofits.'b'Museums\xe2\x80\x99 money troubles are unlikely to disappear soon. And until they do, de-accessioning shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be impossible \xe2\x80\x94 just nearly so.'b'It will take some time before all the facts about the Christmas Day terrorism plot are known and analyzed. One thing is already clear: The government has to urgently improve its ability to use the reams of intelligence it receives every day on suspected terrorists and plots. That was supposed to have been addressed after the infamous \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to connect the dots\xe2\x80\x9d before the 9/11 attacks. The echoes of the earlier disaster in this near-disaster are chilling.'b'There were plenty of clues about Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian man accused of trying to blow a hole in the side of Northwest Flight 253. But no one in the vast (and vastly expensive) intelligence and homeland security bureaucracy put them together.'b'In May, Britain refused to renew Mr. Abdulmutallab\xe2\x80\x99s visa and put him on a watch list. In August, the National Security Agency overheard leaders of an Al Qaeda branch in Yemen discussing a plot involving a Nigerian man. In November, Mr. Abdulmutallab\xe2\x80\x99s father, a respected banker, warned the American Embassy in Abuja (he even met with an official of the Central Intelligence Agency) that his son was being radicalized and had disappeared in Yemen.'b'The son was put on the least-restrictive American watch list \xe2\x80\x94 one that flagged him for future investigation. His plane ticket to Detroit was bought with cash. He boarded the trans-Atlantic flight with no luggage. Homeland security officials routinely receive lists of passengers before planes take off and the Transportation Security Administration can request that a plane return to its departure airport if a suspicious passenger is on board. Still no one raised an alarm.'b'Following the recommendations of the 9/11 commission, Congress created the National Counterterrorism Center to unify the government\xe2\x80\x99s data collection and ordered the welter of intelligence agencies to put aside their rivalries and share what they know and suspect. Everyone insists that is happening; but still something went terribly wrong.'b'According to The Times, a preliminary review ordered by President Obama has found that because of human error, the agencies were still looking at discrete pieces of the puzzle without adequately checking other available databases \xe2\x80\x94 and, in some cases, were not sharing what they knew. The State Department says that it relayed the father\xe2\x80\x99s warnings to the National Counterterrorism Center. C.I.A. officials in Nigeria prepared a separate report on Mr. Abdulmutallab that was sent to the C.I.A. headquarters but not to other agencies. At this point, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know who was told of the N.S.A. intercepts.'b'Either the National Counterterrorism Center didn\xe2\x80\x99t get all of the information it was supposed to get \xe2\x80\x94 or it utterly failed to do its job, which is to correlate data so any pattern emerges. No doubt sorting through heaps of information and determining what is urgent or even worthy of follow-up is daunting. Still, it is incredible, and frightening, that the government cannot do at least as good a job at swiftly updating and correlating information as Google.'b'Long before Mr. Abdulmutallab was allowed to board that flight to Detroit, some analyst should have punched \xe2\x80\x9cNigerian, Abdulmutallab, Yemen, visa, plot\xe2\x80\x9d into the system. We are still waiting to find out whether Britain told Washington that it had revoked the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s visa. Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that have been on file?'b'We will reserve judgment about whether anyone should be fired for what President Obama has rightly called a \xe2\x80\x9csystemic failure.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, didn\xe2\x80\x99t help matters when she briefly asserted that the system worked. Her system clearly has serious flaws. So does the intelligence system. We are sure that the turf war between Leon Panetta, the C.I.A. director, and the director of national intelligence, Dennis Blair (his job was created after 9/11 to oversee all 16 spy agencies), is not helping. Neither are the Republicans, who predictably seized on the plot for political advantage by absurdly accusing Mr. Obama of being weak on national security.'b'What is needed now is what was needed after 9/11: a clearheaded, nonpoliticized assessment of what went wrong and nonhysterical remedies that work this time. The United States cannot be enclosed in an impermeable bubble. But Mr. Abdulmutallab never should have been allowed to board that plane.'b'New York City has now officially registered its ringing opposition to a proposal by state regulators to allow natural gas drilling in the watershed that supplies drinking water to more than eight million city residents. Albany should amend its proposal and put the area permanently off limits to drilling.'b'The watershed covers roughly a million acres of farms, forests, lakes and streams northwest of the city. Its subsurface rock formations contain rich deposits of natural gas and are part of a much larger geologic formation known as the Marcellus Shale, which runs northward from West Virginia into New York\xe2\x80\x99s southern tier.'b'The state wants to exploit this resource because it could add to the region\xe2\x80\x99s energy supplies and give a much-needed lift to the upstate economy. But the watershed contains just one-tenth of the state\xe2\x80\x99s known gas deposits. That means New York would not be giving up all that much if it does the right thing and bans drilling there.'b'Last fall, Albany issued a thick set of rules intended to regulate drilling. Environmentalists and city officials immediately cautioned that while carefully regulated drilling could proceed in other parts of the state with minimal environmental damage, it would be foolish to risk the city\xe2\x80\x99s water supply.'b'A new report commissioned by the city, and written by scientists and engineers who specialize in gas drilling, confirms those fears. It says that the drilling process \xe2\x80\x94 which is done by injecting water and chemicals at high pressure into the rock formations \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9ccreates a substantial risk of chemical contamination and infrastructure damage.\xe2\x80\x9d That, in turn, could force the city to build a $10 billion filtration plant and negate the sizable investment it has already made to keep the watershed clean. Mayor Michael Bloomberg is to be commended for commissioning the report and demanding a quick turnaround.'b'The good news is that the Chesapeake Energy Corporation, believed to be the largest leaseholder in the watershed, has already announced that it will not drill there. But its decision is voluntary and not binding on other companies. The only sure way to guarantee the protection of the watershed, and New York City\xe2\x80\x99s supply of drinking water, is to quarantine the area.'b'In a welcome move toward increased freedom of expression, the Supreme Court of Canada has issued two rulings that will give reporters a new legal defense for \xe2\x80\x9cresponsible communication.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Libel law in Canada has long been heavily tilted against the news media. It has been far too easy for corporations and rich individuals in Canada to sue over news reports they do not like. Canadian journalists have had to worry far more than their American counterparts about being hit with large damage awards.'b'Last month, the Canadian Supreme Court changed the rules. One of the cases involved a lawsuit by a forestry executive who won a judgment of about $1.5 million against The Toronto Star, a newspaper that published an article suggesting that he had used political connections to get approval for a golf course expansion.'b'The Supreme Court ruled that the judgment against the newspaper was improper because it had failed to give adequate weight to the value of freedom of expression. The court announced a new defense of \xe2\x80\x9cresponsible communication on matters of public interest.\xe2\x80\x9d Journalists and other speakers can avoid liability, the court ruled, if they can show that the information they communicated \xe2\x80\x94 whether it turned out to be true or false \xe2\x80\x94 was of public interest and they were diligent in trying to verify it.'b'In the second case, a lawsuit by a former Ontario police officer against The Ottawa Citizen newspaper, the court reached a similar result. It reversed a jury award of $100,000 to the officer, who objected to the newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s reports that claimed he had misrepresented his search-and-rescue work at ground zero in New York City after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.'b'In its opinions, the Supreme Court recognized the importance of free speech and a robust news media to a functioning democracy. That is good news for Canadians and all people who respect and value Canada\xe2\x80\x99s press.'b'Two-and-a-half years ago, Michael Ragusa was 13 years old when he was in a car accident that left him with more than two dozen skull fractures. \xe2\x80\x9cMedically, there is no hope,\xe2\x80\x9d one doctor warned his mother, Anne Wollman.'b'Ms. Wollman didn\xe2\x80\x99t give up, and neither did Michael.

Unfortunately, the reality is quite different. An increasing number of civil cases go forward without lawyers. Litigants who cannot afford a lawyer, and either do not qualify for legal aid or are unable to have a lawyer assigned to them because of dwindling budgets, are on their own \xe2\x80\x94 pro se. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, they\xe2\x80\x99re often on their own in cases involving life-altering situations like divorce, child custody and loss of shelter.'b'As the economy has worsened, the ranks of the self-represented poor have expanded. In a recent informal study conducted by the Self-Represented Litigation Network, about half the judges who responded reported a greater number of pro se litigants as a result of the economic crisis. Unrepresented litigants now also include many in the middle class and small-business owners who unexpectedly find themselves in distress and without sufficient resources to pay for the legal assistance they need.'b'As judges, we believe more needs to be done to meet this growing challenge: an inaccessible, overburdened justice system serves none of us well. California took a major step forward in October when it became the first state to recognize as a goal the right to counsel in certain civil cases. (The state also committed to a pilot project, financed by court fees, to provide lawyers for low-income citizens in cases where basic human needs are at stake.)'b'But this is only a beginning. It is essential that we promote other efforts to close the \xe2\x80\x9cjustice gap.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'One such effort involves the \xe2\x80\x9cunbundling\xe2\x80\x9d of legal services. Forty-one states, including California and New Hampshire, have adopted a model rule drafted by the American Bar Association, or similar provisions, which allow lawyers to unbundle their services and take only part of a case, a cost-saving practice known as \xe2\x80\x9climited-scope representation\xe2\x80\x9d that, with proper ethical safeguards, is responsive to new realities.'b'Traditionally, lawyers have been required to stay with a case from beginning to end, unless a court has excused them from this obligation. Now, in those states that explicitly or implicitly allow unbundling, people or businesses can hire a lawyer on a limited basis to help them fill out forms, to prepare documents, to coach them on how to present in court or to appear in court for one or two hearings.'b'For example, a lawyer could advise a client in a divorce proceeding about legal principles governing the division of marital assets or provide assistance in calculating child-support obligations. A lawyer might also draft pleadings or legal memos or provide representation at a hearing to obtain a domestic-violence restraining order.'b'What could be wrong with this? Well, some lawyers have expressed concern that limited legal representation will encourage litigants to dissect their cases in an effort to save money, sacrificing quality representation that the litigant might otherwise be able to afford. We have also heard the argument that by offering too much assistance to self-represented litigants, the courts themselves are undermining the value of lawyers and the legal profession. Apparently, some are concerned that the court system will become so user-friendly that there will be no need for lawyers.'b'We respectfully disagree. Litigants who can afford the services of a lawyer will continue to use one until a case or problem is resolved. Lawyers make a difference and clients know that. But for those whose only option is to go it alone, at least some limited, affordable time with a lawyer is a valuable option we should all encourage.'b'In fact, we believe that limited-scope-representation rules will allow lawyers \xe2\x80\x94 especially sole practitioners \xe2\x80\x94 to service people who might otherwise have never sought legal assistance. We also believe that carefully drafted ethical rules allowing lawyers to handle part of a case give the legal profession an opportunity to help the courts address the ever-growing number of litigants who cross our thresholds. This cause has special relevance now as state courts are faced with serious cutbacks in financing, forcing some to close their doors one day a week or a month, lay off front-line staff members and delay jury trials. None of this bodes well for the judicial system or for those seeking to vindicate their rights through the courts, whether they have a lawyer or not.'b'We need members of the legal profession to join with us, as many have done, in meeting this challenge by making unbundled legal services and other innovative solutions \xe2\x80\x94 like self-help Web sites, online assistance programs and court self-help centers \xe2\x80\x94 work for all who need them. If we are to maintain public trust and confidence in the courts, we must keep faith with our founding principles and our core belief in equal justice under the law.'b'Dublin'b'IF we have overindulged in anything these past several days, it is neither holiday ham nor American football; it is Top 10 lists.

And once more, information was not collated, which should mean a bad day at Kinko\xe2\x80\x99s, not at counterterrorism headquarters.'b'On Tuesday, John McCain and Jon Kyl, the two Republican senators from Arizona who had praised Napolitano at her confirmation hearings, stood together, with Kyl saying he no longer felt \xe2\x80\x9ctotally safe\xe2\x80\x9d with her in command.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe and I spoke and he explained to me that that\xe2\x80\x99s not what he meant,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he was misconstrued.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She said she, too, was misconstrued, and that in other interviews she did on Sunday, she made it clear that she meant the system worked \xe2\x80\x9cafter the incident.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo excuses, but I was a little focused on what we were doing operationally,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were working to deal with the airports and the airliners, so perhaps I was a little distracted.\xe2\x80\x9d  The important message, she said, was \xe2\x80\x9cto immediately tell the American people we were not just cowering somewhere but we were taking this on very, very forcefully.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Asked about the frustrations of some on the 9/11 Commission, that the description of what went wrong this time was disturbingly  similar to what went wrong that time, Napolitano argued that \xe2\x80\x9cwe are safer now than before 9/11.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat this brings home is that we can\xe2\x80\x99t be complacent,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a determined enemy and you can\xe2\x80\x99t put the United States in a big Tupperware container.

I think we tell them we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything we can to reduce risk. I think we tell people that they are also part of the system. I mean, the passengers on this plane were a line of defense, the flight crew were a line of defense. So everybody has a shared responsibility here. You can\xe2\x80\x99t just say, well, this government department or that government department\xe2\x80\x99s got the whole shebang.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She said criticism that her department had been on auto-pilot before the sky scare was \xe2\x80\x9cmisguided.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Asked if her job is particularly thankless, given that only mistakes are recognized, she smilingly made a \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t feel sorry for me\xe2\x80\x9d gesture, rubbing imaginary tears away from her eyes.'b'I noted that Dick Cheney had gone squirrelly seeing the avalanche of daily threats coming in, and asked how she kept paranoia at bay.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of it out there,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI try to keep focused, really trying to ascertain who needs to be our targets.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Why is it so hard for those charged with keeping us safe to be as imaginative and innovative as filmmakers like James Cameron?  \xe2\x80\x9cWe do have some great technology,  but this is not a movie,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe reality is much more complex and nuanced, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t take human judgment out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She said that \xe2\x80\x9cone of the things that may come out of this awful day is perhaps a renewed sense of urgency,\xe2\x80\x9d and that it has spurred her department to \xe2\x80\x9caccelerate\xe2\x80\x9d talks it was  already having about collaborating with the Department of Energy  \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cwhich has a phenomenal research budget and capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She laughed when I wondered if she wished she\xe2\x80\x99d lobbied harder for that Supreme Court spot.'b'Does anything keep her up at night?

Hint: It\xe2\x80\x99s far cheaper. A year\xe2\x80\x99s supply costs less than the cheapest hamburger.'b'Give up? Here\xe2\x80\x99s another hint: It\xe2\x80\x99s lifesaving for children and for women who may become pregnant. If you know of a woman who may become pregnant, make sure she gets this miracle substance.'b'A final hint: It was a lack of this substance that led to a tragedy that I encountered the other day at a hospital here in the Honduran capital. Three babies lay in cots next to one another with birth defects of the brain and spinal cord.'b'In the first cot was Rosa \xc3\x81lvarez, 18 days old and recovering from surgery to repair a hole in her spine. She also suffers from a brain deformity.'b'In the next cot was \xc3\x81ngel Flores, soft tissue protruding from his back.'b'Closest to the door was Jos\xc3\xa9 Tercera. His mother unwrapped a bandage on his head, and I saw a golf-ball-size chunk of his brain spilling out a hole in his forehead.'b'The doctors believe the reason for these deformities, called neural tube defects, was that their mothers  did not have enough 'b'micronutrients'b', particularly folic acid, while pregnant.  These micronutrients are the miracle substance I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about, and there\xe2\x80\x99s scarcely a form of foreign aid more cost-effective than getting them into the food supply.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s unnecessary to have these kinds of problems,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Ali Flores, a pediatrician and expert on these defects, said as he looked over the three babies.'b'If a pregnant woman does not have enough folic acid (also known as vitamin B9) in her body at the very beginning of her pregnancy, then her fetus may suffer these neural tube defects. That\xe2\x80\x99s why doctors give folic acid to women who plan to become pregnant.'b'Equally important is another micronutrient, iodine. The worst consequence of iodine deficiency isn\xe2\x80\x99t goiters, but malformation of fetuses\xe2\x80\x99 brains, so they have 10 to 15 points permanently shaved off their I.Q.\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'Then there\xe2\x80\x99s zinc, which reduces child deaths from diarrhea and infections. There\xe2\x80\x99s iron, lack of which causes widespread anemia. And there\xe2\x80\x99s vitamin A: some 670,000 children die each year because they don\xe2\x80\x99t get enough vitamin A, and lack of the vitamin remains the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading cause of childhood blindness.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn the early stages of life, the die is cast,\xe2\x80\x9d said David Dodson, the founder of 'b'Project Healthy Children'b', an aid group that fights micronutrient deficiencies in Honduras and other poor countries. \xe2\x80\x9cIf a child is not getting the right micronutrients, the effect is permanent.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Nine years ago, Mr. Dodson was simply an American businessman running a 300-employee waste company that he had founded. Then he happened to visit Honduras and, in a hospital, encountered a mother whose newborn baby had a hole in the skull. He learned that negligible amounts of folic acid would prevent such heartbreaking defects  \xe2\x80\x94 and his life was transformed.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI had never seen anything in my life that could have so much impact for so little money and be sustainable,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Dodson said. He and his wife, Stephanie, sold their company and used some of the proceeds to start Project Healthy Children.'b'The most cost-effective way to distribute micronutrients isn\xe2\x80\x99t to hand them out. Mary Flores, a former Honduran first lady who is active in nutrition, notes that impoverished women can be hard to reach, and even if they are given folic acid pills they sometimes won\xe2\x80\x99t take them for fear that they actually are birth control pills. So micronutrients instead are often added to such common foods as salt, sugar, flour or cooking oil.'b'Adding iodine, iron, vitamin A, zinc and various B-complex vitamins including folic acid to a range of foods costs about 30 cents per person reached per year. Groups focusing on micronutrients also include 'b'Helen Keller International'b' and 'b'Vitamin Angels'b'.'b'In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has required that flour be fortified with folic acid since 1998.  Even in America, with better diets, medical care and widespread fortification, not all women get enough micronutrients, but the problem is far worse in poor countries.'b'Mr. Dodson notes that it is much cheaper to prevent birth defects than to treat them.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a sexy world health issue, but it\xe2\x80\x99s about the nuts and bolts of putting together a healthy population,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Dodson said. \xe2\x80\x9cPutting small amounts of iron, iodine and folic acid in the food supply hasn\xe2\x80\x99t drawn attention the way it does when you treat someone who is sick or in a refugee camp. Until recently, this has been off everybody\xe2\x80\x99s radar screen.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As the United States reorganizes its chaotic aid program, it might try promoting what just may be the world\xe2\x80\x99s most luscious food: micronutrients.'b'The evidence that Al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s branch in Yemen had a role in the failed Christmas Day bombing of an American passenger jet has led some to declare that Yemen is the new front in the war against the terrorist organization. But the truth is, Yemen has been a front in that war since at least Oct. 12, 2000, when Al Qaeda blew up the Navy destroyer Cole, killing 17 American sailors, in the port of Aden. The explosives for the bombing were bought in Yemen. And the attackers and their accomplices were predominantly Yemenis. Indeed, after the attack, terrorists in Qaeda camps in Afghanistan would march and chant, \xe2\x80\x9cWe, the Yemenis, destroyed the Cole.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As the F.B.I. case agent for the Cole investigation from 2000 to 2005, I spent years with colleagues in Yemen hunting down those responsible, and we unraveled an entire Qaeda network in the country.'b'Even before the Cole attack, Yemen was linked to terrorist acts. Most of the people who executed the 1998 East African embassy bombings either traveled through Yemen or used fraudulent Yemeni passports. Almost two years after the Cole, Qaeda terrorists based in Yemen struck the Limburg, a French oil tanker, off the coast of Yemen. Qaeda terrorists in Yemen also helped facilitate the attacks of 9/11. Fahd al-Quso, a Yemeni Qaeda member who confessed to me his role in the U.S.S. Cole bombing, also admitted to ferrying money to a  Qaeda operative known as Khallad who was part of an important 9/11 planning meeting in Malaysia.'b'As recently as this past August, an assassination attempt against Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s deputy minister of interior in charge of security, was plotted in Yemen. The explosive mixture that the suicide bomber used in that attack was the same one that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab tried to ignite on the passenger jet over Detroit \xe2\x80\x94 and in each case the terrorist hid the mixture in his underwear.'b'Yemen is a very appealing base for Al Qaeda for various reasons. From its position at the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, the country has convenient access to Al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s main theaters of battle, including Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan. Its borders are unsecured, and tribal groups sympathetic to Al Qaeda control many regions, so terrorists can move freely into, out of and around the country. And guns and explosives are readily available from Yemen\xe2\x80\x99s thriving arms market.'b'The country\xe2\x80\x99s tribal nature also makes it a relatively easy place for Al Qaeda to operate. Yemen has a weak government and powerful regional tribes, which in many ways operate as mini-governments free of central control. In addition, the government is struggling to contain both a secessionist movement in the south and a rebellion in the north. Rampant poverty and illiteracy make it easy for Al Qaeda to buy local support and manipulate Yemenis into believing its propaganda.'b'When I was in Yemen, I found many extremely capable officials in law enforcement and intelligence who were dedicated to stopping Al Qaeda. With their help, and with support from American intelligence and military agencies, our F.B.I. team was able to arrest and prosecute in a Yemeni court people responsible for the Cole bombing and for planning other attacks. By the time we left Yemen, in 2005, those terrorists were in prison.'b'Later, however, some of them \xe2\x80\x9cescaped,\xe2\x80\x9d and others were given clemency. Jamal al-Badawi, for example, a Qaeda terrorist who confessed to me his role in the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole, was sentenced to death by a Yemeni judge in 2004. But in 2006, he \xe2\x80\x9cescaped\xe2\x80\x9d from jail, only to turn himself in the next year \xe2\x80\x94 in a deal that released him from prison on a promise of good behavior. Today, Mr. Quso, the confessed Cole bomber,  is not only free, he\xe2\x80\x99s giving interviews and re-establishing himself as a terrorist operative.'b'During the past year, in an ominous sign of Yemen\xe2\x80\x99s rising importance to Al Qaeda, the Saudi branch of the organization merged with the Yemeni branch to form a single terrorist group for the entire peninsula. Known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, it is based in Yemen and headed by a Yemeni, Naser Abdel-Karim al-Wahishi, who served as a close aide to Osama bin Laden. Mr. Wahishi \xe2\x80\x9cescaped\xe2\x80\x9d from jail with Mr. Badawi.'b'Some Yemeni government officials highly value their relationship with the United States, which provides financial aid and military training. During our investigation of the Cole bombing, when the American government made it clear to the Yemenis that they expected full cooperation, the Yemenis who were dedicated to justice were given free rein and those with extremist ties were sidelined. After the trials were over and the terrorists made it out of jail, Robert S. Mueller III, the director of the F.B.I., flew to Yemen to complain, but there was little further protest by the United States. We dropped the ball.'b'A year and a half ago, when I briefed a bipartisan group of Senate staff members on Yemen, I warned that unless the American government sent a united message to the Yemenis to act against Al Qaeda, the terrorists responsible for the Cole would remain free and there would be future attacks against the United States connected to Yemen. Today, the terrorists behind the Cole are still free, and an attack connected to Yemen has been attempted.'b'It is possible to defeat Al Qaeda in Yemen without sending American troops. Now that the Yemenis are once again acting against Al Qaeda by striking the terrorist group\xe2\x80\x99s bases and killing or apprehending many of its members, the United States must show that it has learned to stay focused and hold Yemeni officials accountable. This time, the terrorists must be permanently locked up, not allowed to escape or receive pardons. The most important sign of Yemen\xe2\x80\x99s sincerity will be when those with the blood of 17 American sailors on their hands are all brought to justice in the way they deserve.'b'Mary Tripsas, an 'b'associate professor'b' at the Harvard Business School, has been writing a monthly 'b'column'b' in The Times called \xe2\x80\x9cPrototype,\xe2\x80\x9d about corporate innovation, her academic specialty. Last Sunday, 'b'she highlighted'b' the 3M Company\xe2\x80\x99s customer innovation center at its headquarters in St. Paul.'b'Today, an editor\xe2\x80\x99s note in the paper says that, had The Times known that 3M paid Tripsas\xe2\x80\x99 expenses to Minnesota in November, the column would not have been published as it was written. Tripsas violated a policy against accepting travel or anything else of value from the subjects of coverage. She will no longer be writing for The Times.'b'Last week, The Times parted company with Joshua Robinson, a 'b'prolific'b' young freelancer who represented himself as a Times reporter while asking airline magazines for free tickets to cities around the world for an independent project he was proposing with a photographer.'b'And the byline of Mike Albo, another freelancer who was'b' one writer'b' of the \xe2\x80\x9cCritical Shopper\xe2\x80\x9d column, disappeared from the paper in the fall, after \xe2\x80\x94 separate from his work at The Times \xe2\x80\x94 he accepted an expenses-paid junket to Jamaica, 'b'organized'b' by Thrillist, a consumer e-letter, and sponsored by JetBlue and other corporations.'b'These cases illustrate how hard it is for The Times to ensure that freelancers, who contribute a substantial portion of the paper\xe2\x80\x99s content, abide by ethics guidelines that editors believe are self-evident and essential to the paper\xe2\x80\x99s credibility but that writers sometimes don\xe2\x80\x99t think about, or don\xe2\x80\x99t think apply to their circumstances, or believe are unfair or unrealistic. Some writers do not read the guidelines carefully, and although they are encouraged to raise possible conflicts of interest with an editor, some don\xe2\x80\x99t tell and are not asked.'b'Transgressions are heavily chewed over on the Web, doing no good for the reputation of a paper trying to protect its integrity from even the appearance of improper influence.

But 'b'Philip Corbett'b', the standards editor, said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t done enough,\xe2\x80\x9d and he said top editors plan to discuss this week how to get greater compliance with 'b'the ethics rules'b', spelled out in a 54-page booklet that all contributors to The Times, staff and freelance, are expected to read and obey.'b'Despite all the precautions, the cases of Tripsas, Robinson and Albo show how differing views of ethics, a failure to read or remember the fine print and a failure to communicate can lead to embarrassment all around.'b'Tripsas, who accepts speaking fees from companies to share the findings of her academic research and conducts executive education at companies that pay Harvard for her services, now realizes that she was probably ineligible to write for The Times from the start. But the newspaper recruited her for the expertise she gained through her academic work, and she said she did not read the contract carefully or consider its full implications. \xe2\x80\x9cI should have,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'The trip to 3M was arranged before she began working for The Times in August, she said, and she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking about a column when she flew to St. Paul.

Only after she saw 3M\xe2\x80\x99s innovation center did she propose a column to her editor, Patricia Kranz.'b'Tripsas said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt should have computed that there might have been, from the journalistic point of view, a conflict.\xe2\x80\x9d But from her point of view, she was doing academic research, as she normally did, and there was nothing remarkable about allowing 3M to pick up the $820 bill for air fare and a hotel. The money could just as easily have come from her Harvard research budget, she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have changed what I wrote,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'Tripsas made clear in her proposal to Kranz that she had visited 3M, but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention who paid for her trip. \xe2\x80\x9cIt just didn\xe2\x80\x99t even occur to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Tripsas told me.

He said he called himself \xe2\x80\x9ca reporter for The New York Times\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 which he is not \xe2\x80\x94 only to establish his \xe2\x80\x9cstreet cred\xe2\x80\x9d with those he was soliciting, and not to imply he was on the newspaper staff.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was an honest mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me. \xe2\x80\x9cTo me, this was so far removed from anything I do for The Times, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem applicable.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Albo, a novelist, comedian and freelance writer, said he also separated his junket to Jamaica from his work at The Times. He said he took the trip \xe2\x80\x9cexplicitly to see how such an overhyped and oversponsored junket worked,\xe2\x80\x9d expecting that it would provide satiric material for a monologue or a piece of fiction. He said he informally asked friends who were reporters at The Times if they thought the junket would violate the paper\xe2\x80\x99s ethics rules, and they agreed it would not because he was a freelancer. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seemed clear that I was a free agent when it came to my other work,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'But, like Robinson, Albo did not consult an editor responsible for enforcing the ethics policy, and his friends gave him the wrong answer.

She said The Times operates under \xe2\x80\x9cthe false assumption\xe2\x80\x9d that companies pay fees to professors or authors to influence their writing rather than to learn from them. Postrel said Tripsas\xe2\x80\x99 main job was to understand and improve business practices, so it did not matter who paid her way to 3M.'b'Times editors reject such arguments because, to them, the most important consideration is that everything in the newspaper, no matter who produces it, must be free of even the smallest hint of undue influence. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it is important for us to be clear and strict about our rules so readers have reason to trust our credibility,\xe2\x80\x9d Corbett said.'b'I come from the same place, but the system is not working well: these cases keep coming up with dismaying frequency. That could be because the system is so elaborate \xe2\x80\x94 written booklet, written contract, written questionnaire \xe2\x80\x94 that editors take false comfort and neglect the most important element: constant conversation with freelancers over every assignment about the paper\xe2\x80\x99s expectations. Then, even when considering asking someone else for free air fare or taking a junket, a freelancer would know better, or stop and ask.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI do wish someone had kind of beaten me over the head,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tripsas, whose first column was already in print before she received her conflict-of-interest questionnaire.'b'Thankfully, 2009 ended better than it began. Economists talk about green shoots of recovery taking hold. Consumer confidence has improved. Equity markets have soared. But for all the progress, the American economy remains extremely vulnerable.'b'To understand those economic risks, it is worth considering Japan\xe2\x80\x99s experience in the 1990s. A bursting housing bubble there sparked a banking crisis that was followed by a decade of economic stagnation.'b'The Japanese government lacked the resolve to do what was necessary. It failed to fix its banks and stopped its early fiscal stimulus before recovery had taken hold, leaving the economy all too vulnerable to outside shocks, including the Asian currency crisis and the dot-com collapse in 2001. Japan\xe2\x80\x99s annual growth rate \xe2\x80\x94 which had averaged 4 percent since 1973 \xe2\x80\x94 slowed to less than 1  percent, on average, from 1992 to 2003.'b'President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s economic advisers have learned from Japan\xe2\x80\x99s experience. But they may not have learned enough. (Certainly Congress has not been paying attention.) If they are not careful, they could end up repeating some of the big mistakes that condemned Japan\xe2\x80\x99s economy to a lost decade.'b'The green shoots are barely out of the ground and Republicans and conservative Democrats in Congress are already demanding that the administration \xe2\x80\x9cdo something\xe2\x80\x9d to cut the budget gap. We worry that the political drumbeat may be too hard to resist. In 1997, after three years of tepid growth, the Japanese government stopped its stimulus: it raised a consumption tax, ended a temporary income tax cut, increased social security premiums and nipped recovery in the bud.'b'Japan\xe2\x80\x99s other blunder was its unwillingness to fix its banks. Regulators did not force banks and indebted firms to recognize trillions of yen worth of bad loans. Banks trundled along like zombies, squandering credit to keep insolvent firms on their feet. When the Asian currency crisis hit, many undercapitalized banks toppled over.'b'The Obama administration has not been quite as forgiving with the banks, but it still has been nowhere near aggressive enough. The regulatory reform meant to curb bankers\xe2\x80\x99 destructive risk-taking is moving at a snail\xe2\x80\x99s pace through Congress. While the Treasury has forced banks to raise capital, many \xe2\x80\x94 including some of the largest \xe2\x80\x94 remain thinly capitalized and weak.'b'Banks have been unwilling to sell bad assets and take a loss. They remain stuffed with risky commercial and residential mortgages and consumer debt. Bankers, meanwhile, have made things worse by insisting on paying themselves huge bonuses after profiting so handsomely from the taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 tolerance and largess.'b'There are two big problems with that. The bankers\xe2\x80\x99 taste for risk has not been in any way quenched. And the American public is, justifiably, fed up. That means if there is another bank crisis \xe2\x80\x94 say when the Federal Reserve takes away the punch bowl of low interest rates \xe2\x80\x94 it will be a lot harder to get Congress to approve another bailout, no matter how necessary.'b'The Obama administration has still done a far better job \xe2\x80\x94 up to now \xe2\x80\x94 in addressing the crisis than Japan\xe2\x80\x99s governments did. As dismal as 2009 was, it pales when compared with what would have happened without the fiscal stimulus and the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s enormous monetary boost.'b'The White House is now pushing another mini-stimulus plan for next year. Chances are it will need to do a lot more to push reform and boost the economy. If there is an overarching lesson from Japan\xe2\x80\x99s lost decade, it is that half measures don\xe2\x80\x99t pay.'b'More than 200 years late \xe2\x80\x94 31 if you count from the tribe\xe2\x80\x99s petition \xe2\x80\x94 the federal government has acknowledged that the Shinnecocks of Southampton, Long Island, are an Indian tribe. Settling that question raises new ones. The Shinnecocks will almost certainly try to build a casino \xe2\x80\x94 they have been lobbying as hard for one as they have for recognition \xe2\x80\x94 but how big, and where?'b'The \xe2\x80\x9cwhere\xe2\x80\x9d is an especially interesting question. Casinos are usually built on reservation land. The Shinnecocks live on the East End of Long Island, a national depository of wealth, privilege and privacy. When the tribe jumped the gun a few years back and bulldozed part of its property for a bingo hall, the not-in-my-backyard opposition erupting from the dunes and privet hedges was ferocious. And that was just a skirmish.'b'That is probably why the Shinnecocks are exploring other sites in Suffolk County, at two New York racetracks and in the Catskills. But building an off-reservation casino is itself fraught with uncertainty and regulatory hurdles. The tribe could end up spending many years and lots of money chasing something that is a guaranteed winner only for lobbyists and consultants.'b'Casinos are also a magnet for tainted money and a handmaiden to addiction, crime and other social ills. That is why we would urge the tribe to spend its energy on finding other ways to leverage its valuable real estate.'b'A casino is, after all, only a means to an end \xe2\x80\x94 to economic vitality, greater respect, a better future for the tribe\xe2\x80\x99s 1,000 members. The Shinnecocks are now in a much better position to pursue that dream. Lack of federal status did more than hamper the tribe\xe2\x80\x99s quest for gambling riches. It also denied it access to federal programs for housing, health care and education.'b'The Shinnecocks have a long, proud history of self- governance, and advantages that poorer, more remote tribes can only dream of: geography, bargaining power and the support of state officials including Gov. David Paterson, who endorsed their quest for recognition. The good news on recognition would be even better if the tribe could foresee a future apart from slots and dice.'b'Last week felt like a last chance before winter. The snow melted, dying back until the vole trails became thin green paths through the remains of whiteness. The ice unbound itself from the rim of the horse tanks. One warm morning, a bat fluttered past my head, resting on the clapboards for a moment and then arcing around to the east side of the house. Despite the sense of relenting, the ground was still frozen solid.'b'And then it began to snow again \xe2\x80\x94 light, voluminous snow, swelling in the air and muffling every detail. Watching it, I felt a sense of intention in the weather, as if those mild days were just a way of clearing the canvas, scraping away the old paint, before laying down a fresh ground of white.'b'It is less a fall of snow than a fog, the flakes suspended in air, darkening and brightening the day at the same time. The birds line up on the boughs of a pignut hickory, and swoop on to the feeders by twos and threes, titmice and juncos, a crowd of chickadees and a demure pair of cardinals. Woodpeckers cling to the suet feeders, and squirrels rummage among the shells on the porch. Everyone eats in a kind of mutual disturbance, which the falling snow intensifies.'b'I know from the weather maps that the edge of the storm is only a few miles to the west. It will be shutting down soon in a last bank of dark gray clouds, so dark that the blue sky shining through their gaps will be the color of diluted turquoise. And then the sun will beam through the cold air and the sense of urgency will dissipate.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m reluctant to see the storm finish. At this time of year \xe2\x80\x94 winter only begun \xe2\x80\x94 I still feel the way I did when I was a child. I want the snow to keep falling, soft and deep into the night and the next day and the week after, until I wake up in a world completely unknown. In that world, there will be no melting back to the vole trails, no going back to spring. There will be only an unknown track into the snowbound woods.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Big Zero\xe2\x80\x9d'b' (column, Dec. 28):'b'Yes, Paul Krugman is right.

Or are they simply the latest editions of the books produced by publishers like Random House?'b'It was an old-fashioned book publisher who decided that William Styron\xe2\x80\x99s work was worth reading in the first place. Hiram Haydn signed him up and edited his debut novel, \xe2\x80\x9cLie Down in Darkness,\xe2\x80\x9d which Random House published in 1951. As Mr. Styron himself later said, both Mr. Haydn and his subsequent Random House editor, Robert Loomis, had a \xe2\x80\x9cgenius for catching me out in my weakest or most slipshod moments, but never tried to impose their ideas on mine. It\xe2\x80\x99s the moral support that\xe2\x80\x99s been so valuable.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the course of his career, Mr. Styron published nine other books with Random House, each of which received the scrupulous line-by-line attention of one of the great editors of the time. Each was also copy-edited through several stages of proof that were passed back and forth among the copy editor, Mr. Styron and Mr. Loomis.'b'The appropriate typeface was chosen and submitted to the author for approval by Random House\xe2\x80\x99s designers, and a binding was selected. A dust jacket \xe2\x80\x94 often involving art specially commissioned by Random House to represent and advertise the book \xe2\x80\x94 was designed, and copy intended to induce reviewers and readers to pick the book up and pay attention to it was written.'b'Employees of the Random House publicity department then talked about the books with anyone who would listen and submitted bound proofs to newspapers and magazines for review, while the Random House sales department obtained advance orders from booksellers. The Random House rights department, working in concert with Mr. Styron\xe2\x80\x99s agent, pitched the books to magazine editors, movie agents and foreign publishers.'b'Large-print versions for the reading-impaired and audio versions were produced, marketed and sold by Random House or licensed to others, and, after a suitable period, cheaper paperback versions were also published.'b'For each book, Random House exploited its edition in every then-conceivable format. And through it all, Mr. Loomis and his colleagues kept in touch with Mr. Styron, monitoring the life of the book through its various permutations.'b'Recently, a new, previously unimagined version of the work became a possibility: Mr. Styron\xe2\x80\x99s books can now be reproduced and distributed electronically.'b'The author\xe2\x80\x99s heirs hold the copyright to his work. But should another company be able to issue e-book versions of Random House\xe2\x80\x99s editions without its involvement?  An e-book version of Mr. Styron\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Confessions of Nat Turner\xe2\x80\x9d will contain more than the author\xe2\x80\x99s original words. It will also comprise Mr. Loomis\xe2\x80\x99s editing, as well as all the labor of copy editing, designing and producing, not to mention marketing and sales, that went into making it a desirable candidate for e-book distribution. Mr. Styron\xe2\x80\x99s books took the form they have, are what they are today, not only because of his remarkable genius but also, as he himself acknowledged, because of the dedicated work of those at Random House.'b'In this increasingly virtual age of open access and universal availability, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for readers to keep in mind what it is that a publisher does for an author. A publisher \xe2\x80\x94 and I write as one \xe2\x80\x94 does far more than print and sell a book. It selects, nurtures, positions and promotes the writer\xe2\x80\x99s work.'b'An e-book distributor is not a publisher, but rather a purveyor of work that has already been created. In this way, e-books are no different from large-print or paperback or audio versions. They are simply the latest link in an unbroken editorial chain, the newest format for one of man\xe2\x80\x99s greatest inventions: the constantly evolving, imperishable book \xe2\x80\x94 given its definitive form by a publisher.'b'Even if someday, God forbid, books are no longer printed, they will still need the thought and care and dedication that Mr. Loomis and his colleagues put into producing William Styron\xe2\x80\x99s work for nearly 60 years. Some things never change.'b'Nairobi, Kenya'b'LAST Monday, Somali pirates seized two more prizes in rapid succession: a British-flagged chemical tanker and a Greek bulk carrier, bringing the current number of captive ships to 12 and the number of hostage mariners to at least 278. Despite the presence in the region of three multinational naval task forces comprising about 30 warships, there were 68 successful pirate hijackings in 2009, compared with 49 one year earlier.'b'If the New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day capture of an Indonesian tanker is any indication, 2010 will not herald an end to the attacks. As one Somali pirate told me last year: \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes, we capture ships when [warships] are right around us. We don\xe2\x80\x99t care about them. They\xe2\x80\x99re not going to stop us.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed, the pirates\xe2\x80\x99 range has expanded to more than 1,000 miles off the Somali coast \xe2\x80\x94 as far as the Seychelles \xe2\x80\x94 and the futility of an exclusively naval strategy is increasingly apparent.'b'The situation is not without hope. There might be another way to make greater strides against pirates. However, it would involve allying ourselves with a place that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist: the autonomous region of Puntland, Somalia.'b'To the ancient Egyptians, the land of Punt was a source of munificent treasures and bountiful wealth. Modern  Puntland, a self-governing region in northeastern Somalia, may or may not be the successor to the Punt of legend. As I discovered when I first visited, last year, it contained none of the gold and ebony that dazzled the Egyptians, save perhaps for the color of the sand and the skin of the nomadic goat and camel herders who have inhabited it for centuries.'b'I arrived in Puntland in the frayed seat of a 1970s Soviet propeller plane. The 737s of Dubai, with their meal service and functioning seatbelts, were a distant memory; the plane I was on was not even allowed to land in Dubai, and the same probably went for the unkempt, ill-tempered Ukrainian pilot.'b'The state of the sole road running through Puntland\xe2\x80\x99s north-south axis is symbolic of the neglect the region experienced under its former dictator, Siad Barre \xe2\x80\x94 who was overthrown in 1991 at the onset of the Somali civil war \xe2\x80\x94 and from the international community since. The three-decade-old Chinese concrete was crumbling and corroded, with craterous potholes turning my 150-mile journey from the airport into a four- or five-hour jolting ordeal. It was the dry season, and parched shrubs dotted the barren landscape; the dust clung to my skin until my shirt felt like fine sandpaper.'b'I spent the next six weeks living in the regional capital, Garowe, amid the boom and bustle created by the recent influx of pirates\xe2\x80\x99 wealth from nearby coastal bases of operation. Conducting research with a local journalist \xe2\x80\x94 who is the son of Puntland\xe2\x80\x99s president, Abdirahman Farole \xe2\x80\x94 I gained an inside view into the workings of this fledgling and largely autonomous state within Somalia.'b'Contrary to the oft-recycled one-liners found in most news reports, Somalia is not a country ruled by anarchy. Indeed, it is a mischaracterization to even speak of Somalia as a uniform entity. It is an amalgamation of quasi-independent regions like Puntland, which was founded in 1998 as a tribal sanctuary for the hundreds of thousands of Darod-clan people fleeing massacres in the south. Puntland comprises one-quarter to one-third of Somalia\xe2\x80\x99s total land mass (depending on whom you talk to) and almost half of its coastline.'b'Straddling the shipping bottleneck of the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean, it was the natural candidate to become the epicenter of the recent outbreak of Somali piracy. But inhabitants of Puntland enjoy a relatively violence-free existence, little troubled by the turmoil to the south. The region has experienced only one low-intensity civil conflict since its founding, a brief dispute in 2001 and 2002 between the presidential incumbent, Abdullahi Yusuf, and his challenger, Jama Ali Jama.'b'In any serious attempt to combat piracy, Puntland must play an integral role. Yet it is not recognized as a legitimate actor in the region  and has been financially abandoned by the international community, which continues to ignore the reality on the ground in favor of the flimsy transitional federal government, a 550-member parliamentary hodgepodge ruling over a few checkpoints in Mogadishu, hundreds of miles from any real pirate activity. A collection of ex-warlords and self-styled moderate Islamists, this is a government that does not govern; its M.P.\xe2\x80\x99s have no constituents, its ministers no portfolios, and it exercises nothing close to control of the violence within its supposed borders.'b'The perpetuation of this farce is inexplicable. At an April 2009 donor conference in Brussels, the international community pledged $250 million to finance, among other things, the training of a police force and the upkeep of the African Union mission in Mogadishu. This, despite the fact that politicians of the transitional government have a talent for making money vanish into thin air. A far better use of aid would be to augment Puntland\xe2\x80\x99s paltry $18 million budget, which is almost exclusively derived from port taxes.'b'Two weeks into my visit, I accompanied President Farole to Bossaso,  Puntland\xe2\x80\x99s sweltering northern metropolis (and largest city), on his first domestic tour since his election. Addressing an assembly of Somali businessmen one evening, he appealed for donations to pay for a list of absurdly modest projects: building a four-mile road from the livestock-inspection station to the port; replacing road signs on the lone highway, long ago stripped bare for the valuable metal; constructing a small hospital. As the members of the transitional government huddle in their Mogadishu barracks, waiting to collect their welfare checks, Mr. Farole is reduced to roaming the countryside, begging for alms.'b'Despite Puntland\xe2\x80\x99s limited capacity, Mr. Farole is committed to taking the fight to the pirates. Indeed, the government of Puntland has been advocating a strict policy of nonnegotiation with pirates since the beginning of the crisis. On those occasions that Puntland\xe2\x80\x99s tiny (and now defunct) coast guard has been given the authority by shipowners to liberate hijacked vessels, the pirates have tended to melt away, content to keep their lives rather than their prize.'b'Successful land operations in Puntland\xe2\x80\x99s coastal towns have accompanied these marine assaults. One afternoon, while in Bossaso, the president personally led a sudden raid on a gang of pirates preparing to shove off into the Gulf of Aden. These would-be hijackers joined the more than 100 convicted pirates, many with life sentences, being held in Puntland\xe2\x80\x99s lone prison.'b'It is unclear if an all-out assault would have worked with the pirates on board a multimillion-dollar lottery ticket like the Saudi oil supertanker Sirius Star, which was released last year after a huge ransom was paid. But the effect of international shipping companies consistently giving in to pirates\xe2\x80\x99 demands is clear: ransoms keep creeping steadily upward, highlighted by a reported $4 million paid to release the Chinese bulk carrier MV De Xin Hai on Dec. 28 \xe2\x80\x94 the highest publicly announced amount to date. Unless a concerted effort is made to prevent shipping companies from paying these ransoms, the hands of both international navies and the local authorities will be tied \xe2\x80\x94 and the pirates know it.'b'Meanwhile, the Puntland security forces, at sea and on land, are woefully undermanned, underfinanced and underequipped. The terrain encompassing the eastern coastal towns, including the infamous pirate haven of Eyl, is rugged and roadless. Any land operation has to originate in Bossaso or Garowe, home to the only military bases in the region, and it would involve transporting troops up to hundreds of miles by four-wheel drive. The logistical difficulties in deploying such a response make successful results extremely rare, and almost entirely dependent on timely local intelligence gathering. Without ample international assistance, Puntland\xe2\x80\x99s law-enforcement capacity is unlikely to improve.'b'Buttressing Puntland will not bring an end to the piracy problem. Because of a combination of increasing government security sweeps, hostility from the local people and the growing preference of the pirates to work in the relatively vacant Indian Ocean (and not the heavily patrolled Gulf of Aden), the locus of attacks has begun to shift from Eyl to ports farther south, particularly Harardhere.'b'But Puntland remains crucial, and success there might prove a model for similar action in Harardhere, which is governed by another regional administration distinct from the turbulent south, albeit an extremely weak one.'b'The way to begin is by siphoning to Puntland some of the money flowing into the bottomless coffers of the transitional government. If the international community is serious about ending Somali piracy, it must engage Puntland as a full-time partner.'b'Acknowledging its existence would be a sound first step.'b'Bush administration officials came up with all kinds of ridiculously offensive rationalizations for torturing prisoners. It\xe2\x80\x99s not torture if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean it to be. It\xe2\x80\x99s not torture if you don\xe2\x80\x99t nearly kill the victim. It\xe2\x80\x99s not torture if the president says it\xe2\x80\x99s not torture.'b'It was deeply distressing to watch the  United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit sink to that standard in April when it dismissed a civil case brought by four former Guant\xc3\xa1namo detainees never charged with any offense. The court said former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and the senior military officers charged in the complaint could not be held responsible for violating the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 rights because at the time of their detention, between 2002 and 2004, it was not \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d that torture was illegal.'b'The Supreme Court could have corrected that outlandish reading of the Constitution, legal precedent, and domestic and international statutes and treaties. Instead, last month, the justices abdicated their legal and moral duty and declined to review the case.'b'A denial of certiorari is not a ruling on the merits. But the justices surely understood that their failure to accept the case would further undermine the rule of law.'b'In effect, the Supreme Court has granted the government immunity for subjecting people in its custody to terrible mistreatment. It has deprived victims of a remedy and Americans of government accountability, while further damaging the country\xe2\x80\x99s standing in the world.'b'Contrary to the view of the lower appellate court, it was crystal clear that torture inflicted anywhere is illegal long before the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 ruling that prisoners at Guant\xc3\xa1namo, de facto United States territory, have a constitutional right to habeas corpus. Moreover, the shield of qualified immunity was not raised in good faith. Officials decided to hold detainees offshore at Guant\xc3\xa1namo precisely to try to avoid claims from victims for conduct the officials knew was illegal.'b'Reversing the Circuit Court would not have ended the matter. The plaintiffs would still have had to prove their case at trial. They deserved that chance. There are those who oppose trying to punish Bush-era lawlessness \xe2\x80\x94 some who argue that America should not look backward and some who excuse that lawlessness. But the rule of law rests on scrutinizing evidence of past behavior to establish accountability, confer justice and deter bad behavior in the future.'b'President Obama, much to his credit, has forsworn the use of torture, but politics and policy makers change and democracy cannot rely merely on the good will of one president and his aides. Such good will did not exist in the last administration. And the inhumane and illegal treatment of detainees could make a return in a future administration unless the Supreme Court sends a firm message that ordering torture is a grievous violation of fundamental rights.'b'Anyone who doubts the degree of executive branch pliability in this realm needs to consider this: The party that urged the Supreme Court not to grant the victims\xe2\x80\x99 appeal because the illegality of torture was not \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d was the Obama Justice Department.'b'Even as many members of Congress resist as too hard or too costly the steps necessary to address global warming, American cities and states \xe2\x80\x94 the largest of which have carbon footprints bigger than those of most nations \xe2\x80\x94 have quietly been making serious commitments to curb emissions. Instead of finding reasons to do nothing, Congress should build on these actions to fashion a national response to climate change.'b'According to a recent 'b'study'b' by Environment America, an advocacy group, about half of the states have broad plans and specific regulations aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions. When fully realized, these actions would cut emissions by over 7 percent between now and 2020 \xe2\x80\x94 a sizable distance toward the 17 percent reductions President Obama promised at Copenhagen.'b'About half the reductions would come from proposed emission limits in six big states, plus a regional cap on power plant emissions adopted by New York and nine other Northeastern states. The other half would result from legally required increases in the use of alternative energy sources like wind \xe2\x80\x94 29 states have approved such mandates \xe2\x80\x94 as well as stronger state and city efficiency standards for appliances, lighting and buildings.'b'California\xe2\x80\x99s goal of cutting greenhouse gases by one-quarter by 2020 is plausible partly because the state has been so successful in improving the efficiency of its power plants and buildings, promoting renewable energy and insisting on fuel-efficient vehicles. The state recently approved strict new energy-efficiency requirements for television sets, which now account for 10 percent of the average household\xe2\x80\x99s energy use but are largely unregulated. The rules will save consumers $1 billion in energy bills and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by three million tons each year. Though that is just under 1 percent of current emissions, it is small steps like these that will take California to its overall goal.'b'In another positive move, New York City has adopted a new law requiring periodic \xe2\x80\x9cenergy audits\xe2\x80\x9d on 22,000 large commercial and residential buildings that account for half of the city\xe2\x80\x99s carbon dioxide emissions.'b'Owners will not be required to make renovations under the law,  although this idea should be revisited if the economy improves.  The expectation is that the prospect of saving energy costs over the long term will lead to major investments in more efficient heating and cooling systems. The law is a critical component of Mayor Michael Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s goal of reducing New York City\xe2\x80\x99s carbon emissions by 30 percent by 2030.'b'A national policy endorsed by Congress that puts a price on greenhouse gas emissions  is urgently needed. These states and cities shed a hopeful light on what this nation and others can and must achieve.'b'The United States, which has less than 5 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s population, has about one-quarter of its prisoners. But the relentless rise in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s prison population has suddenly slowed as many states discover that it is simply too expensive to overincarcerate.'b'Between 1987 and 2007 the prison population nearly tripled, from 585,000 to almost 1.6 million. Much of that increase occurred in states \xe2\x80\x94 many with falling crime rates \xe2\x80\x94 that had adopted overly harsh punishment policies, such as the \xe2\x80\x9cthree strikes and you\xe2\x80\x99re out\xe2\x80\x9d rule and drug laws requiring that nonviolent drug offenders be locked away.'b'These policies have been hugely costly. According to the Pew Center on the States, state spending from general funds on corrections increased from $10.6 billion in 1987 to more than $44 billion in 2007, a 127 percent increase in inflation-adjusted dollars. In the same period, adjusted spending on higher education increased only 21 percent.'b'In 2008, the explosion of the prison population ground to a near halt, according to 'b'data'b' released last  month by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. About 739,000 inmates were admitted to federal and state facilities, only about 3,500 more than were released.'b'One factor seems to be tight budgets as states decide to release nonviolent offenders early. This can not only save money. If done correctly, it can also be very sound social policy. Many nonviolent offenders can be dealt with more effectively and more cheaply through treatment and jobs programs.'b'Michigan, which has been hard hit by the recession, has done a particularly good job of releasing people who do not need to be in prison. As the American Civil Liberties Union\xe2\x80\x99s National Prison Project details in a 'b'new report'b', Michigan reduced its prison population by about 8 percent between March 2007 and November 2009 by taking smart steps, notably doing more to get nonviolent drug offenders out, while helping in their transition to a productive, and crime-free, life.'b'Not every state has gotten the message. Florida, for example,  has a state law mandating that all prisoners serve a high percentage of their sentence, which is both dubious corrections policy and terrible fiscal policy.'b'For many years, driving up prison populations has been an easy thing for elected officials to do, popular with voters and powerful corrections officer unions. The new incarceration figures suggest, however, that in the current hard economic times, strapped states are beginning to realize that they do not have the money to keep people in prison who do not need to be there.'b'The nation\xe2\x80\x99s hard times are proving to be boom times for the lobbying industry in Washington. Lobbyists are expected to easily break their  record of $3.3 billion in annual business, raising an inevitable question: How much more in special-interest donations will be bagged by lawmakers as they are furiously lobbied on everything from health care reform to economic regulation?'b'No one confesses to explicit quid pro quo crudity. But the power of lobbyists as they channel money and urge favor for rich clients is a gripping, and so far immutable, fact of political life. It needs to change.'b'To his credit, President Obama has delivered some promised reforms in the executive branch, particularly by banning administration officials from doubling back as lobbyists across his time in office. But the moneyed clout of K Street makes it urgent that Mr. Obama deliver on an even bigger promise. He must repair the damage done by his unfortunate rejection last year of publicly subsidized election financing as an alternative to the temptations of the special-interest trough.'b'Mr. Obama chose unlimited private financing to buoy his campaign to a huge electioneering advantage. He pronounced the leaner public subsidy option used by major candidates since Watergate to be a \xe2\x80\x9cbroken system\xe2\x80\x9d outdated by modern campaign costs.'b'Mr. Obama made much of a promise to fix it, once elected. So, the time has come to fix it.'b'He needs to set a strong example for Congress and the status quo laziness of Washington and move convincingly for revival of the public option, which served the nation well. This would create pressure for a similar system of restraint by Congressional candidates now basted with special-interest money. As the lucre builds to critical mass, a public option for Congressional and presidential candidates becomes ever more vital.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Hard Choice for a Comfortable Death: Drug-Induced Sleep'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cMonths to Live\xe2\x80\x9d series, front page, Dec. 27):'b'Bravo to The New York Times for its in-depth reporting on palliative sedation.

First, most practitioners, patients and families arrive at palliative sedation without crossing a clear threshold or boundary. In almost all cases multiple other drug and nondrug treatments have already been brought to bear on the patient\xe2\x80\x99s suffering without relief.'b'Many of the drug treatments result in some degree of sedation, the acceptable level of which is determined jointly by patient and physician. At the point of so-called palliative sedation there is no alternative other than uncontrolled pain and distress.'b'Second, the article perpetuates the myth that death is hastened by pain relievers and sedatives in these circumstances. Sufficient research exists to contradict these concerns and suggests that far from hastening death, such interventions appear to have a neutral effect on survival and may actually prolong life while relieving suffering. How so? A patient with uncontrolled pain is under severe cardiovascular stress from the pain itself. A rapid heart rate, shallow breathing and agitation will themselves shorten life as death nears. Relief of the pain calms the heart and helps the patient breathe more effectively.'b'Politicians have done much to raise fear around care at the end of life; we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t add to it.'b'Steven Radwany'b'\n   Akron, Ohio, Dec.'b''b'29, 2009'b''b'The writer is medical director of palliative care and hospice services for Summa Health System.'b''b'\xc2\x95'b'To the Editor:'b'I am concerned about your article\xe2\x80\x99s portrayal of palliative sedation.

Over the last 20 years, the knowledge about how to manage symptoms \xe2\x80\x94 including agitation like that of the patient profiled in your article, Leo Oltzik \xe2\x80\x94 has grown exponentially.'b'Too often, palliative sedation is used as a first-line therapy rather than a therapy of last resort. In some units, palliative sedation is used on one-third to one-half of patients. That is far too often. Most expert providers will use palliative sedation extremely rarely in a 20- to 25-year career.  Further, expert providers do not use palliative sedation lightly. They consult with colleagues to make sure that all other means of symptom management have been tried.'b'Finally, terminal sedation implies, as a colleague of mine says, \xe2\x80\x9ca one-way ticket.\xe2\x80\x9d Palliative sedation is usually done with the intent of allowing someone to be awakened after a day or so to see if the symptoms are alleviated.'b'Margaret M.

The next G.D.P. report is likely to show solid growth in late 2009. There will be lots of bullish commentary \xe2\x80\x94 and the calls we\xe2\x80\x99re already hearing for an end to stimulus, for reversing the steps the government and the Federal Reserve took to prop up the economy, will grow even louder.'b'But if those calls are heeded, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be repeating the great mistake of 1937, when the Fed and the Roosevelt administration decided that the Great Depression was over, that it was time for the economy to throw away its crutches. Spending was cut back, monetary policy was tightened \xe2\x80\x94 and the economy promptly plunged back into the depths.'b'This shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be happening. Both Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, and Christina Romer, who heads President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Council of Economic Advisers, are scholars of the Great Depression. Ms. Romer has warned explicitly against re-enacting the events of 1937. But those who remember the past sometimes repeat it anyway.'b'As you read the economic news, it will be important to remember, first of all, that blips \xe2\x80\x94 occasional good numbers, signifying nothing \xe2\x80\x94 are common even when the economy is, in fact, mired in a prolonged slump. In early 2002, for example, initial reports showed the economy growing at a 5.8 percent annual rate. But the unemployment rate kept rising for another year.'b'And in early 1996 preliminary reports showed the Japanese economy growing at an annual rate of more than 12 percent, leading to triumphant proclamations that \xe2\x80\x9cthe economy has finally entered a phase of self-propelled recovery.\xe2\x80\x9d In fact, Japan was only halfway through its lost decade.'b'Such blips are often, in part, statistical illusions. But even more important, they\xe2\x80\x99re usually caused by an \xe2\x80\x9cinventory bounce.\xe2\x80\x9d When the economy slumps, companies typically find themselves with large stocks of unsold goods. To work off their excess inventories, they slash production; once the excess has been disposed of, they raise production again, which shows up as a burst of growth in G.D.P. Unfortunately, growth caused by an inventory bounce is a one-shot affair unless underlying sources of demand, such as consumer spending and long-term investment, pick up.'b'Which brings us to the still grim fundamentals of the economic situation.'b'During the good years of the last decade, such as they were, growth was driven by a housing boom and a consumer spending surge. Neither is coming back. There can\xe2\x80\x99t be a new housing boom while the nation is still strewn with vacant houses and apartments left behind by the previous boom, and consumers \xe2\x80\x94 who are $11 trillion poorer than they were before the housing bust \xe2\x80\x94 are in no position to return to the buy-now-save-never habits of yore.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s left? A boom in business investment would be really helpful right now. But it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to see where such a boom would come from: industry is awash in excess capacity, and commercial rents are plunging in the face of a huge oversupply of office space.'b'Can exports come to the rescue? For a while, a falling U.S. trade deficit helped cushion the economic slump. But the deficit is widening again, in part because China and other surplus countries are refusing to let their currencies adjust.'b'So the odds are that any good economic news you hear in the near future will be a blip, not an indication that we\xe2\x80\x99re on our way to sustained recovery. But will policy makers misinterpret the news and repeat the mistakes of 1937? Actually, they already are.'b'The Obama fiscal stimulus plan is expected to have its peak effect on G.D.P. and jobs around the middle of this year, then start fading out. That\xe2\x80\x99s far too early: why withdraw support in the face of continuing mass unemployment? Congress should have enacted a second round of stimulus months ago, when it became clear that the slump was going to be deeper and longer than originally expected. But nothing was done \xe2\x80\x94 and the illusory good numbers we\xe2\x80\x99re about to see will probably head off any further possibility of action.'b'Meanwhile, all the talk at the Fed is about the need for an \xe2\x80\x9cexit strategy\xe2\x80\x9d from its efforts to support the economy. One of those efforts, purchases of long-term U.S. government debt, has already come to an end. It\xe2\x80\x99s widely expected that another, purchases of mortgage-backed securities, will end in a few months. This amounts to a monetary tightening, even if the Fed doesn\xe2\x80\x99t raise interest rates directly \xe2\x80\x94 and there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of pressure on Mr. Bernanke to do that too.'b'Will the Fed realize, before it\xe2\x80\x99s too late, that the job of fighting the slump isn\xe2\x80\x99t finished? Will Congress do the same? If they don\xe2\x80\x99t, 2010 will be a year that began in false economic hope and ended in grief.'b'Here in the United States, we spent New Year\xe2\x80\x99s weekend bidding good riddance to the awful, awful aughties \xe2\x80\x94 a miserable decade of bubbles and busts, rising health care bills and soaring deficits, domestic terror attacks and overseas quagmires.'b'Elsewhere, though, the decade\xe2\x80\x99s turn was probably flavored by nostalgia. For much of the world, the last 10 years was a period to savor \xe2\x80\x94 an era of impressive economic growth, ever-higher life expectancy, relative peace and steady progress against poverty.'b'A billion-odd Chinese had a pretty good decade, and so did a billion Indians: their economies just about doubled in size, minting new millionaires and lifting countless peasants into a growing middle class. Brazil boomed, Indonesia prospered, and even Africa enjoyed a season of substantial growth.

The enormous Clinton-era gulf between the United States and its competitors was bound to narrow eventually. For now, at least, our decline is only relative \xe2\x80\x94 from hyperpower back to superpower, from the only nation that mattered to the one that matters most.'b'But as the 2010s begin, there\xe2\x80\x99s reason to worry that America has further to fall. Our politics are polarized, our finances are still overleveraged, and our society is increasingly segregated  \xe2\x80\x94  by income, education and family structure \xe2\x80\x94 between a thriving elite and a struggling working class. Worse, neither political party seems capable of forging a new policy synthesis to reckon with our domestic challenges.'b'In the unhappy aughts, we witnessed the exhaustion of Reaganomics. A quarter-century after Ronald Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s mix of tax cuts and deregulation revived American competitiveness, George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to imitate the Gipper produced only wage stagnation and skyrocketing debt.'b'This failure helped cost Republicans their majority. But instead of seeking a new post-Reagan consensus, the Obama Democrats are returning to their party\xe2\x80\x99s long-running pursuit of European-style social democracy  \xe2\x80\x94  by micromanaging industry, pouring money into entitlement and welfare programs, and binding the economy in a web of new taxes and regulations.'b'These policies may help smooth over the inequalities that have opened in our national life since the 1970s. But they threaten to cost America its position in the world along the way.'b'Social democracy has its benefits, but global competitiveness isn\xe2\x80\x99t one of them. As Jim Manzi points out, in an essay on \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Keeping America\xe2\x80\x99s Edge'b'\xe2\x80\x9d  in the latest issue of National Affairs, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom 1980 through today, America\xe2\x80\x99s share of global output has been constant at about 21 percent. Europe\xe2\x80\x99s share, meanwhile, has been collapsing in the face of global competition \xe2\x80\x94 going from a little less than 40 percent of global production in the 1970s to about 25 percent today.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If we hope to avoid a similar plunge, the Obama-era tilt toward government intervention needs to be balanced, and soon, by a new growth-oriented agenda. This will require more than the rote invocations of Reaganism that too many Republican politicians have fallen back on, however. The age of sweeping tax cuts financed by deficit spending is over. The policies of the 1980s will not keep America competitive in the 2010s. Our challenges are new, and we must think and act anew.'b'Manzi\xe2\x80\x99s National Affairs essay, a tour d\xe2\x80\x99horizon of our socioeconomic situation, provides a solid place to start. He proposes a fourfold agenda: Unwind the partnerships forged between Big Business and Big Government in the wake of the 2008 crash; seek financial regulations that \xe2\x80\x9ccontain busts,\xe2\x80\x9d by segregating high-risk transactions from lower-risk enterprises; deregulate the public school system, to let a thousand charter schools and start-ups bloom; and shift our immigration policy away from low-skilled immigration, and toward the recruitment of high-skilled  \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s from around the globe.'b'To this list, I would add tax reform and entitlement reform. The former should broaden the tax base while cutting taxes on work, childrearing and investment. The latter should means-test both Social Security and Medicare, reducing both programs\xe2\x80\x99 spending on well-off retirees rather than questing fruitlessly for their privatization.'b'This is a right-of-center agenda, broadly speaking, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also one that you could imagine attracting bipartisan support, even in the current polarized environment.'b'Which is as it should be \xe2\x80\x94 since in the quest to make the 2010s a far, far better era than the grueling decade America has just escaped, we\xe2\x80\x99re all in this together.'b'An earlier version of this column incorrectly identified the elected official from South Carolina who assaulted a senator with a cane in 1856. He was a member of the House of Representatives, not a fellow senator.'b'The United States opens this decade in a sour mood. First, Americans are anxious about the future. Sixty-one percent of Americans believe the country is in decline, according to the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey. Only 27 percent feel confident that their children\xe2\x80\x99s generation will be better off than they are.'b'Second, Americans have lost faith in their institutions. During the great moments of social reform, at least 60 percent of Americans trusted government to do the right thing most of the time. Now, only a quarter have that kind of trust.'b'The country is evenly divided about President Obama, but state governments are in disrepute and confidence in Congress is at withering lows. As Frank Newport of the Gallup organization noted in his year-end wrap-up, \xe2\x80\x9cAmericans have less faith in their elected representatives than ever before.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Third, the new administration has not galvanized a popular majority. In almost every sphere of public opinion, Americans are moving away from the administration, not toward it. The Ipsos/McClatchy organizations have been asking voters which party can do the best job of handling a range of 13 different issues. During the first year of the Obama administration, the Republicans gained ground on all 13.'b'The public is not only shifting from left to right. Every single idea associated with the educated class has grown more unpopular over the past year.'b'The educated class believes in global warming, so public skepticism about global warming is on the rise. The educated class supports abortion rights, so public opinion is shifting against them. The educated class supports gun control, so opposition to gun control is mounting.'b'The story is the same in foreign affairs. The educated class is internationalist, so isolationist sentiment is now at an all-time high, according to a Pew Research Center survey. The educated class believes in multilateral action, so the number of Americans who believe we should \xe2\x80\x9cgo our own way\xe2\x80\x9d has risen sharply.'b'A year ago, the Obama supporters were the passionate ones. Now the tea party brigades have all the intensity.'b'The tea party movement is a large, fractious confederation of Americans who are defined by what they are against. They are against the concentrated power of the educated class. They believe big government, big business, big media and the affluent professionals are merging to form self-serving oligarchy \xe2\x80\x94 with bloated government, unsustainable deficits, high taxes and intrusive regulation.'b'The tea party movement is mostly famous for its flamboyant fringe. But it is now more popular than either major party. According to the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 41 percent of Americans have a positive view of the tea party movement. Only 35 percent of Americans have a positive view of the Democrats and only 28 percent have a positive view of the Republican Party.'b'The movement is especially popular among independents. The Rasmussen organization asked independent voters whom they would support in a generic election between a Democrat, a Republican and a tea party candidate. The tea party candidate won, with 33 percent of independents. Undecided came in second with 30 percent. The Democrats came in third with 25 percent and the Republicans fourth with 12 percent.'b'Over the course of this year, the tea party movement will probably be transformed. Right now, it is an amateurish movement with mediocre leadership. But several bright and polished politicians, like Marco Rubio of Florida and Gary Johnson of New Mexico, are unofficially competing to become its de facto leader. If they succeed, their movement is likely to outgrow its crude beginnings and become a major force in American politics. After all, it represents arguments that are deeply rooted in American history.'b'The Obama administration is premised on the conviction that pragmatic federal leaders with professional expertise should have the power to implement programs to solve the country\xe2\x80\x99s problems. Many Americans do not have faith in that sort of centralized expertise or in the political class generally.'b'Moreover, the tea party movement has passion. Think back on the recent decades of American history \xe2\x80\x94 the way the hippies defined the 1960s; the feminists, the 1970s; the Christian conservatives, the 1980s. American history is often driven by passionate outsiders who force themselves into the center of American life.'b'In the near term, the tea party tendency will dominate the Republican Party. It could be the ruin of the party, pulling it in an angry direction that suburban voters will not tolerate. But don\xe2\x80\x99t underestimate the deep reservoirs of public disgust. If there is a double-dip recession, a long period of stagnation, a fiscal crisis, a terrorist attack or some other major scandal or event, the country could demand total change, creating a vacuum that only the tea party movement and its inheritors would be in a position to fill.'b'Personally, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a fan of this movement. But I can certainly see its potential to shape the coming decade.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m starting the new year with the sinking feeling that important opportunities are slipping from the nation\xe2\x80\x99s grasp. Our collective consciousness tends to obsess indiscriminately over one or two issues  \xe2\x80\x94  the would-be bomber on the flight into Detroit, the Tiger Woods saga  \xe2\x80\x94  while enormous problems that should be engaged get short shrift.'b'Staggering numbers of Americans are still unemployed and nearly a quarter of all homeowners owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. Forget the false hope of modestly improving monthly job numbers. The real story right now is the entrenched suffering (with no end in sight) that has been inflicted on scores of millions of working Americans by the Great Recession and the misguided economic policies that preceded it.'b'As The Washington Post reported over the weekend, the entire past decade \xe2\x80\x9cwas the worst for the U.S. economy in modern times.\xe2\x80\x9d There was no net job creation  \xe2\x80\x94  none  \xe2\x80\x94  between December 1999 and now. None!'b''b'The Post article'b' read like a lament, a longing for the U.S. as we\xe2\x80\x99d once known it: \xe2\x80\x9cNo previous decade going back to the 1940s had job growth of less than 20 percent.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Middle-class families in 2008 actually earned less, adjusted for inflation, than they did in 1999. The data for 2009 are not yet in, but you can just imagine what happened to those families in that nightmarish downturn. Small children over the holidays were asking Santa Claus to bring mommy or daddy a job.'b'One in eight Americans, and one in four children, are on food stamps. Some six million Americans, 'b'according to an article in The Times'b' on Sunday, have said that food stamps were their only income.'b'This is a society in deep, deep trouble and the fixes currently in the works are in no way adequate to the enormous challenges we\xe2\x80\x99re facing. For example, an end to the mantra of monthly job losses would undoubtedly be welcomed. But even if the economy manages to create a few hundred thousand new jobs a month, it would do little to haul us from the unemployment pit dug for us by the Great Recession. We need to create more than 10 million new jobs just to get us back to where we were when the recession began in December 2007.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s needed are big new innovative efforts to fashion an economy that creates jobs for all who want and need to work. Just getting us back in fits and starts over the next few years to where we were when the recession began should not be acceptable to anyone. We should be moving now to invest aggressively in a new, greener economy, leading the world in the development of alternative fuels, advanced transportation networks and the effort to restrain the poisoning of the planet. We should be developing an industrial policy that emphasizes the need for America to regain its manufacturing mojo, as tough as that might seem, and we need to rebuild our infrastructure.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re not smart as a nation. We don\xe2\x80\x99t learn from the past, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t plan for the future. We\xe2\x80\x99ve spent a year turning ourselves inside out with arguments of every sort over health care reform only to come up with a bloated, Rube Goldberg legislative mess that protects the insurance and drug industries and does not rein in runaway health care costs.'b'The politicians will be back soon, trust me, screaming about the need to rein in health costs.'b'We keep talking about how essential it is to radically improve public education while, at the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99re closing libraries and firing teachers by the tens of thousands for economic reasons.'b'The fault lies everywhere. The president, the Congress, the news media and the public are all to blame. Shared sacrifice is not part of anyone\xe2\x80\x99s program. Politicians can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to tell the difference between wasteful spending and investments in a more sustainable future. Any talk of raising taxes is considered blasphemous, but there is a constant din of empty yapping about controlling budget deficits.'b'Oh, yes, and we\xe2\x80\x99re fighting two wars.'b'If America can\xe2\x80\x99t change, then the current state of decline is bound to continue. You can\xe2\x80\x99t have a healthy economy with so many millions of people out of work, and there is no plan now that would result in the creation of millions of new jobs any time soon.'b'Voters were primed at the beginning of the Obama administration for fundamental changes that would have altered the trajectory of American life for the better. Politicians of all stripes, many of them catering to the nation\xe2\x80\x99s moneyed interests, fouled that up to a fare-thee-well.'b'Now we\xe2\x80\x99re escalating in Afghanistan, falling back into panic mode over an attempted act of terror and squandering a golden opportunity to build a better society.'b'The financial crisis and Great Recession have their roots in the housing bust. When it comes, a lasting recovery will be evident in a housing rebound. Unfortunately, housing appears to be weakening anew.'b'Figures released last week show that after four months of gains, home prices flattened in October. At that time, low mortgage rates (courtesy of the Federal Reserve) and a home buyer\xe2\x80\x99s tax credit (courtesy of Congress) were fueling sales. That should have propped up prices. But it was not enough to overcome the drag created by a glut of 3.2 million new and existing unsold single-family homes \xe2\x80\x94 about a seven-month supply.'b'The situation, we fear, will only get worse in months to come. Rates already are starting to rise as lenders brace for the Fed to curtail support for mortgage lending as early as the end of March. The home buyer\xe2\x80\x99s tax credit is scheduled to expire at the end of April. And a new flood of foreclosed homes is ready to hit the market.'b'It is increasingly clear that the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s anti-foreclosure effort \xe2\x80\x94 which pressed lenders to reduce interest rates \xe2\x80\x94 isn\xe2\x80\x99t doing nearly enough. High unemployment rates also mean that many borrowers who did qualify for aid have been unable to keep up with even reduced monthly payments.'b'As a result, an estimated 2.4 million foreclosed homes will be added to the existing glut in 2010, driving prices down by another 10 percent or so. That would bring the average decline nationwide to about 40 percent since the peak of the market in 2006.'b'A renewed price drop could usher in a new grim chapter in the foreclosure crisis. Already an estimated one-third of homeowners with a mortgage \xe2\x80\x94 nearly 16 million people \xe2\x80\x94 owe more than their homes are worth; in industry parlance, they are \xe2\x80\x9cunderwater.\xe2\x80\x9d If prices drop further, ever more borrowers will sink ever deeper. Research suggests that the greater the loss of home equity, the greater the likelihood that borrowers will decide to turn in the keys and find a cheaper place to rent.'b'Things didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to get this bad.'b'The best way to modify an underwater loan is to reduce the principal balance, lowering the monthly payment and restoring equity. But for the most part, lenders have refused to reduce principal because it would force them to take an immediate loss on the loan. Lenders also have vehemently \xe2\x80\x94 and successfully \xe2\x80\x94 resisted Congressional efforts to change the law so that bankruptcy courts could reduce the mortgage balances for bankrupt borrowers.'b'The administration decided not to press lenders to grant principal reductions in the flawed belief that simply making payments more affordable would be enough to forestall foreclosures. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t. The administration also didn\xe2\x80\x99t fight for the bankruptcy fix when it was before Congress last year despite President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s campaign promise to do so.'b'The economy is hard pressed to function, let alone thrive, when house prices are falling. As home equity erodes, consumer spending falls and foreclosures increase. Lenders lose the ability and willingness to extend credit and employers are disinclined to hire. True economic recovery is all but impossible.'b'To avert the worst, the White House should alter its loan-modification effort to emphasize principal reduction. Job creation should also be a priority so that rising unemployment does not cause more defaults.'b'We wish we could proclaim a Happy New Year in housing. But until more is done to help struggling homeowners, the portents are not good.'b'Uganda\xe2\x80\x99s government, which has a shameful record of discrimination against gay men and lesbians, is now considering legislation that would impose the death sentence for homosexual behavior. The United States and others need to make clear to the Ugandan government that such barbarism is intolerable and will make it an international pariah.'b'Corruption and repression \xe2\x80\x94 including violence against women and children and abuse of prisoners \xe2\x80\x94 are rife in Uganda. 'b'According to'b' The Times\xe2\x80\x99s Jeffrey Gettleman, officially sanctioned homophobia is particularly acute.

Scott Lively, Caleb Lee Brundidge and Don Schmierer gave a series of talks in Uganda last March to thousands of police officers, teachers and politicians in which, according to participants and audio recordings, they claimed that gays and lesbians are a threat to Bible-based family values.'b'Now the three Americans are saying they had no intention of provoking the anger that, just one month later, led 'b'to the introduction'b' of the Anti-Homosexuality Bill of 2009. You can\xe2\x80\x99t preach hate and not accept responsibility for the way that hate is manifested.'b'We don\xe2\x80\x99t have much hope that they will atone for their acts. But right now the American government, and others, should make clear to Uganda that if this legislation becomes law, it will lose millions of dollars in foreign aid and be shunned globally.'b'A federal appeals court in California has sent a strong warning to law enforcement officials that should make them rethink the all-too-common use of Tasers. It ruled last week that a police officer can be held liable for delivering a high-level electric shock to an unarmed person who poses no immediate threat.'b'Carl Bryan, 21, was driving to his parents\xe2\x80\x99 home in Southern California when he was stopped for speeding. On the same trip, he was pulled over for not wearing a seat belt. Angry at facing a second traffic citation, he hit the steering wheel and yelled expletives to himself. He then stepped out of the car. There is some disagreement over what happened next \xe2\x80\x94 the officer said Mr. Bryan took \xe2\x80\x9cone step\xe2\x80\x9d toward him, while Mr. Bryan said he did not take any. It is undisputed that Mr. Bryan, who was not armed, did not verbally threaten the officer and was not attempting to flee.'b'Without warning, the officer shot Mr. Bryan with a Taser, which uses compressed nitrogen to propel \xe2\x80\x9cprobes\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 aluminum darts connected to wires that deliver a very painful, 1,200-volt electric charge into the target\xe2\x80\x99s muscles. As the current immobilized him, Mr. Bryan fell to the ground, fracturing four teeth. A doctor had to remove one of the probes with a scalpel.'b'Mr. Bryan sued for assault and battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The officer tried to get the suit dismissed on summary judgment, but the trial court ruled that it could go forward. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, based in San Francisco, affirmed that decision by a 3-to-0 vote.'b'The appeals court ruled that the officer was not justified in using the Taser. The evidence showed, the court said, that Mr. Bryan did not pose an immediate threat. It was also relevant that the \xe2\x80\x9ccrime\xe2\x80\x9d he was accused of was a mere traffic violation. Given these facts, the amount of force used was unreasonable.'b'Although the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision is only binding on a group of Western states and territories, all of the more than 17,000 law enforcement agencies across the country that use Tasers should follow its guidance. There are questions about how safe Tasers are in the best of circumstances, an issue that deserves greater study. But it is clear that they are too powerful for use on people who do not pose a serious danger to others.'b'The Tim Burton exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art was sold out, which is not serious deprivation at a museum that also offers C\xc3\xa9zanne\xe2\x80\x99s apples and Matisse\xe2\x80\x99s goldfish.

Our crime rate and prison population have both dropped sharply in the last decade.'b'In searching for a national model, The Times should consider New York\xe2\x80\x99s record.'b'Brian Fischer'b'\n Commissioner, New York State'b'\n Department of Correctional Services'b'\n Albany, Dec. 31, 2009'b''b''b''b'Washington'b'WHY are we reading Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab his Miranda rights instead of taking him somewhere and forcibly finding out where he got the explosive underwear and whatever else he might know about Al Qaeda? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this, as well as the forthcoming federal court  trial of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, proof that the Obama administration doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really regard the war on terrorism as a war?'b'Even worse, isn\xe2\x80\x99t President Obama, despite his statements on terrorism over the weekend, confused and amateurish on this deadly serious issue? At his direction, thousands of American soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq are doing their best to kill terrorists, would-be terrorists and terrorists in training with no thought whatsoever to the legal niceties. Why do these two scoundrels deserve lawyers and a trial?'b'Republican critics like Dick Cheney and Newt Gingrich have raised these questions in the past few days. There\xe2\x80\x99s a gruesome anomaly here, to be sure: the United States government will blow you to smithereens and consider it a good day\xe2\x80\x99s work if you\xe2\x80\x99re a Qaeda member dreaming of jihadist glory while residing somewhere outside the United States, but will pay for your lawyer if you  get caught in the act within our borders. But this anomaly didn\xe2\x80\x99t arise with the Obama administration. It is built into our dual role as a liberal democracy and as a legitimately aggrieved superpower.'b'The charms of liberal democracy sometimes need to be defended by war, and Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s critics are right that war can\xe2\x80\x99t be conducted with a high level of concern for individual justice. A liberal democracy aspires to punish only the guilty. But war is inherently unfair \xe2\x80\x94 it distributes suffering arbitrarily among enemy combatants, civilians and one\xe2\x80\x99s own soldiers. A line has to be drawn somewhere to determine which of these utterly different standards of government behavior is applied where \xe2\x80\x94 and the nation\xe2\x80\x99s border is as good a line as any.'b'Members of Al Qaeda are not the only ones affected by this double standard. The most repulsive and obviously guilty child molester \xe2\x80\x94 or drug kingpin who may also have information that the government could use \xe2\x80\x94 gets American justice, while an innocent child killed accidentally in  our pursuit of terrorists gets no justice at all. (This second part of the equation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to bother the Cheneys and the Gingriches.) Any place you draw the line, it will be possible to come up with what lawyers call \xe2\x80\x9ca parade of horribles.\xe2\x80\x9d Any line you draw can be made to seem absurd, because it is absurd. But the line must be drawn somewhere.'b'So why not draw the line to put an Abdulmutallab or a Shaikh Mohammed on the \xe2\x80\x9cwar\xe2\x80\x9d side and treat him as an enemy combatant? Well, first, recognize that this has become a judgment call so the answer is no longer obvious or mandated by logic. Second, recognize that the national border is a \xe2\x80\x9cbright line,\xe2\x80\x9d and if people captured within the United States are going to be treated as if they were somewhere else \xe2\x80\x94 provided that they are certified terrorists \xe2\x80\x94 things are going to  get complicated quickly.'b'What about Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, the Army psychiatrist charged with killing 13 people at Fort Hood, Tex., in November? He was influenced by an Islamic cleric, but seems to have been fighting his own demons rather than participating in a larger plot. And he\xe2\x80\x99s a citizen. What about Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber? What about the Columbine high school killers? Are they terrorists? Is American justice too good for them?'b'American justice is not a \xe2\x80\x9cget out of jail free\xe2\x80\x9d card. Obviously guilty murderers rarely escape punishment here. We have nothing to be ashamed of, little to fear and much to be proud of in choosing to err on the side of treating captured foreign terrorists as we would treat any upstanding American who tried  to blow up an airplane full of people.'b'An Op-Ed article on Sunday, about e-books, incorrectly described the publishing history of William Styron\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLie Down in Darkness.\xe2\x80\x9d It was first published in 1951 by Bobbs-Merrill, not Random House.'b'The quest for overhauling immigration received two very welcome lifts on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day.'b'Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City, at his inauguration, pledged to help the Obama administration pass immigration reform. Mr. Bloomberg is a force to reckon with, as he proved with his national campaign against illegal guns. On the same day, four young people in Miami, current or former students at Miami Dade College, began their own determined march to Washington in an effort to bring pressure from the grass roots.'b'Three of the four were brought to this country illegally as children. Like thousands of other young people, they bear no blame for their status, and they are frustrated that their hard work and bright promise lead to a brick wall. Their protest for a chance to become Americans is courageous because it exposes them to possible arrest and deportation. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are risking our future because our present is unbearable,\xe2\x80\x9d one of them, Felipe Matos, 'b'told The Times'b'.'b'The Obama administration has vowed to press ahead with reform this year. Given the hard economic times, the politics may be bleaker even than in 2007 when reform was scuttled in an ugly battle. The need is just as real \xe2\x80\x94 for the undocumented and for the country.'b'America needs to shut the path to illegal entry and employment while opening smoother and more rational routes to legal immigration. Opponents of reform say the downturn is a terrible time to fix the system, but they are wrong. When the recovery comes, the country will need a functioning system more than ever \xe2\x80\x94 one that encourages legal entry and bolsters all workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights.'b'To do this, the country needs to bring its huge undocumented underclass into the light. This means putting 12 million people on a path to being assimilated. It is not a question of adding new people to the work force; they are here, many helping keep the economy afloat while tolerating low pay and abuse from lawbreaking employers who prefer them to American workers.'b'Representative Luis Gutierrez, a Democrat of Illinois, already has offered a sensible bill that legalizes immigrants who show that they have been employed, pay a $500 fine, learn English and undergo a criminal background check, among other things.'b'Opponents will try their best to scuttle reform by claiming to be open to compromise while they insist on prohibitive fees, penalties and requirements that turn the path into a fiction \xe2\x80\x94  not a wait of months but of decades or never. That is not reform. And it won\xe2\x80\x99t solve the problem.'b'After years of tightening the screws, the system is hopelessly frozen. Those who want to fix it will have to shut out the choruses of no-amnestys and over-my-dead-bodys, sidestep the false arguments and press into the headwinds while holding firm to the core of the better solution. To legalize the undocumented, collect their unpaid taxes, free them to earn more and spend more, to get the immigrant escalator to the middle class moving again. The country needs it; the economy needs it; the immigrants need and deserve it.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo city on earth has been more rewarded by immigrant labor, more renewed by immigrant ideas, more revitalized by immigrant culture,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Bloomberg said of New York City last week. Substitute \xe2\x80\x9ccountry\xe2\x80\x9d in that sentence, as in America, and it is every bit as true.'b'Gladys Carri\xc3\xb3n, New York\xe2\x80\x99s reform-minded commissioner of the Office of Children and Family Services, has been calling on the state to close many of its remote, prison-style juvenile facilities and shift resources and children to therapeutic programs located in their communities. Her efforts have met fierce and predictably self-interested resistance from the unions representing workers in juvenile prisons and their allies in Albany.'b'A recent series of damning reports have underscored the flaws in New York\xe2\x80\x99s juvenile justice system and the urgent need to shut down these facilities. The governor and the State Legislature need to pay attention.'b'A report by a task force appointed by Gov. David Paterson describes a failing system that damages young people, fails to curb recidivism and eats up millions of tax dollars. Children should be confined only when they present a clear threat to public safety. But the most recent statistics show that 53 percent of the youths admitted to New York\xe2\x80\x99s institutional facilities were placed there for minor nonviolent infractions.'b'The report also says that judges often send children to these facilities because local communities are unable to help them with mental problems or family issues. But once they are locked up, these young people rarely get the psychiatric care or special education they need because the institutions lack trained staff.'b'A report from the Justice Department, which has threatened to sue the state, documents the use of excessive and injury-causing force against children in juvenile facilities, often for minor offenses such as laughing too loudly or refusing to get dressed. And last week, the Legal Aid Society of New York City filed a class-action suit on behalf of youths in confinement, arguing that conditions in the system violate their constitutional rights.'b'Not surprisingly, these institutions do a terrible job of rehabilitation. According to a study of children released from custody between 1991 and 1995, 89 percent of the boys and 81 percent of the girls were eventually rearrested. New York\xe2\x80\x99s facilities are so disastrous and inhumane that state officials recently asked the courts to refrain from sending children to them, except in cases in which they presented a clear danger to the public.'b'Mr. Paterson\xe2\x80\x99s task force was rightly impressed with Missouri\xe2\x80\x99s juvenile justice system. It has adopted smaller regional facilities that focus on rehabilitation and house troubled youths as close to home as possible in order to involve parents and community groups in the therapeutic process. Missouri also has cut recidivisim rates by smoothing re-entry and helping young people with drug treatment, education or job placement.'b'New York clearly needs to follow Ms. Carri\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s advice and adopt a Missouri-style system. That means the Legislature will finally have to put the needs of the state\xe2\x80\x99s children ahead of the politically powerful unions and upstate lawmakers who want to preserve jobs \xe2\x80\x94 and the disastrous status quo \xe2\x80\x94 at all costs.'b'Ten years after NATO went to war with Slobodan Milosevic over Kosovo, a democratically transformed Serbia has applied to join the European Union. That process is likely to take five years or more, but this is an apt moment to celebrate the turnaround in Serbian policies and attitudes under President Boris Tadic.'b'Mr. Tadic was first elected in 2004, but it has been only since his 2008 re-election that he became strong enough to set his country on the path toward European Union membership. Many Serbs remain bitter over the wars and territory that Mr. Milosevic lost. Most now are more interested in looking forward toward a better future in partnership with Europe.'b'The European Union already provides more than half of Serbia\xe2\x80\x99s imports and buys more than half of its exports. Serbia\xe2\x80\x99s economy, still recovering from the sanctions and chaos of the Milosevic years, needs outside capital to help generate jobs. With European Union membership on the horizon, Fiat already has announced plans for substantial investments in Serbian car production.'b'Joining Europe makes human sense, too. A generation of Serbs grew up isolated from much of Europe. Since December, Serbs have been able to travel to most of the European Union visa-free.'b'Important conditions must still be met before Serbia\xe2\x80\x99s membership application can progress.'b'The Serbian government must make every possible effort to arrest two remaining indicted war crimes suspects \xe2\x80\x94 Gen. Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic \xe2\x80\x94 and deliver them to the Hague for trial. The Netherlands threatens to hold up the application until they are turned over. President Tadic pledges full cooperation. Six months from now, the chief war crimes prosecutor in the Hague is scheduled to report on how well he has kept that pledge.'b'Another issue is Kosovo. Serbia is now cooperating with a European Union-led police mission there and is securing its side of the border. It still refuses to recognize Kosovo\xe2\x80\x99s independence. With five European Union members also holding out, recognition cannot be a condition of membership. But the Serbian government must agree that it will not try to unreasonably bar Kosovo from eventual European Union membership.'b'To prepare Serbia to compete within Europe, Mr. Tadic must also continue his economic reforms. The country has come far, and the European Union has used the incentive of eventual membership to encourage constructive policies in Belgrade. Serbia now needs to complete a transformation well begun.'b'On Monday, Dubai celebrated the completion of what is now, and is likely to remain for some time, the tallest building on the planet and its last-second name change. What was supposed to be called Burj Dubai (burj means tower in Arabic) rises to 2,717 feet above a series of rounded, bronzed setbacks. It took five years to complete and cost $1.5 billion. At the opening, it was renamed Burj Khalifa, in honor of Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the emir of Abu Dhabi, which gave Dubai a $10 billion loan a few weeks ago to help head off the country\xe2\x80\x99s financial collapse.'b'The building sets many other records: highest swimming pool, highest mosque, tallest service elevator, highest outdoor observation deck, highest vertical concrete pumping during construction, first Armani hotel. From the top you can see 60 miles away \xe2\x80\x94 and back to 2004 when construction started in the midst of a real estate frenzy.'b'It is hard, despite the glitter and fireworks, not to see Burj Khalifa as a monument to Dubai\xe2\x80\x99s burst real estate bubble and a caution against much of the world\xe2\x80\x99s overreach during the last few years. Its developer says that the building is 90 percent sold. That would make it the exception in Dubai where real estate prices have dropped by as much as 50 percent from their height.'b'We are all for vaulting ambition and reaching for the heights. But Burj Khalifa is also a reminder that what the world needs right now is sensibly lowered expectations and a far more solid economic foundation on which to build going forward.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s Always the End of the World as We Know It'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Jan. 1):'b'Denis Dutton makes a compelling case for the triumph of hysteria over actual knowledge in the case of Y2K, but he overreaches in concluding that any other apocalyptic scenario must be similarly foolish.'b'In suggesting global warming as a current example, Mr. Dutton ignores the fact that dire warnings come neither from religious zealots nor capitalist profiteers, but rather from the vast majority of the world\xe2\x80\x99s scientists, a generally sober bunch.'b'Yes, we may possibly err in thinking that we need to spend uncounted billions on green technologies, new industries and fostering worldwide unanimity of purpose.

A Feb. 20, 2005, Internet posting attributed to the son and quoted by The Associated Press said: \xe2\x80\x9cI imagine how the great jihad will take place, how the Muslims will win ... and rule the whole world, and establish the greatest empire once again!!!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Finding people with the courage to confront 'b'that breakdown'b'  \xe2\x80\x94  the one identified by the father, the one that lures young Muslims away from the mainstream into a willingness to commit suicide against innocent civilians as part of some jihadist power fantasy  \xe2\x80\x94 is what matters most right now.'b'Yes, we need to fix our intelligence. Yes, we absolutely must live up to our own ideals, as President Obama is trying to do in banning torture and closing Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay. We can\xe2\x80\x99t let this \xe2\x80\x9cwar on terrorism\xe2\x80\x9d consume us. We can\xe2\x80\x99t let our country become just The United States of Fighting Terrorism and nothing more. We are the people of July 4th  \xe2\x80\x94  not Sept. 11th.'b'But even if we do all that, no laws or walls we put up will ever be sufficient to protect us unless the Arab and Muslim societies from whence these suicide bombers emerge erect political, religious and moral restraints as well \xe2\x80\x94 starting by shaming suicide bombers and naming their actions \xe2\x80\x9cmurder,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cmartyrdom.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I keep saying: It takes a village. The father, Alhaji Umaru Mutallab, saw himself as part of a global community, based on shared values, and that is why he rang the alarm bell. Bless him for that. Unless more Muslim parents, spiritual leaders, political leaders  \xe2\x80\x94  the village  \xe2\x80\x94  are ready to publicly denounce suicide bombing against innocent civilians  \xe2\x80\x94  theirs and ours  \xe2\x80\x94 this behavior will not stop.'b'Just last Friday, for example, 'b'a suicide bomber set off an explosives-laden vehicle'b' in the midst of a volleyball tournament in the Pakistani village of Shah Hassan Khel, killing more than 100 people. Most were youngsters. No surprise. When suicide bombing becomes legitimate to use against non-Muslim \xe2\x80\x9cinfidels\xe2\x80\x9d abroad it becomes legitimate to use against Muslim opponents at home. And what becomes \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cillegitimate\xe2\x80\x9d in a community is so much more important than any government regulation.'b'All too often, though, Arab and Muslim governments arrest their jihadis at home, denounce them privately to us, but say nothing in public. The global leadership of Islam \xe2\x80\x94 like the king of Saudi Arabia or the Organization of the Islamic Conference \xe2\x80\x94 rarely take on jihadist actions and ideology openly with the kind of passion, consistency and mass protests that we have seen them do, for example, against Danish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad.'b'President Obama should not hesitate to call for it \xe2\x80\x94 respectfully but publicly. If he only presses for more effective airport security, which he must, it\xe2\x80\x99s a cop-out.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you want to foster more responsible behavior in people, you can\xe2\x80\x99t just legislate more rules and regulations,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dov Seidman, the C.E.O. of LRN, which helps companies build ethical cultures, and the author of the book \xe2\x80\x9cHow.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to enlist and inspire people in a set of values. People need to be governed both from the outside, through compliance with rules, and from the inside, inspired by shared values. That is why shame is so important. When we call a banker \xe2\x80\x98a fat cat\xe2\x80\x99 for taking too big a bonus, we\xe2\x80\x99re actually being inspirational leaders because we are telling them, \xe2\x80\x98You are behaving beneath how a responsible human being should behave.\xe2\x80\x99 We need to inspire the village to shame those who betray our common values.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Every faith has its violent extreme. The West is not immune. It\xe2\x80\x99s all about how the center deals with it. Does it tolerate it, isolate it or shame it? The jihadists are a security problem for our system. But they are a political and moral problem for the Arab-Muslim system. If they won\xe2\x80\x99t address this problem for us, I truly hope they will do it for themselves. Eventually, we\xe2\x80\x99ll find a way to keep most jihadists off our planes and out of our volleyball games \xe2\x80\x94 but they will have to live with them.'b'IN the days since the attempted Christmas Day airplane bombing, many officials, including the White House\xe2\x80\x99s counterterrorism director, John Brennan, have insisted that the Detroit incident was \xe2\x80\x9cnot like 9/11.\xe2\x80\x9d In many respects, we agree. But the government\xe2\x80\x99s handling of the intelligence leading up to the attack was eerily reminiscent of one of the most shocking \xe2\x80\x94 and relatively underreported \xe2\x80\x94 revelations to come out of the 9/11 commission\xe2\x80\x99s hearings.'b'The commission, having been informed that before  9/11 the State Department maintained a list of known or suspected terrorists whose travel should be restricted, asked Federal Aviation Administration officials how many of that list\xe2\x80\x99s  61,000 names  were on the F.A.A.\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cno fly\xe2\x80\x9d registry. The answer supplied by senior aviation administration officials was astonishing in two respects. First, the commission was told, the no-fly list had not 61,000 names but only 12, and included none of the 9/11 hijackers, even though  the F.B.I. was searching actively for two of them before the attack.'b'Then came the bombshell: the F.A.A. security officials were unaware  \xe2\x80\x94 until the commission asked its question at a hearing \xe2\x80\x94 that the State Department  maintained a terrorist watch list at all.'b'In the hearing, Tim Roemer, a commission member, was stunned, 'b'telling the F.A.A. officials'b': \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a difference of 60,988 names between what\xe2\x80\x99s been accumulated at the State Department as dangerous people, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be flying, and what you have with your 12 people. Now, I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand why there are not more efforts in liaison activities to reach out to State Department and start to bring some of those names over and prevent those people from flying.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Today, the no-fly list has grown to 4,000 people, but the name of the man accused of the Christmas bombing attempt, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab,  was not on it. Critical information concerning Mr.  Abdulmutallab\xe2\x80\x99s growing estrangement from his family and his Islamic radicalization in Yemen, 'b'according to an understandably exasperated President Obama'b', \xe2\x80\x9cwas passed to a component of our intelligence community but was not effectively distributed so as to get the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s name on a no-fly list.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Others in the intelligence community, according to Mr. Brennan, were aware that Al Qaeda in Yemen was training a Nigerian, perhaps named Umar Farouk, to carry out an attack. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there was nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'according to Mr. Brennan,'b' \xe2\x80\x9cthat brought it all together.\xe2\x80\x9d When Mr. Abdulmutallab\xe2\x80\x99s father reported his dangerous behavior to the United States Embassy in Nigeria, moreover, no one checked whether the younger Abdulmutallab  held a multiple-entry visa (he did), or whether he had been denied a visa anywhere else (he had).'b'As President Obama said yesterday, after meeting with his national security team at the White House, \xe2\x80\x9cThis was not a failure to collect intelligence; it was a failure to integrate and understand the intelligence we already had.\xe2\x80\x9d What, more than eight years after 9/11, and more than four years after the issuance of the 9/11 commission\xe2\x80\x99s findings, are we to make of this systemic failure? And what should be done about it?'b'First, we should dismiss the partisan bickering over the issue. Both parties have presided over security failures and successes; systemic failures cannot be ascribed to the stewardship of a political party. Any effort to take partisan advantage of this unfortunate event, moreover, can only mask the more serious underlying issues, which President Obama raised squarely in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s remarks: are lapses in information gathering and sharing like those that occurred here endemic, or fixable?'b'The task of isolating the data points that identify one dangerous individual among thousands is hard; there will be, under the best of conditions, an element of judgment involved, an ineradicable quantum of human frailty. Tragic mistakes will always be possible. And there will be little or no defense against a lunatic, unconnected with any group, who ignites kindling in his underpants.'b'The question that Congress should investigate, and the administration should ask itself, is whether the system we have in place has reduced the likelihood of human error to an acceptable, if not irreducible, margin.'b'Our national security system should aspire to the zero-tolerance effectiveness with which our military has prevented an accidental launching of nuclear weapons. The attempted Christmas bombing, thwarted by brave passengers and not by our intelligence community, illustrates how far we still have to go.'b'There are procedural fixes worth undertaking, of course, like mandating enhanced screening, or installing body scanning technology, or coordinating the software used by intelligence agencies, or instructing State Department personnel to query the visa status of any person reported to be suspicious. Reforming the no-fly list procedures, as President Obama has proposed, is certainly overdue. But in our view the problem runs deeper, and requires a searching look at the structure of government itself.'b'Despite the best efforts of the 9/11 commission and other intelligence reformers, budgetary authority over intelligence remains unaligned with substantive responsibility. Turf battles persist among intelligence agencies. Power is sought while responsibility is deflected. The drift toward inertia continues.'b'Government agencies are most likely to succeed when structure matches mission. With its many jurisdictional boundaries and its persistent bureaucratic fault lines, our current system, although greatly improved since 9/11, affords too many opportunities to let information slip, too many occasions for human frailty to assert itself.'b'The attempted Christmas bombing carries an eerie echo of the failures that led to 9/11 because those fundamental flaws persist. The challenge for President Obama and Congress is to resist superficial sound-bite solutions and undertake the harder task of reinventing our national security system. As the president stated, \xe2\x80\x9cThe margin for error is slim, and the consequences of failure can be catastrophic.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'THE Islamic Republic of Iran is not about to implode. Nevertheless, the misguided idea that it may do so is becoming enshrined as conventional wisdom in Washington.'b'For President Obama, this misconception provides a bit of cover; it helps obscure his failure to follow up on his campaign promises about engaging Iran with any serious, strategically grounded proposals. Meanwhile, those who have never supported diplomatic engagement with Iran are now pushing the idea that the Tehran government might collapse to support their arguments for military strikes against Iranian nuclear targets and adopting \xe2\x80\x9cregime change\xe2\x80\x9d as the ultimate goal of America\xe2\x80\x99s Iran policy.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with the most recent events. On Dec. 27, large crowds poured into the streets of cities across Iran to commemorate the Shiite holy day of Ashura; this coincided with mourning observances for a revered cleric, Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, who had died a week earlier. Protesters used the occasion to gather in Tehran and elsewhere, setting off clashes with security forces.'b'Important events, no doubt. But assertions that the Islamic Republic is now imploding in the fashion of the shah\xe2\x80\x99s regime in 1979 do not hold up to even the most minimal scrutiny. Antigovernment Iranian Web sites claim there were \xe2\x80\x9ctens of thousands\xe2\x80\x9d of Ashura protesters; others in Iran say there were 2,000 to 4,000. Whichever estimate is more accurate, one thing we do know is that much of Iranian society was upset by the protesters using a sacred day to make a political statement.'b'Vastly more Iranians took to the streets on Dec. 30, in demonstrations organized by the government to show support for the Islamic Republic (one Web site that opposed President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\xe2\x80\x99s re-election in June estimated the crowds at one million people). Photographs and video clips lend considerable plausibility to this estimate \xe2\x80\x94 meaning this was possibly the largest crowd in the streets of Tehran since Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini\xe2\x80\x99s funeral in 1989. In its wake, even President Ahmadinejad\xe2\x80\x99s principal challenger in last June\xe2\x80\x99s presidential election, Mir Hossein Mousavi, felt compelled to acknowledge the \xe2\x80\x9cunacceptable radicalism\xe2\x80\x9d of some Ashura protesters.'b'The focus in the West on the antigovernment demonstrations has blinded many to an inconvenient but inescapable truth: the Iranians who used Ashura to make a political protest do not represent anything close to a majority. Those who talk so confidently about an \xe2\x80\x9copposition\xe2\x80\x9d in Iran as the vanguard for a new revolution should be made to answer three tough questions: First, what does this opposition want? Second, who leads it? Third, through what process will this opposition displace the government in Tehran?'b'In the case of the 1979 revolutionaries, the answers to these questions were clear. They wanted to oust the American-backed regime of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi and to replace it with an Islamic republic. Everyone knew who led the revolution: Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who despite living in exile in Paris could mobilize huge crowds in Iran simply by sending cassette tapes into the country. While supporters disagreed about the revolution\xe2\x80\x99s long-term agenda, Khomeini\xe2\x80\x99s ideas were well known from his writings and public statements. After the shah\xe2\x80\x99s departure, Khomeini returned to Iran with a draft constitution for the new political order in hand. As a result, the basic structure of the Islamic Republic was set up remarkably quickly.'b'Beyond expressing inchoate discontent, what does the current \xe2\x80\x9copposition\xe2\x80\x9d want? It is no longer championing Mr. Mousavi\xe2\x80\x99s presidential candidacy; Mr. Mousavi himself has now redefined his agenda as \xe2\x80\x9cnational reconciliation.\xe2\x80\x9d Some protesters seem to want expanded personal freedoms and interaction with the rest of the world, but have no comprehensive agenda. Others \xe2\x80\x94 who have received considerable Western press coverage \xe2\x80\x94 have taken to calling for the Islamic Republic\xe2\x80\x99s replacement with an (ostensibly secular) \xe2\x80\x9cIranian Republic.\xe2\x80\x9d But University of Maryland polling   after the election and popular reaction to the Ashura protests suggest that most Iranians are unmoved, if not repelled, by calls for the Islamic Republic\xe2\x80\x99s abolition.'b'With Mr. Mousavi increasingly marginalized, who else might lead this supposed revolution? Surely not Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the former president who became a leading figure in the protests after last summer\xe2\x80\x99s election. Yes, he is an accomplished political actor, is considered a \xe2\x80\x9cfounding father\xe2\x80\x9d of the state and heads the Assembly of Experts, a body that can replace the Islamic Republic\xe2\x80\x99s supreme leader. But Mr. Rafsanjani lost his 2005 bid to regain the presidency in a landslide to Mr. Ahmadinejad, and has shown no inclination to spur the masses to bring down the system he helped create.'b'Nor will Mohammad Khatami, the reformist elected president in 1997, lead the charge; in 1999, at the height of his popularity, he publicly disowned widespread student demonstrations protesting the closing of a newspaper that had supported his administration.'b'Many of the Westerners who see the opposition displacing the Islamic Republic emphasize the potential for unrest during Shiite mourning rituals, which take place at three-, seven- and 40-day intervals after a person\xe2\x80\x99s death. During the final months of the shah\xe2\x80\x99s rule, his opponents used mourning rituals held for demonstrators killed by security forces to catalyze further protests. But does this mean that a steady stream of mourning rituals for fallen protesters today will set off a similarly escalating spiral of protests, eventually sweeping away Iran\xe2\x80\x99s political order?'b'That is highly unlikely. First, Ayatollah Montazeri had unique standing in the Islamic Republic\xe2\x80\x99s history; it is not surprising that the coincidence of his seven-day observance with the Ashura observation would have drawn crowds. His 40-day observance \xe2\x80\x94 which will fall on Jan. 29 \xe2\x80\x94 and the early February commemoration of the 1979 revolution might also encourage public activism. But there is nothing in the Islamic Republic\xe2\x80\x99s history to support projections that future mourning rituals for those killed in the Ashura protests will elicit similar attention.'b'For example, in late 1998 four prominent intellectuals were assassinated, allegedly by state intelligence officers, prompting considerable public outrage. Yet the mourning rituals for the victims did not prompt large-scale protests. In 1999, nationwide student protests were violently suppressed, with at least five people killed and 1,200 detained. Once again, though, the mourning dates for those who died did not generate significant new demonstrations. Likewise, after the presidential election in June, none of the deaths associated with security force action \xe2\x80\x94 even that of Neda Agha-Soltan, the young woman whose murder became a cause c\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8bre of the YouTube age \xe2\x80\x94 resulted in further unrest.'b'In keeping with this pattern, the seven-day mourning observances for those killed in the Ashura protests generated no significant demonstrations in Iran. Clearly, comparisons of the Ashura protests to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, projecting a cascade of monumental consequences to follow, are fanciful. The Islamic Republic will continue to be Iran\xe2\x80\x99s government. And, even if there were changes in some top leadership positions \xe2\x80\x94 such as the replacement of Mr. Ahmadinejad as president by Ali Larijani, the speaker of the Parliament, as some Westerners speculate \xe2\x80\x94 this would not fundamentally change Iran\xe2\x80\x99s approach on regional politics, its nuclear program and other matters of concern.'b'The Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s half-hearted efforts at diplomacy with Tehran have given engagement a bad name. As a result, support for more coercive options is building across the American political spectrum. The president will do a real disservice to American interests if he waits in vain for Iranian political dynamics to \xe2\x80\x9csolve\xe2\x80\x9d the problems with his Iran policy.'b'As a model, the president would do well to look to China. Since President Richard Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s opening there (which took place amid the Cultural Revolution), successive American administrations have been wise enough not to let political conflict \xe2\x80\x94 whether among the ruling elite or between the state and the public, as in the Tiananmen Square protests and ethnic separatism in Xinjiang \xe2\x80\x94 divert Washington from sustained, strategic engagement with Beijing. President Obama needs to begin displaying similar statesmanship in his approach to Iran.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Why Twitter Will Endure'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Week in Review, Jan. 3):'b'As a 71-year-old grandmother of 10, I have eschewed Facebook, declined a BlackBerry (who wants to be contacted \xe2\x80\x9cinstantly\xe2\x80\x9d?) and barely given Twitter a thought ... until today.

David Paterson delivered his annual report on New York\xe2\x80\x99s condition on Wednesday, everyone knew that the state of the state was desperate. New York is crippled by a mounting budget crisis and saddled with a Legislature that is incompetent in its governance and corrupt in its behavior.'b'To his great credit, Mr. Paterson skipped the usual, and usually insincere, homages to his fellow politicians and went straight into an unsparing assessment of fiscal and political reality. He insisted that the Legislature attack economics and ethics at the same time.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCultures of addiction to spending, power and approval have ruined empires, and now they threaten the Empire State,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, reciting his powerful speech from memory because his limited eyesight prevents him from reading from paper or a teleprompter.'b'The full details of his economic plans will become clearer when he presents his budget later this month. But Mr. Paterson made a good start on Wednesday by asking the assembled lawmakers \xe2\x80\x94 who mostly looked on sullenly or applauded wanly \xe2\x80\x94 to cap spending so Albany can finally get a grip on a deficit that is expected to be about $8 billion this year. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are more deficits up ahead that will require an even greater sacrifice,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Mr. Paterson said he directed Lt. Gov. Richard Ravitch to create a four-year budget plan to replace the year-by-year recklessness that leaves counties, cities and towns vulnerable to economic downturns like the one now paralyzing them. Among other things, the governor proposed eliminating the costly and increasingly corrupt  Empire Zone economic development program, which ended up shuffling jobs around from place to place. He suggested replacing it with a program focused on creating jobs in the high-tech and clean-energy sectors.'b'But Mr. Paterson went beyond the necessary hard talk about budgets and demanded that legislators \xe2\x80\x9cbring fairness and openness to government, which has very little of either.\xe2\x80\x9d Albany\xe2\x80\x99s lawmakers should be worried about both of those things, and many swiftly denounced his proposal as an attempt to bolster low poll ratings. That\xe2\x80\x99s fine with us. At this point, anything that forces the State Legislature to confront reality is valuable.'b'Here are a few of Mr. Paterson\xe2\x80\x99s best ideas:'b'\xc2\xb6To clean up one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s most notoriously corrupt campaign finance systems, he proposes encouraging much-needed competition by phasing in public financing of campaigns. That would mean limiting contributions to $1,000 instead of $55,900 for state races. Lobbyists would be allowed to pitch in only $250. He would end the scandalous practice of writing checks for party \xe2\x80\x9chousekeeping\xe2\x80\x9d that have no limits at all.'b'\xc2\xb6He wants to ban all contributions from corporations, including limited liability corporations, one of the latest tricks for adding big bucks to campaigns. His bill would also ban transfers from committee to committee, which allows politicians to pile money from various sources into one campaign. He wants to limit personal use of campaign dollars, finally, and he wants to increase penalties for violations of this new law.'b'\xc2\xb6To tackle the pay-to-play culture, the governor\xe2\x80\x99s bill would require everybody earning public money to disclose all outside business income in detail. His bill would even require lawyers to itemize their income and clients \xe2\x80\x94 an idea that the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, an attorney who profits handsomely from New York\xe2\x80\x99s lack of transparency, is expected to fight ferociously.'b'\xc2\xb6He proposed creating a board of financial experts to help oversee the state pension fund. The comptroller is now the sole trustee of $126 billion in pensions.'b'\xc2\xb6He wants to end double-dipping by closing a 1995 loophole that permits legislators to collect a state pension along with their legislative salary.'b'\xc2\xb6He also proposed a truly independent ethics commission to oversee all branches of the government. The state\xe2\x80\x99s top politicians would appoint a \xe2\x80\x9cdesignating committee\xe2\x80\x9d that would then appoint the commission. That is a far cry from today\xe2\x80\x99s Legislative Ethics Commission, which is made up of legislators who \xe2\x80\x94 to everyone\xe2\x80\x99s disgust but no one\xe2\x80\x99s surprise \xe2\x80\x94 generally find nothing wrong with their colleagues\xe2\x80\x99 misbehavior.'b'Not all of Mr. Paterson\xe2\x80\x99s ideas are useful, like his suggestion for term limits on state politicians. For Albany, that is a particularly seductive idea since most legislators only leave office if they retire, die or go to jail. The democratic way to impose term limits is at the ballot box. The state must make it easier to challenge incumbents who have been in Albany for far too long.'b'Albany\xe2\x80\x99s time-serving politicians wasted no time attacking the ethical reforms. State Senator Dean Skelos, the Republican leader, scoffed that most New Yorkers are interested in jobs and taxes, not reform. Joseph Bruno, the former Republican leader, made that same point about a year before he was convicted for abusing the public trust. These denizens of the old Albany have not gotten the message that fiscal responsibility and ethical responsibility are inseparable. New Yorkers want both.'b'Mr. Paterson will have to negotiate with Mr. Silver and the Democrats in the State Senate to get any ethics bill passed, and it is not clear that he has the political will, or the political muscle, to make that happen. But he was right to set the bar high at the start.'b'\xc2\x95'b''b'For more on the political and fiscal crises in New York State, go to 'b'nytimes.com/editorials'b'.'b''b'Senator Christopher Dodd\xe2\x80\x99s decision to not seek re-election in November could be a fatal blow to meaningful financial regulatory reform \xe2\x80\x94 or a desperately needed boost. It depends on what he does now.'b'Mr. Dodd has been in the Senate since 1981 and has been chairman of the banking committee since 2007. Over the years, we have seen two very different Chris Dodds.'b'There is the reformer who championed the Family and Medical Leave Act and helped to expand Head Start. There is also the all-too-cozy pal of Wall Street who is one of the top recipients of millions of dollars in donations from commercial banks and the securities industry. Recently, Mr. Dodd\xe2\x80\x99s fingerprints were on legislation that allowed the American International Group to pay big bonuses after the firm was bailed out by taxpayers.'b'That coziness \xe2\x80\x94  especially the V.I.P. cut-rate mortgage he received from the now-defunct subprime lender, Countrywide Financial \xe2\x80\x94 is one of the reasons his state\xe2\x80\x99s voters have turned against him. With a legacy to burnish, and no need to drum up campaign contributions, we hope the reformer will be unleashed.'b'Last year, Mr. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, put forth a strong financial reform proposal that would have gone a long way toward protecting ordinary Americans and avoiding a replay of the banking meltdown. It included robust consumer protection, sound regulation of derivatives and limits on too-big-to-fail firms. Naysaying senators on the committee \xe2\x80\x94 Republicans and a few Democrats \xe2\x80\x94 blocked the proposal. Mr. Dodd then set up four bipartisan teams to come up with alternatives. They are supposed to report back this month.'b'We would love to be pleasantly surprised, but odds are that they will offer up a watery gruel. Much like fiscal stimulus and health care reform, Republicans appear determined to block significant financial reform, no matter how desperately needed, lest it be perceived as a victory for President Obama.'b'This is where Mr. Dodd can try to make a difference.'b'Impending retirement frees him from having to woo donors or listen to anyone or anything other than his own best instincts. He is free to criticize and, if need be, condemn the working groups\xe2\x80\x99 proposals \xe2\x80\x94 to contrast their proposals with his own and challenge them to explain how anything less than sweeping reform will be enough to protect Americans.'b'(We would be disappointed if he decided to go through the revolving door and seek a job in the industry he now oversees. But if that is his eventual choice, he would be doing Wall Street a real favor if he works now to save the financial industry from its own excesses.)'b'Mr. Dodd\xe2\x80\x99s fellow senators certainly need a lot of goading. So does the White House. President Obama has vowed to rein in Wall Street, but the White House has pushed for loopholes in derivatives legislation and recently proclaimed itself satisfied with a House-passed reform bill that was weaker on consumer protection than what\xe2\x80\x99s needed.'b'At the top of the agenda, Mr. Dodd and the White House should loudly resist attempts to defang the proposed consumer protection legislation. Mr. Dodd should also insist that dangerous gaps in proposed derivatives\xe2\x80\x99 regulation be closed.'b'Mr. Dodd may be a lame duck. But he is still chairman of the committee. That gives him a formidable bully pulpit. He should use it.'b'After weeks of maneuvering and delay, the New Jersey State Senate will finally vote on Thursday on whether to legalize same-sex marriage. The Senate needs to approve the bill, and the General Assembly needs to follow \xe2\x80\x94 quickly. Gov. Jon Corzine has pledged to sign the legislation into law; his soon-to-be-successor, Gov.-elect Christopher Christie, has vowed to veto it. The transfer of power takes place in less than two weeks on Jan. 19.'b'Polls show that a majority of New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s citizens accept the idea of same-sex marriage. There also is wide agreement that New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s current civil union law does not live up to the standard of equal protection mandated in 2006 by the New Jersey Supreme Court.'b'Until just a few months ago, it looked as if legislators would enact a marriage equality bill, likely after the November election. But Democrats in both the Senate and House were spooked by Mr. Corzine\xe2\x80\x99s defeat, and their leaders have since wasted weeks in unseemly squabbling over whether the Senate or Assembly should take up the measure first.'b'The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the bill last month. And the outgoing Senate president, Richard Codey, a supporter of marriage equality, has now made the right call in scheduling Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s floor vote \xe2\x80\x94  despite qualms over whether the measure has enough support at this point to pass. The legislation\xe2\x80\x99s chances would be considerably enhanced if the majority leader, Stephen Sweeney, would use the debate to endorse it and rally wavering fellow Democrats to join him.'b'Mr. Sweeney, who will succeed Mr. Codey as Senate president this month, has declined to say whether he supports the same-sex marriage bill, raising concerns about how he will exercise his influential new role.'b'It is not too late for him \xe2\x80\x94 and all New Jersey legislators \xe2\x80\x94 to show real leadership and stand up for the fundamental rights of New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s gay and lesbian citizens.

The all-white demography of Eleanor, W.Va., is no accident. Almost all the towns that Franklin D.

I know this comes as a shock to you, people. Also Senator Chris Dodd! We are only one week into the new year, and the political world is in turmoil. It\xe2\x80\x99s a wonder we can continue on with our regular duties.'b'Two Democratic senators quitting is seen as a terrible portent for 2010. (\xe2\x80\x9cDemocrats\xe2\x80\x99 Black Tuesday,\xe2\x80\x9d said a headline on MSNBC.) That seems a tad overblown given the fact that six Republican senators already have announced their retirements.'b'Plus, Dodd has been in terrible trouble back home ever since he ran for president and tried to get a jump on the competition by moving his family to Iowa. Connecticut has feelings, too. When your senator registers his daughter in kindergarten in Des Moines, the voters in Bridgeport don\xe2\x80\x99t feel the love.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s really all good for the Nutmeg State Democrats. Dodd can leave with dignity. He has an overall record to be proud of, including a major role in health care reform. He also worked very hard on issues that have no political payoff whatsoever, like early childhood education.'b'In his place, the Democrats can nominate the popular attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, who has been waiting in the wings since Cyndi Lauper was at the top of the charts. He was the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 young man on the rise in the \xe2\x80\x9970s, and he\xe2\x80\x99s been attorney general for nearly 'b'20 years. 'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing Dodd decided to get out of the way now or when Blumenthal\xe2\x80\x99s turn came, Connecticut would have wound up electing a new senator who looked like Robert Byrd without seniority.'b'Blumenthal\xe2\x80\x99s opponent might turn out to be Linda McMahon, who formerly ran World Wrestling Entertainment with her husband, Vince. There are other, perhaps better, Republican candidates in the race, but I am rooting for McMahon for entertainment value. She used to be a central character in cable wrestling shows whose scripts had family members shrieking, betraying and, occasionally, slugging one another. One episode featured a villain who broke into the \xe2\x80\x9cpalatial McMahon headquarters\xe2\x80\x9d while Linda was recovering from a neck injury that she had received when an aggrieved wrestler flipped her upside down and slammed her head onto the floor. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a rather aggressive beauty, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d he breathed, before forcing a kiss upon her resistant lips and promising to break both her son\xe2\x80\x99s legs.'b'Lately, there have not been all that many good times on the political front. In Washington, the Democrats are sulky about Obama spending all his political capital on health care while the sane people in both parties are completely freaked out by the tea partiers. Meanwhile, interested civilians are being required to spend an excessive amount of time worrying about cloture votes and yearning for the good old days when the only senators you had to know anything about were your own.'b'Until recently, all I knew about Byron Dorgan was that he was a populist from North Dakota who had once been named Person of the Year by the durum wheat growers. Now he is the center of the universe.'b'In North Dakota, Democrats are petitioning him to change his mind and run again. The 60th vote could hang on it! Nobody seemed to have expected Dorgan to call it quits even though he has been a professional politician since he was 26 and made history as the most youthful person ever appointed to the North Dakota Tax Commission.'b'Now the guy is 67 years old, and he says he wants to write books and teach. I think we should give him a thumbs up on his new life plan, except for the part about how he might \xe2\x80\x9calso like to work on energy policy in the private sector.\xe2\x80\x9d That sure does sound like a lobbyist, but perhaps it just means investing in a gas station.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m beginning to suspect that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t expect to go back to North Dakota at all. I am basing this mainly on the fact that the \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Notable North Dakotans'b'\xe2\x80\x9d page on the Byron Dorgan Web site lists 19 people, none of whom seem to actually live there. In fact, seven of them are dead and one of the others is the guy who is married to the pop star Fergie.'b'No wonder that when Dorgan bolted, a top North Dakota Democrat instantly called Ed Schultz, the former Fargo native turned MSNBC talk-show host, and asked him if he had ever thought about running for the Senate. Even the people in North Dakota don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to think there are any actual residents left in the state.'b'You\xe2\x80\x99re giving yourself too little credit, North Dakota Democrats. There\xe2\x80\x99s got to be a potential junior senator somewhere in your 641,000 fine residents. Who, of course, get exactly the same number of Senate votes as the 36.8 million people in California. But that\xe2\x80\x99s a complaint for another day.'b'SAN JOS\xc3\x89, Costa Rica'b'Hmmm. You think it\xe2\x80\x99s a coincidence? Costa Rica is one of the very few countries to have abolished its army, and it\xe2\x80\x99s also arguably the happiest nation on earth.'b'There are several ways of measuring happiness in countries, all inexact, but this pearl of Central America does stunningly well by whatever system is used. For example, the 'b'World Database of Happiness'b', compiled by a Dutch sociologist on the basis of answers to surveys by Gallup and others, lists Costa Rica in the top spot out of 148 nations.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s because Costa Ricans, asked to rate their own happiness on a 10-point scale, average 8.5. Denmark is next at 8.3, the United States ranks 20th at 7.4 and Togo and Tanzania bring up the caboose at 2.6.'b'Scholars also calculate happiness by determining \xe2\x80\x9chappy life years.\xe2\x80\x9d This figure results from merging average self-reported happiness, as above, with life expectancy. Using this system, Costa Rica again easily tops the list. The United States is 19th, and Zimbabwe comes in last.'b'A third approach is the \xe2\x80\x9c'b'happy planet index'b',\xe2\x80\x9d devised by the New Economics Foundation, a liberal think tank. This combines happiness and longevity but adjusts for environmental impact  \xe2\x80\x94  such as the carbon that countries spew.'b'Here again, Costa Rica wins the day, for achieving contentment and longevity in an environmentally sustainable way. The Dominican Republic ranks second, the United States 114th (because of its huge ecological footprint) and Zimbabwe is last.'b'Maybe Costa Rican contentment has something to do with the chance to explore dazzling beaches on both sides of the country, when one isn\xe2\x80\x99t admiring the sloths in the jungle (sloths truly are slothful, I discovered; they are the tortoises of the trees). Costa Rica has done an unusually good job preserving nature, and it\xe2\x80\x99s surely easier to be happy while basking in sunshine and greenery than while shivering up north and suffering \xe2\x80\x9cnature deficit disorder.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'After dragging my 12-year-old daughter through Honduran slums and Nicaraguan villages on this trip, she was delighted to see a Costa Rican beach and stroll through a national park. Among her favorite animals now: iguanas and sloths.'b'(Note to boss: Maybe we should have a columnist based in Costa Rica?)'b'What sets Costa Rica apart is its remarkable decision in 1949 to dissolve its armed forces and invest instead in education. Increased schooling created a more stable society, less prone to the conflicts that have raged elsewhere in Central America. Education also boosted the economy, enabling the country to become a major exporter of computer chips and improving English-language skills so as to attract American eco-tourists.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not antimilitary. But the evidence is strong that education is often a far better investment than artillery.'b'In Costa Rica, rising education levels also fostered impressive gender equality so that it ranks higher than the United States in the World Economic Forum 'b'gender gap index'b'. This allows Costa Rica to use its female population more productively than is true in most of the region. Likewise, education nurtured improvements in health care, with life expectancy now about the same as in the United States  \xe2\x80\x94  a bit longer in some data sets, a bit shorter in others.'b'Rising education levels also led the country to preserve its lush environment as an economic asset. Costa Rica is an ecological pioneer, introducing a carbon tax in 1997. The 'b'Environmental Performance Index'b', a collaboration of Yale and Columbia Universities, ranks Costa Rica at No. 5 in the world, the best outside Europe.'b'This emphasis on the environment hasn\xe2\x80\x99t sabotaged Costa Rica\xe2\x80\x99s economy but has bolstered it. Indeed, Costa Rica is one of the few countries that is seeing migration from the United States: Yankees are moving here to enjoy a low-cost retirement. My hunch is that in 25 years, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see large numbers of English-speaking retirement communities along the Costa Rican coast.'b'Latin countries generally do well in happiness surveys. Mexico and Colombia rank higher than the United States in self-reported contentment. Perhaps one reason is a cultural emphasis on family and friends, on social capital over financial capital  \xe2\x80\x94  but then again, Mexicans sometimes slip into the United States, presumably in pursuit of both happiness and assets.'b'Cross-country comparisons of happiness are controversial and uncertain. But what does seem quite clear is that Costa Rica\xe2\x80\x99s national decision to invest in education rather than arms has paid rich dividends. Maybe the lesson for the United States is that we should devote fewer resources to shoring up foreign armies and more to bolstering schools both at home and abroad.'b'In the meantime, I encourage you to conduct your own research in Costa Rica, exploring those magnificent beaches or admiring those slothful sloths. It\xe2\x80\x99ll surely make you happy.'b'Cambridge, Mass.'b'SEEN from Tokyo, America\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Japan faces a crisis. The immediate problem is deadlock over a plan to move  an American military base on the island of Okinawa. It sounds simple, but this is an issue with a long back story that could create a serious rift with one of our most crucial allies.'b'When I was in the Pentagon more than a decade ago, we began planning to reduce the burden that  our presence places on Okinawa, which houses more than half of the 47,000  American troops in Japan. The Marine Corps Air Station Futenma was a particular problem because of its proximity to a crowded city, Ginowan. After years of negotiation, the Japanese and American governments agreed in 2006 to move the base to a less populated part of Okinawa and to move 8,000 Marines from Okinawa to Guam by 2014.'b'The plan was thrown into jeopardy last summer when the Japanese  voted out the Liberal Democratic Party that had governed the country  for nearly half a century in favor of the Democratic Party of Japan. The new prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, leads a government that is inexperienced, divided and still in the thrall of campaign promises to move the base off the island or out of Japan completely.'b'The Pentagon is properly annoyed that Mr. Hatoyama is trying to go back on an agreement that took more than a decade to work out and that has major implications for the Marine Corps\xe2\x80\x99 budget and force realignment. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates expressed displeasure during a trip to Japan in October, calling any reassessment of the plan \xe2\x80\x9ccounterproductive.\xe2\x80\x9d When he visited Tokyo in November, President Obama agreed to a high-level working group to consider the Futenma question. But since then, Mr. Hatoyama has said he will delay a final decision on relocation until at least May.'b'Not surprisingly, some in Washington want to play hardball with the new Japanese government. But that would be unwise, for Mr. Hatoyama is caught in a vise, with the Americans squeezing from one side and a small left-wing party (upon which his majority in the upper house of the legislature depends) threatening to quit the coalition if he makes any significant concessions to the Americans. Further complicating matters, the future of Futenma is deeply contentious for Okinawans.'b'Even if Mr. Hatoyama eventually gives in on the base plan, we need a more patient and strategic approach to Japan. We are allowing a second-order issue to threaten our long-term strategy for East Asia. Futenma, it is worth noting, is not the only matter that the new government has raised. It also speaks of wanting a more equal alliance and better relations with China, and of creating an East Asian community \xe2\x80\x94 though it is far from clear what any of this means.'b'When I helped to develop the Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s East Asian Strategy Report in 1995,  we started with the reality that there were three major powers in the region \xe2\x80\x94 the United States, Japan and China \xe2\x80\x94 and that maintaining our alliance with Japan would shape the  environment into which China was emerging. We wanted to integrate China into the international system by, say, inviting it to join the World Trade Organization, but we needed to hedge against the danger that a future and stronger China might turn aggressive.'b'After a year and a half of extensive negotiations, the United States and Japan agreed that our alliance, rather than representing a cold war relic, was the basis for stability and prosperity in the region. President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto affirmed that in their 'b'1996 Tokyo declaration'b'.  This strategy of \xe2\x80\x9cintegrate, but hedge\xe2\x80\x9d continued to guide American foreign policy through the years of the Bush administration.'b'This year is the 50th anniversary of the 'b'United States-Japan security treaty.'b'  The two countries will miss a major opportunity if they let the base controversy lead to bitter feelings or the further reduction of American forces in Japan. The best guarantee of security in a region where China remains a long-term challenge and a nuclear North Korea poses a clear threat  remains the presence of American troops, which Japan helps to maintain with generous host nation support.'b'Sometimes Japanese officials quietly welcome \xe2\x80\x9cgaiatsu,\xe2\x80\x9d or foreign pressure, to help resolve their own bureaucratic deadlocks. But that is not the case here: if the United States undercuts the new Japanese government  and creates resentment among the Japanese public, then a victory on Futenma could prove Pyrrhic.'b'Washington'b'ON Wednesday, Senator Chris Dodd announced his retirement after 30 years in the Senate. As a Senate Democratic staffer in 1980, I remember Mr. Dodd\xe2\x80\x99s election well \xe2\x80\x94 it was the only bright spot on the night that changed the Senate drastically, and in ways we still feel today.'b'In the 1960s and \xe2\x80\x9970s, a great Senate had occupied a unique place in our country. It was the Senate that broke the Southern filibuster to enact the Civil Rights Act of 1964; became the arena for challenging, and ultimately ending, the Vietnam War; called Richard Nixon to account; spearheaded new environmental and consumer protections; and advanced equal treatment for women. In an era marked by war, assassinations and political scandal, the Senate provided continuity, gravitas and leadership.'b'The Senate\xe2\x80\x99s fall was as swift as it was surprising. In 1977, the Senate greeted a new president, Jimmy Carter, with a new leadership team of its own, Robert Byrd as majority leader and Howard Baker as minority leader.  Several iconic members \xe2\x80\x94 Sam Ervin, J. William Fulbright, Mike Mansfield, Philip Hart \xe2\x80\x94 were gone. But the core of the great Senate, the liberal Democrats elected in 1958 and 1962, and the moderate-to-progressive Republicans who had forged so many bipartisan alliances, was still intact.'b'The Russell and Dirksen Senate Office Buildings were filled with young, talented, ambitious staff members like Madeleine Albright, Tim Russert, Susan Collins and Tom Daschle. And after battling the imperial presidencies of Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon, the Senate was armed with new legislative tools, including the War Powers Act, the Budget Control Act and the Freedom of Information Act.'b'There was every reason to think that the Senate would continue with a solid Democratic majority, operate in a bipartisan fashion, and have a powerful, positive influence in the country. But the assertive Senate Democrats and the new, outsider president clashed from the start. Republicans formed strong alliances with an energized business community and surging social conservatives. Jesse Helms, finishing his first term, and Orrin Hatch, newly elected, mastered and exploited the Senate rules; liberal senators retaliated in kind. The filibuster, previously a weapon of last resort, became increasingly commonplace.'b'Still, thanks to statesmanship and bipartisan traditions, the 95th Congress compiled a respectable record, including passage of a far-ranging energy program, the Civil Service Reform Act and financial relief for New York City.'b'America\xe2\x80\x99s politics, however, had already started moving to the right, spurred by anger over the Panama Canal treaty and a tax revolt that started in California and swept across the country. In the 1978 election, conservatives helped oust several Democratic senators and purged Republican liberals: defeating Clifford Case in a primary; standing by while Ed Brooke, the only African-American senator, lost; and causing Charles Percy, who won re-election only after pledging that he had \xe2\x80\x9cgotten the message,\xe2\x80\x9d to turn hard to the right.'b'Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s 49-state sweep in 1972 had not diminished the Democratic majority. But by 1980, with America facing an economy in tailspin and the hostage crisis in Iran, the conservative tide was running too strong, and the veteran liberal senators had plainly lost a step.'b'Frank Church, who had overseen the Senate investigation into intelligence abuses, turned hawkish in a desperate effort to revive his sagging political fortunes. George McGovern, who had provided singular leadership in opposing the Vietnam War and fighting hunger, slumped badly in his re-election bid. Jacob Javits, the most liberal Republican and perhaps the greatest legislator of his era, unwisely sought one more term despite failing health.'b'Before joining Thomas Eagleton\xe2\x80\x99s staff, I had worked for Gaylord Nelson, the great Wisconsin environmentalist who was now campaigning unconvincingly as a champion of small business. One afternoon, I found Eagleton scribbling furiously on a pad, talking on the phone, smoking constantly.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to help Gaylord,\xe2\x80\x9d Eagleton boomed. \xe2\x80\x9cHe just did a three-day California fund-raising trip.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Nelson hated fund-raising. \xe2\x80\x9cThat sounds like a good thing,\xe2\x80\x9d I ventured.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe actually came out behind,\xe2\x80\x9d Eagleton told me. \xe2\x80\x9cThe trip cost more than he raised.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'On election night, my wife, Nancy, and I got into the car to go to the first of several parties. It was just after 8 p.m.; the radio told us that Birch Bayh had been defeated by Dan Quayle.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re all going down,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. Nancy knew I meant the veteran Senate liberals.'b'That night, they were all defeated as Ronald Reagan won a crushing victory over Jimmy Carter. Additionally,  Abraham Ribicoff, one of the liberal stalwarts, had retired, as had Adlai Stevenson, while  Ed Muskie had left the Senate in May to become secretary of state. It was the greatest exodus of talent and experience in Senate history. The incoming Republican class had a few promising politicians, but it also included many who came with no visible accomplishments, and left, one term later, with that record intact.'b'In the weeks that followed, we Democrats were virtual zombies, numb with grief and shock. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t help that the Republicans celebrated boisterously and endlessly. At the end of one long day, the elevator opened in front of me, and a group of happy Republicans, dressed in formal wear, poured out. I noticed a heavily made-up but still strikingly attractive woman: Senator John Warner\xe2\x80\x99s wife, better known as Elizabeth Taylor.'b'The 1980 election was more than just a change of party control from Democratic to Republican. Gone was the Senate that had been experienced, progressive and bipartisan; 30 years have passed, and the decline has only accelerated. The Senate today is bitterly divided, frequently paralyzed and borderline bizarre. Olympia Snowe offered this sad observation: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have been miniaturized.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Can the Senate renew itself? In late 1963, the Senate was also in crisis, to the point that Mike Mansfield, the majority leader, prepared to offer his resignation as majority leader. But one towering achievement, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, transformed the legislative body and began the period of great accomplishment that lasted until 1980. Against the odds, let us hope that the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s recent passage of landmark health care legislation can have the same effect.'b'President Obama was right to take responsibility for the near-catastrophic Christmas Day terrorist plot. The buck, as always, must stop with the president. And it was a relief to hear him candidly acknowledge widespread failures in the vast and vastly expensive intelligence and homeland security system and insist that his administration do better. It must.'b'Of course, we have heard about these problems before in the months and years after 9/11. And while Mr. Obama did not create the current system, he has now gotten a bitter lesson in its weaknesses and its stubborn resistance to change, despite the mea culpas and pledges of reform.'b'Many of the most glaring failings \xe2\x80\x94 specifically the failure to correlate and act on available intelligence about a brewing terrorist plot \xe2\x80\x94 were supposed to have been corrected long ago. They clearly were not.'b'The review the White House released on Thursday acknowledges that the government was awash in clues \xe2\x80\x94 about a plot by an Al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen to attack the United States and about Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian man trained in Yemen who is accused of trying to blow a hole in the side of Detroit-bound Northwest Flight 253. The report is filled with shocking details on how the government failed to act.'b'To recap what happened, quickly:'b'In May, Britain refused to renew Mr. Abdulmutallab\xe2\x80\x99s visa, and it put him on a watch list. In August, the National Security Agency overheard leaders of the Al Qaeda branch in Yemen discussing a plot involving a Nigerian man. In November, Mr. Abdulmutallab\xe2\x80\x99s father, a respected banker in Nigeria, warned the American Embassy in Abuja that his son was being radicalized and had disappeared in Yemen. The father even met with an official of the Central Intelligence Agency.'b'The son was put on the least-restrictive American watch list \xe2\x80\x94 one that still allowed him to board a plane to Detroit without luggage and with a ticket that was paid for with cash.'b'The report implicitly acknowledges all of this, saying that the system failed \xe2\x80\x9cto identify, correlate, and fuse into a coherent story all of the discrete pieces of intelligence held by the U.S. government\xe2\x80\x9d about both the Al Qaeda group and Mr. Abdulmutallab. It also makes clear that this was not a single failure by one agency but was a cascade of failures across agencies and departments and the bureaucracies that are supposed to coordinate them.'b'It says that once the government learned of a possible plot in Yemen, the intelligence community failed to devote more analytic resources, and it failed to put one agency or official in charge. John Brennan, the senior official responsible for figuring out what went wrong, said on Thursday that only after the failed plot did the intelligence community recognize that the group, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, actually posed a direct threat to the United States.'b'The report also describes serious problems with the system of watch lists, which, even with fair and frightening warning, put Mr. Abdulmutallab on one that only flagged him for future investigation rather than on the no-fly list. Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, said that while Mr. Abdulmutallab was in the air, customs officials had decided to question him after he landed.'b'The government\xe2\x80\x99s report chillingly acknowledges that, eight years after 9/11, it still does not have a single database that contains all terrorism-related information. And, incredibly, the report suggests that the intelligence community does not know the current \xe2\x80\x9cvisa status of all \xe2\x80\x98known and suspected terrorists,\xe2\x80\x99 beginning with the No Fly list.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'President Obama has now ordered a raft of immediate improvements in the handling of intelligence and in border security.'b'We would feel more reassured if these steps weren\xe2\x80\x99t so basic and self-evident: improve intelligence analysis; clarify the responsibilities of different agencies; upgrade computer technology; ensure faster distribution of intelligence reports; train National Security Agency personnel in watch list procedures; add more people to watch lists; enhance airport screening.'b'More than eight years after 9/11, the United States has another chance to learn from its mistakes. So does Al Qaeda. President Obama has his work cut out for him.'b'Between them, the Obama administration and the federal courts have reversed most of the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s wrongheaded environmental regulations. But a few bad rules linger on the books, among them an inadequate health standard governing harmful ozone, which most people call smog.'b'Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Environmental Protection Agency is now proposing to get rid of this rule and replace it with a stronger standard. This would result in cleaner air and better health for millions of Americans.'b'Ozone is a photochemical reaction that occurs when sunlight mixes with nitrogen oxides and other pollutants from power plants, vehicles, refineries and industrial facilities. It poses a serious health threat, especially in children and people suffering from asthma and lung disease, and is responsible for respiratory-related emergency room visits, hospitalizations and premature deaths.'b'Apart from their health advantages, the new rules proposed reflect the administration\xe2\x80\x99s effort to restore science, as opposed to politics, to its rightful place in environmental rule-making. In 2008, the E.P.A.\xe2\x80\x99s independent board of scientific advisers unanimously recommended that the ozone standards be set at somewhere between 0.060 and 0.070 parts per million.'b'Responding, in part, to industry pressure, the Bush administration imposed a less exacting and less protective standard of 0.075 parts per million. The new proposal, to be issued after a 60-day comment period, is expected to be somewhere in the range originally proposed by the scientific panel.'b'Some big polluters, including the oil companies, are likely to resist since the new standards would require investments in stronger pollution controls on power plants, refineries and chemical plants. The standards could also provide the impetus for cleaner vehicles.'b'Lisa Jackson, the E.P.A.\xe2\x80\x99s administrator, should stick to her guns. When Carol Browner, then the administrator, first tightened health standards for smog and other pollutants like soot in 1997, industry groups rose up as one, predicting bankruptcy. But technology almost always catches up. In the end, costs are a fraction of the original claims, and the air is a lot cleaner.'b'Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California was on the mark when he said this week that the state needed to change policies that spend more money on prisons than on the state\xe2\x80\x99s once-vaunted higher education systems, which are being bled to death in budget cuts. But Mr. Schwarzenegger was way off the mark when he suggested that the answer was to privatize prison services or to pass yet another constitutional amendment, this time to limit prison spending.'b'States that privatize prisons sometimes save money, but they can also buy trouble by ceding control to companies that put profit first and inmate welfare a distant second. That would be disastrous for the California prison system. It is already under pressure from scores of court orders that require it to reduce its growing prison count and provide adequate mental, medical and dental services, as well as better care for the disabled.'b'It would generally be impossible for the state to unilaterally lower prison spending without first cutting the prison population dramatically. And because so much prison spending is nondiscretionary, a constitutional amendment that reduced spending \xe2\x80\x94 without cutting the prison population \xe2\x80\x94 would be doomed to failure. It would also draw the ire of judges who have rightly run out of patience with the state\xe2\x80\x99s long list of failures in this area.'b'The only real way for California to cut prison costs is to reverse sentencing policies that have filled its prisons to bursting and have driven up costs by about 50 percent over the last decade alone. Among other things, too many minor offenders are sent to jail for too long.'b'The Legislature tinkered at the margins of this problem last year. But real sentencing reform has proved impossible in the State Assembly, where lawmakers live in fear of the politically powerful corrections officers\xe2\x80\x99 union lobby, which enforces the status quo by labeling reformers as soft on crime.'b'Sleight of hand will not cut prison costs in California. To do that, lawmakers will need to find their spines.'b'Somewhere in the afterlife\xe2\x80\x99s screening room, Will Hays, architect of Hollywood\xe2\x80\x99s old Production Code, and the stern Catholic bishops of the Legion of Decency are probably sharing a chuckle, maybe over Scotch and cigarettes. Why? The recent fuss over \xe2\x80\x9cAvatar,\xe2\x80\x9d the James Cameron film in which the latest in cinematic technology meets the oldest argument in the movies: whether vice on screen encourages vice in real life.'b'In \xe2\x80\x9cAvatar,\xe2\x80\x9d a character played by Sigourney Weaver smokes. Antitobacco advocates say on-screen smoking \xe2\x80\x94 even by a character we\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to dislike, like Ms. Weaver\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 makes children pick up the habit. They have criticized the movie as a threat to public health.'b'Your initial response \xe2\x80\x94 for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake \xe2\x80\x94 might be tempered by knowing that the advocates have persuasive scientific studies to support their warnings. Stanton A. Glantz, the director of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco, points to several, in publications like the medical journal The Lancet, showing strong evidence that on-screen smoking increases teenage cigarette use.'b'The World Health Organization wants governments to \xe2\x80\x9cseverely restrict smoking imagery in all film media.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Glantz doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go that far. He is not urging government regulation but industry self-restraint and greater public awareness, like an R rating for smoking so families can go to the multiplex forewarned.'b'Does that strike you as nannyish and make you a little queasy? Us, too. But it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to condemn the strategy of using information, not censorship, to confront a perceived public-health threat, especially when, as Mr. Glantz argues, big spending on movie product placement by tobacco companies tilts the field heavily in smoking\xe2\x80\x99s favor.'b'Probably the only rational response is to let the artists and scolds flourish together, along with information. Protect our children as we must, but we should leave the moviemakers to do their thing.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Art of the Deal'b',\xe2\x80\x9d by Judith H. Dobrzynski (Op-Ed, Jan. 2):'b'All who care about our art museums should be grateful to Ms. Dobrzynski for raising an issue about which few choose to speak. But I disagree with her conclusion \xe2\x80\x94 that selling works of art to deal with a museum\xe2\x80\x99s financial crisis is justified \xe2\x80\x94 for two reasons. First, it would not work, and second, it would probably have unintended consequences.'b'To raise substantial amounts of income, you must sell good, and thereby potentially important, works of art. The smaller the amount raised by sales of works of art, the more this solution becomes stopgap. If a long-term solution is to be achieved, not only must substantial amounts be raised, but also the money must be put into an endowment with an annual spendable rate that preserves the principal.'b'The unintended consequences could well include a change in the board\xe2\x80\x99s perception of its fiduciary responsibility to one more focused on asset management than philanthropy. Human nature has shown us that if there is an accepted alternative to giving one\xe2\x80\x99s own money, many, if not all, will seize it. And potential and past donors of works of art will be uncertain as to the future use of their gifts.'b'The decisions that would need to be made by the \xe2\x80\x9cimpartial arbitrator\xe2\x80\x9d suggested by Ms. Dobrzynski \xe2\x80\x94 What art is too important to sell?

Doing otherwise only removes the museum world\xe2\x80\x99s equivalent of moral hazard.'b'All too often a root cause of a museum\xe2\x80\x99s financial crisis is a building expansion compelled by the growth of its collection. A more effective, long-term solution to the perennial problem of museums spending beyond their means is to rework the professional practices regarding acquisitions.'b'When a trustee or someone else donates a work to a museum, the conditions of the gift should include a cash payment to the museum\xe2\x80\x99s operating endowment equal to a set percentage of the tax-deductible value of the work. Similarly, when a museum uses money from an acquisition fund to purchase a work, a set percentage of the price should be paid into the operating endowment.'b'To allow museum directors and trustees to keep growing their institutions\xe2\x80\x99 collections without taking responsibility for the long-term costs of accommodating and caring for them is irresponsible.

'b''b'Health care reform is almost (knock on wood) a done deal. Next up: fixing the financial system. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be writing a lot about financial reform in the weeks ahead. Let me begin by asking a basic question: What should reformers try to accomplish?'b'A lot of the public debate has been about protecting borrowers. Indeed, a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency to help stop deceptive lending practices is a very good idea. And better consumer protection might have limited the overall size of the housing bubble.'b'But consumer protection, while it might have blocked many subprime loans, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have prevented the sharply rising rate of delinquency on conventional, plain-vanilla mortgages. And it certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have prevented the monstrous boom and bust in commercial real estate.'b'Reform, in other words, probably can\xe2\x80\x99t prevent either bad loans or bubbles. But it can do a great deal to ensure that bubbles don\xe2\x80\x99t collapse the financial system when they burst.'b'Bear in mind that the implosion of the 1990s stock bubble, while nasty  \xe2\x80\x94  households took a $5 trillion hit  \xe2\x80\x94  didn\xe2\x80\x99t provoke a financial crisis. So what was different about the housing bubble that followed?'b'The short answer is that while the stock bubble created a lot of risk, that risk was fairly widely diffused across the economy. By contrast, the risks created by the housing bubble were strongly concentrated in the financial sector. As a result, the collapse of the housing bubble threatened to bring down the nation\xe2\x80\x99s banks. And banks play a special role in the economy. If they can\xe2\x80\x99t function, the wheels of commerce as a whole grind to a halt.'b'Why did the bankers take on so much risk? Because it was in their self-interest to do so. By increasing leverage  \xe2\x80\x94  that is, by making risky investments with borrowed money  \xe2\x80\x94  banks could increase their short-term profits. And these short-term profits, in turn, were reflected in immense personal bonuses. If the concentration of risk in the banking sector increased the danger of a systemwide financial crisis, well, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the bankers\xe2\x80\x99 problem.'b'Of course, that conflict of interest is the reason we have bank regulation. But in the years before the crisis, the rules were relaxed  \xe2\x80\x94  and, even more important, regulators failed to expand the rules to cover the growing \xe2\x80\x9cshadow\xe2\x80\x9d banking system, consisting of institutions like Lehman Brothers that performed banklike functions even though they didn\xe2\x80\x99t offer conventional bank deposits.'b'The result was a financial industry that was hugely profitable as long as housing prices were going up  \xe2\x80\x94  finance accounted for more than a third of total U.S. profits as the bubble was inflating  \xe2\x80\x94  but was brought to the edge of collapse once the bubble burst. It took government aid on an immense scale, and the promise of even more aid if needed, to pull the industry back from the brink.'b'And here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing: Since that aid came with few strings  \xe2\x80\x94  in particular, no major banks were nationalized even though some clearly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have survived without government help  \xe2\x80\x94  there\xe2\x80\x99s every incentive for bankers to engage in a repeat performance. After all, it\xe2\x80\x99s now clear that they\xe2\x80\x99re living in a heads-they-win, tails-taxpayers-lose world.'b'The test for reform, then, is whether it reduces bankers\xe2\x80\x99 incentives and ability to concentrate risk going forward.'b'Transparency is part of the answer. Before the crisis, hardly anyone realized just how much risk the banks were taking on. More disclosure, especially with regard to complex financial derivatives, would clearly help.'b'Beyond that, an important aspect of reform should be new rules limiting bank leverage. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be delving into proposed legislation in future columns, but here\xe2\x80\x99s what I can say about the financial reform bill the House passed  \xe2\x80\x94  with zero Republican votes  \xe2\x80\x94  last month: Its limits on leverage look O.K. Not great, but O.K. It would, however, be all too easy for those rules to get weakened to the point where they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do the job. A few tweaks in the fine print and banks would be free to play the same game all over again.'b'And reform really should take on the financial industry\xe2\x80\x99s compensation practices. If Congress can\xe2\x80\x99t legislate away the financial rewards for excessive risk-taking, it can at least try to tax them.'b'Let me conclude with a political note. The main reason for reform is to serve the nation. If we don\xe2\x80\x99t get major financial reform now, we\xe2\x80\x99re laying the foundations for the next crisis. But there are also political reasons to act.'b'For there\xe2\x80\x99s a populist rage building in this country, and President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s kid-gloves treatment of the bankers has put Democrats on the wrong side of this rage. If Congressional Democrats don\xe2\x80\x99t take a tough line with the banks in the months ahead, they will pay a big price in November.'b''b'Readers intending to watch the movie \xe2\x80\x9cAvatar\xe2\x80\x9d should know that major events in the plot are revealed.'b''b'Every age produces its own sort of fables, and our age seems to have produced The White Messiah fable.'b'This is the oft-repeated story about a manly young adventurer who goes into the wilderness in search of thrills and profit.

He flies the big red bird that no one in generations has been able to master.'b'Along the way, he has his consciousness raised. The peace-loving natives are at one with nature, and even have a fiber-optic cable sticking out of their bodies that they can plug into horses and trees, which is like Horse Whispering without the wireless technology. Because they are not corrupted by things like literacy, cellphones and blockbuster movies, they have deep and tranquil souls.'b'The natives help the white guy discover that he, too, has a deep and tranquil soul.'b'The natives have hot bodies and perfect ecological sensibilities, but they are natural creatures, not history-making ones. When the military-industrial complex comes in to strip mine their homes, they need a White Messiah to lead and inspire the defense.'b'Our hero leaps in, with the help of a pack of dinosaurs summoned by Mother Earth. As he and his fellow freedom fighters kill wave after wave of Marines or former Marines or whatever they are, he achieves the ultimate prize: He is accepted by the natives and can spend the rest of his life in their excellent culture.'b'Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s handling of the White Messiah fable is not the reason \xe2\x80\x9cAvatar\xe2\x80\x9d is such a huge global hit. As John Podhoretz 'b'wrote in The Weekly Standard'b', \xe2\x80\x9cCameron has simply used these familiar bromides as shorthand to give his special-effects spectacular some resonance.\xe2\x80\x9d The plotline gives global audiences a chance to see American troops get killed. It offers useful hooks on which McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s and other corporations can hang their tie-in campaigns.'b'Still, would it be totally annoying to point out that the whole White Messiah fable, especially as Cameron applies it, is kind of offensive?'b'It rests on the stereotype that white people are rationalist and technocratic while colonial victims are spiritual and athletic. It rests on the assumption that nonwhites need the White Messiah to lead their crusades. It rests on the assumption that illiteracy is the path to grace. It also creates a sort of two-edged cultural imperialism. Natives can either have their history shaped by cruel imperialists or benevolent ones, but either way, they are going to be supporting actors in our journey to self-admiration.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s just escapism, obviously, but benevolent romanticism can be just as condescending as the malevolent kind \xe2\x80\x94 even when you surround it with pop-up ferns and floating mountains.'b'Pittsburgh'b'IN the final days of a year dominated by repeated \xe2\x80\x94 and mostly unheeded \xe2\x80\x94 calls for full disclosure on the part of Wall Street banks, pharmaceutical companies, the N.F.L. and any number of other organizations, transparency arrived out of the blue from an unlikely quarter if ever there was one: the Freemasons.'b'Thanks go not to Dan Brown, whose latest novel, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lost Symbol,\xe2\x80\x9d focuses on the notoriously mysterious fraternal order, but to Tom Sturgeon, a career law-enforcement officer, who was installed as Right Worshipful Grand Master for Pennsylvania on Dec. 28. His ceremony, in a break with centuries-old Masonic tradition, was held at a convention center here and open to the public. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to make Freemasonry more contemporary,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Sturgeon told me, \xe2\x80\x9cto make it reflect 2010, not 1910 \xe2\x80\x94 or 1810.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Nonetheless, the audience of about 1,200 people seemed to consist primarily of members and their families with a sizeable contingent of Masonic dignitaries from 13 other states and Canada. Many had come in full regalia, sporting tailcoats, purple moire  or black velvet \xe2\x80\x9ccollars,\xe2\x80\x9d satin aprons embroidered with esoteric symbols, white gloves, swords \xe2\x80\x94 all telegraphing distinctions of rank legible only to insiders.'b'Freemasonry in America is organized by state \xe2\x80\x94 there is no higher governing body \xe2\x80\x94 and Pennsylvania is the largest Masonic jurisdiction in the world, with a spectacular temple in Philadelphia, completed in 1873, as its headquarters. Mr. Sturgeon was sworn in reciting the same oath, or \xe2\x80\x9cobligation,\xe2\x80\x9d Benjamin Franklin recited 275 years ago when he took the same office.'b'If the ceremony at the convention center was any indication, it appears that not much has changed in the interim, although the torches around the altar are now electric and the musical repertoire has been updated to include \xe2\x80\x9cBeer Barrel Polka\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cNo Man Is an Island.\xe2\x80\x9d Membership has been declining (currently 120,000 in Pennsylvania, down from 260,000 when Mr. Sturgeon joined in 1965) and the median age has been steadily climbing (now 68).'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBrethren, ladies and friends,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Sturgeon greeted the audience for his installation. \xe2\x80\x9cThe 21st-century Masonic Renaissance starts today!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The \xe2\x80\x9crenaissance\xe2\x80\x9d is Mr. Sturgeon\xe2\x80\x99s agenda for reform, jump-starting a membership drive with a new strategy that permits \xe2\x80\x9cselective invitation,\xe2\x80\x9d replacing the old \xe2\x80\x9cTo be one, ask one\xe2\x80\x9d policy that forbade Masons to proselytize. He also decreed a lifetime dues exemption for any Mason over 60 who brings in two new members under 30. Like other Pennsylvania grand masters before him, Mr. Sturgeon designed a necktie, to be distributed as a token of appreciation. Typically, the ties are a vehicle for the Masonic insignia; his is more in the style of Jerry Garcia, something he thinks younger guys might be more inclined to wear.'b'In his most radical move, Mr. Sturgeon has mandated that the ritual be published in book form. In Pennsylvania, since the order\xe2\x80\x99s beginnings, each Mason has learned his obligation from another Mason, one on one. The ritual had never been written down. For the two lowest ranks of Freemasonry it lasts 30 minutes or so; for the third and highest degree it takes roughly an hour and runs to some 8,000 words. \xe2\x80\x9cIt might take a man away from home maybe 50 nights to sit and learn it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Though candidates will still be required to perform the ritual from memory, the printed text allows them to learn it on their own. Mr. Sturgeon assured his fellow masons that photocopying will be prohibited, that all copies will be signed out and strictly audited. Even so, this announcement met with silence, a response he had foreseen. \xe2\x80\x9cMany Masons will tell you that one of the great bonds of this fraternity happens when I meet with you 40 times to go over this work, and I become your mentor,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, that\xe2\x80\x99s true. But for the greater good, we have to make a decision.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Not a secret society but \xe2\x80\x9ca society with secrets\xe2\x80\x9d is how the protagonist of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lost Symbol\xe2\x80\x9d describes the Masons. Has that secrecy served a purpose? Is the famous Masonic bond based, at least to some extent, on shared information that nobody else knows? If that was once the case, it seems safe to say that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t any longer, now that detailed accounts of the Masons\xe2\x80\x99 procedures have been posted online, including YouTube videos of the secret handshake.'b'The drama seems to be in short supply. Any Dan Brown fans who came to the convention center in Pittsburgh expecting daggers pressed to bare chests or red wine drunk out of a skull surely left disappointed. Mr. Sturgeon says that he thought Mr. Brown made that stuff up until a friend reminded him that in one ceremony they attended for a branch of Masonry called the Scottish Rite there had indeed been a skull; he is, however, quite certain that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t drink wine out of it. And if there is a pyramid with Freemasonry\xe2\x80\x99s highest secrets inscribed on it, as \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lost Symbol\xe2\x80\x9d purports, he has yet to hear about it.'b'Some Masons may regret losing the mystique \xe2\x80\x94 though surely not as much as the conspiracy theorists, who now have less room for speculation about the order. While it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to put much store in allegations that Freemasonry is Satan worship or a plot to dominate the world when its membership has included such disparate characters as Count Basie, Daniel Boone, Winston Churchill, Paul Revere, Clark Gable, J. Edgar Hoover, Mozart, Colonel Sanders, Peter Sellers, Cy Young, Pushkin and Brad Paisley, those suspicions thrived nonetheless. The conspiracy theorists, it seems, needed the Masons\xe2\x80\x99 secrecy even more than the Masons needed it themselves.'b'EVERY year, more than 100,000 Americans discover that they have  often life-threatening blood and bone-marrow diseases like leukemia.  For many, the only hope is a transplant of blood-producing marrow cells.'b'Finding someone to donate the marrow is challenging, though, because the cells must be a near-perfect genetic match with the patient\xe2\x80\x99s own cells, and those are hard to find. Even siblings have compatible marrow cells only 30 percent of the time. Most patients must search nationally and internationally for potential donors.'b'Only 7 in 10 Caucasian patients who need a donor find one. For African-Americans, the odds are longer still; only one in four do.  Tens of thousands of Americans have died for lack of a donor.'b'It would make sense to encourage donation by offering potential donors an incentive \xe2\x80\x94 a gift to a favorite charity, for example, or a scholarship. But federal law forbids doctors, nurses or dying patients to offer any incentives. The intent of the 1984 law, 'b'the National Organ Transplant Act'b', was to prevent the sale of human kidneys for transplant, out of concern that a market in organs could tempt people to risk their health for money by making an irreversible decision to be a donor.'b'But with marrow donation this is not an issue. Unlike organs, marrow cells \xe2\x80\x94 basically, immature blood cells \xe2\x80\x94 are renewable. The body grows fresh ones quickly enough to replace those extracted for transplant in about a month. And donating marrow cells is now very safe \xe2\x80\x94 in most cases, it\xe2\x80\x99s simply a matter of drawing blood from the donor\xe2\x80\x99s arm and running it through a machine that skims off the marrow cells. Well under  half of donations are conducted the old way, by harvesting marrow cells from the donor\xe2\x80\x99s hip.'b'Interestingly, Congress didn\xe2\x80\x99t bar compensation for all human donors. In writing the 1984 law, it excluded renewable cells like blood or sperm from the payment prohibition, even as it inexplicably included bone marrow.'b'We have filed in federal district court a constitutional challenge to the marrow prohibition, because we want to set up a pilot program to ascertain the extent to which certain strategic incentives \xe2\x80\x94 a $3,000 scholarship, a housing allowance, a charitable gift \xe2\x80\x94 could increase marrow-cell donations.'b'If our suit is successful and incentives are allowed, it would not create a freewheeling market in bone marrow donation. Marrow donation would, and should, remain anonymous \xe2\x80\x94 and there should be no negotiation with donors. There would be no buyers or sellers, no possibility of market-like transactions.'b'But people who provide life-giving marrow cells could, in good conscience, get something in return for helping save a life.'b'On July 12, the Op-Ed page published an article by Jonathan Gruber, a professor of economics at M.I.T., on health insurance and taxation. On Friday, Professor Gruber confirmed reports that he is a paid consultant to the Department of Health and Human Services, and that his contract was in effect when he published his article. The article did not disclose this relationship to readers.'b'Like other writers for the Op-Ed page, Professor Gruber signed a contract that obligated him to tell editors of such a relationship. Had editors been aware of Professor Gruber\xe2\x80\x99s government ties, the Op-Ed page would have insisted on disclosure or not published his article.'b'If there\xe2\x80\x99s a silver lining in the December jobs report, it is this: Nothing concentrates the minds of politicians like rising unemployment in an election year. Unless Congress and the White House push a robust job-creation agenda \xe2\x80\x94  starting now \xe2\x80\x94  worsening joblessness is a distinct possibility, even if the economy in general recovers in the coming months. That means the unemployment rate could still be high or even climbing when the midterm elections near. That may be the best hope for concerted federal action to put Americans back to work.'b'At 10 percent, the unemployment rate was unchanged from November to December. But the only reason it held steady is that 661,000 jobless Americans were not counted as unemployed last month because they had not looked for a job in the four weeks preceding the December survey. If they had been included, the jobless rate would have been closer to 10.4 percent. Over all, an estimated 3.6 million out-of-work people have been uncounted since the recession began in December 2007. They include people who had not recently looked for work and those who would have entered the work force in normal times, like recent high school and college graduates, but remained on the sidelines as jobs disappeared.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s the rub: As soon as the economy shows more signs of life, those missing workers are likely to start looking for work. That would add to the ranks of the officially unemployed, causing the jobless rate to rise, perhaps dramatically \xe2\x80\x94 unless jobs are being created to absorb the labor glut.'b'The private sector alone is unlikely to create enough new jobs, even as the economy recovers. Employers are more likely to add hours to the truncated workweeks of existing employees than to hire new workers. They may also prefer to make temporary workers permanent rather than add new staff.'b'And even if hiring were unexpectedly strong, it could not repair the severely damaged job market anytime soon. The economy lost another 85,000 jobs in December, bringing the official total job loss over the past two years to 7.2 million jobs. But with the population growing \xe2\x80\x94 and with revisions to earlier data expected to show larger losses than previously reported \xe2\x80\x94 the economy is probably coming up short by 10 million to 11 million jobs. The job growth that would be needed to recoup losses of that magnitude in the next three years \xe2\x80\x94 some 400,000 jobs a month \xe2\x80\x94 is simply not in the cards.'b'Responding to the jobs report on Friday, Mr. Obama reminded Americans that $2.3 billion in tax credits \xe2\x80\x94 passed by Congress last year as part of the fiscal stimulus \xe2\x80\x94 would soon begin to spur the creation of some 17,000 green technology jobs. He also called on Congress to approve another $5 billion in spending for more clean energy manufacturing. And he urged lawmakers to move on legislation for several job ideas he put forth last month, including a plan for public-works employment and bolstered small business lending. That\xe2\x80\x99s a start, but now he has to get Congress to act.'b'The jobs he saves may be those of members of Congress from his own party.'b'We didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay attention to the housing bubble. We closed our eyes to warnings that the levees in New Orleans were inadequate. We gave short shrift to reports that bin Laden was determined to attack the U.S. And now we\xe2\x80\x99re all but ignoring the fiscal train wreck that is coming from states with budget crises big enough to boggle the mind.'b'The states are in the worst fiscal shape since the Depression. The Great Recession has caused state tax revenues to fall off a cliff. Some states  \xe2\x80\x94  New York and California come quickly to mind  \xe2\x80\x94  are facing prolonged budget nightmares. Across the country, critical state services are being chopped like firewood. More cuts are coming. Taxes and fees are being raised. Yet the budgets in dozens and dozens of states remain drastically out of balance.'b'This is an arrow aimed straight at the heart of a robust national recovery. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has pointed out that if you add up the state budget gaps that have recently been plugged (in most cases, temporarily and haphazardly) and those that remain to be dealt with, you\xe2\x80\x99ll likely reach a staggering $350 billion for the 2010 and 2011 fiscal years.'b'This is not a disaster waiting to happen. It\xe2\x80\x99s under way.'b'Without substantial new federal help, state cuts that are now merely drastic will become draconian, and hundreds of thousands of additional jobs will be lost. The suffering is already widespread. Some states have laid off or furloughed employees. Tens of thousands of teachers have been let go as cuts have been made to public schools and critically important preschool programs. California has bludgeoned its public higher education system, one of the finest in the world.'b'Michigan has cut some of the benefits it provided to middle-class families struggling with the costs of health care for severely disabled children  \xe2\x80\x94  benefits that helped pay for such things as incontinence supplies and transportation to special care centers. The Grand Rapids Press quoted a state official who acknowledged that the cuts were \xe2\x80\x9ctough\xe2\x80\x9d and were hurting families. But he added, \xe2\x80\x9cThe state simply doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the money.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The collapse of state tax revenues caused by the recession is the sharpest on record. Steep budget cuts have not been enough to offset the unprecedented plunge in tax collections that resulted from unemployment and other aspects of the downturn. The shortfalls swept the nation. As the Rockefeller Institute of Government reported, \xe2\x80\x9cTotal tax revenue declined in all 44 states for which comparable early data are available.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'State governments are not without fault. Very few have been paragons of fiscal responsibility over the years. California is a well-known basket case. New York has a Legislature that is a laughingstock. But for the federal government to resist offering substantial additional help in the face of this growing crisis would be foolhardy. You can\xe2\x80\x99t have a healthy national economy while dozens of states are hooked up to life support.'b'The Center on Budget offered some insight into how the trouble in the states adds up to trouble for us all:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cExpenditure cuts are problematic policies during an economic downturn because they reduce overall demand and can make the downturn deeper. When states cut spending, they lay off employees, cancel contracts with vendors, eliminate or lower payments to businesses and nonprofit organizations that provide direct services, and cut benefit payments to individuals.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn all of these circumstances, the companies and organizations that would have received government payments have less money to spend on salaries and supplies, and individuals who would have received salaries or benefits have less money for consumption. This directly removes demand from the economy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Obama administration has provided significant help to states through its stimulus program, and it has made a difference. It prevented the crisis from being much worse. But much of that assistance will run out by the end of the year and states are fashioning budgets right now that will absolutely hammer the quality of life for some of their most vulnerable residents.'b'New York\xe2\x80\x99s lieutenant governor, Richard Ravitch, has been trying to bring a measure of sanity to the state\xe2\x80\x99s budget process. But as he told me this week, without additional federal help, many states will have no choice but to impose extreme budget cuts, or raise taxes, or  \xe2\x80\x94  most likely  \xe2\x80\x94  do both.'b'We need more responsible and less wasteful fiscal behavior from all levels of government. But the country is still faced with a national economic emergency, with tens of millions out of work or underemployed. We can hardly afford any additional economic shocks. Turning our backs on the desperate trouble the states are in right now is nothing less than an utterly willful invitation to disaster.'b'In our search for comity and common ground this year, perhaps we can all agree that professional athletes should try to reduce the use of firearms to resolve personal disputes in 2010.'b'You may have heard that the Washington Wizards are engulfed in a crisis over Gilbert Arenas, one of the team\xe2\x80\x99s star players. His fight with a teammate over a gambling debt led to a display of handguns in the Wizards locker room.'b'Seldom have we seen so many words that do not belong in the same sentence. Perhaps not since Plaxico Burress of the New York Giants managed to string together pistol, nightclub, \xe2\x80\x9ctucked in his sweatpants waistband\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwent off.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to Arenas in a minute. Actually, he was only up there in the beginning because in these distracted times you do need a good celebrity connection if you want to make a serious policy point.'b'Gun control is one of those issues where deep political division hides a general national consensus. A vast majority of Americans believe people should be able to keep guns for reasonable purposes, like defending their homes or hunting. But they also approve of background checks and other regulations aimed at keeping weapons out of the hands of criminals and the mentally disturbed.'b'Mayors Against Illegal Guns recently hired the pollster Frank Luntz to ask gun owners whether they approved of closing one of the big loopholes in current regulation \xe2\x80\x94 the fact that people who buy weapons at gun shows don\xe2\x80\x99t have to undergo background checks. Close to 70 percent of National Rifle Association members said yes, and 85 percent of gun owners who were not N.R.A. members said they approved.'b'Also, 82 percent of N.R.A. members said they felt that the F.B.I. should be able to block people under investigation for being suspected terrorists from buying guns.'b'Let us pause for a moment to consider the 9 percent of respondents who said they thought this was a bad idea. Perhaps they live in the same compound with the 1 out of 10 dentists who did not think patients who chewed gum should go for the sugarless kind.'b'Or maybe they are all serving in the United States Senate. In 2007, Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey introduced a bill that would give the attorney general the authority to prohibit the sale of guns or explosives to known or suspected terrorists. It is still sitting somewhere in the Senate Judiciary Committee.'b'There is, of course, a cultural divide between the crowded parts of the country and the nearly empty parts when it comes to guns. Residents of rural areas see them as a natural part of daily life. Those of us who live in the crowded places tend to regard them as a problem.'b'The District of Columbia suffered so terribly from gun violence that it passed the most stringent gun control laws in the country. And the owner of the local basketball team changed its name from the Bullets to the Wizards to reinforce the fact that in the crowded places, guns are a serious, serious matter.'b'The star guard of the Wizards, Gilbert Arenas, missed this point completely. Perhaps he thought the name change had something to do with Harry Potter.'b'Arenas is a terrific basketball player who has now created a moment of national consensus over the fact that everything about his gun story represents a bad idea. The details are still murky, but Arenas apparently brought four unloaded handguns for which he had no permit into the Wizards locker room, put them on a chair and indicated to the teammate with whom he had been fighting that he should pick one. The Washington Post has reported that said teammate then grabbed his own pistol, loaded it and chambered a bullet. At this moment, Arenas has been suspended without pay and the teammate is undoubtedly having a really, really bad day.'b'Even when his $111 million contract appeared to be hanging in the balance, Arenas seemed to regard the whole situation as hilarious. \xe2\x80\x9cI wake up this morning and seen I was the new JOHN WAYNE. ... media is too funny,\xe2\x80\x9d he Twittered. Then: \xe2\x80\x9cI guess nobody thought that last text was funny welll I hav 2 change subjects ... what about that TIGER WOODS.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I would like to offer two comments about this. One is that professional athletes should not Twitter. I got this thought from Ashley Mayo, a student at the Columbia Journalism School, who showed me an essay that she had written on the subject, which included a tweet from one of the Indiana Pacers containing the good news that he had begun the day with a triumph over irregularity.'b'The second thought is that the average Tiger Woods fan is a middle-aged guy who is frequently too tired at night to behave badly if he wanted to, and that we have spent the last month worrying about the wrong role model.'b'The attack on the Republican establishment by the tea party folks grabs the gaze like a really bad horror flick  \xe2\x80\x94  some version of \xe2\x80\x9cHee Haw\xe2\x80\x9d meets \xe2\x80\x9c28 Days Later.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s fascinating. But it also raises a serious question: Are these the desperate thrashings of a dying movement or the labor pains of a new one?'b'My money is on the former. Anyone who says that this is the dawn of a new age of conservatism is engaging in wishful thinking on a delusional scale.'b'There is no doubt that the number of people who say that they are conservative has inched up. According to a report from Gallup on Thursday, 'b'conservatives finished 2009'b' as the No. 1 ideological group. But ideological identification is no predictor of electoral outcomes. According to 'b'polls by The New York Times'b', conservative identification was slightly higher on the verge of Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s first-term election and Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s election than it was on the verge of George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s first-term election.'b'It is likely that Republicans 'b'will pick up Congressional seats'b' in November partly because of the enthusiasm of this conservative fringe, democratic apathy and historical trends. But make no mistake: This is not 1994.'b'This is a limited, emotional reaction. It\xe2\x80\x99s a response to the trauma that is the Great Recession, the uncertainty and creeping suspicion about the risks being taken in Washington, a visceral reaction to Obama and an overwhelming sense of powerlessness and loss.'b'Simply put, it\xe2\x80\x99s about fear-fueled anger. But anger is not an idea. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a plan. And it\xe2\x80\x99s not a vision for the future. It is, however, the second stage of grief, right after denial and before bargaining.'b'The right is on the wrong side of history. The demographics of the country are rapidly changing, young people are becoming increasingly liberal on social issues, and rigid, dogmatic religious stricture is loosening its grip on the throat of our culture.'b'The right has seen the enemy, and he is the future.'b'According to 'b'a Gallup report issued this week'b', Republicans were more than twice as likely as Democrats and a third more likely as independents to have a pessimistic outlook for the country over the next 20 years. That might be the fourth stage of grief: depression.'b'So what\xe2\x80\x99s their battle plan to fight back from the precipice of irrelevance? Moderation? A stab at modernity? A slate of innovative ideas? No,  their plan is to purge the party\xe2\x80\x99s moderates and march farther down the road to oblivion.'b'Erick Erickson, the incendiary editor of the popular conservative blog RedState, appeared on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Colbert Report\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'on Monday'b' and said that \xe2\x80\x9cno one really knows what a Republican is anymore.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Split hairs about labels if you must, but the Republican brand already has begun a slow slide into obscurity. And turning further right only hastens its demise. Quiet as it\xe2\x80\x99s kept, many in the party know this. That, alas, is called acceptance.'b'Five months after Afghanistan\xe2\x80\x99s tainted presidential election, it still does not have a fully functioning government in place. President Hamid Karzai nominated 24 members to his new cabinet, and last week Parliament rejected 17 of them.'b'That could further delay the reforms that are urgently needed to reverse years of government mismanagement and corruption. Still, Parliament has shown a healthy independence and many of its judgments appear sound. It also gives Mr. Karzai another chance to assemble a stronger team. He should do so, quickly.'b'Several important cabinet posts were approved, including the ministers of defense, interior, finance, agriculture and education. These appointees are largely technocrats and are seen by American and other Western officials as competent and relatively untainted by corruption \xe2\x80\x94 an especially important qualification for officials who will control large sums of outside aid.'b'Washington lobbied hard for the incumbents Abdul Rahim Wardak, the defense minister, and Hanif Atmar, the interior minister. They are both considered to be strong leaders and allies for the necessary but difficult effort to build up and strengthen the army and to clean up the highly corrupt police.'b'Lawmakers also wisely rejected the reappointment of Ismail Khan as energy minister and three nominees associated with Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum. Mr. Khan and General Dostum backed Mr. Karzai in the campaign. Both are also notorious warlords accused of human rights abuses. If Mr. Karzai felt a debt to them, he should consider it repaid, distance himself from such unsavory cronies and reach out to other candidates.'b'President Karzai showed better sense when he chose political allies of Abdullah Abdullah \xe2\x80\x94 his main challenger in the August election \xe2\x80\x94 to serve as ministers of higher education, rural rehabilitation and refugees. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know why Parliament rejected them; they may not have been the best choices. Mr. Karzai should work hard to find other competent members of Mr. Abdullah\xe2\x80\x99s group to serve in the government.'b'He should also work hard to find a place for Ashraf Ghani, a former finance minister and World Bank official who is well regarded internationally. He has sensible ideas about developing a national strategy for improving governance and for adopting transparent criteria for choosing credible people for government jobs. He could bring both credibility and competence to a government short on both.'b'After the cabinet vote, lawmakers were about go on their winter break. President Karzai was right to insist that they remain in Kabul until they confirm a new cabinet. He now must put forward a better list of nominees and work cooperatively with a Parliament he usually ignores to win their approval. Washington should encourage them to come to terms as quickly as possible.

After all, any number of experts have argued that antidepressants \xe2\x80\x94 and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like Paxil in particular \xe2\x80\x94 are overhyped and oversold. And after years of hearing about shady practices within the pharmaceutical industry, and of psychiatrists who enrich themselves in the shadows by helping the industry market its drugs, we are primed to believe stories of psychiatric trickery.'b'Yet in all the excitement about \xe2\x80\x9cstartling\xe2\x80\x9d news and \xe2\x80\x9csugar pills,\xe2\x80\x9d a more nuanced and truer story about mental health care in America was all but lost.'b'That story begins to take shape when you consider what the new study actually said: Antidepressants do work for very severely depressed people, as well as for those whose mild depression is chronic. However, the researchers found, the pills don\xe2\x80\x99t work for people who aren\xe2\x80\x99t really depressed \xe2\x80\x94 people with short-term, minor depression whose problems tend to get better on their own.

Neither is it all that likely to change the practice of treating depression \xe2\x80\x94 at least as it\xe2\x80\x99s carried out by responsible doctors.'b'After all, people who are depressed for the first time, or have been depressed for only a short time, or are upset after a personal setback, aren\xe2\x80\x99t considered ideal candidates for immediate drug therapy. And, contrary to popular belief, there\xe2\x80\x99s no evidence that most psychiatrists regularly prescribe pills straight off to people who can get better by reading about depression, exercising or doing nothing. What numbers do exist, said Peter Kramer, who has written extensively on antidepressant use in books like \xe2\x80\x9cListening to Prozac,\xe2\x80\x9d indicate that relatively few people with minimal depression leave psychiatrists\xe2\x80\x99 offices with a prescription.'b'That people have come to believe otherwise may be in part because most patients with depression are treated by general practitioners, not psychiatrists. Studies have shown that these primary care doctors don\xe2\x80\x99t strenuously enough screen their patients for depression before prescribing drugs, or closely monitor their care afterward.'b'And here the truer story about mental health care in America begins to unfold. The trouble is not that the drugs don\xe2\x80\x99t work; it\xe2\x80\x99s that the care is not very good.'b'Inadequate treatment by nonspecialists is only a piece of the problem. In fact, most Americans with depression, rather than being overmedicated, are undertreated or not treated at all. This might have been big news this week, too, had anyone noticed another academic study, 'b'a survey'b' of nearly 16,000 people published this month in The Archives of General Psychiatry, which looked more broadly at the picture of depression in America.

Indeed, as illustrated by the chart below (based on data from the Pentagon and 'b'icasualties.org'b', an independent research group), in 2009 there were 498 American and allied deaths in Afghanistan as compared with  141 in Iraq.'b'While the loss of any American life is tragic, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to point out that the Iraq figure is down from 306 fatalities in 2008, and that most of these deaths took place in Baghdad and surrounding towns, a sign that the United States is making progress in turning the counterinsurgency efforts over to Iraqi military and police forces.'b'The news from Afghanistan is far less heartening. The death toll is up by 40 percent from last year, and that\xe2\x80\x99s without including fatalities among Afghan Army and security personnel. Most of the deaths are occurring on the battlefield (unlike in Iraq, where half the fatalities weren\xe2\x80\x99t related to combat), an indication of the intensity of the fighting. And while many see the war in Afghanistan as an American effort, the colors  on the chart show the extent to which the Western allies are sharing the deadly burden.'b'The country needs health care reform, and Congress should move quickly to pass legislation. But as House and Senate leaders work to forge a consensus bill for final approval, they should look for ways to lessen the Medicaid burden on hard-pressed state budgets \xe2\x80\x94 and ensure that relief is fairly apportioned.'b'One of the important goals is to extend coverage to more low-income Americans. The bills quite sensibly require the states to expand Medicaid and offer them generous federal support to do so. Even then, the states \xe2\x80\x94 whose Medicaid budgets are already badly stretched \xe2\x80\x94 will have to put up substantial money of their own.'b'Ideally, Congress should find some way to get more  money to state Medicaid programs. But if that proves politically impossible, as seems likely, the states will have to bear part of the additional burden in what is, after all, a shared national enterprise. Their poorer citizens will benefit greatly.'b''b'HOW DOES MEDICAID WORK?'b'The program currently pays for health care and nursing home care for 50 million poor Americans. In fiscal year 2008, the federal government paid about 57 percent of the total $354 billion cost, with the states picking up the rest. Both bills would broaden eligibility, and their requirement that everyone obtain insurance should also push more currently eligible people to sign up. That is a good thing.'b'It is important to remember that under the reform bills, all of these people would gain access to health insurance \xe2\x80\x94 either through Medicaid or through federally subsidized private insurance plans. Medicaid is a better deal for poor people because it typically charges much less in co-payments and premiums for a better package of benefits than private insurers are apt to provide. From an overall budgetary standpoint, Medicaid is also the cheapest way to insure people since it reimburses hospitals, doctors and other providers at a lower rate than private insurers do.'b'The issue here is how much the states can and should pay for expanding Medicaid rolls.'b''b''b'HOW WOULD IT CHANGE? 'b''b' Right now the states differ considerably on who is eligible for Medicaid. (Only a few   states extend much coverage to poor, childless adults.) Both the House and the Senate versions would require the states to cover all poor people under age 65. The House version would set an income ceiling of 150 percent of the federal poverty level, or $33,000 for a family of four. The Senate bill would expand coverage only up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, or $29,300 for a family of four. Our own preference would be to choose the higher ceiling for the benefit of more people.'b''b'WHO PAYS? AND HOW MUCH? 'b'To ease the additional burden on the states, under both bills the federal government would pick up the entire tab for newly eligible enrollees for the first two or three years. After that the states would have to pick up part of the cost.'b'The amount of federal support would differ for two categories of people. For those new enrollees who could have been covered under the state\xe2\x80\x99s existing rules \xe2\x80\x94 but never enrolled \xe2\x80\x94 the federal government would pay its usual share, which varies depending on a state\xe2\x80\x99s per capita income. In fiscal year 2008, the federal government paid three-quarters of the program\xe2\x80\x99s costs in Mississippi but only half the cost in New York and California.'b'But for all \xe2\x80\x9cnewly eligible\xe2\x80\x9d enrollees \xe2\x80\x94 those who were not covered by a state\xe2\x80\x99s previous rules \xe2\x80\x94 the states would get a greatly enhanced match. That is appropriate since the goal is to enroll a lot more people. The House would have the federal government pay 91 percent of the costs of these newly eligible in every state. The Senate would pay 82 to 95 percent of the cost, depending on a state\xe2\x80\x99s per capita income. We believe that per capita income is a poor measure of how much help a state needs, especially in states like New York and California, where a veneer of very-high-income people can skew the average income upward. The House approach seems fairer.'b''b'A BIGGER DISPARITY. 'b'While both bills would provide enhanced matches for \xe2\x80\x9cnewly eligible\xe2\x80\x9d Medicaid recipients, they have very different definitions of \xe2\x80\x9cnew.\xe2\x80\x9d The House would count people who are already covered by Medicaid under so-called waiver programs, which are considered demonstration projects. The Senate bill would not.'b'That may sound arcane, but it could make a huge difference. New York, which has large numbers of people in waiver programs, estimates that the Senate bill would cost it an additional $1 billion a year, while the House bill could actually save the state close to $4 billion a year. While good news for New York, that seems unfair.'b'California, a state in comparable if not worse budgetary distress, would get no such relief for its previous expansions of Medicaid because they were mostly achieved through amendments to its state Medicaid plan, not the waiver process. State officials calculate that the reform bills would require it to put up $3 billion to $4 billion a year to cover additional enrollees.'b'Instead of paying more for people already on the rolls, Congress should try to provide an enhanced share to all states for all new Medicaid enrollees, whether or not they were previously eligible.'b''b'WHAT ABOUT THE LAGGARDS? 'b'Texas, a state that currently has far less generous Medicaid coverage, illustrates the problems that can confront even a laggard state. While it will get substantial federal help to pay for its \xe2\x80\x9cnewly eligible\xe2\x80\x9d citizens, it estimates that it would still have to spend $20 billion to $24 billion over a decade to expand its Medicaid rolls.'b'There is no perfect answer to these problems other than providing a lot more federal money for Medicaid expansion. So far the Senate has provided extra money to win the votes of key senators, most notoriously by granting Nebraska full federal funding in perpetuity for all newly eligible people it enrolls. Ideally, that should be done for all states, as Senator Ben Nelson, under fire for his special deal, has recently suggested.'b'That is not apt to happen. But surely Congress could find at least a little more money to ease the problems of California and other states that have already expanded their Medicaid rolls and now face crushing deficits.'b''b'This editorial is a part of a 'b'continuing series'b' by The New York Times that is providing a comprehensive examination of the policy changes and politics behind the debate over health care reform.'b''b'About eight years ago, a company called Beef Products Inc. had the novel idea of injecting its ground beef with ammonia to kill deadly E. coli and salmonella.

(In March, Bank of America\xe2\x80\x99s   Ken Lewis, who presided over the bungled acquisition of Merrill Lynch, issued his own apology and was still pushed out.)

Five minutes on the neighborhood playground will confirm that parents still try their best to instill in their children the merits of saying \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'True contrition is a rare thing in the American corner office, probably because when children become corporate executives they have lawyers who patiently explain how such good manners could get them in trouble in the land of legal liability. In bankers, this is compounded by a sense that they are truly doing God\xe2\x80\x99s work \xe2\x80\x94 not merely gambling with taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 money.'b'At play here, we suspect,  are both tactics and a sense of history.

We don\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to publish unwelcome news or tough-minded analysis about companies or industries that advertise in The Times.

Phil Angelides, the former California treasurer who is the inquiry\xe2\x80\x99s chairman, told me in interviews late last year that he has been busy deploying a tough investigative staff and will not allow the proceedings to devolve into a typical blue-ribbon Beltway exercise in toothless bloviation.'b'He wants to examine the financial sector\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgreed, stupidity, hubris and outright corruption\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x94  from traders on the ground to the board room. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s important that we deliver new information,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t just rehash what we\xe2\x80\x99ve known to date.\xe2\x80\x9d He understands that if he fails to make news or to tell the story in a way that is comprehensible and compelling enough to arouse Americans to demand action, Wall Street and Washington will both keep moving on, unchallenged and unchastened.'b'Angelides gets it. But he has a tough act to follow: Ferdinand Pecora, 'b'the legendary prosecutor'b' who served as chief counsel to the Senate committee that investigated the 1929 crash as F.D.R. took office. Pecora was a master of detail and drama. He riveted America even without the aid of television. His investigation led to indictments, jail sentences and, ultimately, key New Deal reforms  \xe2\x80\x94  the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Glass-Steagall Act, designed to prevent the formation of banks too big to fail.'b'As it happened, a major Pecora target was the chief executive of National City Bank, the institution that would grow up to be Citigroup. Among other transgressions, National City had 'b'repackaged bad Latin American debt as new securities'b' that it then sold to easily suckered investors during the frenzied 1920s boom. Once disaster struck, the bank\xe2\x80\x99s executives  helped  themselves to millions of dollars in interest-free loans. Yet their own employees had to keep ponying up salary deductions for decimated National City stock purchased at a heady precrash price.'b'Trade bad Latin American debt for bad mortgage debt, and you have a partial portrait of Citigroup at the height of the housing bubble. The reckless Citi executives of our day may not have given themselves interest-free loans, but they often walked away with the short-term, illusionary profits while their employees were left with shredded jobs and 401(k)\xe2\x80\x99s. Among those Citi executives was Robert Rubin, who, as the Clinton Treasury secretary, 'b'helped repeal the last vestiges of Glass-Steagall'b' after years of Wall Street assault. Somewhere Pecora is turning in his grave'b'Rubin has never apologized, let alone been held accountable. But he\xe2\x80\x99s hardly alone. Even after all the country has gone through, the titans who fueled the bubble are heedless. 'b'In last Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s Times'b', Sandy Weill, the former chief executive who built Citigroup (and recruited Rubin to its ranks), gave a remarkable interview to Katrina Brooker blaming his own hand-picked successor, Charles Prince, for his bank\xe2\x80\x99s implosion. Weill said he preferred to be remembered for his philanthropy. Good luck with that.'b'Among his causes is Carnegie Hall, where he is chairman of the board. To see how far American capitalism has fallen, contrast Weill with the giant who built Carnegie Hall. 'b'Not only is Andrew Carnegie remembered'b' for far more epic and generous philanthropy than Weill\xe2\x80\x99s  \xe2\x80\x94  'b'some 1,600 public libraries'b', just for starters  \xe2\x80\x94  but also for creating a steel empire that actually helped build America\xe2\x80\x99s industrial infrastructure in the late 19th century. At Citi, Weill built little more than a bloated gambling casino. As Paul Volcker, the regrettably 'b'powerless chairman of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Economic Recovery Advisory Board'b', 'b'said recently'b', there is not \xe2\x80\x9cone shred of neutral evidence\xe2\x80\x9d that any financial innovation of the past 20 years has led to economic growth. Citi, that \xe2\x80\x9cinnovative\xe2\x80\x9d banking supermarket, destroyed far more wealth than Weill can or will ever give away.'b'Even now  \xe2\x80\x94  despite its near-death experience, despite the departures of Weill, Prince and Rubin  \xe2\x80\x94  Citi remains as imperious as it was before 9/15. Its current chairman, Richard Parsons, was one of three executives (along with Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs and John Mack of Morgan Stanley) who 'b'failed to show up at the mid-December White House meeting'b' where President Obama implored bankers to increase lending. (The trio blamed fog for forcing them to participate by speakerphone, but the weather hadn\xe2\x80\x99t grounded their peers or Amtrak.) Last week, ABC World News was also stiffed by Citi, which refused to answer questions about its latest round of outrageous credit card rate increases and instead e-mailed 'b'a statement blaming its customers'b' for \xe2\x80\x9cnot paying back their loans.\xe2\x80\x9d This from a bank that still 'b'owes taxpayers $25 billion'b' of its 'b'$45 billion  handout'b'!'b'If Citi, among the most egregious of Wall Street reprobates, feels it can get away with business as usual, it\xe2\x80\x99s because it fears no retribution. And it got more good news last week. Now that Chris Dodd is vacating the Senate, his chairmanship of the Banking Committee 'b'may fall next year to Tim Johnson of South Dakota'b', home to Citi\xe2\x80\x99s credit card operation. Johnson was the only Senate Democrat to vote against Congress\xe2\x80\x99s recent bill policing credit card abuses.'b'Though bad history shows every sign of repeating itself on Wall Street, it will take a near-miracle for Angelides to repeat Pecora\xe2\x80\x99s triumph. Our zoo of financial skullduggery is far more complex, with many more moving pieces, than that of the 1920s. The new inquiry does have subpoena power, but its entire budget, a mere $8 million, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even match the 'b'lobbying'b' 'b'expenditures'b' for just three banks (Citi, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America) in the first nine months of 2009. The firms under scrutiny can pay for as many lawyers as they need to stall between now and Dec. 15, deadline day for the commission\xe2\x80\x99s report.'b'More daunting still is the inquiry\xe2\x80\x99s duty to reach into high places in the public sector as well as the private. The mystery of exactly what happened as TARP fell into place in the fateful fall of 2008 thickens by the day  \xe2\x80\x94  especially the behind-closed-door machinations surrounding the government rescue of A.I.G. and its counterparties. Last week, a Republican congressman, Darrell Issa of California, 'b'released e-mail'b' showing that officials at the New York Fed, then led by Timothy Geithner, pressured A.I.G. to delay disclosing to the S.E.C. and the public the details on the billions of bailout dollars it was funneling to its trading partners. In this backdoor rescue, taxpayers unknowingly awarded banks like Goldman 100 cents on the dollar for their bets on mortgage-backed securities.'b'Why was our money used to make these high-flying gamblers whole while ordinary Americans received no such beneficence? Nothing less than complete transparency will connect the dots. Among 'b'the big-name witnesses that the Angelides commission'b' has called for next week is Goldman\xe2\x80\x99s Blankfein. Geithner, Henry Paulson and Ben Bernanke should be next.'b'If they all skate away yet again by deflecting blame or mouthing pro forma mea culpas, it will be a sign that this inquiry, like so many other promises of reform since 9/15, is likely to leave Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s status quo largely intact. That\xe2\x80\x99s the ticking-bomb scenario that truly imperils us all.'b'Hong Kong'b'C. H. Tung, the first Chinese-appointed chief executive of Hong Kong after the handover in 1997, offered me a three-sentence summary the other day of China\xe2\x80\x99s modern economic history: \xe2\x80\x9cChina was asleep during the Industrial Revolution. She was just waking during the Information Technology Revolution. She intends to participate fully in the Green Revolution.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ll say. Being in China right now I am more convinced than ever that when historians look back at the end of the first decade of the 21st century, they will say that the most important thing to happen was not the Great Recession, but China\xe2\x80\x99s Green Leap Forward. The Beijing leadership clearly understands that the E.T.  \xe2\x80\x94  Energy Technology  \xe2\x80\x94  revolution is both a necessity and an opportunity, and they do not intend to miss it.'b'We, by contrast, intend to fix Afghanistan. Have a nice day.'b'O.K., that was a cheap shot. But here\xe2\x80\x99s one that isn\xe2\x80\x99t: Andy Grove, co-founder of Intel, liked to say that companies come to \xe2\x80\x9cstrategic inflection points,\xe2\x80\x9d where the fundamentals of a business change and they either make the hard decision to invest in a down cycle and take a more promising trajectory or do nothing and wither. The same is true for countries.'b'The U.S. is at just such a strategic inflection point. We are either going to put in place a price on carbon and the right regulatory incentives to ensure that America is China\xe2\x80\x99s main competitor/partner in the E.T. revolution, or we are going to gradually cede this industry to Beijing and the good jobs and energy security that would go with it.'b'Is President Obama going to finish health care and then put aside the pending energy legislation  \xe2\x80\x94  and carbon pricing  \xe2\x80\x94  that Congress has already passed in order to get through the midterms without Republicans screaming \xe2\x80\x9cnew taxes?\xe2\x80\x9d Or is he going to seize this moment before the midterms  \xe2\x80\x94  possibly his last window to put together a majority in the Senate, including some Republicans, for a price on carbon  \xe2\x80\x94  and put in place a real U.S. engine for clean energy innovation and energy security?'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve been stunned to learn about the sheer volume of wind, solar, mass transit, nuclear and more efficient coal-burning projects that have sprouted in China in just the last year.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s e-mail from Bill Gross, who runs eSolar, a promising California solar-thermal start-up: On Saturday, in Beijing, said Gross, he announced \xe2\x80\x9cthe biggest solar-thermal deal ever. It\xe2\x80\x99s a 2 gigawatt, $5 billion deal to build plants in China using our California-based technology. China is being even more aggressive than the U.S. We applied for a [U.S. Department of Energy] loan for a 92 megawatt project in New Mexico, and in less time than it took them to do stage 1 of the application review, China signs, approves, and is ready to begin construction this year on a 20 times bigger project!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yes, climate change is a concern for Beijing, but more immediately China\xe2\x80\x99s leaders know that their country is in the midst of the biggest migration of people from the countryside to urban centers in the history of mankind. This is creating a surge in energy demand, which China is determined to meet with cleaner, homegrown sources so that its future economy will be less vulnerable to supply shocks and so it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pollute itself to death.'b'In the last year alone, so many new solar panel makers emerged in China that the price of solar power has fallen from roughly 59 cents a kilowatt hour to 16 cents, according to The Times\xe2\x80\x99s bureau chief here, Keith Bradsher. Meanwhile, China last week tested the fastest bullet train in the world  \xe2\x80\x94  217 miles per hour  \xe2\x80\x94  from Wuhan to Guangzhou. As Bradsher noted, China \xe2\x80\x9chas nearly finished the construction of a high-speed rail route from Beijing to Shanghai at a cost of $23.5 billion. Trains will cover the 700-mile route in just five hours, compared with 12 hours today. By comparison, Amtrak trains require at least 18 hours to travel a similar distance from New York to Chicago.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'China is also engaged in the world\xe2\x80\x99s most rapid expansion of nuclear power. It is expected to build some 50 new nuclear reactors by 2020; the rest of the world combined might build 15.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBy the end of this decade, China will be dominating global production of the whole range of power equipment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew Brandler, the C.E.O. of the CLP Group, Hong Kong\xe2\x80\x99s largest power utility.'b'In the process, China is going to make clean power technologies cheaper for itself and everyone else. But even Chinese experts will tell you that it will all happen faster and more effectively if China and America work together  \xe2\x80\x94  with the U.S. specializing in energy research and innovation, at which China is still weak, as well as in venture investing and servicing of new clean technologies, and with China specializing in mass production.'b'This is a strategic inflection point. It is clear that if we, America, care about our energy security, economic strength and environmental quality we need to put in place a long-term carbon price that stimulates and rewards clean power innovation. We can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to be asleep with an invigorated China wide awake.'b'Religions derive their power and popularity in part from the ethical compass they offer. So why do so many faiths help perpetuate something that most of us regard as profoundly unethical: the oppression of women?'b'It is not that warlords in Congo cite Scripture to justify their mass rapes (although the last warlord I met there called himself a pastor and wore a button reading \xe2\x80\x9crebels for Christ\xe2\x80\x9d). It\xe2\x80\x99s not that brides are burned in India as part of a Hindu ritual. And there\xe2\x80\x99s no verse in the Koran that instructs Afghan thugs to throw acid in the faces of girls who dare to go to school.'b'Yet these kinds of abuses  \xe2\x80\x94 along with more banal injustices, like slapping a girlfriend or paying women less for their work  \xe2\x80\x94 arise out of a social context in which women are, often, second-class citizens. That\xe2\x80\x99s a context that religions have helped shape, and not pushed hard to change.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWomen are prevented from playing a full and equal role in many faiths, creating an environment in which violations against women are justified,\xe2\x80\x9d former President Jimmy Carter noted 'b'in a speech last month'b' to the Parliament of the World\xe2\x80\x99s Religions in Australia.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe belief that women are inferior human beings in the eyes of God,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Carter continued, \xe2\x80\x9cgives excuses to the brutal husband who beats his wife, the soldier who rapes a woman, the employer who has a lower pay scale for women employees, or parents who decide to abort a female embryo.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Carter, who sees religion as one of the \xe2\x80\x9cbasic causes of the violation of women\xe2\x80\x99s rights,\xe2\x80\x9d is a member of The Elders, a small council of retired leaders brought together by Nelson Mandela. 'b'The Elders'b' are focusing on the role of religion in oppressing women, and they have issued a joint statement calling on religious leaders to \xe2\x80\x9cchange all discriminatory practices within their own religions and traditions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Elders are neither irreligious nor rabble-rousers. They include Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and they begin their meetings with a moment for silent prayer.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Elders are not attacking religion as such,\xe2\x80\x9d noted Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland and United Nations high commissioner for human rights. But she added, \xe2\x80\x9cWe all recognized that if there\xe2\x80\x99s one overarching issue for women it\xe2\x80\x99s the way that religion can be manipulated to subjugate women.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There is of course plenty of fodder, in both the Koran and the Bible, for those who seek a theology of discrimination.'b'The New Testament quotes St. Paul (I Timothy 2) as saying that women \xe2\x80\x9cmust be silent.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'Deuteronomy'b' declares that if a woman does not bleed on her wedding night, \xe2\x80\x9cthe men of her town shall stone her to death.\xe2\x80\x9d An Orthodox Jewish prayer thanks God, \xe2\x80\x9cwho hast not made me a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d The Koran stipulates that a woman shall inherit less than a man, and that a woman\xe2\x80\x99s testimony counts for half a man\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'In fairness, many scholars believe that Paul did not in fact write the passages calling on women to be silent. And Islam started out as socially progressive for women  \xe2\x80\x94 banning female infanticide and limiting polygamy  \xe2\x80\x94 but did not continue to advance.'b'But religious leaders sanctified existing social structures, instead of pushing for justice. In Africa, it would help enormously if religious figures spoke up for widows disenfranchised by unjust inheritance traditions  \xe2\x80\x94 or for rape victims, or for schoolgirls facing sexual demands from their teachers. Instead, in Uganda, the influence of conservative Christians is found in a grotesque push to execute gays.'b'Yet paradoxically, the churches in Africa that have done the most to empower women have been conservative ones led by evangelicals and especially Pentecostals. In particular, Pentecostals encourage women to take leadership roles, and for many women this is the first time they have been trusted with authority and found their opinions respected. In rural Africa, Pentecostal churches are becoming a significant force to emancipate women.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s a glimmer of hope that reminds us that while religion is part of the problem, it can also be part of the solution. The Dalai Lama has taken that step and calls himself a feminist.'b'Another excellent precedent is slavery. Each of the Abrahamic faiths accepted slavery. Muhammad owned slaves, and St. Paul seems to have condoned slavery. Yet the pioneers of the abolitionist movement were Quakers and evangelicals like William Wilberforce. People of faith ultimately worked ferociously to overthrow an oppressive institution that churches had previously condoned.'b'Today, when religious institutions exclude women from their hierarchies and rituals, the inevitable implication is that females are inferior. The Elders are right that religious groups should stand up for a simple ethical principle: any person\xe2\x80\x99s human rights should be sacred, and not depend on something as earthly as their genitals.'b'Arlington, Va.'b'AS I reflect on disturbing events of recent weeks \xe2\x80\x94 'b'the massacre of seven C.I.A. officers'b' in Khost, Afghanistan, and the near bombing of Northwest Flight 253 on its way to Detroit \xe2\x80\x94 I can see in my mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye a young man. He is Middle Eastern, with a thin, mustachioed face and pallid skin, and he stands nervously in the middle of a very public square, unnoticed amid a swirling crowd. Glancing furtively at his watch, he begins to walk, as he was instructed, along a prescribed route.'b'Another young man, an American who is a C.I.A. case officer, has already circled the square, shielded by the passers-by. He is alert to anything out of place, to someone loitering near a motorcycle, to a group of men sitting aimlessly in a car, to anyone who may be paying attention to his source. He is dressed to look like any other dark-haired male of no particular account in this dusty and obscure third-world city in the 1980s. Under the officer\xe2\x80\x99s sweater is a crude bulletproof vest, giving him the barrel-chested look of a wrestler. The vest is of limited protection, but a partial insurance against faults of judgment.'b'The case officer begins to follow his source at a discreet distance. He knows the young man well, or believes he does. His assessment, upon which his life may depend, is that the source, though a member of a terrorist organization and willing to put his life at risk to meet an American spy, is a physical coward. Personal loyalty is important to him, as is his relationship with the American, from which he hopes to benefit.'b'Circumstances can change, however, and with them, motivations. In a world of fear and desperation, today\xe2\x80\x99s friend can become tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s deadly enemy. The case officer is confident that while the source could perhaps find the opportunity to shoot him, he lacks the courage ever to do it himself. While this lack of fortitude may be a blessing, it could easily lead him, if discovered and placed under pressure, to guide others to their American target, to do what he himself could not.'b'Satisfied at length that no one is watching the source, the case officer suddenly approaches him from behind, grabs him by the elbow and pulls him abruptly down a cobblestone alley, in a direction the source could not have anticipated.'b'In this case, the officer\xe2\x80\x99s faith is rewarded. The Middle Easterner becomes a valuable asset. But the case officer is not always so fortunate. A year later, in a different city, he has just inherited a new source. Working against the government of a state sponsor of terrorism, the source is what is referred to in the business as a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal agent,\xe2\x80\x9d running his own network of subordinate spies. With the case officer\xe2\x80\x99s encouragement, the principal agent has managed to lure a potential subagent \xe2\x80\x94 a childhood friend he considers closer than a brother \xe2\x80\x94 out from the police state where he lives. They hold a series of meetings during which the principal agent vets his friend, assesses him and formally recruits him into the network, all under the watchful guidance of the case officer.'b'As I look back at that young case officer poised at that moment in time, I wish I could speak with him now. I wish I could remind him that his own confidence, his ambition and his desire for success are in fact his worst enemies.'b'Some of the story concerning that principal agent we will never know. We will never know precisely why one day, in setting up another meeting with his old friend, he ignored his training. He had been told \xe2\x80\x94 hadn\xe2\x80\x99t he? \xe2\x80\x94 that he must never allow himself to fall into a pattern, that he must never be predictable. And his case officer, in spite of endless soul-searching, would never know whether any of the myriad things he might have done differently would have saved a brave man whom he had sworn to protect.'b'What we do know is that one evening, the principal agent and his boyhood pal, now his betrayer, had dinner at a shabby seaside restaurant; that they sat at the same table they had occupied the night before; that a group of four men in a car drove slowly around the block twice; that two of the men entered the restaurant and strolled over in front of the principal agent\xe2\x80\x99s table; that each then emptied his pistol into the agent\xe2\x80\x99s chest.'b'In the wake of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s 'b' speech on intelligence last week'b', there is much soul-searching going on, at C.I.A. headquarters in Langley and elsewhere, about what happened in Khost on Dec. 30. We are told that a Jordanian-born informant betrayed his spymasters and ignited a suicide bomb at a military base, killing those seven C.I.A. employees and wounding at least six more in the greatest blow to American intelligence in two decades. It comes as a cold slap in the face, but one that implicates us all. For these men and women, like the uniformed troops they serve alongside, have assumed great risks, and they have assumed them to keep the rest of us safe at home.'b'As the wildly divergent news accounts attest, none of us on the outside knows what really happened. But this hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped the armchair geniuses who dispense grave platitudes on the enormity of the mistakes made, or the \xe2\x80\x9cformer officials\xe2\x80\x9d who preen for reporters, spouting revelations regarding international intelligence relationships that, if true, are best not spoken of at all.'b'There may well have been some element of human error or incaution. Young operatives might have allowed their desire to strike a blow against America\xe2\x80\x99s enemies to override their professional caution. (As perhaps I did myself so many years ago.) Or, perhaps, having weighed the risks and gains of the alternatives, the officers simply came up short. In the wilderness of mirrors that defines human intelligence in counterterrorism, the threat of disaster is an inescapable presence.'b'But for the grace of God, my colleagues and I could have come up similarly short on any number of occasions  in Pakistan and Afghanistan during the run-up to 9/11 and the resulting American-led invasion. Brave young men and women met in wild and obscure places with dubious characters; had they not done so, we would not have had the human information network that was vital in routing Al Qaeda and the Taliban so quickly in 2001.   Some flew on helicopters deep into Taliban-controlled areas to meet with tribal leaders whom we felt we could trust, but whose followers might have had the means and motivation to murder my colleagues. We fully expected to lose many of our people in those days. That our losses were light in the end was a testament to their courage, their professionalism and, yes, their luck.'b'The importance of the human intelligence work done by officers like those we lost at Khost is only increasing over time. The growing sophistication of our enemies, as they react to the grievous losses they have suffered, makes us all the more reliant on human spies.'b'To outsiders, the counterterrorism struggle along the Pakistani-Afghan border can seem antiseptic \xe2\x80\x94 a war of drones, of terrorists who simply disappear in a puff of smoke. But make no mistake: the intelligence-led struggle fought in our name is, at its core, every bit as gritty and as visceral as conventional combat. But in this war, you come to know your enemies as well as your friends, and the battlefield encompasses the full scope of human character.'b'Trainees who aspire to join the National Clandestine Service, the undercover arm of the C.I.A., get careful instruction. They are instilled with a proper regard for their mission, for the laws they must follow, for the sacred obligation to sources, and for their duty to one another. Much stress is placed on loyalty. Loyalty can take many forms, but when all is said and done, loyalty is essentially tribal. That is as true for us as it is for any Afghan. C.I.A. officers undertake risks not for any ideology, but to protect Americans from those who would want only kill them. At a time when calamity is a poignant reminder of the loyalty displayed by C.I.A. officers toward us, we might reflect on what we owe them in return.'b'Yet over the past two weeks, we have watched the unedifying spectacle of politicians and bureaucrats, mired in a Washington environment defined by political fear, posturing shamelessly over the would-be airline bomber. A wealthy nation that refuses to invest sufficiently in available technology, or to put up with travel delays necessary to see whether passengers are carrying explosives onto airplanes, chooses instead to excoriate the intelligence community for failing to see unerringly into the minds and hearts of men.'b'Rather than admit to the hard fact that we must always rely on someone\xe2\x80\x99s subjective assessment of tolerable risk, politicians are vilifying those who put together our terrorism watch lists, who are simply following threat protocols. Meanwhile, intelligence analysts who are charged with making subjective judgments as to which of the hundreds of thousands of possible terrorists lurking in their databases merit their focused scrutiny to \xe2\x80\x9cconnect the dots\xe2\x80\x9d are being accused of dereliction for having underestimated the threat from a single African college student.'b'Sacrificing intelligence operatives out of political expediency is a bipartisan sport. Officials in the George W. Bush administration did not hesitate to blame the spies when it suited them \xe2\x80\x94 as though the decision to invade Iraq really depended on intelligence \xe2\x80\x94 and the Obama administration is proving, if anything, worse. Last spring\xe2\x80\x99s decision to release secret Justice Department memos on the interrogations of suspected terrorists was a blatantly partisan act. It was designed to win political advantage by holding intelligence officers \xe2\x80\x94 whose offense was to follow faithfully their lawful orders \xe2\x80\x94 up to opprobrium and scorn. Members of Congress who had enthusiastically encouraged aggressive interrogations in the wake of 9/11 suddenly suffered amnesia when the political zeitgeist shifted.'b'This is a curious way to reward those who risk everything to defend us. How, in the face of such betrayal, can we expect to bring new generations  into the intelligence ranks? It is possible to reward loyalty with loyalty while still insisting on the highest standards of professionalism from our intelligence officers. Indeed, we can better reinforce excellence in intelligence when we judge it with honesty, realism and a sense of proportion. Politicians will behave dishonorably so long as it benefits them. It is up to the rest of us to tell them, \xe2\x80\x9cEnough.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Living on Nothing but Food Stamps'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Safety Net\xe2\x80\x9d series, front page, Jan. 3):'b'Economic hard times have thrown more men, white people and two-parent households into poverty.

In throwing out charges against Blackwater agents who killed 17 Iraqis in Baghdad\xe2\x80\x99s Nisour Square in September 2007, Judge Urbina highlighted the government\xe2\x80\x99s inability to hold mercenaries accountable for crimes they commit.'b'Judge Urbina correctly ruled that the government violated the Blackwater agents\xe2\x80\x99 protection against self-incrimination. He sketched an inept prosecution that relied on compelled statements made by the agents to officials of the State Department, who employed the North Carolina security firm to protect convoys and staff in Iraq. That, he said, amounted to a \xe2\x80\x9creckless violation of the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional rights.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'During the presidential campaign, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton competed over who would take the toughest line against mercenaries. It is clear that the only way for President Obama to make good on the rhetoric is to get rid of the thousands of private gunmen still deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere.'b'The killings in Nisour Square were hardly the first misdeeds by hired guns in Iraq, or the last. The army has said contractors from firms like CACI International Inc. were involved in more than a third of the proven incidents of abuse in 2003 and 2004 in the Abu Ghraib prison. Guards from Blackwater \xe2\x80\x94 which has renamed itself Xe Services \xe2\x80\x94 and other security firms, like Triple Canopy, have been involved in other wanton shootings.'b'On Jan. 7, two former Blackwater guards were arrested on murder charges stemming from a shooting in Afghanistan last May that left two Afghans dead.'b'Still, the government has failed to hold armed contractors accountable. When its formal occupation of Iraq ended in 2004, the Bush administration demanded that Baghdad grant legal immunity to private contractors.'b'Congress has tried to cover such crimes with American law. The Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act extends civilian law to contractors supporting military operations overseas, and the Uniform  Code of Military Justice was broadened in 2006 to cover contractors.'b'But the government has not prosecuted a single successful case for killings by armed contractors overseas. An Iraqi lawsuit against American military contractors by Iraqi victims of torture at Abu Ghraib was dismissed by a federal appeals court that said the companies had immunity as government contractors.'b'Furious that the Nisour Square case was dismissed, the Iraqi government said it might file civil suits in the United States and Iraq against Xe. But its chances of success are not considered great. The families of many of the victims of the rampage accepted a settlement from Xe last week, worried that had they pursued their civil suit they might have gotten nothing.'b'There are many reasons to oppose the privatization of war. Reliance on contractors allows the government to work under the radar of public scrutiny. And freewheeling contractors can be at cross purposes with the armed forces. Blackwater\xe2\x80\x99s undersupervised guards undermined the effort to win Iraqi support.'b'But most fundamental is that the government cannot \xe2\x80\x94 or will not \xe2\x80\x94 keep a legal handle on its freelance gunmen. A nation of laws cannot go to war like that.'b'Just last June, the Supreme Court decided that when prosecutors rely on lab reports they must call the experts who prepared them to testify. It was an important ruling, based on a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to be confronted with witnesses against him, but the court is about to revisit it. The justices should reaffirm that the Sixth Amendment requires prosecutors to call the lab analysts whose work they rely on.'b'On Monday, the court hears arguments in Briscoe v. Virginia, in which a man was convicted on drug charges. The prosecutors relied on certificates prepared by forensic analysts to prove that the substance seized was cocaine. They did not call the analysts as witnesses.'b'The defendant should be able to get his conviction overturned based on Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, the ruling from last June, which held, by a 5-to-4 vote, that using lab reports without calling the analysts violates the Sixth Amendment.'b'The amendment\xe2\x80\x99s confrontation clause guarantees defendants the right to see prosecution witnesses in person and to cross-examine them, unless they are truly unavailable. In cases that involve drugs, and many that do not, lab analysts\xe2\x80\x99 work can be a critical part of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case. If the prosecutors want to use the reports, they should be required to call the analysts as witnesses.'b'Critics of the ruling last June argue that it imposes too great a burden and excessive costs on prosecutors. But in states where analysts have to testify, the burden is easily manageable. Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s 14 forensic scientists appeared in 123 drug cases in 2008, less than one appearance each per month.'b'It is not clear why the Supreme Court is rushing to reconsider this issue. There are some differences in the rules on witnesses between Virginia and Massachusetts. But it may be that with Justice Sonia Sotomayor having replaced Justice David Souter, the dissenters believe they have a fifth vote to erode or undo last June\xe2\x80\x99s ruling.'b'As a former assistant district attorney, some court analysts argue, she may be more sympathetic to the burden on prosecutors. As a circuit court judge, Justice Sotomayor did often rule for the government in criminal cases, but making predictions of this sort is perilous. Justice Antonin Scalia, one of the court\xe2\x80\x99s most conservative members, wrote the majority opinion in Melendez-Diaz.'b'If the court changes the rule, it would be a significant setback for civil liberties, and not just in cases involving lab evidence. Prosecutors might use the decision to justify offering all sorts of affidavits, videotaped statements and other evidence from absent witnesses.'b'Charter schools \xe2\x80\x94 which are run with public money but subject to fewer state regulations \xe2\x80\x94 have a lot of  supporters  in Washington. Education Secretary Arne Duncan wants states to close some chronically failing schools and turn them into charters. Congress is so enthusiastic that it has created a $50 million fund and given Mr. Duncan the authority to directly finance charter school operators who want to replicate or expand successful programs.'b'Proponents  initially  argued that charter schools could  provide a better education  because they were allowed to operate independently. But  the  research has turned up mixed results. To ensure that this new money goes only to operators with proven records of success, Mr. Duncan will need to be guided by well-designed studies like the one being carried out by Stanford University\xe2\x80\x99s Center for Research on Education Outcomes.'b'The center startled many education specialists last summer with a report that showed that a large number of charter schools are failing to deliver on their promises. It compared the performance of charter schools and traditional schools in 15 states and the District of Columbia and found that only about 17 percent of charters offered students a better education than traditional schools \xe2\x80\x94 and that 37 percent were worse.'b'A 'b'new study'b' from the center has turned up a brighter picture in New York City, where students at more than half of the charter schools are showing more academic improvement in math than their  traditional-school counterparts. The reading numbers were not as strong, but still nearly 30 percent of charters outperformed traditional schools.'b'The Stanford study does not explain why charter schools in New York City are outperforming charters elsewhere. But some ideas spring readily to mind.'b'New York City has a rigorous mechanism for licensing charters as well as strong oversight of performance. The city also gives charter operators free space, and provides them with administrative support so that they can more easily get up and running and comply with state and federal education law. This environment has been a magnet for strong operators that have been treated almost like pariahs in other states.'b'Critics have often charged that charter schools look better academically because they skim off the most talented students from neighboring traditional schools. The Stanford study rules out this explanation by carefully controlling for all known variables, including race, gender, ethnicity and achievement level.'b'The success of high-quality charter schools in places like New York supports Mr. Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s view that charters can play an important role in efforts to reform the country\xe2\x80\x99s flawed education system \xe2\x80\x94 but only if they are closely monitored and held to high standards.'b'Anyone who\xe2\x80\x99s spent time in Youngstown, Ohio, is entitled to nagging affection for the gritty old steeltown that has long struggled with lost jobs and serial political corruption.

The interns have an opportunity to observe and work with a variety of teachers who have different teaching styles and philosophies. Likewise, their exposure to a variety of students serves as a strong foundation for their own teaching once they have completed their certification requirements.

'b''b'As health care reform nears the finish line, there is much wailing and rending of garments among conservatives. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not just talking about the tea partiers. Even calmer conservatives have been issuing dire warnings that Obamacare will turn America into a European-style social democracy. And everyone knows that Europe has lost all its economic dynamism.'b'Strange to say, however, what everyone knows isn\xe2\x80\x99t true. Europe has its economic troubles; who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t? But the story you hear all the time \xe2\x80\x94 of a stagnant economy in which high taxes and generous social benefits have undermined incentives, stalling growth and innovation \xe2\x80\x94 bears little resemblance to the surprisingly positive facts. The real lesson from Europe is actually the opposite of what conservatives claim: Europe is an economic success, and that success shows that social democracy works.'b'Actually, Europe\xe2\x80\x99s economic success should be obvious even without statistics. For those Americans who have visited Paris: did it look poor and backward? What about Frankfurt or London? You should always bear in mind that when the question is which to believe \xe2\x80\x94 official economic statistics or your own lying eyes \xe2\x80\x94 the eyes have it.'b'In any case, the statistics confirm what the eyes see.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s true that the U.S. economy has grown faster than that of Europe for the past generation. Since 1980 \xe2\x80\x94 when our politics took a sharp turn to the right, while Europe\xe2\x80\x99s didn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x94 America\xe2\x80\x99s real G.D.P. has grown, on average, 3 percent per year. Meanwhile, the E.U. 15 \xe2\x80\x94 the bloc of 15 countries that were members of the European Union before it was enlarged to include a number of former Communist nations \xe2\x80\x94 has grown only 2.2 percent a year. America rules!'b'Or maybe not. All this really says is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had faster population growth. Since 1980, per capita real G.D.P. \xe2\x80\x94 which is what matters for living standards \xe2\x80\x94 has risen at about the same rate in America and in the E.U. 15: 1.95 percent a year here; 1.83 percent there.'b'What about technology? In the late 1990s you could argue that the revolution in information technology was passing Europe by. But Europe has since caught up in many ways. Broadband, in particular, is just about as widespread in Europe as it is in the United States, and it\xe2\x80\x99s much faster and cheaper.'b'And what about jobs? Here America arguably does better: European unemployment rates are usually substantially higher than the rate here, and the employed fraction of the population lower. But if your vision is of millions of prime-working-age adults sitting idle, living on the dole, think again. In 2008, 80 percent of adults aged 25 to 54 in the E.U. 15 were employed (and 83 percent in France). That\xe2\x80\x99s about the same as in the United States. Europeans are less likely than we are to work when young or old, but is that entirely a bad thing?'b'And Europeans are quite productive, too: they work fewer hours, but output per hour in France and Germany is close to U.S. levels.'b'The point isn\xe2\x80\x99t that Europe is utopia. Like the United States, it\xe2\x80\x99s having trouble grappling with the current financial crisis. Like the United States, Europe\xe2\x80\x99s big nations face serious long-run fiscal issues \xe2\x80\x94 and like some individual U.S. states, some European countries are teetering on the edge of fiscal crisis. (Sacramento is now the Athens of America \xe2\x80\x94 in a bad way.) But taking the longer view, the European economy works; it grows; it\xe2\x80\x99s as dynamic, all in all, as our own.'b'So why do we get such a different picture from many pundits? Because according to the prevailing economic dogma in this country \xe2\x80\x94 and I\xe2\x80\x99m talking here about many Democrats as well as essentially all Republicans \xe2\x80\x94 European-style social democracy should be an utter disaster. And people tend to see what they want to see.'b'After all, while reports of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s economic demise are greatly exaggerated, reports of its high taxes and generous benefits aren\xe2\x80\x99t. Taxes in major European nations range from 36 to 44 percent of G.D.P., compared with 28 in the United States. Universal health care is, well, universal. Social expenditure is vastly higher than it is here.'b'So if there were anything to the economic assumptions that dominate U.S. public discussion \xe2\x80\x94 above all, the belief that even modestly higher taxes on the rich and benefits for the less well off would drastically undermine incentives to work, invest and innovate \xe2\x80\x94 Europe would be the stagnant, decaying economy of legend. But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'Europe is often held up as a cautionary tale, a demonstration that if you try to make the economy less brutal, to take better care of your fellow citizens when they\xe2\x80\x99re down on their luck, you end up killing economic progress. But what European experience actually demonstrates is the opposite: social justice and progress can go hand in hand.'b'Liberal democracy offers religious believers a bargain. Accept, as a price of citizenship, that you may never impose your convictions on your neighbor, or use state power to compel belief. In return, you will be free to practice your own faith as you see fit  \xe2\x80\x94  and free, as well, to compete with other believers (and nonbelievers) in the marketplace of ideas.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s the theory. In practice, the admirable principle that nobody should be persecuted for their beliefs often blurs into the more illiberal idea that nobody should ever publicly criticize another religion. Or champion one\xe2\x80\x99s  own faith as an alternative. Or say anything whatsoever about religion, outside the privacy of  church, synagogue or home.'b'A week ago, Brit Hume broke all three rules at once.

The tendency to take offense at freewheeling religious debate is widespread. There are European Christians who side with Muslims in support of blasphemy laws, lest Jesus or the Prophet Muhammad have his  reputation sullied. There are American Catholics who cry \xe2\x80\x9cbigotry\xe2\x80\x9d every time a newspaper columnist criticizes the church\xe2\x80\x99s teaching on sexuality. Many Christians have decided that the best way to compete in an era of political correctness is to play the victim card.'b'But these believers are colluding in their own marginalization. If you treat your faith like a hothouse flower, too vulnerable to survive in the crass world of public disputation, then you ensure that nobody will take it seriously. The idea that religion is too mysterious, too complicated or too personal to be debated on cable television just ensures that it never gets debated at all.'b'This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we need to welcome real bigotry into our public discourse. But what Hume said wasn\xe2\x80\x99t bigoted: Indeed, his claim about the difference between Buddhism and Christianity was perfectly defensible. Christians believe in a personal God who forgives sins. Buddhists, as a rule, do not. And it\xe2\x80\x99s at least plausible that Tiger Woods might welcome the possibility that there\xe2\x80\x99s Someone out there capable of forgiving him, even if Elin Nordegren and his corporate sponsors never do.'b'Or maybe not. For many people \xe2\x80\x94 Woods perhaps included \xe2\x80\x94 the fact that Buddhism promotes an ethical life without recourse to Christian concepts like the Fall of Man, divine judgment and damnation is precisely what makes it so appealing. The knee-jerk outrage that greeted Hume\xe2\x80\x99s remarks buried intelligent responses from Buddhists, who made arguments along these lines \xe2\x80\x94 'b'explaining their faith'b', 'b'contrasting it with Christianity'b', and describing how a lost soul like 'b'Woods might use Buddhist concepts'b' to climb from darkness into light.'b'When liberal democracy was forged, in the wake of Western Europe\xe2\x80\x99s religious wars, this sort of peaceful theological debate is exactly what it promised to deliver. And the differences between religions are worth debating. Theology has consequences: It shapes lives, families, nations, cultures, wars; it can change people, save them from themselves, and sometimes warp or even destroy them.'b'If we tiptoe politely around this reality, then we betray every teacher, guru and philosopher \xe2\x80\x94 including Jesus of Nazareth and the Buddha both \xe2\x80\x94 who ever sought to resolve the most human of all problems: 'b'How then should we live?'b''b'It\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable to doubt that a cable news analyst has the right answer to this question. But the debate that Brit Hume kicked off a week ago is still worth having. Indeed, it\xe2\x80\x99s the most important one there is.'b'Washington'b'THE much-anticipated trial to determine the constitutionality of California\xe2\x80\x99s Proposition 8 is scheduled to begin this morning in the case of Perry v. Schwarzenegger. What\xe2\x80\x99s at stake in this case, filed in federal district court in San Francisco on behalf of two gay couples, is not just  the right of California voters to reaffirm the definition of marriage as only between a man and a woman, but also whether marriage may be otherwise defined in any state.'b'The entire premise of this litigation is disquieting \xe2\x80\x94 that traditional marriage is nothing but \xe2\x80\x9cthe residue of centuries of figurative and literal gay bashing,\xe2\x80\x9d as David Boies, a lawyer for the plaintiffs,  has written. According to the plaintiffs, there is just no rational basis for government to privilege marriage between a man and a woman. Thus, in their minds, Proposition 8, which was supported by more than seven  million California voters, could have been adopted only as a result of \xe2\x80\x9canimus,\xe2\x80\x9d as the complaint puts it, toward gays and lesbians.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s disquieting that the trial is taking place in San Francisco, probably the venue most likely to support gay marriage. More than 75 percent of San Francisco voters opposed Proposition 8. That\xe2\x80\x99s quite a home-court advantage for same-sex marriage advocates.'b'But most disquieting for supporters of traditional marriage is a series of pretrial rulings issued by Judge Vaughn R. Walker that have the effect of putting the sponsors of Proposition 8, and the people who voted for it, on trial.'b'Judge Walker\xe2\x80\x99s decisions have been surprising because they differ from those of other judges who have previously scrutinized marriage laws \xe2\x80\x94 in Iowa, Hawaii, Massachusetts,  New Jersey and elsewhere in California, for example. In those instances, the courts have decided legal challenges to state marriage laws based on  legislative history, scholarly articles and testimony by social scientists and other experts. They have, in some cases, looked for evidence of legislative intent in the statements published in official voter information pamphlets.'b'But in this case,  Judge Walker has ruled that things like TV advertisements, press releases and campaign workers\xe2\x80\x99 statements are also relevant evidence of what the voters intended. The judge went so far as to order the Proposition 8 campaign to disclose private internal communications about messages that were  considered for public use but never actually used. He has even ordered the campaign to turn over copies of all internal records and e-mail messages relating to campaign strategy.'b'Most troubling, Judge Walker has also ruled that the trial will investigate the Proposition 8 sponsors\xe2\x80\x99 personal beliefs regarding marriage and sexuality. No doubt, the plaintiffs  will aggressively exploit this opportunity to assert that the sponsors exhibited bigotry toward homosexuals, or that religious views motivated the adoption of Proposition 8. They\xe2\x80\x99ll argue that prohibiting gay marriage is akin to racial discrimination.'b'To top it all off, Judge Walker has determined that this case will be the first in the Ninth Circuit to allow cameras in the courtroom, with the proceedings posted  on YouTube. This will expose supporters of Proposition 8 who appear in the courtroom to the type of vandalism, harassment and bullying attacks already used by some of those who oppose the proposition.'b'Thankfully, some of Judge Walker\xe2\x80\x99s rulings have been overturned. For example, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals 'b'blocked the disclosure of internal communications'b' among the core Proposition 8 organizers. But there is no question that virtually every ruling by Judge Walker so far has put advocates of traditional marriage at an increasing disadvantage.'b'Despite this, during the trial, the supporters of Proposition 8 will work hard to demonstrate that it was rational for voters to conclude that marriage is a unique institution that promotes the interests of   child-rearing, and that those interests are broader than the personal special interests of the adults involved. And they\xe2\x80\x99ll make the case that voters were very much within their rights, when casting their ballots, to consider their own moral and religious views about marriage \xe2\x80\x94 or any other subject.'b'It remains to be seen whether traditional marriage, and the rights of the voters who approved Proposition 8, will prevail in Judge Walker\xe2\x80\x99s courtroom. Most likely, no matter how the judge rules, the Perry case is destined for appeals and a final decision in the United States Supreme Court. But it is during the present trial that the facts in the case will be determined, and it is there that the two sides should be able to present their cases on a level playing field.'b'Chicago'b'ABOUT the Senate, a college professor of mine used to say, \xe2\x80\x9cOne day, the Supreme Court will declare it unconstitutional.\xe2\x80\x9d He was joking, I think.'b'But the Senate, as it now operates, really has become unconstitutional:  as we saw during the recent health care debacle, a 60-vote majority is required to overcome a filibuster and pass any contested bill. The founders, though, were dead set against supermajorities as a general rule, and the ever-present filibuster threat has made the Senate a more extreme check on the popular will than they ever intended.'b'This change to the Constitution was not the result of, say, a formal  amendment, but a procedural rule adopted in 1975: a revision of Senate Rule 22, which was the old cloture rule. Before 1975, it took two-thirds of the Senate to end a filibuster, but it was the \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Smith Goes to Washington\xe2\x80\x9d filibuster: if senators wanted to stop a vote, they had to bring in the cots and the coffee and read from Grandma\xe2\x80\x99s recipe for chicken soup until, unshaven, they keeled over from their own rhetorical exhaust.'b'For the record, nothing like Senate Rule 22 appears in the Constitution, nor was there unlimited debate until Vice President Aaron Burr presided over the Senate in the early 180os. In 1917, after a century of chaos, the Senate put in the old Rule 22 to stop unlimited filibusters. Because it was about stopping real, often distressing, floor debate, one might have been able to defend that rule under Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution, which says,  \xe2\x80\x9cEach house may determine the rule of its proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As revised in 1975, Senate Rule 22 seemed to be an improvement: it required 60 senators, not 67, to stop floor debate. But there also came a significant change in de facto Senate practice: to maintain a filibuster, senators no longer had to keep talking. Nowadays, they don\xe2\x80\x99t even have to start; they just say they will, and that\xe2\x80\x99s enough. Senators need not be on the floor at all. They can be at home watching Jimmy Stewart on cable. Senate Rule 22 now exists to cut off what are ghost filibusters, disembodied debates.'b'As a result, the supermajority vote no longer deserves any protection under Article I, Section 5 \xe2\x80\x94 if it ever did at all. It is instead a revision of Article I itself: not used to cut off debate, but to decide in effect whether to enact a law. The filibuster votes, which once occurred perhaps seven or eight times a whole Congressional session, now happen more than 100 times a term. But this routine use of supermajority voting is, at worst, unconstitutional and, at best, at odds with the founders\xe2\x80\x99 intent.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s why. First, the Constitution explicitly requires supermajorities only in a few special cases: ratifying treaties and constitutional amendments, overriding presidential vetoes, expelling members and for impeachments. With so many lawyers among them, the founders knew and operated under the maxim \xe2\x80\x9cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the express mention of one thing excludes all others. But one need not leave it at a maxim. In the Federalist Papers, every time Alexander Hamilton or John Jay defends a particular supermajority rule, he does so at length and with an obvious sense of guilt over his departure from majority rule.'b'Second, Article I, Section 3, expressly says that the vice president as the presiding officer of the Senate should cast the deciding vote when senators are \xe2\x80\x9cequally divided.\xe2\x80\x9d The procedural filibuster does an end run around this constitutional requirement, which presumed that on the truly contested bills there would be ties. With supermajority voting, the Senate is never \xe2\x80\x9cequally divided\xe2\x80\x9d on the big, contested issues of our day, so that it is a rogue senator, and not the vice president, who casts the deciding vote.'b'The procedural filibuster effectively disenfranchises the vice president, eliminating as it does one of the office\xe2\x80\x99s only two constitutional functions. Yet the founders very consciously intended for the vice president, as part of the checks and balances system, to play this tie-breaking role \xe2\x80\x94 that is why  Federalist No. 68 'b'so specifically argued'b' against a sitting member of the Senate being the presiding officer in place of the vice president.'b'Third, Article I pointedly mandates at least one rule of proceeding, namely, that a majority of senators (and House members, for that matter) will constitute a quorum. Article I, Section 5 states in part that \xe2\x80\x9ca majority of each shall constitute a majority to do business.\xe2\x80\x9d Of course, in requiring a simple majority for a quorum, the founders were concerned about no-shows for a host of reasons \xe2\x80\x94 not least of all because the first legislators had to travel great distances by stagecoach.'b'But the bigger reason for the rule was to keep a minority from walking out and thereby blocking a majority vote. In Federalist No. 75,  Hamilton 'b'dismissed a supermajority rule'b' for a quorum thus: \xe2\x80\x9cAll provisions which require more than a majority of any body to its resolutions have a direct tendency to embarrass the operations of the government and an indirect one to subject the sense of the majority to that of the minority.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It would be illogical for the Constitution to preclude a supermajority rule with respect to a quorum while allowing it on an ad hoc and more convenient basis any time a minority wanted to block a vote. Yet that is essentially what Senate Rule 22 achieves on any bill that used to require a majority vote.'b'So on the health care bill, as on so many other things, we now have to take what a minority of an inherently unrepresentative body will give us. Forty-one senators from our 21 smallest states \xe2\x80\x94 just over 10 percent of our population \xe2\x80\x94 can block bills dealing not just with health care but with global warming and hazards that threaten the whole planet. Individual senators now use the filibuster, or the threat of it, as a kind of personal veto, and that power seems to have warped their behavior, encouraging grandstanding and worse.'b'What can be done about the procedural filibuster? There are several promising lines of attack.'b'If the House passed a resolution condemning the use of the procedural filibuster, it might begin to strip the supermajority of its spurious legitimacy. It\xe2\x80\x99s the House that has been the great victim of the filibuster, and at least with such a resolution that chamber could express the grievance of the people as a whole against this usurpation by a minority in the Senate.'b'The president of the Senate, the vice president himself, could issue an opinion from the chair that the filibuster is unconstitutional. Our first vice presidents, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, felt a serious obligation to resolve the ties and tangles of an evenly divided Senate, and they would not have shrunk from such a challenge.'b'We citizens could also demand that our parties stop financially supporting senators who are committed to the filibuster, and we ourselves could deprive them of fund-raising dollars.'b'And we needn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out the possibility of a Supreme Court case. Surely, the court would not allow the Senate to ignore either the obvious intent of the Constitution.'b'Whether any such approach works, the founders would have expected us to do something about this unconstitutional filibuster. In Federalist No. 75, Hamilton denounced the use of supermajority rule in these prophetic words: \xe2\x80\x9cThe history of every political establishment in which this principle has prevailed is a history of impotence, perplexity and disorder.\xe2\x80\x9d That is a suitable epitaph for what has happened to the Senate.'b'Washington'b'AMERICANS are scrambling to understand Yemen, where Al Qaeda has recently surged and the Christmas Day plot against Northwest Flight 253 was hatched. It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy. Yemen has 5,000 years of history, complicated politics and daunting economic challenges. But we\xe2\x80\x99ve made it more difficult to understand by allowing several myths to cloud our vision. Challenging these misconceptions is a first step toward comprehending  and overcoming significant threats to American, Yemeni and international security.'b''b'Myth 1:'b''b' 'b''b'The Yemeni government\xe2\x80\x99s control does not extend much beyond the capital, Sana.'b''b' 'b''b'It\xe2\x80\x99s true that the government of President Ali Abdullah Saleh faces several security problems. Al Qaeda has operated there since the early 1990s, with its strength waxing and waning depending on the effectiveness of the government\xe2\x80\x99s counterterrorism efforts. Since 2004, the government has faced an insurrection in the north from a group called the Houthis, who would restore a religious ruler. There has also been growing separatist feeling in the southern regions that tried to secede in 1994. And many of the tribes in the north are well armed and operate largely outside the government structure.'b'None of this, however, means that the government is confined to ruling  a city-state centered on Sana. The Yemeni Army and national police exert significant day-to-day control over most of the country, and almost everywhere else on an ad hoc basis. Yemen is much like the United States in the latter half of the 19th century, when the government faced a rebellious South and a Wild West, but was hardly   powerless outside the East Coast.'b''b'Myth 2:'b' 'b'Yemen is a Qaeda haven because it is the ancestral home of Osama bin Laden, who is supported by tribes in Hadhramaut 'b''b''b'Province.'b''b''b'Osama bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s father, Muhammad, was one of many Yemenis who achieved great success outside his native country. But the bin Ladens are not part of any politically significant tribe or clan, nor has the family sought to convert its wealth into power in Yemen. Osama bin Laden has some popularity, but no more so than elsewhere in the Islamic world.  The Qaeda virus \xe2\x80\x94 which has been present in Yemen since 1992, when Qaeda members bombed a hotel in Aden where American troops had been staying on their way to Somalia \xe2\x80\x94 is the problem for Yemen, not Mr. bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s ancestral ties.'b''b'Myth 3:'b' 'b'Yemen is torn by Sunni-Shiite divisions, much like Iraq.'b''b'The Houthi rebellion is often described as Shiite resistance against a Sunni establishment. In fact, both the Houthis and President Saleh are followers of the Zaidi sect of Shiite Islam. Generally, there is no clear divide between Sunnis and Shiites in Yemen, although the Shiites tend to live in the north and northwest while the Sunnis, mostly members of the moderate Shafii school, predominate in the south and southeast. In any case, one\xe2\x80\x99s sect matters far less in Yemen than in countries like Lebanon or Iraq, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not unknown for Yemenis to convert from Sunni to Shiite as a matter of convenience.'b''b'Myth 4:'b' 'b'Yemeni tribes have an inherent affinity for Al Qaeda or terrorism.'b''b'In 2002, Abu Ali al-Harithi, then Al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s leader in Yemen, was killed by an American drone in a strike that was coordinated with the Yemeni government.  By tribal custom, any perceived illegitimate killing would have been grounds for a claim by the tribe against the government. No such claim was made. In fact, when receiving the body for burial, one of his kinsmen noted that \xe2\x80\x9che had chosen his path, and it had led to his death.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This was not an anomaly. In my experience, there is no deep-seeded affinity between Yemeni tribes and the  Qaeda movement. Tribes tend to be opportunistic, not ideological, so the risk is that Al Qaeda will successfully exploit opportunities created by government neglect. There are also family affinities \xe2\x80\x94 cousins, linked to uncles, linked to brothers. These do matter.  But what matters most is the \xe2\x80\x9cmujahedeen fraternity\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Yemenis with jihadist experience in Afghanistan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia or elsewhere. Finally, what would matter \xe2\x80\x94 and significantly \xe2\x80\x94 would be innocent casualties resulting from counterterrorism operations, which could well set off a tribal response.'b'\xc2\x95'b'Forging an effective American counterterrorism policy in Yemen will be as difficult as it is necessary. But misreading Yemeni history and society can only complicate its conception and jeopardize its execution.'b'Jews are a famously accomplished group. They make up 0.2 percent of the world population, but 54 percent of the world chess champions, 27 percent of the Nobel physics laureates and 31 percent of the medicine laureates.'b'Jews make up 2 percent of the U.S. population, but 21 percent of the Ivy League student bodies, 26 percent of the Kennedy Center honorees, 37 percent of the Academy Award-winning directors, 38 percent of those on a recent Business Week list of leading philanthropists, 51 percent of the Pulitzer Prize winners for nonfiction.'b'In his book, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Golden Age of Jewish Achievement,\xe2\x80\x9d Steven L. Pease lists some of the explanations people have given for this record of achievement. The Jewish faith encourages a belief in progress and personal accountability. It is learning-based, not rite-based.'b'Most Jews gave up or were forced to give up farming in the Middle Ages; their descendants have been living off of their wits ever since. They have often migrated, with a migrant\xe2\x80\x99s ambition and drive. They have congregated around global crossroads and have benefited from the creative tension endemic in such places.'b'No single explanation can account for the record of Jewish achievement. The odd thing is that Israel has not traditionally been strongest where the Jews in the Diaspora were strongest. Instead of research and commerce, Israelis were forced to devote their energies to fighting and politics.'b'Milton Friedman used to joke that Israel disproved every Jewish stereotype. People used to think Jews were good cooks, good economic managers and bad soldiers; Israel proved them wrong.'b'But that has changed. Benjamin Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s economic reforms, the arrival of a million Russian immigrants and the stagnation of the peace process have produced a historic shift. The most resourceful Israelis are going into technology and commerce, not politics. This has had a desultory effect on the nation\xe2\x80\x99s public life, but an invigorating one on its economy.'b'Tel Aviv has become one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s foremost entrepreneurial hot spots. Israel has more high-tech start-ups per capita than any other nation on earth, by far. It leads the world in civilian research-and-development spending per capita. It ranks second behind the U.S. in the number of companies listed on the Nasdaq. Israel, with seven million people, attracts as much venture capital as France and Germany combined.'b'As Dan Senor and Saul Singer write in \xe2\x80\x9cStart-Up Nation: The Story of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s Economic Miracle,\xe2\x80\x9d Israel now has a classic innovation cluster, a place where tech obsessives work in close proximity and feed off each other\xe2\x80\x99s ideas.'b'Because of the strength of the economy, Israel has weathered the global recession reasonably well. The government did not have to bail out its banks or set off an explosion in short-term spending. Instead, it used the crisis to solidify the economy\xe2\x80\x99s long-term future by investing in research and development and infrastructure, raising some consumption taxes, promising to cut other taxes in the medium to long term. Analysts at Barclays write that Israel is \xe2\x80\x9cthe strongest recovery story\xe2\x80\x9d in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.'b'Israel\xe2\x80\x99s technological success is the fruition of the Zionist dream. The country was not founded so stray settlers could sit among thousands of angry Palestinians in Hebron. It was founded so Jews would have a safe place to come together and create things for the world.'b'This shift in the Israeli identity has long-term implications. Netanyahu preaches the optimistic view: that Israel will become the Hong Kong of the Middle East, with economic benefits spilling over into the Arab world. And, in fact, there are strands of evidence to support that view in places like the West Bank and Jordan.'b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s more likely that Israel\xe2\x80\x99s economic leap forward will widen the gap between it and its neighbors. All the countries in the region talk about encouraging innovation. Some oil-rich states spend billions trying to build science centers. But places like Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv are created by a confluence of cultural forces, not money. The surrounding nations do not have the tradition of free intellectual exchange and technical creativity.'b'For example, between 1980 and 2000, Egyptians registered 77 patents in the U.S. Saudis registered 171. Israelis registered 7,652.'b'The tech boom also creates a new vulnerability. As Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic has argued, these innovators are the most mobile people on earth. To destroy Israel\xe2\x80\x99s economy, Iran doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually have to lob a nuclear weapon into the country. It just has to foment enough instability so the entrepreneurs decide they had better move to Palo Alto, where many of them already have contacts and homes. American Jews used to keep a foothold in Israel in case things got bad here. Now Israelis keep a foothold in the U.S.'b'During a decade of grim foreboding, Israel has become an astonishing success story, but also a highly mobile one.'b'The president of the American Federation of Teachers says she will urge her members to accept a form of teacher evaluation that takes student achievement into account and that the union has commissioned an independent effort to streamline disciplinary processes and make it easier to fire teachers who are guilty of misconduct.'b'In a speech to be delivered Tuesday in Washington, Randi Weingarten plans to call for more frequent and more rigorous evaluations of public schoolteachers, and she says she will assert that standardized test scores and other measures of student performance should be an integral part of the evaluation process. The use of student test scores to measure teacher performance has been anathema to many teachers. Ms. Weingarten is not proposing that they be the only  \xe2\x80\x94  or even the primary  \xe2\x80\x94  element in determining teacher quality.'b'But she told me in an interview over the weekend that she wants to \xe2\x80\x9cstop this notion\xe2\x80\x9d that her membership is in favor of keeping bad teachers in the classroom. \xe2\x80\x9cI will try to convince my members that, of course, we have to look at student test scores and student learning,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'The use of test scores, as Ms. Weingarten sees it, would be part of a new, enhanced process of teacher evaluation that would offer clear professional standards for teachers. It would replace current practices, which in many districts across the country are lax, haphazard and, in the words of Ms. Weingarten and others, often amount to little more than \xe2\x80\x9cdrive-by\xe2\x80\x9d evaluations.'b'It is not uncommon for teachers to be observed in the classroom just a couple of times a year for only a few minutes each time and then get a satisfactory rating. Under those circumstances, hardly anything is learned about the quality or effectiveness of the teachers. Most teachers are routinely rated as satisfactory, and many are never evaluated at all.'b'Ms. Weingarten is urging school administrators to observe teachers more closely and more frequently. (The enhanced, clearly articulated professional standards she is calling for are already in use in some districts. There is no need to reinvent the wheel.) Experts trained in best practices and using a variety of objective data, including measures of student achievement, would do the evaluating. Teachers who are struggling would be given an opportunity to improve their performance. If, after remedial efforts, they still did not measure up, they would be fired, whether tenured or not.'b'As Ms. Weingarten put it, \xe2\x80\x9cWe would have to say, \xe2\x80\x98Look, we helped you. We tried. You\xe2\x80\x99re just not cut out to be a teacher.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ms. Weingarten also addresses the fact that it is sometimes scandalously difficult to remove teachers who have engaged in serious misconduct. While emphasizing the need for due process, she bluntly asserts, in a draft of her speech: \xe2\x80\x9cWe recognize, however, that too often due process can become a glacial process. We intend to change that.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The union has asked Kenneth Feinberg, the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s so-called pay czar, to develop a more efficient protocol for disciplining  \xe2\x80\x94  and when necessary, removing  \xe2\x80\x94  teachers accused of misconduct.'b'This would be a big deal. Mr. Feinberg is highly respected and widely viewed as independent. He administered the government fund that compensated those who were injured and the families of those who were killed in the Sept. 11 attacks. He also administered a fund set up in the wake of the mass shooting at Virginia Tech in 2007.'b'He is not the kind of guy to go into the tank for the teachers\xe2\x80\x99 union. (John Ashcroft chose him to lead the 9/11 fund.) It will be very interesting to see whether the union actually goes along if Mr. Feinberg fashions a workable plan to streamline teacher discipline that is viewed favorably by school administrators.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe look forward,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ms. Weingarten, \xe2\x80\x9cto working with Mr. Feinberg on this critical undertaking.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If the union follows through on Ms. Weingarten\xe2\x80\x99s proposals, it would represent a significant, good-faith effort to cooperate more fully with state officials and school administrators in the monumental job of improving public school education. More than 90 percent of American youngsters go through the public schools. The schools were struggling and failing too many youngsters even before the latest economic downturn, which is taking a terrible toll.'b'My view is that America\xe2\x80\x99s greatest national security crisis is the crisis in its schools.'b'Ms. Weingarten\xe2\x80\x99s ideas for upgrading the teacher evaluation process are good ones and should be embraced and improved upon where possible by those in charge of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s schools. The point is not just to get rid of failing teachers, but to improve the skills and effectiveness of the millions of teachers who show up in the classrooms every day.'b'If the union chooses not to follow through on these proposals, its credibility will take a punishing and well-deserved hit.'b'China\xe2\x80\x99s economic strategy over the past two decades has been remarkably successful. By opening its doors to foreign investment and manipulating currency markets to keep the renminbi from rising against the dollar, it hitched itself to consumers in the industrial world and achieved spectacular growth.'b'While the strategy is still working for China, it is exacerbating economic weakness around the globe. If China keeps it up, other countries are likely to use their last available weapon \xe2\x80\x94 protectionism \xe2\x80\x94 to stop the onslaught of artificially cheap Chinese goods. A trade war is easy to start and hard to contain. It could hit everybody\xe2\x80\x99s exports, disrupting growth everywhere.'b'As China has flooded the world with exports, it has edged out suppliers from other developing countries. This was bad enough when the world economy was growing briskly.'b'Now China\xe2\x80\x99s strategy is doing considerably more harm. In many countries, fiscal stimulus efforts have been weakened by inflows of cheap Chinese imports that have soaked up some of the money added by these government programs.'b'With global demand flagging, the Chinese government has manipulated its currency, the renminbi, even more aggressively. After having allowed the renminbi to appreciate gradually against the dollar for three years, in the summer of 2008 China re-established a hard peg, ensuring that the renminbi followed the dollar as the American currency fell against the euro and the yen. That has put enormous pressure on the economies of Europe and Japan.'b'If China continues its beggar-thy-neighbor currency policy, it will make it even harder for countries and the global economy to revive. As overextended governments wind down their fiscal stimulus, many economies will have to rely on exports as a crucial source of demand while their consumers restructure their sorry personal finances.'b'This task is made much more difficult if China is flooding the world with cheap goods. China\xe2\x80\x99s exports rebounded sharply in December after more than a year of decline. Its trade surplus \xe2\x80\x94 after falling last year \xe2\x80\x94 is expected to rebound sharply in 2010.'b'There are healthier strategies for China to follow. In particular, it could deploy some of its mountainous reserves at home to pay for long-neglected social spending: on health care, education and pensions. This would provide substantial economic stimulus and improve the lives of its people.'b'If it sticks to its cheap-renminbi guns, however, it is bound to draw a protectionist response. The Obama administration already has caved to political demands and slapped exceptional tariffs on Chinese tires and antidumping duties on steel pipes. Congress has been uncharacteristically quiet, but patience is wearing thin in Washington and everywhere.'b'India has filed a stack of trade complaints against China. And the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum recently urged the adoption of \xe2\x80\x9cmarket-oriented exchange rates\xe2\x80\x9d for Asian currencies, a reference to China\xe2\x80\x99s manipulation.'b'A trade war with China would be disastrous and bound to escalate around the world. Restraint is needed. But we fear no one is going to feel restrained if China doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change its strategy.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Wrong Story About Depression'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Jan. 9):'b'Judith Warner is correct that antidepressants are frequently prescribed by primary-care doctors, often for the minor and moderate depressions referred to in the study getting recent media attention.'b'Depressions respond to psychotherapy. Ms. Warner is also correct that the effectiveness of this treatment very much depends on the individual practitioner. The practitioner can be a psychiatrist, a psychologist or a social worker.'b'The advantage of an evaluation by a well-trained psychiatrist is that the medical and drug-induced causes of depression can be better ruled out, and a judgment can be made whether the condition is of significant severity where the benefits of the addition of medication outweigh the risks.'b'Unfortunately, as with other fields, attempts to determine who are the best (performance measurements, published rankings, word of mouth) all have their flaws.

The same day, the Justice Department released an audit that found that threats against judges and prosecutors have more than doubled since 2003 and warned that their security had critical deficiencies. Both events sound a much-needed alarm.'b'The audit, prepared by the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s inspector general, found that there were 1,278 reported threats against judges and prosecutors in fiscal-year 2008. The inspector general noted that judges and prosecutors are not reporting all threats promptly \xe2\x80\x94 or at all \xe2\x80\x94 which means the number may be significantly higher.'b'These threats should not be taken casually. In 2005, the mother and husband of Joan Lefkow, a federal judge in Chicago, were murdered in her home by a litigant who was upset that she had dismissed his lawsuit.'b'The audit faulted the main agencies that protect federal justice officials. It found that the United States Marshals Service, which is responsible for ensuring the security of federal judicial proceedings, has not consistently responded in an appropriate way to threats. In the cases it looked at, judges and prosecutors who had reported being threatened were too often not provided with basic protective measures.'b'The audit also found that personnel of the United States attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 offices who are responsible for protecting federal prosecutors lack adequate training in threat response.

But after visiting Hong Kong and Taiwan this past week and talking to many people who work and invest their own money in China, I\xe2\x80\x99d offer Mr. Chanos two notes of caution.'b'First, a simple rule of investing that has always served me well: Never short a country with $2 trillion in foreign currency reserves.'b'Second, it is easy to look at China today and see its enormous problems and things that it is not getting right. For instance, low interest rates, easy credit, an undervalued currency and hot money flowing in from abroad have led to what the Chinese government Sunday called \xe2\x80\x9cexcessively rising house prices\xe2\x80\x9d in major cities, or what some might call a speculative bubble ripe for the shorting. In the last few days, though, China\xe2\x80\x99s central bank has started edging up interest rates and raising the proportion of deposits that banks must set aside as reserves \xe2\x80\x94 precisely to head off inflation and take some air out of any asset bubbles.'b'And that\xe2\x80\x99s the point. I am reluctant to sell China short, not because I think it has no problems or corruption or bubbles, but because I think it has all those problems in spades  \xe2\x80\x94  and some will blow up along the way (the most dangerous being pollution). But it also has a political class focused on addressing its real problems, as well as a mountain of savings with which to do so (unlike us).'b'And here is the other thing to keep in mind. Think about all the hype, all the words, that have been written about China\xe2\x80\x99s economic development since 1979. It\xe2\x80\x99s a lot, right? What if I told you this: \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen anything yet.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Why do I say that? All the long-term investments that China has made over the last two decades are just blossoming and could really propel the Chinese economy into the 21st-century knowledge age, starting with its massive investment in infrastructure. Ten years ago, China had a lot bridges and roads to nowhere. Well, many of them are now connected. It is also on a crash program of building subways in major cities and high-speed trains to interconnect them. China also now has 400 million Internet users, and 200 million of them have broadband. Check into a motel in any major city and you\xe2\x80\x99ll have broadband access. America has about 80 million broadband users.'b'Now take all this infrastructure and mix it together with 27 million students in technical colleges and universities \xe2\x80\x94 the most in the world. With just the normal distribution of brains, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to bring a lot of brainpower to the market, or, as Bill Gates once said to me: \xe2\x80\x9cIn China, when you\xe2\x80\x99re one-in-a-million, there are 1,300 other people just like you.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Equally important, more and more Chinese students educated abroad are returning home to work and start new businesses. I had lunch with a group of professors at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, or HKUST, who told me that this year they will be offering some 50 full scholarships for graduate students in science and technology. Major U.S. universities are sharply cutting back.'b'Tony Chan, a Hong Kong-born mathematician, recently returned from America after 20 years to become the new president of HKUST. What was his last job in America? Assistant director of the U.S. National Science Foundation in charge of the mathematical and physical sciences. He\xe2\x80\x99s one of many coming home.'b'One of the biggest problems for China\xe2\x80\x99s manufacturing and financial sectors has been finding capable middle managers. The reverse-brain drain is eliminating that problem as well.'b'Finally, as Liu Chao-shiuan, Taiwan\xe2\x80\x99s former prime minister, pointed out to me: when Taiwan moved up the value chain from low-end, labor-intensive manufacturing to higher, value-added work, its factories moved to China or Vietnam. It lost them. In China, low-end manufacturing moves from coastal China to the less developed Western part of the country and becomes an engine for development there. In Taiwan, factories go up and out.

That is a good place to start, but it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop there. President Obama and Congress should also impose a windfall tax on the huge bonuses that bailed-out bankers plan to pay themselves over the next few weeks.'b'This is an issue of fairness and sound public policy. The Treasury needs the money. A fee may also get banks and bankers to rethink the way they do business \xe2\x80\x94 something the much-promised, far-too-delayed and increasingly watered-down financial regulatory reform effort is unlikely to do. A permanent tax or fee imposed on the nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest banks could reduce future risks by discouraging big banks from getting even bigger.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, the crisis spawned by banks\xe2\x80\x99 recklessness has cost the country a lot more than $120 billion. Any calculation must also include the deepest recession since the 1930s and the loss of more than seven million jobs. What profits banks have made since then have not come from lending to credit-strapped businesses. They are trading profits made possible by trillions of dollars in cheap financing from the Federal Reserve.'b'The crisis occurred because banks that had grown too big to fail came too close to failure \xe2\x80\x94  driven by a reckless pursuit of risk and profit. Credit froze, and the government was forced to put enormous public resources at their disposal to keep them afloat.'b'Though all that public money has pulled banks back from the brink, some too-big-to-fail banks have since got even bigger by swallowing their weaker brethren. That means, if they get in trouble, they could wreak even greater havoc on the economy.'b'A levy on these financial giants would help by putting a brake on this consolidation \xe2\x80\x94 making the largest banks somewhat less profitable and steering investment and other resources into smaller banks, which, if they failed, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take the rest of us with them.'b'The Obama administration has not specified either the size or the type of levy it would impose on the nation\xe2\x80\x99s big banks. Officials are reportedly considering a tax on profits of the largest banks and a tax based on the size of their assets. Designing either will not be easy. Banks will deploy phalanxes of lawyers to avoid them and threaten to move their operations to friendlier climes.'b'To be effective, any fee or tax should be implemented as part of a coordinated effort with all the big financial centers around the globe. Britain and France would be likely to come on board. The Group of 20 leading industrial and developing nations asked the International Monetary Fund last year to study different ways to make big banks raise money to contribute for present and potential future bailouts.'b'Crafting a coordinated taxation regime might take a while. In the meantime, the Obama administration could start filling the budgetary gap with a windfall tax on those big bankers\xe2\x80\x99 bonuses. It is a perfect way to say thank you.'b'On the surface, American Needle Inc. v. National Football League seems to be about hats, shirts and other items with team logos on them. But if the United States Supreme Court issues a broad ruling in favor of the N.F.L., it could help define how far joint ventures can go in stifling competition.'b'American Needle used to manufacture apparel with team logos, but the N.F.L. entered into an exclusive deal with Reebok nine years ago. American Needle sued, charging that the arrangement illegally restrained trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.'b'The trial court ruled that the law did not apply and that the case could not go forward. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, agreed in a poorly reasoned decision, ruling that the N.F.L. was not covered by Section 1 because it is a \xe2\x80\x9csingle entity,\xe2\x80\x9d and, therefore, not capable of restraining trade. This ruling is wrong on the law and disagrees with many other federal courts.'b'Although it won before the appeals court, the N.F.L. urged the Supreme Court to take the case, perhaps hoping for a broad ruling that would cement its monopoly power. The court, which is scheduled to hear the case on Wednesday, should reverse the appeals court decision and allow the case to proceed.'b'To fall under the \xe2\x80\x9csingle entity\xe2\x80\x9d exception that the courts have recognized, the N.F.L. would have to be a single economic entity.

They should have to comply with Section 1.'b'If the N.F.L.\xe2\x80\x99s exemption is upheld, it would allow the teams to artificially inflate the prices of their insignia items. It could also clear the way for the teams to eliminate competition in other areas. In a friend-of-the-court brief, the National Football League Players Association argued that the league\xe2\x80\x99s position in this case is a \xe2\x80\x9cTrojan horse\xe2\x80\x9d designed to free them from the requirements of Section 1 when it comes to paying and assigning players.'b'If the N.F.L. wins, the Consumer Federation of America warned, other joint ventures \xe2\x80\x94  including health care networks and credit card networks  \xe2\x80\x94 could try to use the ruling to block the government\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to promote competition in their industries.'b'The Sherman Act was designed to promote robust economic competition.

The Legislature rejected a same-sex marriage bill that Mr. Corzine, a Democrat, said he would have signed before handing over the State House to Gov.-elect Christopher Christie, a Republican who has said he would have vetoed it.'b'The legislation that was passed on Monday allows doctors to prescribe marijuana the way they would controlled painkillers like Oxycontin or morphine. New Jersey will be one of 14 states to allow the drug to combat pain, nausea and other debilitating side effects from chemotherapy or for seizures, muscle spasms and glaucoma. That will give doctors in New Jersey an important option to the pharmaceutical drugs now available to treat these serious illnesses.'b'Despite criticism from antidrug groups that the change would open the door to more abuse of marijuana, the New Jersey law would not make it easier to grow your own or puff away freely on the nearest street corner. Doing so is very much illegal. And federal officials have made it clear that while they won\xe2\x80\x99t go after patients using marijuana, they want law enforcement officers to focus more firepower on dangerous drug dealers in their states.'b'New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s law is expected to be the nation\xe2\x80\x99s most restrictive. That is a far cry from California, where marijuana can be used for ailments as common as anxiety.

His family went into hiding that year in unused rooms that were hidden behind a movable bookcase, seeking to avoid the fate of thousands of Dutch Jews being deported to concentration camps. Asked by Mr. Frank to help hide them, and to bring them food and supplies, she readily agreed, even though it meant risking her life.'b'Working with her husband, Jan Gies, a member of the Dutch resistance, and three other employees of Mr. Frank\xe2\x80\x99s business, she provided books, emotional support and nourishment. She traveled on her bicycle to spread her food purchases among different grocers in order to avoid suspicion. After the Gestapo raided the hiding place in August 1944, Mrs. Gies made a bold but unsuccessful attempt to bribe Gestapo officials to spare the lives of the eight arrested Jews.

The Op-Ed editors asked eight financial experts to pose questions they would like to hear the bankers answer.'b''b'1. Bankers are dealers in money. The Federal Reserve is a creator of money \xe2\x80\x94 since the crisis began in August 2007, it has conjured up $1.1 trillion. Given the ease with which these dollars are materialized on a computer screen, how can they be worth anything?'b'2. The Federal Reserve\xe2\x80\x99s setting of its benchmark federal funds  rate at nearly 1 percent in  2003 to 2004  was a primary cause of the housing and mortgage debacle. Yet, in an attempt to nurse the economy back to health, the Fed has set that  rate at nearly zero percent. So what\xe2\x80\x99s the next bubble, and how do you intend to profit by it?'b'3. For Mr. Blankfein: In capitalism, profits are no sin, yet Goldman Sachs keeps making excuses for its success in 2009. If you earned the money honestly, what are you apologizing for? And if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t earn it honestly, how did you do it?'b''b' \xe2\x80\x94 JAMES GRANT, the editor of Grant\xe2\x80\x99s Interest Rate Observer and the author, most recently, of \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Market Miscalculates\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'1. It still isn\xe2\x80\x99t clear precisely how mortgage-related losses in the financial sector grew to be many times greater than the actual losses on the mortgages themselves. What role did synthetic  collateralized debt obligations \xe2\x80\x94 a Wall Street invention that uses credit default swaps to mimic the payments from mortgages \xe2\x80\x94 play in multiplying the losses? Is there any way in which a synthetic debt obligation adds value to the real economy?'b'2. Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms argue that the clients to whom they sold mortgage-related securities were sophisticated investors who fully understood the risks. Goldman has said this was also the case when its clients bought the very same mortgage securities that Goldman, on its own behalf, was betting would default. Did these clients indeed understand all the gory details?'b'3. At the height of the panic in the fall of 2008, Wall Street firms blamed short-sellers for trying to destroy them. What short positions did Wall Street firms have in one another\xe2\x80\x99s shares, and were they also betting against each other using credit default swaps?'b''b' \xe2\x80\x94 BETHANY McLEAN, a contributing editor for Vanity Fair, who is co-writing a book about the financial crisis with Joe Nocera of The Times'b''b'1. Without the Troubled Asset Relief Program, Wall Street banks would not have survived the shock to the financial system that occurred in September 2008. Nor would they have subsequently accrued large profits and bonus pools in 2009. Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t  a substantial share of those bonus pools be sequestered on bank balance sheets for several years to increase  the banks\xe2\x80\x99 capital levels and shield taxpayers against another bailout?'b'2. All deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that were held by Wall Street financial conglomerates should have been insulated in separate bank subsidiaries that were prohibited from trading, holding derivative securities and investing in risky assets like equities or bonds with less than a AAA rating. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t such safeguards  have   reduced excess banker risk-taking, thereby reducing the need for taxpayer bailouts?'b'3. Wall Street turbocharged the subprime mortgage boom from 2002 to 2006 by providing billions in cheap warehouse loans to non-bank lenders  that otherwise had virtually no capital or financing. Had the Federal Reserve kept short-term interest rates at a more normal 4 percent to 5 percent, rather than pushing them down to 1 percent,  would this not have greatly  curtailed the reckless growth of subprime loans?'b''b' \xe2\x80\x94 DAVID STOCKMAN, a  director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan'b''b'1. One result of the Pecora commission, the Depression equivalent of this investigation, was the Glass-Steagall Act, which kept investment banking separate from commercial banking until the act was repealed in 1999.  Many experts now believe that divide should be reinstated. Yet commercial banks like Washington Mutual lost a lot of money during the crisis without having any investment banking activities, and pure investment banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers collapsed without being deposit-taking institutions. This suggests that the problem does not lie with mingling commercial and investment banking. Are you in favor of the return of Glass-Steagall, and why?'b'2. Many people argue that the financial industry now accounts for far too much of the gross domestic product  and that it is unproductive, indeed counterproductive, to devote so much of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s resources to simply moving money around rather than making things. Why has this shift occurred and what, if anything, can the government do about it?'b'3. Over the last 20 years, the world of finance has been irrevocably transformed: individuals have moved  their money from  savings accounts  into money market funds, and institutional investors now keep their cash in the repo market, where Treasury securities are borrowed and lent, rather than as deposits in commercial banks. As a result, before the crisis, half of the credit provided in the United States was being channeled outside the commercial banking system. What regulatory changes do we need to ensure that our current financial system is as stable as the traditional banking system that served us so well from 1936 to 1996?'b''b'\xe2\x80\x94 LIAQUAT AHAMED, the author of \xe2\x80\x9cLords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'1.

Most of those guarantees resulted from hedging supposedly safe investments (they had AAA ratings, after all)   with A.I.G. or other insurers.

The insurance was effective only because the government stepped in, theoretically on the taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 behalf, and made payments for A.I.G., an otherwise bankrupt firm. Since employees\xe2\x80\x99 bonuses, and ultimately yours, were based on these fraudulent profits, my questions are these:'b'1.

What next? Poor Haiti is cursed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But while earthquakes are acts of nature, extreme vulnerability to earthquakes is manmade. And the history of Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s vulnerability to natural disasters \xe2\x80\x94 to floods and famine and disease as well as to this terrible earthquake \xe2\x80\x94 is long and complex, but the essence of it seems clear enough.'b'Haiti is a country created by former slaves, kidnapped West Africans, who, in 1804, when slavery still flourished in the United States and the Caribbean, threw off their cruel French masters and created their own republic. Haitians have been punished ever since for claiming their freedom: by the French who, in the 1820s, demanded and received payment from the Haitians for the slave colony, impoverishing the country for years to come; by an often brutal American occupation from 1915 to 1934; by indigenous misrule that the American government aided and abetted. (In more recent years American administrations fell into a pattern of promoting and then undermining Haitian constitutional democracy.)'b'Hence the current state of affairs: at least 10,000  private organizations perform supposedly humanitarian missions in Haiti, yet it remains one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s poorest countries. Some of the money that private aid organizations rely on comes from the United States government, which has insisted that a great deal of the aid return to American pockets \xe2\x80\x94 a larger percentage than that of any other industrialized country.'b'But that is only part of the problem. In the arena of international aid, a great many efforts, past and present, appear to have been doomed from the start. There are the many projects that seem designed to serve not impoverished Haitians but the interests of the people administering the projects. Most important, a lot of organizations seem to be unable \xe2\x80\x94 and some appear to be unwilling \xe2\x80\x94 to create partnerships with each other or, and this is crucial, with the public sector of the society they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to serve.'b'The usual excuse, that a government like Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s is weak and suffers from corruption, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hold \xe2\x80\x94 all the more reason, indeed, to work with the government. The ultimate goal of all aid to Haiti ought to be the strengthening of Haitian institutions, infrastructure and expertise.'b'This week, the list of things that Haiti needs, things like jobs and food and reforestation, has suddenly grown a great deal longer. The earthquake struck mainly the capital and its environs, the most densely populated part of the country, where organizations like the Red Cross and the United Nations have their headquarters. A lot of the places that could have been used for disaster relief \xe2\x80\x94 including the central hospital, such as it was \xe2\x80\x94 are now themselves disaster areas.'b'But there are effective aid organizations working in Haiti. At least one has not been crippled by the earthquake. Partners in Health, or in Haitian Creole Zanmi Lasante, has been the largest health care provider in rural Haiti. (I serve on this organization\xe2\x80\x99s development committee.) It operates, in partnership with the Haitian Ministry of Health, some 10 hospitals and clinics, all far from the capital and all still intact. As a result of this calamity, Partners in Health probably just became the largest health care provider still standing in all Haiti.'b'Fortunately, it also offers a solid model for independence \xe2\x80\x94 a model where only a handful of Americans are involved in day-to-day operations, and Haitians run the show. Efforts like this could provide one way for Haiti, as it rebuilds, to renew the promise of its revolution.'b'PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti'b'FOR most of the past 20 hours I\xe2\x80\x99ve been hiking the earthquake-rubbled streets of Port-au-Prince. Tuesday night, when we had less idea of the scope of the devastation, there was singing all over town: songs with lyrics like \xe2\x80\x9cO Lord, keep me close to you\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, Jesus.\xe2\x80\x9d Preachers stood atop boxes and gave impromptu sermons, reassuring their listeners in the dark: \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems like the Good Lord is hiding, but he\xe2\x80\x99s here. He\xe2\x80\x99s always here.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The day after, as the sun exposed bodies strewn everywhere, and every fourth building seemed to have fallen, Haitians were still praying in the streets. But mostly they were weeping, trying to find friends and family, searching in vain for relief and walking around in shock.'b'If God exists, he\xe2\x80\x99s really got it in for Haiti. Haitians think so, too. Zed, a housekeeper in my apartment complex, said God was angry at sinners around the world, but especially in Haiti. Zed said the quake had fortified her faith, and that she understood it as divine retribution.'b'This earthquake will make the devastating storms of 2008 look like child\xe2\x80\x99s play. Entire neighborhoods have vanished. The night of the earthquake, my boyfriend, who works for the American Red Cross, and I tended to hundreds of Haitians who lived in shoddily built hillside slums. The injuries we saw were too grave for the few bottles of antiseptic, gauze and waterproof tape we had: skulls shattered, bones and tendons protruding from skin, chunks of bodies missing. Some will die in the coming days, but for the most part they are the lucky ones.'b'No one knows where to go with their injured and dead, or where to find food and water. Relief is nowhere in sight. The hospitals that are still standing are turning away the injured. The headquarters of the United Nations peacekeeping force, which has provided the entirety of the country\xe2\x80\x99s logistical support, has collapsed. Cell and satellite phones don\xe2\x80\x99t work. Cars can\xe2\x80\x99t get through many streets, which are blocked by fallen houses. Policemen seem to have made themselves scarce.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf this were a serious country, there would be relief workers here, finding the children buried underneath that house,\xe2\x80\x9d my friend Florence told me. Florence is a paraplegic who often sits outside her house in the Bois Verna neighborhood. The house next to hers had collapsed, and Florence said that for a time she heard the children inside crying.'b'Why, then, turn to a God who seems to be absent at best and vindictive at worst? Haitians don\xe2\x80\x99t have other options. The country has a long legacy of repression and exploitation; international peacekeepers come and go; the earth no longer provides food; jobs almost don\xe2\x80\x99t exist. Perhaps a God who hides is better than nothing.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'A Nation of Do-It-Yourself Lawyers'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Jan. 2): Chief Justices John T.

Political leaders now must make sure that a sordid crisis does not threaten the agreement or the province\xe2\x80\x99s future.'b'The government\xe2\x80\x99s co-leader, Peter Robinson, has temporarily stepped aside as investigators determine whether he had any role in $80,000 in loans arranged by his wife, Iris, in 2008 and given to her lover, who was a teenage pub operator at the time.'b'The scandal could not have come at a worse moment. Mr. Robinson, the leader of the mostly Protestant unionist political bloc, has been in delicate negotiations with leaders of the largely Catholic republican movement on the big remaining issue in the Good Friday peace agreement: the transfer of police and justice powers from Britain to the province\xe2\x80\x99s shaky government.'b'After news of the loans and the affair broke, Mrs. Robinson abandoned her seats in the Belfast Assembly and London Parliament. Critics insist that her husband should have disclosed the loans to parliamentary authorities after he learned of them.'b'Mr. Robinson has retained his role as negotiator on the police and justice issue. It is an open question as to whether he can make progress amid the tabloid melodrama and intraparty machinations. Most of the republican leaders remain intent on securing home-rule jurisdiction, but there are some dissident unionists who want to stay under London\xe2\x80\x99s authority and have no compunction about scuttling the peace deal.'b'It would be tragic after centuries of bloodshed to see reconciliation in Northern Ireland founder on a lurid sideshow. If the current government falls, it would be crucial for politicians to remember their obligation under the power-sharing agreement for fresh elections, new leadership and a firmer effort at progress.'b'There must be no turning back toward Northern Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s deadly troubles.'b'The trial that started on Monday in San Francisco over the constitutionality of California\xe2\x80\x99s voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage could have been a moment for the entire nation to witness a calm, deliberative debate on a vitally important issue in the era of instant communications. Instead, the United States Supreme Court made it a sad example of the quashing of public discourse by blocking the televising of the nonjury trial.'b'The court blocked the public broadcasting of the proceedings by its familiar 5-to-4 split. In a vigorous dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer correctly objected to the court\xe2\x80\x99s highly unusual intervention. He concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cThe public interest weighs in favor of providing access to the courts.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The antipathy of some justices to televising Supreme Court arguments is as well known as it is wrongheaded. But the court\xe2\x80\x99s stance against allowing unobtrusive C-Spanlike coverage of its own proceedings should not foreclose public viewing of this case.'b'There have been claims that televising the courtroom proceeding would somehow be unfair to defenders of Proposition 8, the California ballot initiative that banned same-sex marriage. They are hazy and unsubstantiated and vastly outweighed by the strong public interest in the airing of a major civil-rights issue. But the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s majority bought the false argument.'b'Over the next three weeks or so, the trial will test whether Proposition 8 violates the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of equal protection. The trial already has featured emotionally charged testimony about the marriage ban. It is a chance for close cross-examination of opponents\xe2\x80\x99 bogus claims that permitting same-sex couples to wed would harm heterosexual marriage.'b'No matter how the trial turns out, the verdict is unlikely to be the final word. There are destined to be appeals, and the Supreme Court may well have the final say. There is considerable anxiety among supporters of same-sex marriage that the case may reach the Supreme Court too soon, while public opinion on same-sex marriage is evolving.'b'Those fears are understandable. But there is a strong legal case that California voters trespassed on the Constitution when they approved Proposition 8. The courtroom battle now unfolding bears close watching, and the Supreme Court should not stand in the way of Americans viewing it and reaching educated judgments.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cTax Them Both\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 13), which calls for a tax on the huge bonuses that bankers are expected to pay themselves:'b'I agree that the bank profits are the result of a deliberate federal government policy to restore banking capital and ultimately investment in American prosperity.

The payouts to bankers are a form of appropriation of public wealth.'b'That is why I have introduced the Responsible Bankers Act, which would impose a 75 percent tax on the outsized bonuses bankers are paying themselves from windfall profits earned from government support of their industry.'b'Shareholders and corporate governance have proved to be feeble means for reining in corporate pay.

The architect of China\xe2\x80\x99s astonishingly successful economic reforms, Deng Xiaoping, clenched his teeth and accepted photocopiers, fax machines, cellphones, computers and lawyers because they were part of modernization.'b'Yet in the last few years, President Hu Jintao has cracked down on Internet freedoms and independent lawyers and journalists.

The earthquake that struck on Tuesday did damage on a scale that scarcely could have been imagined had we all not seen the photos and videos and read the survivors\xe2\x80\x99 agonizing accounts \xe2\x80\x94 of the sudden crumbling of mountainside slums, schools, hospitals, even the Parliament building and presidential palace.'b'Whenever disaster strikes, we are reminded that Haiti is the poorest country in the hemisphere. And each time there is a disaster, this country and others help \xe2\x80\x94  for a while. This time must be different.'b'Haiti urgently needs relief to dig out and shelter survivors, and to nurse, feed and clothe people who had little to start with and now have nothing left. But Haiti needs more. It needs a commitment to finally move beyond the relentless poverty, despair and dysfunction that would be a disaster anywhere else but in Haiti are the norm.'b'President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton have promised that assistance from the United States will be swift through the coordinated efforts of the military, civilian aid agencies and nongovernmental organizations. The administration must make sure that the upswelling of generosity turns into sustained action, replacing the confusion and chaos on the ground with a rational and effective campaign \xe2\x80\x94 first to rescue, then to rebuild.'b'Private citizens can help speed the process by giving generously to charitable organizations that have a track record in Haiti. Those groups know where to direct humanitarian aid and how to spend it prudently.'b'The United Nations mission in Haiti suffered a tragic blow on Tuesday when its headquarters in Port-au-Prince, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital, were destroyed. Its chief and dozens of employees remain  unaccounted for. The organization must find a way to recover quickly to resume its vital mission.'b'Former President Bill Clinton, the United Nations\xe2\x80\x99 special envoy to Haiti, has an opportunity to bring all his skills of leadership and persuasion to bear. If ever there was a time for so gifted and trouble-prone former president to make himself useful, this is it.'b'The United States has a special responsibility to help its neighbor. This is an opportunity for President Obama to demonstrate how the United States shoulders its responsibilities and mobilizes other countries to do their full part as well. Even as he urges his administration and others to act, he should remind them \xe2\x80\x94 and himself \xe2\x80\x94 that this is not the work of a few months. It is a commitment of years.'b'On Wednesday, the Obama administration said it was halting the pending deportation of up to 30,000 Haitians who have run afoul of the immigration agency. The government should now take the next step by granting these immigrants temporary protected status \xe2\x80\x94  as it has to survivors of Latin American earthquakes and other disasters \xe2\x80\x94  so that the Haitian diaspora in the United States will be allowed to work and send vitally needed money home.'b'An earthquake this size would have been a catastrophe in any country. But this was only partly a natural disaster. Look at Haiti and you will see what generations of misrule, poverty and political strife will do to a country. Haiti, suffering forever, is in the direst straits. But Haitians do not need condolences. They need help and the ability to help themselves.'b'Google has taken a bold stand by saying that it would stop cooperating with China\xe2\x80\x99s online censorship and may pull out of the country entirely. Google had many reasons to reconsider its presence, but the discovery that it was a victim of a cyberattack aimed at Chinese human rights activists added a powerful one. There are limits to the price an American company should be willing to pay for access to 300 million Web users.'b'When Google took its Web site to China in early 2006, it argued that the positive benefit of giving the Chinese people more open access to the Internet outweighed the negative. But Google said that it would monitor the situation, including what restrictions were imposed upon its delivery of information.'b'The government\xe2\x80\x99s policies proved to be deeply troubling. In China, search requests on Google for terms that offend the government, such as \xe2\x80\x9cTiananmen Square massacre,\xe2\x80\x9d do not work. YouTube, the company\xe2\x80\x99s user-generated video site, has repeatedly been blocked.'b'Things have not gotten better. The recently discovered cyberattacks aimed at Google\xe2\x80\x99s computers, and those of other companies, are particularly disturbing. A prime purpose appears to have been to hack into the Gmail user accounts of Chinese human rights activists. Google says it has discovered that the accounts of dozens of Gmail users who advocate for human rights in China have been accessed, apparently by deceptive software or other improper means.'b'Google\xe2\x80\x99s policies have not always won plaudits.

Entrepreneurs, scientists and artists who have the most access to it will be in the best position to invent the future.'b'The official Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission \xe2\x80\x94 the group that aims to hold a modern version of the Pecora hearings of the 1930s, whose investigations set the stage for New Deal bank regulation  \xe2\x80\x94  began taking testimony on Wednesday. In its first panel, the commission grilled four major financial-industry honchos. What did we learn?'b'Well, if you were hoping for a Perry Mason moment \xe2\x80\x94 a scene in which the witness blurts out: \xe2\x80\x9cYes! I admit it! I did it! And I\xe2\x80\x99m glad!\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x94  the hearing was disappointing. What you got, instead, was witnesses blurting out: \xe2\x80\x9cYes! I admit it! I\xe2\x80\x99m clueless!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'O.K., not in so many words. But the bankers\xe2\x80\x99 testimony showed a stunning failure, even now, to grasp the nature and extent of the current crisis. And that\xe2\x80\x99s important: It tells us that as Congress and the administration try to reform the financial system, they should ignore advice coming from the supposed wise men of Wall Street, who have no wisdom to offer.'b'Consider what has happened so far: The U.S. economy is still grappling with the consequences of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression; trillions of dollars of potential income have been lost; the lives of millions have been damaged, in some cases irreparably, by mass unemployment; millions more have seen their savings wiped out; hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, will lose essential health care because of the combination of job losses and draconian cutbacks by cash-strapped state governments.'b'And this disaster was entirely self-inflicted. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t like the stagflation of the 1970s, which had a lot to do with soaring oil prices, which were, in turn, the result of political instability in the Middle East. This time we\xe2\x80\x99re in trouble entirely thanks to the dysfunctional nature of our own financial system. Everyone understands this  \xe2\x80\x94  everyone, it seems, except the financiers themselves.'b'There were two moments in Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s hearing that stood out. One was when Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase declared that a financial crisis is something that \xe2\x80\x9chappens every five to seven years. We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised.\xe2\x80\x9d In short, stuff happens, and that\xe2\x80\x99s just part of life.'b'But the truth is that the United States managed to avoid major financial crises for half a century after the Pecora hearings were held and Congress enacted major banking reforms. It was only after we forgot those lessons, and dismantled effective regulation, that our financial system went back to being dangerously unstable.'b'As an aside, it was also startling to hear Mr. Dimon admit that his bank never even considered the possibility of a large decline in home prices, despite widespread warnings that we were in the midst of a monstrous housing bubble.'b'Still, Mr. Dimon\xe2\x80\x99s cluelessness paled beside that of Goldman Sachs\xe2\x80\x99s Lloyd Blankfein, who compared the financial crisis to a hurricane nobody could have predicted. Phil Angelides, the commission\xe2\x80\x99s chairman, was not amused: The financial crisis, he declared, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an act of God; it resulted from \xe2\x80\x9cacts of men and women.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Was Mr. Blankfein just inarticulate? No. He used the same metaphor in his prepared testimony in which he urged Congress not to push too hard for financial reform: \xe2\x80\x9cWe should resist a response ... that is solely designed around protecting us from the 100-year storm.\xe2\x80\x9d So this giant financial crisis was just a rare accident, a freak of nature, and we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t overreact.'b'But there was nothing accidental about the crisis. From the late 1970s on, the American financial system, freed by deregulation and a political climate in which greed was presumed to be good, spun ever further out of control. There were ever-greater rewards  \xe2\x80\x94  bonuses beyond the dreams of avarice  \xe2\x80\x94  for bankers who could generate big short-term profits. And the way to raise those profits was to pile up ever more debt, both by pushing loans on the public and by taking on ever-higher leverage within the financial industry.'b'Sooner or later, this runaway system was bound to crash. And if we don\xe2\x80\x99t make fundamental changes, it will happen all over again.'b'Do the bankers really not understand what happened, or are they just talking their self-interest? No matter. As I said, the important thing looking forward is to stop listening to financiers about financial reform.'b'Wall Street executives will tell you that the financial-reform bill the House passed last month would cripple the economy with overregulation (it\xe2\x80\x99s actually quite mild). They\xe2\x80\x99ll insist that the tax on bank debt just proposed by the Obama administration is a crude concession to foolish populism. They\xe2\x80\x99ll warn that action to tax or otherwise rein in financial-industry compensation is destructive and unjustified.'b'But what do they know? The answer, as far as I can tell, is: not much.'b'THOUGH it can offer scant comfort to the victims of the earthquake in Haiti, seismology is  making some slight progress in its search for the holy grail of being able to predict dreadful events like that on Tuesday. New studies into ultra-slow-motion events deep underground called nonvolcanic tremors are showing vague but promising signs that the same kind of subterranean danger signals that allow us today to forecast when a volcano is about to erupt may one day offer some warning of the hitherto unpredictable nucleation \xe2\x80\x94 the explosive beginning \xe2\x80\x94 of an earthquake.'b'The most interesting studies are those that are proceeding, slowly and expensively, in Parkfield, Calif. (as it happens, just a little north of the road crossing where James Dean was killed in a traffic accident nearly 55 years ago). A deep hole has been drilled into the countryside there, directly into the San Andreas fault, which runs for 800 miles along the junction between the North American and Pacific tectonic plates.'b'The academic and government researchers who run the drilling program seek to find out what happens at the precise point of contact between two plates. It now appears highly likely that the very low impact, but still measurable, nonvolcanic tremors that the researchers have detected in boreholes deep beneath the San Andreas are in some way associated with the destructive earthquakes that occur at shallower depths above them. What the scientists would still like to determine  is whether it might be possible to discern a nonvolcanic tremor\xe2\x80\x99s signature in the deep crust some useful time before a major earthquake happens far above.'b'This is highly relevant to the disaster  in Haiti because the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault, the tectonic culprit behind Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s earthquake, shares many similarities with the San Andreas: it is a strike-slip fault of about half the length (it runs from the Dominican Republic to Jamaica), it separates two plates (the North American and the Caribbean), for most of its length it is simultaneously locked solid and under severe stress, and it shears substantially  every century or so. (The last time was in 1907, in Jamaica; scientists have long warned of a catastrophe \xe2\x80\x94 one day \xe2\x80\x94 involving Port-au-Prince.)'b'It is highly likely that the low-impact, nonvolcanic tremors measured in the San Andreas happen in the Caribbean also. If a real correlation between these tremors and earthquakes can be found, then science will turn out to be truly on to something. Such a relationship has not yet been discovered. But the tremors do seem to have some unusual bellwether characteristics: there seems to be a correlation, for instance, between their occurrence and such external phenomena as the tides and the phases of the Moon. A link to movements within the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s crust is at least a further possibility \xe2\x80\x94 and that is something that could not have been said five years ago. Hence the faintest glimmer of hope for progress.'b'But then what? If the geophysicists at the University of California at Berkeley, the United States Geological Survey, the California Institute of Technology and the Scripps Research Institute are convinced of a correlation, and then one day detect with their deeply buried devices a sudden swarm of nonvolcanic tremors, would they call the mayor of San Francisco or Los Angeles and issue a warning? And would the mayors then order a mass evacuation? And if they did, what if the scientists turned out to be wrong?'b'These are questions well worth asking \xe2\x80\x94 and asking even more stridently of a place that is somewhat less sophisticated than California. If a similar swarm of data is noticed in the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault, would geologists try to warn the citizens of a city like Port-au-Prince? And even if the forecasts were right, would such a warning save lives, or would it set off    panics more lethal than the earthquake itself?'b'The branch of seismology that deals with prediction is undoubtedly in a slightly better place than it was half a decade ago. But new questions arise with every step toward the grail, and the answers come too slowly to bring true comfort to anyone today, least of all the unfortunate people of Haiti.'b'On Oct. 17, 1989, a major earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 struck the Bay Area in Northern California. Sixty-three people were killed. This week, a major earthquake, also measuring a magnitude of 7.0, struck near Port-au-Prince, Haiti. The Red Cross estimates that between 45,000 and 50,000 people have died.'b'This is not a natural disaster story. This is a poverty story. It\xe2\x80\x99s a story about poorly constructed buildings, bad infrastructure and terrible public services. On Thursday, President Obama told the people of Haiti: \xe2\x80\x9cYou will not be forsaken; you will not be forgotten.\xe2\x80\x9d If he is going to remain faithful to that vow then he is going to have to use this tragedy as an occasion to rethink our approach to global poverty. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to acknowledge a few difficult truths.'b'The first of those truths is that we don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to use aid to reduce poverty. Over the past few decades, the world has spent trillions of dollars to generate growth in the developing world. The countries that have not received much aid, like China, have seen tremendous growth and tremendous poverty reductions. The countries that have received aid, like Haiti, have not.'b'In the recent anthology \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Works in Development?,\xe2\x80\x9d a group of economists try to sort out what we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned. The picture is grim. There are no policy levers that consistently correlate to increased growth. There is nearly zero correlation between how a developing economy does one decade and how it does the next. There is no consistently proven way to reduce corruption. Even improving governing institutions doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to produce the expected results.'b'The chastened tone of these essays is captured by the economist Abhijit Banerjee: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not clear to us that the best way to get growth is to do growth policy of any form. Perhaps making growth happen is ultimately beyond our control.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The second hard truth is that micro-aid is vital but insufficient. Given the failures of macrodevelopment, aid organizations often focus on microprojects. More than 10,000 organizations perform missions of this sort in Haiti. By some estimates, Haiti has more nongovernmental organizations per capita than any other place on earth. They are doing the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s work, especially these days, but even a blizzard of these efforts does not seem to add up to comprehensive change.'b'Third, it is time to put the thorny issue of culture at the center of efforts to tackle global poverty. Why is Haiti so poor? Well, it has a history of oppression, slavery and colonialism. But so does Barbados, and Barbados is doing pretty well. Haiti has endured ruthless dictators, corruption and foreign invasions. But so has the Dominican Republic, and the D.R. is in much better shape. Haiti and the Dominican Republic share the same island and the same basic environment, yet the border between the two societies offers one of the starkest contrasts on earth \xe2\x80\x94 with trees and progress on one side, and deforestation and poverty and early death on the other.'b'As Lawrence E. Harrison explained in his book \xe2\x80\x9cThe Central Liberal Truth,\xe2\x80\x9d Haiti, like most of the world\xe2\x80\x99s poorest nations, suffers from a complex web of progress-resistant cultural influences. There is the influence of the voodoo religion, which spreads the message that life is capricious and planning futile. There are high levels of social mistrust. Responsibility is often not internalized. Child-rearing practices often involve neglect in the early years and harsh retribution when kids hit 9 or 10.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re all supposed to politely respect each other\xe2\x80\x99s cultures. But some cultures are more progress-resistant than others, and a horrible tragedy was just exacerbated by one of them.'b'Fourth, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to promote locally led paternalism. In this country, we first tried to tackle poverty by throwing money at it, just as we did abroad. Then we tried microcommunity efforts, just as we did abroad. But the programs that really work involve intrusive paternalism.'b'These programs, like the Harlem Children\xe2\x80\x99s Zone and the No Excuses schools, are led by people who figure they don\xe2\x80\x99t understand all the factors that have contributed to poverty, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t care. They are going to replace parts of the local culture with a highly demanding, highly intensive culture of achievement \xe2\x80\x94 involving everything from new child-rearing practices to stricter schools to better job performance.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s time to take that approach abroad, too. It\xe2\x80\x99s time to find self-confident local leaders who will create No Excuses countercultures in places like Haiti, surrounding people \xe2\x80\x94 maybe just in a neighborhood or a school \xe2\x80\x94 with middle-class assumptions, an achievement ethos and tough, measurable demands.'b'The late political scientist Samuel P. Huntington used to acknowledge that cultural change is hard, but cultures do change after major traumas. This earthquake is certainly a trauma. The only question is whether the outside world continues with the same old, same old.'b'Maybe bankers do know a little bit about shame \xe2\x80\x94 or at least about public opinion polls.'b'Their objections have been muted to President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s decision to impose a fee on the country\xe2\x80\x99s largest banks, insurance companies and broker-dealers to recover some of the money spent bailing them out. And they are so panicked by talk in Congress about taxing their enormous bonuses (the industry is expected to reward itself with tens of billions of dollars this year) that they have decided not to take all of that money in cash.'b'Banks, instead, are bending over backward to ensure their windfalls fit the prescriptions of Kenneth Feinberg, the White House pay czar. The government\xe2\x80\x99s goal is to reduce incentives to reckless risk-taking. The bankers clearly just want to get the money any way they can.'b'JPMorgan Chase is scheduled to be the first to report its bonuses on Friday, and other big banks will be following suit beginning next week. Some are forcing their highest-performing executives to accept only stock shares. Others are conditioning payouts to future performance criteria. This is all good for the stability of the banking system \xe2\x80\x94 where pay has typically been rigged to encourage high-risk, fast-reward schemes that paid bankers handsomely, regardless of the long-term performance of their investments.'b'It is unlikely to quell the furies on Capitol Hill, where House Democrats on Thursday proposed imposing a 50 percent windfall tax on bankers\xe2\x80\x99 bonuses. And it is unlikely to satisfy taxpayers. It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'For the sake of fairness, Congress should pass a one-off windfall tax on bonuses. After all, what profits the banks had in 2009 were largely underwritten by taxpayers, who pumped in billions of dollars of capital, covered losses from the collapse of the American International Group and guaranteed the debts of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Federal Reserve lent hundreds of billions against shoddy collateral that no one else would touch and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation guaranteed loans worth hundreds of billions more.'b'And for the sake of long-term financial stability, Congress should also pass President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s proposed big bank fee \xe2\x80\x94 intended to recover, over 12 years, the $117 billion that the administration estimates it will spend on financial bailouts. That should discourage banks that are already too big from getting even bigger and posing a larger threat to the overall economy.'b'Goldman Sachs, where compensation for 2009 is expected to near the record $20.2 billion it paid out in 2007, has said its top 30 executives will receive their entire bonuses in stock that cannot be sold for five years. It has assured regulators that cash will make up only a small share of bonuses for executives further down the ranks.'b'Others are said to be reducing the size of their bonus pools. Morgan Stanley is reportedly conditioning the payout of bonuses to meeting a set of criteria for future performance. Bank of America plans to pay part of bonuses in some sort of chit that would fluctuate in value according to the company\xe2\x80\x99s performance.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s better than how the game has been played. But we would find it more persuasive if the boards of the banks disclosed clear guidelines on how performance-related bonuses are determined. And we would like to see clear clawback provisions to recoup bonuses if the investments they were based on tank in the future.'b'Ideally, these provisions would be part of the reform of financial regulation winding its way too slowly through Congress. Congress should strengthen that legislation, and it should require the banks and bankers to send more money back to the public coffers from whence it came.'b''b"Editor's Note, Jan. 15, 2010: "b''b'In a 'b' statement today'b', Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced that Haitians in the United States as of Jan. 12, the day of the earthquake, could apply for temporary protected status.'b''b'President Obama made a promise to the people of Haiti on Thursday. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will not be forsaken,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will not be forgotten.\xe2\x80\x9d He said those words at the end of a short White House speech detailing the many ways the United States was rushing food, water, medicine and other aid to that stricken country.'b'We wish he had added that his administration had found the courage, in this emergency, to take a basic but politically difficult step \xe2\x80\x94 to grant temporary protected status to undocumented Haitians in the United States.'b'The Department of Homeland Security occasionally grants such status to immigrants stranded in this country by war, famine, earthquake or some other disaster back home. Protected immigrants are allowed to work legally and cannot be detained or deported. It\xe2\x80\x99s a temporary amnesty, given in 18-month increments to those who qualify, and is currently available to citizens of El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Somalia and Sudan.'b'Earthquakes and hurricanes have routinely prompted the United States to grant and extend protected status to Central Americans. Similar pleas by Haitians have always been rebuffed, even after a devastating series of storms in 2008 left hundreds of thousands homeless.'b'Advocates for Haitian immigrants, whose diaspora is centered in Miami, have waged a long and fruitless campaign for protected status, arguing that remittances by Haitians in the United States are a vital source of aid \xe2\x80\x94 more than $1 billion each year. Now that Haiti has suffered its worst disaster in centuries, the argument for a temporary amnesty is overwhelming.'b'It was not enough for the administration to announce this week that the Department of Homeland Security would halt the pending deportations of the 30,000 or so undocumented Haitians. Burdening a collapsed country with destitute deportees would be a true crime. But all that does is leave the potential deportees in limbo, unable to work without fear.'b'Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s earthquake has caused a global outpouring of giving. But that will inevitably subside as fatigue sets in and new crises arise. What will help keep Haiti going for the long haul is Haitians helping Haitians. The Obama administration should give undocumented Haitians in the United States the simple thing they desperately want: not charity, but the chance to work.'b'The Justice Department needs to act swiftly and decisively to protect young people who are being battered and raped in juvenile corrections facilities all across the country. A shocking new study by the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau of Justice Statistics surveyed more than 9,000 young people in custody and found that 12 percent reported being sexually abused one or more times, mainly by staff members.'b'Particularly alarming, the study found several juvenile facilities where 30 percent or more of the young people reported being raped. Some of the institutions with high rates of victimization were in Indiana, Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Texas.'b'These latest findings are consistent with those reported in June by a federal commission created by Congress under the 2003 Prison Rape Elimination Act. The commission, which examined the problem for five years, also outlined a list of sensible policy changes, which the Justice Department has the power to make mandatory for all corrections institutions that accept federal money.'b'The commission said that corrections facilities must make it easier for victims to report abuse without fear of reprisal and promptly and thoroughly investigate all rape claims. It said that prison employees must be better screened before they are hired, and they must be better trained in how to deal with vulnerable young people.'b'The commission also called on state corrections agencies to develop written zero-tolerance rules for employees of adult and juvenile facilities \xe2\x80\x94 and write those rules into union contracts. Employees must be put on notice that they will be held accountable if they participate in sexual assaults or look the other way when they occur.'b'The 2003 law gave the United States attorney general until June of this year to evaluate the commission\xe2\x80\x99s findings and issue new rape-prevention standards. But juvenile justice advocates worry that the Justice Department will allow state corrections officials to water down those requirements, partly by arguing that they will be too expensive to implement. The department should not allow that to happen. If it does, Congress will have to strengthen the legislation. Zero tolerance for abuse in prisons or juvenile facilities must be the law of the land.'b'Pretty much everyone knows by now that the New York State Legislature is corrupt and dysfunctional. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t end there. It seems every week that New Yorkers learn about another state legislator who has brought shame to the state \xe2\x80\x94 or worse. (Let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget the felony convictions only last month of Joseph Bruno, the former Republican leader.)'b'Now a bipartisan group of senators is calling for the expulsion of Senator Hiram Monserrate, a Queens Democrat, after he was convicted last year of violently assaulting his girlfriend. Despite Mr. Monserrate\xe2\x80\x99s protest that \xe2\x80\x9cI answer to my constituents,\xe2\x80\x9d the entire Senate should get rid of him as quickly as possible. And, this week, Attorney General Andrew Cuomo revealed the first details of his long investigation of State Senator Pedro Espada Jr. of the Bronx.'b'Mr. Espada\xe2\x80\x99s behavior appears to be a particularly disturbing example of the dirty way Albany conducts its business \xe2\x80\x94 and how a powerful legislator might get away with it for far too long.'b'The filing by Mr. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s office is technically a demand for documents subpoenaed in August. It alleges that Mr. Espada violated a number of laws by siphoning off funds from the nonprofit and tax-exempt health clinics that he runs in his \xe2\x80\x9cprivate\xe2\x80\x9d life. The court papers claim evidence of potential fraud, violations of state election law, plus a whole string of other possible violations.'b'Mr. Espada\xe2\x80\x99s reaction was anything but remorseful. He accused Mr. Cuomo of \xe2\x80\x9cconducting a witch hunt\xe2\x80\x9d and of using him, a top Hispanic official, as a \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical pi\xc3\xb1ata.\xe2\x80\x9d In reality, Mr. Espada has failed for years to report campaign contributions and refused to settle questions about whether he actually resides in his own district.'b'Senators Espada and Monserrate stunned fellow Democrats last June by moving to the Republican side of the Senate, a shift that triggered a legislative stalemate for more than a month. As a reward, Republicans elevated Mr. Espada to the post of Senate president, which made him next in line to take over the state if anything happened to Gov. David Paterson.

It crawled and shivered, stretched and quaked. It was the thin, wrinkled skin of an A.D.D. planet, whose muscles and bones constantly twitched beneath it.'b'In California \xe2\x80\x94 as opposed to the relatively placid terrain of Wisconsin, where I now live \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to miss that reality. The great San Andreas fault, where the Pacific and North American plates meet, slowly rumbles its way along the western edge of the state. The fault slides and catches, builds up pressure and then releases that pressure along smaller adjacent faults. Residents and scientists alike play a waiting game in California, uneasily trying to foretell when the big fault itself will go, setting off another geologic convulsion like the one that destroyed San Francisco in 1906.'b'At one meeting of seismologists I attended, the organizers strung a banner across the front of the conference room with a quotation attributed to the historian Will Durant: \xe2\x80\x9cCivilization exists by geological consent, subject to change without notice.\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked that line \xe2\x80\x94 its rebuttal of our natural hubris, our assumption that we inevitably lord over this small sphere in one of our galaxy\xe2\x80\x99s lesser solar systems.'b'Durant, writing with his wife, Ariel, came back to this point again in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lessons of History,\xe2\x80\x9d drawing this time on a Biblical analogy: \xe2\x80\x9cTo the geologic eye all the surface of the earth is a fluid form, and man moves upon it as insecurely as Peter walking on the waves to Christ.\xe2\x80\x9d Again, the Durants hit the right note because a crushing earthquake \xe2\x80\x94 like the one that devastated Haiti on Tuesday \xe2\x80\x94 brings with it a Biblical, a Homeric,  epic sense of the world gone wrong.'b'Surely, you think, we should be able to rely on rock. A country like Haiti, already battered enough by circumstance, should be able to find safety in solid ground. Somehow it should be so, even though our planet proves that wrong again and again. Remember the 2008 earthquake in Sichuan Province in China, which left more than 88,000 people dead or missing? The Indonesian earthquake of 2006, which killed more than 6,000 people?'b'Haiti is situated along a strike-slip fault between two great plates of the earth\xe2\x80\x99s crust, just like the San Andreas of California. The word fault does not imply a mistake. Nor does it suggest a stationary crack in the earth\xe2\x80\x99s crust. In geology, the word \xe2\x80\x9cfault\xe2\x80\x9d implies motion. Beneath the thin outer skin on which we stake our lives, our planet flexes its muscles. The hot magma that lies below, the liquid minerals and metals that swirl around the earth\xe2\x80\x99s core, conspire to keep the surface moving. The crustal plates, which cover the planet\xe2\x80\x99s surface like a great rocky jigsaw puzzle, push against, under and over one another. All with the slowness, and the inevitability, of geologic time.'b'The great continental and oceanic plates of crust are always moving, rubbing, rearranging the bedrock of our lives. The motion is too slow to catch our attention except when it becomes erratic. Strike-slip faults tend to get stuck as they slide against each other, one jagged section catching on another. They grind slowly onward though, moved relentlessly by that underground current, eventually breaking the hold, setting off the reverberations of a quake. It\xe2\x80\x99s been more than 100 years since the San Andreas broke in a spectacular way, more than 200 since the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden Fault, the one adjacent to Haiti, did so. It takes time for even the earth to build up to a catastrophe.'b'Although we have used that time to learn the mechanics of earthquakes, we are still a long way from being able to predict them. The territory is too large, the hidden influences buried too deep. The United States Geological Survey, for instance, has long focused prediction research on an earthquake-prone section of the San Andreas, 'b'near the central California town of Parkfield'b'. From 1857 to 1966, moderate earthquakes rattled Parkfield every 20 to 30 years. The survey forecast the next to occur before 1993. It came in 2004, a tremor registering 6.0. Geologists have been watching the fault region for 25 years now. More than 175 papers have been published on observations at Parkfield. When I read through them, they seem to all reach the same conclusion: we live on a very tricky planet, unstable, restless and, yes, still unpredictable.'b'But they also offer insights into the subterranean world that \xe2\x80\x94 we hope \xe2\x80\x94 will move us a little closer to predicting danger. We do know how to engineer buildings with a greater degree of earthquake safety. But that takes money, commitment and a rigorous standard of government regulation and inspection. It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprising that a state like California has imposed safety measures while Haiti, long an impoverished and disorganized country, has struggled. I\xe2\x80\x99m always heartened by international rescue efforts, like those in Haiti at the moment. But it would be even better if they were less necessary. Eventually, I hope, we will figure out a way to build an international coalition on building standards with some money behind it, able to invest in proactive safety measures.'b'After all, we\xe2\x80\x99re together here, all of us clinging to the skin of this perilously active planet. At our best, we confront the risks as a global community. As Will Durant also pointed out, \xe2\x80\x9cMan, not the earth, makes civilization.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I have often accused Sarah Palin of having more fight than strategy in her.

The timing is impeccable.'b'There is now a bubbling discontent on the right and, in particular, among whites, which is aimed at President Obama.'b'According to an analysis of New York Times and CBS News polls, Obama has the lowest approval rating among whites at the end of his first year in office than any president in the 30 years that The Times and CBS News  have collected such data. And the gap between Obama and the others is significant, ranging from 10 to 36 percentage points.'b'Furthermore, a Quinnipiac University poll, 'b'released on Wednesday'b', found that most whites think that Obama\xe2\x80\x99s first year as president has been mainly a failure. A plurality of whites even said that Obama has been a worse president than George W. Bush.'b'If indeed being Negro-lite made Obama palatable to white voters, as Senator Harry Reid was spanked for saying, that charm has worn off.

For an image of what this looks like, simply recall her rallies from the previous election.'b'(For the record, according to the Nielsen Company, more than 95 percent of the viewers of the Fox News Channel are white.)'b'This move could put Palin in a much better position to become the Republican nominee. The race for the nomination may not be given to the slick or to the strong, but to this fame monster who seems to have the stamina to endure until the end. (Sigh.)'b'The agreement between the White House, Congressional leaders and labor unions over taxing high-priced health insurance policies is a reasonable solution to an issue that was threatening to derail health care reform. The agreement treats unionized workers far more favorably than nonunion workers, the price for the support of important Democratic constituencies. But it would preserve the tax\xe2\x80\x99s crucial role in slowing the rise in health care costs for decades to come.'b'When the Senate voted for the tax on high-priced employer-sponsored health insurance policies \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cCadillac plans\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 labor leaders and many House Democrats complained that the tax would penalize middle-class people who had plans that were hardly lavish. They much preferred the House approach: a so-called millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s tax, a surcharge on earnings above $1 million a year for couples.'b'A millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s tax may not survive the negotiations on a final bill, but Congress has to find money to pay for health insurance for millions of Americans. The agreement makes that more difficult because it is expected to reduce the money generated by the excise tax substantially from the original Senate bill. Rich Americans and the industries involved in health care should pick up much of the added burden.'b'The proposed excise tax on high-cost plans is the most significant measure in either bill to slow the relentless rise in health care spending.'b''b'HOW IT WORKS 'b'Many employers pay most of the premium for health coverage. Workers pick up the rest but pay no taxes on the employer\xe2\x80\x99s often-substantial contribution. That\xe2\x80\x99s why many unions have bargained hard for generous health coverage over the years, even if that meant forgoing a bigger pay raise.'b'The new agreement would take away the tax advantage for a small portion of the health benefit by imposing a 40 percent tax on the amount by which the premiums for employer-sponsored health coverage exceed specified thresholds. That would be $24,000 a year for a family, starting in 2013. The tax on a $26,000 plan would be $800, or 40 percent of $2,000. The insurance company would pay the tax but would almost certainly pass it along to the employer and its employees.'b'That $24,000 threshold, which was raised by $1,000 from the original Senate proposal, is well above the current average of $13,400 for a family plan. By 2013, more than 90 percent of all family plans are projected to still fall below the threshold. In the following years, the tax threshold would rise more slowly than the likely rate of inflation in medical costs, which could mean the plans of millions of workers \xe2\x80\x94 a small minority of the work force \xe2\x80\x94 would be subject to the tax in theory.'b'Most likely, insurers will drop their premiums just below the threshold. They could do that by setting higher deductibles and co-payments, managing access to care more tightly, or reducing benefits.'b''b'WHY IT\xe2\x80\x99S GOOD 'b' A vast majority of economists agree that the tax would be a valuable cost-control feature. In our largely fee-for-service system, doctors have an economic incentive to provide more services. With insurance covering most of the bill, neither patients nor doctors worry much about costs. Requiring workers to pay more out of pocket would force them and their doctors to think a lot more carefully about whether an expensive test or treatment is really necessary.'b'Because the excise tax would be imposed on insurance companies within the health care system, the revenues it generates would grow at the rate of medical inflation; revenues from an income tax on the wealthy would probably grow more slowly.'b''b'POTENTIAL HARM 'b'There is some risk \xe2\x80\x94 nobody knows how large \xe2\x80\x94 that higher deductibles and co-payments would discourage some people, especially the chronically ill, from seeking medical care that they need. Congress can avoid this tragic outcome by setting up a monitoring system to detect any emergence of harm and making a midcourse correction to protect the health of any groups that suffer adverse consequences.'b''b'WILL EMPLOYEES RECOUP? 'b'Eminent economists \xe2\x80\x94 and the official scorers at the Joint Committee on Taxation \xe2\x80\x94 believe that as employers spend less on health benefits they will increase wages to continue to attract high-quality workers. Indeed, most of the money the tax is projected to generate would come from an anticipated increase in wages, rather than the tax itself. The theory is that employers don\xe2\x80\x99t care much whether they provide compensation in the form of health benefits or wages.'b'There is reason to worry that in a troubled economy, with unemployment high and employers scrambling to reduce costs, employers will simply pocket the savings. The new agreement protects unionized workers and state and local government employees by exempting their health plans from the tax for five years, until 2018. That gives the unions plenty of time \xe2\x80\x94 probably more time than justified \xe2\x80\x94 to negotiate new contracts and demand a rise in wages commensurate with any decline in health benefits.'b'The much larger number of nonunion workers would get no comparable protection. In fashioning a final bill, Congress should seek some way to pressure companies to convert their savings on health benefits into higher wages and monitor whether they do so.'b''b'MORE SENSIBLE TARGETING 'b'Many of the policies described as Cadillac plans are not costly because they provide lavish benefits but rather because they cover workers who are older and sicker than most, or who work in high-cost areas or in high-risk industries.'b'The agreement would raise the thresholds for plans covering workers who are disproportionately old or female or employed in a wide range of high-risk jobs. There would be a transition period for states where medical costs are high. These look like reasonable exceptions to ensure that the tax falls on truly generous plans.'b'A vast majority of workers would not be affected by the proposed excise tax. Those that are hit should remember that the bulk of their health benefits would remain exempt from taxes \xe2\x80\x94 an enormous subsidy from the taxpayer. For the sake of reining in costs and helping to pay for covering the uninsured, taxing high-priced plans is the right thing to do.'b'\xc2\x95'b''b'This editorial is a part of a comprehensive examination of the debate over health care reform.

If the Democrats were any more energized, they would be jumping off a cliff.'b'The best news for the Coakley campaign may have been the arrival of Rudy Giuliani to stump with her opponent, Scott Brown. Even back in the days when he was popular, Giuliani\xe2\x80\x99s endorsement was the kiss of death.'b'And the new decade is beginning badly in Rudyland.

(Safir says he didn\xe2\x80\x99t see her.) He is not to be confused with Bernie Kerik, the Giuliani police commissioner who is already in jail.'b'And Giuliani is not so great on the message front these days. Lately, he\xe2\x80\x99s busy trying to explain his recent appearance on television, when he became so engaged in trashing Obama that he said there were never any domestic terror attacks under former President George W.

There\xe2\x80\x99s a third-party candidate in the race named Joseph Kennedy, or as he is referred to in shorthand, No Relation To.

Or perhaps it will be a reminder that in the past, voters once inadvertently elected an assembly-line worker named John Kennedy to be state treasurer.'b'We seem to be living in a time of intense but inchoate communication. What better symbol than the official joining of Sarah Palin and Fox News? This week, Fox\xe2\x80\x99s new commentator got a typical welcome for a serious journalistic enterprise.

Perhaps people are sending a message that they are getting tired of being polled. There are certainly a heck of a lot of surveyors out there trawling for opinions. Just this week I got a press release announcing that 74 percent of Americans polled felt that Brit Hume urging Tiger Woods to convert to Christianity probably would not work.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear that no matter what happens, the voters are sending a message that they are in a bad mood. You cannot fail to notice that people are ticked off. The economy feels awful. The weather feels awful. Did you know that the cold snap in Florida hit the people who breed tropical fish so hard that there is a national guppy shortage? Things are bad, bad, bad.'b'If Coakley loses, the inevitable conclusion will be that the message was a repudiation of Obama. My own theory is that the national angst is causing people to ignore the issues and just react to candidates\xe2\x80\x99 personalities.'b'If forced to choose a Senate candidate to be stranded with on a desert island, most voters would probably pick Brown over Coakley. Possibly even if the question was who they wanted to sit next to on a short bus ride.'b'But didn\xe2\x80\x99t we get over the idea of voting for the person you\xe2\x80\x99d most like to have a beer with after George W.

It\xe2\x80\x99s a place where heartbreak never seems to end.'b'One evening many years ago, when I was on assignment in Haiti for The Daily News, a man took me to the back of a pickup truck and pointed to his two small children. It was obvious they were ill. Both were shivering, although the evening was quite warm.'b'The man pleaded with me to take the youngsters and smuggle them into the United States. \xe2\x80\x9cThey will die here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, whereas in America they would be safe and \xe2\x80\x9cgrow strong.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I tried to explain why that was impossible, that I could not take his children.

On Tuesday, it was an earthquake that crushed the capital city of Port-au-Prince and much of its surroundings and raised the level of suffering and death to heights that defied comprehension.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe world is coming to an end,\xe2\x80\x9d cried a woman in the midst of the carnage.'b'Pooja Bhatia, a journalist who lives in Haiti, told The Times, \xe2\x80\x9cI was here during the 2008 hurricanes that left thousands dead, and thousands and thousands homeless, and that felt like the apocalypse.

No matter how overwhelming the tragedy, how bleak the outlook, no matter what malevolent forces the fates see fit to hurl at this tiny, beleaguered, mountainous, sun-splashed portion of the planet, there is no quit in the Haitian people.'b'They rose up against the French and defeated the forces of Napoleon to become the only nation to grow out of a slave revolt. They rose up against the despotic Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier and sent him packing. Despite ruthless exploitation by more powerful nations, including the United States, and many long years of crippling civil strife, corruption, terror and chronic poverty, the Haitian people have endured.'b'They will not be defeated by this earthquake.'b'I spoke on Friday with Ruthzee Louijeune, who works at the Posse Foundation here in New York and had waited like so many others for word about her extended family in Haiti. Eventually, she learned that her uncle, 43-year-old Michelet Philippe, had been killed and that several relatives, including her grandparents, were living in a car in Port-au-Prince.'b'She wept as she talked. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re grateful that we have a body to bury,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo many people don\xe2\x80\x99t even have that. But right now there is no transportation to take him back to the village where he is from, so they are looking for a respectable place to bury him. It\xe2\x80\x99s so hard. He had a wife and three children.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But even in her grief, Ms. Louijeune spoke forcefully about the resilience of her family and what she referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cher people.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy family always taught me to be proud of Haiti,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever anybody else might say about it. They taught me to read on my own and to learn the true history of the country. We\xe2\x80\x99re strong, and despite the hunger, despite the poverty, despite all the problems, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make it through.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If there is any upside to such an enormous tragedy, it is to be found in the spirit of the people clawing, in some cases with their bare and bleeding hands, through concrete and filth and metal to comfort and rescue survivors and reclaim the dead. And it\xe2\x80\x99s to be found in the powerfully humane way in which so many people, in Haiti and outside of the country, have responded to this shattering disaster  \xe2\x80\x94  spontaneously, generously and in many, many cases, heroically.'b'There are no satisfactory explanations for why this kind of event should have occurred. But we can control the way we respond. Faulkner tells us: \xe2\x80\x9cI believe that man will not merely endure, he will prevail. He is immortal, not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the darkest of moments, Plutarch is also a comfort. \xe2\x80\x9cGood fortune,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwill elevate even petty minds, and give them the appearance of a certain greatness and stateliness, as from their high place they look down upon the world; but the truly noble and resolved spirit raises itself, and becomes more conspicuous in times of disaster and ill fortune.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'TO those of us who have seen all of Eric Rohmer\xe2\x80\x99s films it is impossible not to remember when, where, with whom we saw each one. I even remember the second and third time I saw his films. \xe2\x80\x9cMy Night at Maud\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cClaire\xe2\x80\x99s Knee,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cChloe in the Afternoon\xe2\x80\x9d are grafted onto my life. Something happened between me and these films at the Thalia, at the Brattle, at the old Cin\xc3\xa9math\xc3\xa8que, or at the old Olympia Theater on the Upper West Side. But I can no longer isolate what that something is. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even care to know what was exclusively Eric Rohmer\xe2\x80\x99s and what was mine, what he was ever so cautious to convey and what I most likely misunderstood completely. The mix, as sometimes happens, becomes the work of art.'b'But then with Mr. Rohmer, who died this week at the age of 89, the mix is not incidental; it is essential. To see an Eric Rohmer film is not to escape from the drudgery of our daily lives; it is to sit quietly and have someone show us lives that are not entirely different from ours but different enough, situations we\xe2\x80\x99ve all been in and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait to get out of but could have learned from, if only we\xe2\x80\x99d had the patience and the courage to sit through them.'b'Mr. Rohmer was the master of tact \xe2\x80\x94 tact in the way his characters behave with one another, tact in the way he himself, as a director, spun his tales, and ultimately tact with truth and fiction. In his hands, sex could be suspended, and passion, without ever boiling over, seldom went cold.'b'I can\xe2\x80\x99t forget the scene in \xe2\x80\x9cMy Night at Maud\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d when the very pious engineer in the business suit decides to sit on Maud\xe2\x80\x99s bed while she is lying under the covers with only a T-shirt on, determined to seduce him. They stare at each other, and they talk, and she tells him things, and he tells her things, and still they talk, and it\xe2\x80\x99s clear to everyone, including the characters themselves, that though this strange couple has just met hours earlier and may not share a sliver of love between them, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve just witnessed is one of the most intimate scenes in movie history.'b'It is impossible to watch this scene or certain moments in \xe2\x80\x9cTale of Autumn,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cA Good Marriage\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cFull Moon in Paris\xe2\x80\x9d and not envy the candor of Eric Rohmer\xe2\x80\x99s men and women, their impulse to dissect each nuance of desire and then turn around and confide it right away to those who\xe2\x80\x99d aroused them.'b'With my friends we used to call these situations Rohmerian. You meet A, you are drawn to A, but neither you nor A wish to rush things. You simply want to stop time a bit, and because neither of you cares to hide what you\xe2\x80\x99re really doing, you decide to confess your maneuvers and are wildly grateful when told they were by no means unknown to the other. Rohmerian. What comes after this is seldom the business of art; it is the stuff of humdrum prose.'b'Since his death, the usual clich\xc3\xa9s about Eric Rohmer are once again pullulating on the Internet. He was talky. He was a mannerist. He was a classicist. Eric Rohmer \xe2\x80\x94 whose men are more into themselves than the women they are allegedly trying to seduce. Eric Rohmer \xe2\x80\x94 whose films, in the words of the character played by Gene Hackman in \xe2\x80\x9cNight Moves,\xe2\x80\x9d are like \xe2\x80\x9cwatching paint dry.\xe2\x80\x9d Eric Rohmer \xe2\x80\x94 for whom courtship is a conceit for how people jockey into position vis-\xc3\xa0-vis the things they want and seldom believe they\xe2\x80\x99ll get.'b'What the commentary has missed is that Eric Rohmer was above all things a \xe2\x80\x9cmoraliste.\xe2\x80\x9d The word is difficult to translate. All the men in his \xe2\x80\x9cSix Moral Tales\xe2\x80\x9d are either married or engaged to be married but, through a series of accidents, find themselves tempted to betray their beloveds. Each therefore is faced with a \xe2\x80\x9cmoral\xe2\x80\x9d quandary.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s worth remembering that Mr. Rohmer was playing with words, using the word \xe2\x80\x9cmoral\xe2\x80\x9d in a way that harks back to the French Moralists of the 17th century. Despite their emphasis on morality, men like Pascal, La Rochefoucauld and La Bruy\xc3\xa8re were urbane and disabused analysts of manners, mores and the human psyche. They were perpetually on the lookout for every insidious motivation in others and every instance of self-delusion in themselves. In the hands of a moralist, even sex becomes a conceit.'b'For all their self-analysis, Eric Rohmer\xe2\x80\x99s men and women are not as penetrating as they wish to be. No one is evil, no one is too good either, and no one suffers, or at least not for long. They all muddle through courtship, never get their hands dirty; and the hard truths they must face are always given obliquely enough and never hurt. There are ugly facts enough on the outside.'b'With Eric Rohmer, as with Mozart, Austen, James and Proust, we need to remember that art is seldom about life, or not quite about life. Art is about discovery and design and reasoning with chaos. If there is one thing I will miss with Eric Rohmer\xe2\x80\x99s death, it is the clarity, the candor and the pleasure with which one human can sit with another and reason about love and not forget, in Pascal\xe2\x80\x99s words, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe heart has reasons that reason knows nothing of.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When I drive from New York to California, as I did again last week, I always hope I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get a kind of backyard view of the present-day United States. But what I discover is that I\xe2\x80\x99m driving through the past. The road west is littered with the bones of old vehicles, taunting me in their rusted glory from just beyond the fence-line. Every echo of Route 66 is a reminder of a time when the highway was a trail of automotive woe, of engine failures and bad rubber, of drivers on bended knee in front of a jack.'b'This drive was entirely without incident \xe2\x80\x94 2,976 miles in four days, from my farm in upstate New York to the eastern edge of Los Angeles County. And yet all the way I kept expecting the car to act up. On a bitterly cold morning in Grove City, Ohio, I turned the key, ready to hear a moan from the engine. It fired right up, of course. There were no flats and there was not a mutter of perturbation from the muffler. An alarm light did come on once, but that was only because the other driver \xe2\x80\x94 a farming friend who needed a break from the pigs \xe2\x80\x94 pushed the wrong button while adjusting the mirrors.'b'The reason I always expect trouble is my father\xe2\x80\x99s cars. They were like horses that traveled well for him but always came up lame for his children. It bred chronic distrust. I learned to think of a car \xe2\x80\x94 my dad\xe2\x80\x99s especially \xe2\x80\x94 as a way of getting from one breakdown to the next and meeting unexpected strangers. Driving a nearly new car across the country felt like a mean but somehow gloating rejection of adventure.'b'The curious part is that as cars have become more and more sealed off in their technological dependability, they\xe2\x80\x99ve also become more porous. It was no trouble, using G.P.S. and our smartphones, to find Ingrid\xe2\x80\x99s Kitchen in Oklahoma City or Lumpy\xe2\x80\x99s in Joplin, Mo., or Taqueria Mexico in Albuquerque. I began, in fact, to glimpse a new geography. All those towering fast food signs clustered at freeway exits began to look like signs of paranoia as well as convenience \xe2\x80\x94 a warning against getting too far off the track. But information doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cluster at the exits \xe2\x80\x94 it takes you wherever you think you want to go.'b'And so, after four days, we came across Arizona and alongside the Mojave and over Cajon Pass to the high, whining, gospel yelp of Bill Monroe. Somehow that Joad-like music seemed just right, though we never found ourselves searching for radiator water or camping in the ditches or cursing the foul machine that carried us west.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s obvious  that many of the buildings that collapsed during the Haitian earthquake  were poorly designed or constructed. In Haiti, because there is virtually no lumber for building, structures have been made of concrete blocks, often with  inadequately reinforced concrete frames. But to suggest that the country simply be rebuilt to a technically higher standard is to take a shortsighted approach.'b'An internationally financed rebuilding effort, involving scores of architects and engineers drafted  to work with the Haitian authorities, should take a longer view of Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s future, supporting a gradual, profoundly well-thought-out physical transformation. Their work will demand determined physical reinvention and, where appropriate, architectural innovation.'b'Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s government had already begun considering new planning and building codes. It\xe2\x80\x99s still crucial to finish that job, to establish standards that not only reduce the risk that structures will collapse  in hurricanes and earthquakes but also help Haiti build for the future. But this isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a question of better-quality steel and concrete; it\xe2\x80\x99s also about choosing where not to build. Far too many buildings in Haiti have stood on deforested, unstable hillsides, and new building strategies must dovetail with environmental repair schemes.'b'Furthermore, the urge to rebuild rapidly should be tempered by a  thorough examination of new designs for safer, more energy-efficient and less expensive structures. (Keep in mind that the cost of construction relative to income in Haiti is at least five times greater than it is in the United States.) For architects and engineers from Haiti and overseas, that\xe2\x80\x99s a huge responsibility.'b'In few places can the usually glib phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdesign for life\xe2\x80\x9d have greater meaning. Now, for the most awful and imperative reason imaginable, Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s government and its international supporters have the opportunity to turn stark devastation into the beginning of a new standard of living.'b''b'When the immediate crisis passes, how can we ensure that Haiti becomes a functioning nation? Eight experts give their prescriptions. 'b''b'There are about a billion squatters in the world today, and over time many have transformed their once-squalid communities into normal urban neighborhoods. In the awful aftermath of the tremor that turned hundreds of thousands of Haitians into refugees in their own hometown, a few sensible squatter principles may hold out hope for the devastated residents of Port-au-Prince:'b'\xc2\x95 Squatting is not a crime. Rather than being put in refugee camps, people can seize the initiative and squat in their old communities, without aid groups clamping down on them. This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean occupying unsafe houses, but erecting new shacks nearby. This way, families can share food, shelter and skills. And these nascent communities \xe2\x80\x94 self-organized and temporary at first \xe2\x80\x94 can serve  as the building blocks of new neighborhoods.'b'\xc2\x95 Scavenging is not wrong. In Mumbai, India, squatters build and rebuild their homes one wall at a time using materials that they find on the side of the road. Billboards, fence posts, bricks picked up from construction sites, scarred wooden panels: these are all incredibly valuable resources.'b'\xc2\x95 Not all theft is criminal. Looting is wrong, but lifting necessities like water or electricity is not. In Rio de Janeiro\xe2\x80\x99s favelas, squatters steal from the city\xe2\x80\x99s water mains and connect them directly to their homes using electric pumps (they pilfer the electricity, too) and long lines of plastic pipe. If any of Port-au-Prince\xe2\x80\x99s water system or electric grid has survived, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t people be allowed to tap into them?'b'\xc2\x95 Self-reliant networks are key. In the favelas, families will join to create a mutir\xc3\xa3o \xe2\x80\x94 mutual construction society \xe2\x80\x94 and build their homes together. In Kibera, the largest mud hut community in Nairobi, Kenya, women form \xe2\x80\x9cmerry-go-rounds\xe2\x80\x9d to pool their money. In Lagos, Nigeria, every illegal market has a self-governing association. In Istanbul, squatter communities have elected governments that establish planning and zoning principles. Local cooperative efforts like these can help make rebuilding and recovery possible in Haiti.'b'America\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to assist Haiti over the last 20 years were hobbled by bitter partisan division over Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the country\xe2\x80\x99s elected, deposed and then reinstalled president. Unfortunately, as the American debate over policy toward Haiti subsided with Mr. Aristide\xe2\x80\x99s final ouster in 2004, so did American interest.'b'The latest disaster to befall Haiti creates the opportunity to combine bipartisan accord on Haiti in Washington with keen and perhaps sustained American public interest. The first priorities must be food, water, medicine and shelter. The second is to   repair hospitals, schools, roads, electricity and telephone service and government buildings.'b'But these institutions should not be rebuilt on the old inefficient and corrupt foundations. This disaster is an opportunity to accelerate oft-delayed reforms in each of these sectors. The port of Port-au-Prince has, for instance, long had one of the highest costs per ton of shipping in the hemisphere, despite also having the lowest wages. Any aid that goes to rebuilding the port should be conditional on ending this grossly inefficient management and distorted cost structure.'b'Likewise, money for repairing the country\xe2\x80\x99s telecommunications system should be linked to breaking up or at least reorganizing the government-controlled telephone monopoly. The same goes with the Education Ministry, the electric company, the Health Ministry and the courts. Repair or replace the buildings, by all means, but also insist on fundamental reforms in their management.'b'The standard approach to residential redevelopment projects is to take ground zero as a starting point \xe2\x80\x94 even if it means creating it. This often translates into shifting people from substandard but incrementally developing environments into apartment blocks that cut them off from their social networks and livelihoods. These projects often become housing-centric and blind to the relationship between neighborhoods and economic development. They end up benefiting the construction industry much more than the population they are supposed to serve.'b'Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s shattered urban landscapes were about communities, street life, resourcefulness, aspirations and dynamic local exchanges. As we have seen in the Dharavi area of Mumbai (the setting of \xe2\x80\x9cSlumdog Millionaire\xe2\x80\x9d), poverty often generates creative responses and initiatives. Local actors tend to produce piecemeal development that directly supports neighborhood-level activity.'b'As we consider how to rebuild Port-au-Prince, we can find an alternative to the usual top-down redevelopment model in postwar Tokyo. The Japanese government didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the money to rebuild housing and so focused instead on roads, sewage and rail transportation. It also encouraged lenders to give families money to build homes. A decentralized and highly participatory urban redevelopment process produced areas of low-rise, high-density structures built with local skills and material. This not only strengthened communities but also stimulated the local economies. Tokyo today has a landscape that is futuristic and yet retains many traditional Asian urban features including street markets, small-scale businesses and family enterprises. The incremental redevelopment of Tokyo was thus intricately connected to the rise of its middle class.'b'If aid in Haiti aims specifically at regenerating local economies, if it promotes existing skills and collective initiatives, if it consults with grassroots groups and residents directly, it may well bring about a real transformation.'b'When  Columbus landed on Hispaniola in 1492, he marveled at the island\xe2\x80\x99s luxuriant, towering forests. Today, on the Haitian side of the island, only 2 percent of the forest cover remains. During storms, water rushes off barren hillsides, causing deadly mudslides, clogging streams with soil and sewage and disappearing before it can  replenish Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s diminishing groundwater reserves.'b'As a result, nearly half of all Haitians lack satisfactory access to clean drinking water, and more than two-thirds live without adequate sanitation. Water poverty is the main reason for Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s abysmal illness and early mortality rates.'b'Designing and building pipes and sewage systems  is the easiest part of solving a nation\xe2\x80\x99s water problem; maintenance is what is always frustratingly intractable. In Haiti, meter readers and water bill collectors are  often  assaulted when they try to do their jobs, and service has deteriorated.'b'In rebuilding Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s water systems, it is imperative to focus on simple and affordable local projects that communities can take responsibility for. The network of water and sewer pipes should be built with flexible materials that can be shallowly buried and easily repaired. Bulk sewer services and drinking water should be delivered at wholesale costs to distribution points in urban neighborhoods, where local leaders can handle payments for the service and maintain the local network.'b'Before the earthquake, Haiti was working to expand its already modestly successful water initiatives in rural areas, including the local management of simple well pumps. This work should be revived as soon as possible. Local water management both inside and outside the cities is a necessary condition for rebuilding all of Haiti.'b'The  United States has a vast bureaucracy to scrutinize how our government spends money abroad. While this kind of oversight is often necessary, there must be an exception made for crisis response in failed states.  I base this on  my experience after the Iraq invasion.'b'In June 2003, we learned that most of Baghdad\xe2\x80\x99s hospitals had no emergency generators. We needed 22 of them. Logistically, there was no problem \xe2\x80\x94  they could be shipped in within a week. But we were told by Washington that we would have to follow standard federal contracting and acquisition regulations, which meant a seven-month delay.'b'That September, the Iraqi Water Ministry was trying to cope with the devastation caused to Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s ancient irrigation canals in the breadbasket areas south of Baghdad. The minister told us that if he could have $20 million, he could hire Iraqis to clean up the canals with shovels, pitchforks and rakes, resolving a humanitarian crisis and creating thousands of jobs. The same day, the Coalition Provisional Authority allocated $20 million of Iraqi government money for the project.'b'Unfortunately, the inspector general for Iraq reconstruction in Washington later objected, in an official report,  because we had no way of tracking the money after it had been turned over to the Water Ministry. Merely to state this argument is to understand its absurdity. We would have had to install an army of American accountants to track every expense to its end recipient.'b'Today, Haiti faces a similar crisis. If we are going to have American military units deployed in Haiti \xe2\x80\x94 and we should \xe2\x80\x94 it would be invaluable for the unit commanders to have access to the Commanders\xe2\x80\x99 Emergency Response Fund that was established for Iraq. This is a discretionary fund that American officers can dip into for development projects and crisis response without constantly looking over their shoulders at monitors in Washington. Congress recently set aside an additional $1.3 billion for the program, which has been expanded to Afghanistan. It should be expanded to Haiti, too.'b'Coinciding with the one-year anniversary of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s unfulfilled pledge to close the American prison at Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay, the disaster  in Haiti suggests a new mission for the United States naval base, one that might burnish America\xe2\x80\x99s reputation in the world, if not redeem the base itself. Guant\xc3\xa1namo is just 200 miles from Port-au-Prince, only 50 miles farther than Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic, where American officials are staging earthquake recovery operations. Even as the United States works to close the prison, it should use the base for humanitarian intervention.'b'The base has two airfields, a state-of-the-art communication system and brand-new water and sewage lines that could accommodate as many as 45,000 refugees. And the base is large enough to stage an aid effort without impinging on prison operations.'b'Starting today, it might serve as a field hospital, a refugee camp or a depot for the distribution of food, medicine, clothing and other emergency supplies. It could also be a command-and-control center for the many aid groups now clogging Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s runways. Once the rescue mission is complete, Guant\xc3\xa1namo could continue to serve as the headquarters of what is sure to be an extended rebuilding effort in Port-au-Prince.'b'It would not be the first time that Guant\xc3\xa1namo served as a base for humanitarian relief in Haiti. In October 1935, after a hurricane brought deadly flooding to the country, washing away whole villages, the   Navy ship Woodcock set out from the base to deliver lumber, medicine, food, disinfectant and other necessities.'b'A re-imagined Guant\xc3\xa1namo could again be used to help relieve crises in the region, beginning with Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s earthquake recovery today.'b'The underground economy in places like Haiti is often viewed as a criminal sector, made up of thugs and warlords, that sets back economic growth. But this is a one-sided portrait. Informal trading may be critical for Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s recovery. Citizens in developing countries tend to find creative ways to make ends meet. The sharing of tools and workspaces, collective ownership of property, revolving credit associations and barter systems  make up the backbone of the economy.'b'New customs emerge to settle disputes and enforce contracts. Anyone might be a banker one day (lending small sums of money to others) and a policeman the next (resolving a disagreement between two local traders). This exchange system also brings together diverse groups who learn to interact across religious, ethnic, tribal and other social divides.'b'During disasters, however, things can turn for the worse, and those with force can take over. Countries now aiding Haiti should  ensure that organized crime doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take control of local economies. But they must be careful not to drum out the positives of informal development.'b'Haitians could benefit from outsiders who help them rebuild the ad hoc relationships that have engendered trust and cooperation. Nongovernmental groups could aid the creation of cooperatives that can be brought into decisions about the distribution of food, medical care and housing in their neighborhoods. We can take a cue from the Grameen \xe2\x80\x9cmicrobank\xe2\x80\x9d in South Asia by identifying informal economic leaders with the legitimacy to mobilize others, spread information and coordinate rebuilding efforts.'b'SAN FRANCISCO'b'It has been quite a journey for Ted Olson. He\xe2\x80\x99s gone from being the conservative lawyer who helped crown W. by winning the Bush v. Gore case before the Supreme Court, to being a lesbian.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMaureen,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me in his gravelly voice, \xe2\x80\x9cone of the biggest lesbian groups in this country told me I\xe2\x80\x99m already an honorary lesbian.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Did it make you feel different, I wondered.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI still like women very much,\xe2\x80\x9d he wryly replied, as his biking pal, liberal adversary and now co-counsel David Boies laughed, snacking on a crust of sourdough bread in their temporary office on Mission Street.'b'In 2000, Olson and Boies sparred with each other in Washington over which candidate would marry the country. Now they have joined forces here to spar with Prop 8 defenders over who can marry.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTed Olson and David Boies, so what are they up to?\xe2\x80\x9d Olson laughed, summarizing the confusion and conspiracy theories that their union inspired.'b'As the sun set on the Bay Bridge behind him and the curtain dropped on the first week of the dramatic trial to challenge the constitutionality of the state\xe2\x80\x99s ban on same-sex marriage, Olson reviewed the case: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to explain why allowing same-sex couples to have that same right that the rest of us have is not going to hurt heterosexual marriages. It has no point at all except some people don\xe2\x80\x99t want to recognize gays and lesbians as normal, as human beings.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Boies, wearing a flag pin on his lapel, said that the state of California is engaged in \xe2\x80\x9cgay bashing.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke intensely about the gay and lesbian plaintiffs, who offered poignant testimony about their loving relationships and about wanting to be liked and accepted: \xe2\x80\x9cThese people are people you would want your child to grow up and marry. You can be a child molester and get married. You can be a wife beater and get married. You can be a child-support scofflaw and get married. The importance of that emotional relationship is so vital to the pursuit of happiness that even prison felons, who aren\xe2\x80\x99t really procreating, have a right to get married.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Noting the rabid effort being made to restrict marriage to only those who can protect its sanctity, a chuckling Olson reeled off some names: \xe2\x80\x9cTiger Woods, Eliot Spitzer, Mark Sanford, Kobe Bryant, Bill Clinton.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I asked Olson if he misted up, as many in the courtroom did, when Jeff Zarrillo, a 36-year-old manager at AMC Entertainment, testified that he loved his partner \xe2\x80\x9cprobably more than I love myself.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Olson replied, noting that he finds himself getting weepy a lot, including when a bright lawyer in his Washington law firm approached him in the library to tell him she was a lesbian mother of two and she was grateful to him.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think there\xe2\x80\x99s something the matter with you if you don\xe2\x80\x99t care enough to feel the suffering that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been through and if you\xe2\x80\x99re not emotionally upset about the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing an immense amount of harm to people,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not treating them like Americans. We\xe2\x80\x99re not treating them like citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Boies said the problem was generational, and they have to try the case before judges their own age who might find it hard to move beyond old prejudices. (Although this judge, a libertarian-tilting George H. W. Bush appointee, Vaughn Walker, who likes to hire magicians for the court\xe2\x80\x99s annual dinner, has been so accommodating to their side that Ed Meese complained he was tilting the case.)'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a grandson who\xe2\x80\x99s a senior in college, and he can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine fighting over this issue,\xe2\x80\x9d Boies said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like explaining to my daughter that there was a time when women didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the right to vote and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t own property.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The anti-gay-marriage proponents whipped up a moral frenzy in 2008,  suggesting conjugal parity would harm children, summon the devil, tear down churches and melt civilization. But Olson argued in his opening statement that the discrimination gays experience \xe2\x80\x9cweakens our moral fiber in this country.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'While Charles Cooper, the lawyer on the anti-gay-marriage side, cited President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s declaration that marriage should only be between a man and a woman, Olson noted that Obama\xe2\x80\x99s parents could not have married in Virginia before he was born.'b'I asked the lawyers if they were disappointed that the president who had once raised such hope in the gay community now seemed behind the curve.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDamned right,\xe2\x80\x9d Boies snapped. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope my Democratic president will catch up to my conservative Republican co-counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Olson added: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about Obama, but that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s so bad about politicians. They say, \xe2\x80\x98I must hasten to follow them, for I am their leader.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Obama sees himself as such a huge change that he can be cautious about other societal changes. But what he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t realize is that legalizing gay marriage is like electing a black president. Before you do it, it seems inconceivable. Once it\xe2\x80\x99s done, you can\xe2\x80\x99t remember what all the fuss was about.'b'Even given the low bar set by America\xe2\x80\x99s bogus conversations about race, the 'b'short-lived Harry Reid fracas'b' was a most peculiar nonevent. For all the hyperventilation in cable news land, this supposed racial brawl didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to generate any controversy whatsoever in what is known as the real world.'b'Eugene Robinson, the liberal black columnist at The Washington Post, 'b'wrote'b' that he was \xe2\x80\x9cneither shocked nor outraged\xe2\x80\x9d at Reid\xe2\x80\x99s less-than-articulate observation that Barack Obama benefited politically from being \xe2\x80\x9clight-skinned\xe2\x80\x9d and for lacking a \xe2\x80\x9cNegro dialect unless he wanted to have one.\xe2\x80\x9d Besides, Robinson said, Reid\xe2\x80\x99s point was \xe2\x80\x9csurely true.\xe2\x80\x9d The black conservative Ward Connerly agreed, 'b'writing in The Wall Street Journal'b' that he was \xe2\x80\x9chaving a difficult time determining what it was that Mr. Reid said that was so offensive.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'President Obama immediately granted Reid absolution. A black columnist at The Daily News in New York, Stanley Crouch, even'b' stood up for the archaic usage'b' of \xe2\x80\x9cNegro.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'George Will defended'b' Reid from charges of racism as vociferously as Democrats did. Al Sharpton may have 'b'accepted Reid\xe2\x80\x99s apology'b', but for once there\xe2\x80\x99s no evidence that he ever cared enough to ask for one. So who, actually, was the aggrieved party here? What  \xe2\x80\x94  or who  \xe2\x80\x94  was really behind this manufactured race war with no victims?'b'It would be easy to dismiss the entire event as a credulous news media\xe2\x80\x99s collaboration with a publisher\xe2\x80\x99s hype for a new tell-all-gossip 2008 campaign book, \xe2\x80\x9cGame Change,\xe2\x80\x9d which breathlessly broke the Reid \xe2\x80\x9cbombshell.\xe2\x80\x9d But this is a more interesting tale than that. The true prime mover in this story was not a book publicist but Michael Steele, the chairman of the Republican Party and by far the loudest and most prominent Beltway figure 'b'demanding that Reid resign'b' as Senate majority leader as punishment for his \xe2\x80\x9cracism.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Steele is widely regarded as a clown by observers of all political persuasions, but he is clownish like a fox. His actions in this incident offer some hilarious and instructive insights into what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the Republican hierarchy right now as it tries to cope not just with our first African-American president but with a restive base embracing right-wing tea-party populism that loathes the establishment in both parties. And though Steele is black, and perhaps the most enthusiastic player of the race card in American politics today, race was a red herring in his Reid vendetta. It threw most everyone off the scent of his real motivation, which had nothing to do with black versus white but everything to do with green, as in money.'b'A profligate spender, Steele had inaugurated his arrival  as party chairman by 'b'devoting nearly $20,000'b' to redecorate his office 'b'because'b' he found it \xe2\x80\x9cway too male\xe2\x80\x9d for his sensitive tastes. In the weeks just before \xe2\x80\x9cGame Change\xe2\x80\x9d emerged, Steele was in more hot water. Over the holidays, G.O.P. elders were shocked to learn that their front man had 'b'a side career as a motivational public speaker'b' at up to $20,000 a gig. The party treasury, which contained $22.8 million upon Steele\xe2\x80\x99s arrival at the end of January 2009, 'b'was down to $8.7 million by late November'b', with 2010 campaign expenditures rapidly arriving. \xe2\x80\x9cHe needs to raise money for the party, not his wallet,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'one Republican leader griped to Politico'b'.'b'Then, just after New Year, Steele published an unexpected book of his own, \xe2\x80\x9cRight Now: A 12-Step Program for Defeating the Obama Agenda.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t told his employers'b' that the book was in the works, and, to add further insult, he attacks unnamed party leaders in its pages for forsaking conservative principles. Since it hit the stores, Steele has pursued a book tour for fun and personal profit, all the while daring his G.O.P. critics to bring it on. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t want me in the job, fire me,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'he taunted them'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cBut until then, shut up. Get with the program, or get out of the way.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Fire him? Steele knows better than anyone that his party can\xe2\x80\x99t afford what Clarence Thomas might call a \xe2\x80\x9chigh-tech lynching\xe2\x80\x9d of the only visible black guy it has in even a second-tier office. 'b'Steele has said'b' that white Republicans are \xe2\x80\x9cscared\xe2\x80\x9d of him. They are. He loves to play head games with their racial paranoia and insecurities, whether he\xe2\x80\x99s publicly professing \xe2\x80\x9c'b'slum love'b'\xe2\x80\x9d for the Indian-American Louisiana governor, Bobby Jindal, or starting a blog on the R.N.C. site titled \xe2\x80\x9c'b'What Up?'b',\xe2\x80\x9d or announcing that he would use \xe2\x80\x9c'b'fried chicken and potato salad'b'\xe2\x80\x9d to recruit minority voters. As long as the G.O.P. remains largely a whites-only country club, Steele has job security. But he had real reason to fear some new restraints on the cash box; last year the party was driven to write a rule requiring him to get approval for expenditures over $100,000.'b'On Jan. 9 The Washington Post 'b'ran a front-page article headlined'b' \xe2\x80\x9cFrustrations With Steele Leaving G.O.P. in a Bind,\xe2\x80\x9d reporting, among other embarrassments, that the party had spent $90 million during Steele\xe2\x80\x99s brief reign while raising just $84 million. Enter \xe2\x80\x9cGame Change,\xe2\x80\x9d right in the nick of time for Steele to pull off his own cunning game change. On Jan. 10 he stormed \xe2\x80\x9cFox News Sunday\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMeet the Press\xe2\x80\x9d to 'b'demand Reid\xe2\x80\x99s head'b'. There has been hardly a mention of Steele\xe2\x80\x99s sins since. He can laugh all the way to the bank.'b'His behavior is not anomalous. Steele is representative of a fascinating but little noted development on the right: the rise of buckrakers who are exploiting the party\xe2\x80\x99s anarchic confusion and divisions to cash in for their own private gain. In this cause, Steele is emulating no one if not Sarah Palin, whose hunger for celebrity and money outstrips even his own. As many suspected at the time, her 2008 campaign wardrobe, like the doomed campaign itself, was just a preview of coming attractions: she would surely dump the bother of serving as Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s besieged governor for a lucrative star turn on Fox News. Last week 'b'she made it official'b'.'b'Both Steele and Palin claim to be devotees of the tea party movement. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a tea partier, I\xe2\x80\x99m a town-haller, I\xe2\x80\x99m a grass-roots-er\xe2\x80\x9d is 'b'how Steele put it in a recent radio interview'b', wet-kissing a market he hopes will buy his book. Palin has far more grandiose ambitions. She recently signed on as a speaker for the first 'b'Tea Party Convention'b', scheduled next month in Nashville  \xe2\x80\x94  even though she had 'b'turned down a speaking invitation from the annual Conservative Political Action Conference'b', the traditional meet-and-greet for the right. The conservative conference doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pay. The Tea Party Convention does. A 'b'blogger at Nashville Scene reported'b' that Palin\xe2\x80\x99s price for the event was $120,000.'b'The entire Tea Party Convention is a 'b'profit-seeking  affair'b' charging $560 a ticket  \xe2\x80\x94  plus the cost of a room at the Opryland Hotel. Among the convention\xe2\x80\x99s eight 'b'listed sponsors'b' is 'b'Tea Party Emporium'b', which gives as its contact address 'b'444 Madison Avenue'b' in New York, also 'b'home to the high-fashion brand Burberry'b'. This emporium\xe2\x80\x99s  Web site offers a bejeweled tea bag at $89.99 for those furious at \xe2\x80\x9ca government hell bent on the largest redistribution of wealth in history.\xe2\x80\x9d This is almost as shameless as Glenn Beck, whose own tea party profiteering has included hawking gold coins merchandised by a sponsor of his radio show.'b'Last week a prominent right-wing blogger, Erick Erickson of 'b'RedState.com'b', 'b'finally figured out'b' that the Tea Party Convention \xe2\x80\x9csmells scammy,\xe2\x80\x9d likening it to one of those Nigerian e-mails promising untold millions. Such rumbling about the movement\xe2\x80\x99s being co-opted by hucksters may explain why Palin used her first paid appearance at Fox last Tuesday to 'b'tell Bill O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly that she would recycle her own tea party profits'b' in political contributions. But Erickson had it right: the tea party movement is being exploited  \xe2\x80\x94  and not just by marketers, lobbyists, political consultants and corporate interests but by the Republican Party, as exemplified by Palin and Steele, its most prominent leaders.'b'Tea partiers hate the G.O.P. establishment and its Wall Street allies, starting with the Bushies who created TARP, almost as much as they do Obama and his Wall Street pals. When Steele and Palin pay lip service to the movement, they are happy to glom on to its anti-tax, anti-Obama, anti-government, anti-big-bank vitriol. But they don\xe2\x80\x99t call for any actual action against the bailed-out perpetrators of the financial crisis. They\xe2\x80\x99d never ask for investments to put ordinary Americans back to work. They have no policies to forestall foreclosures or protect health insurance for the tea partiers who\xe2\x80\x99ve been shafted by hard times. Their only economic principle beside tax cuts is vilification of the stimulus that did save countless jobs for firefighters, police officers and teachers at the state and local level.'b'The Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to counter the deprivation and bitterness spawned by the Great Recession are indeed timid and imperfect. The right has a point when it says that the Senate health care votes of Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana were bought with pork. But at least their constituents can share the pigout. Hustlers like Steele and Palin take the money and run. All their followers get in exchange is a lousy tea party T-shirt. Or a ghost-written self-promotional book. Or a tepid racial sideshow far beneath the incendiary standards of the party whose history from Strom to \xe2\x80\x9cmacaca\xe2\x80\x9d has driven away nearly every black American except Steele for the past 40 years.'b'Want to be happier in 2010? Then try this simple experiment, inspired by recent scholarship in psychology and neurology. Which person would you rather be:'b'Richard is an ambitious 36-year-old white commodities trader in Florida. He\xe2\x80\x99s healthy and drop-dead handsome, lives alone in a house with a pool, and has worked his way through a series of gorgeous women. Richard\xe2\x80\x99s job is stressful, but he spent Christmas in Tahiti. Unencumbered, he also has time to indulge such passions as reading (right now he\xe2\x80\x99s finishing a book called \xe2\x80\x9cHalf the Sky\xe2\x80\x9d), marathon running and writing poetry. In the last few days, he has been composing an elegy about the Haiti earthquake.'b'Lorna is a 64-year-old black woman in Boston. She\xe2\x80\x99s overweight and unattractive, even after a recent nose job. Lorna is on regular dialysis, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t impede her active social life or babysitting her grandchildren. A retired school assistant, she is close to her 67-year-old husband and is much respected in her church for directing the music committee and the semiannual blood drive. Lorna believes in tithing (giving 10 percent of her income to charity or the church) and in the last few days has organized a church drive to raise $10,000 for earthquake relief in Haiti.'b'I adapted those examples from ones that Jonathan Haidt, a psychology professor at the University of Virginia, develops in his fascinating book, 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Happiness Hypothesis.\xe2\x80\x9d'b' His point is that while most of us might prefer to trade places with Richard, Lorna is probably happier.'b''b'Men are no happier than women'b', and people in sunny areas no happier than people in chillier climates. 'b'The evidence on health is complex'b', but even chronic health problems (like those requiring dialysis) may have surprisingly little long-term effect on happiness, because we adjust to them. Beautiful people aren\xe2\x80\x99t happier than ugly people, although cosmetic surgery does seem to leave patients feeling brighter. Whites are happier than blacks, but only very slightly. And young people are actually a bit less happy than older folks, at least up to age 65.'b'Lorna has a few advantages over Richard. She has less stress and is respected by her peers  \xe2\x80\x94 factors that make us feel good. Happiness is tied to volunteering and to giving blood, and people with religious faith tend to be happier than those without. A solid marriage is linked to happiness, as is participation in social networks. And one study found that people who focus on achieving wealth and career advancement are less happy than those who focus on good works, religion or spirituality, or friends and family.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHuman beings are in some ways like bees,\xe2\x80\x9d Professor Haidt said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe evolved to live in intensely social groups, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t do as well when freed from hives.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Happiness is, of course, a complex concept and difficult to measure, and John Stuart Mill had a point when he suggested: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But in any case, nobility can lead to happiness. Professor Haidt notes that one thing that can make a lasting difference to your contentment is to work with others on a cause larger than yourself.'b'I see that all the time. I interview people who were busy but reluctantly undertook some good cause because (sigh!) it was the right thing to do. Then they  found that this \xe2\x80\x9csacrifice\xe2\x80\x9d became a huge source of fulfillment and satisfaction.'b'Brain scans by neuroscientists confirm that altruism carries its own rewards. A team including Dr. Jorge Moll of the National Institutes of Health 'b'found'b' that when a research subject was encouraged to think of giving money to a charity, parts of the brain lit up that are normally associated with selfish pleasures like eating or sex.'b'The implication is that we are hard-wired to be altruistic. To put it another way, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for humans to be truly selfless, for generosity feels so good.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe most selfish thing you can do is to help other people,\xe2\x80\x9d says Brian Mullaney, co-founder of 'b'Smile Train'b', which helps tens of thousands of children each year who are born with cleft lips and cleft palates. Mr. Mullaney was a successful advertising executive, driving a Porsche and taking dates to the Four Seasons, when he felt something was missing and began volunteering for good causes. He ended up leaving the business world to help kids smile again  \xe2\x80\x94 and all that makes him smile, too.'b'So at a time of vast needs, from Haiti to our own cities, here\xe2\x80\x99s a nice opportunity for symbiosis: so many afflicted people, and so much benefit to us if we try to help them. Let\xe2\x80\x99s remember that while charity has a mixed record helping others, it has an almost perfect record of helping ourselves. Helping others may be as primal a human pleasure as food or sex.'b'Taipei, Taiwan'b'Dick Cheney says President Obama is \xe2\x80\x9ctrying to pretend that we are not at war\xe2\x80\x9d with terrorists. There is only one thing I have to say about that: I sure hope so.'b'Frankly, if I had my wish, we would be on our way out of Afghanistan not in, we would be letting Pakistan figure out which Taliban they want to conspire with and which ones they want to fight, we would be letting Israelis and Palestinians figure out on their own how to make peace, we would be taking $100 billion out of the Pentagon budget to make us independent of imported oil  \xe2\x80\x94  nothing would make us more secure  \xe2\x80\x94  and we would be reducing the reward for killing or capturing Osama bin Laden to exactly what he\xe2\x80\x99s worth: 10 cents and an autographed picture of Dick Cheney.'b'Am I going isolationist? No, but visiting the greater China region always leaves me envious of the leaders of Hong Kong, Taiwan and China, who surely get to spend more of their time focusing on how to build their nations than my president, whose agenda can be derailed at any moment by a jihadist death cult using exploding underpants.'b'Could we just walk away? No, but we must change our emphasis. The \xe2\x80\x9cwar on terrorists\xe2\x80\x9d has to begin by our challenging the people and leaders 'b'over there'b'. If they\xe2\x80\x99re not ready to take the lead, to speak out and fight the madness in their midst, for the future of their own societies, there is no way we can succeed. We\xe2\x80\x99ll exhaust ourselves trying. We\xe2\x80\x99d be better off just building a higher wall.'b'As the terrorism expert Bruce Hoffman noted in an essay in The Washington Post: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the wake of the global financial crisis, Al Qaeda has stepped up a strategy of economic warfare. \xe2\x80\x98We will bury you,\xe2\x80\x99 Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev promised Americans 50 years ago.

Let\xe2\x80\x99s get out of the way and let the moderate majorities there, if they really exist, face their own enemies on their own. It is the only way they will move. We can be the wind at their backs, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t be their sails. There is some hope for Iraq and Iran today because their moderates are fighting for themselves.'b'Has anyone noticed the most important peace breakthrough on the planet in the last two years? It\xe2\x80\x99s right here: the new calm in the Strait of Taiwan. For decades, this was considered the most dangerous place on earth, with Taiwan and China pointing missiles at each other on hair triggers. Well, over the past two years, China and Taiwan have reached a quiet rapprochement  \xe2\x80\x94  'b'on their own'b'. No special envoys or shuttling secretaries of state. Yes, our Navy was a critical stabilizer. But they worked it out. They realized their own interdependence. The result: a new web of economic ties, direct flights and student exchanges.'b'A key reason is that Taiwan has no oil, no natural resources. It\xe2\x80\x99s a barren rock with 23 million people who, through hard work, have amassed the fourth-largest foreign currency reserves in the world. They got rich digging inside themselves, unlocking their entrepreneurs, not digging for oil. 'b'They took responsibility'b'. They got rich by asking: \xe2\x80\x9cHow do I improve myself?\xe2\x80\x9d Not by declaring: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s fault.

Nevertheless, I hope Americans see China\xe2\x80\x99s rise as the 21st-century equivalent of Russia launching the Sputnik satellite \xe2\x80\x94 a challenge to which we responded with a huge national effort that revived our education, infrastructure and science and propelled us for 50 years. Unfortunately, the Cheneyites want to make fighting Al Qaeda our Sputnik. Others want us to worry about some loopy remark Senator Harry Reid made about the shade of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s skin.'b'Well, what is our national project going to be?

Of course, to a degree, we need to both race China and confront Al Qaeda \xe2\x80\x94 but which will define us?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOur response to Sputnik made us better educated, more productive, more technologically advanced and more ingenious,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Johns Hopkins foreign policy expert Michael Mandelbaum. \xe2\x80\x9cOur investments in science and education spread throughout American society, producing the Internet, more students studying math and people genuinely wanting to build the nation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And what does the war on terror give us?

Chertoff, the former secretary of homeland security, did not volunteer that he is a consultant to a company that makes such equipment, and though they spoke to him twice, reporters never asked if he had a financial stake in the matter.'b'Peter Galbraith, a former diplomat, wrote several Op-Ed columns a few years ago supporting a strong and independent Kurdistan. The editors who published his pieces learned only in November \xe2\x80\x94 from 'b'a front-page article'b' \xe2\x80\x94 that Galbraith\xe2\x80\x99s business ties to a Norwegian oil company operating in Kurdistan positioned him to earn millions.'b''b'Jonathan Gruber'b', a prominent M.I.T. health economist, wrote an Op-Ed 'b'column'b' and was quoted frequently in other Times columns, news articles and blogs on health care reform before it came to light that he had a 'b'contract'b' worth nearly $400,000  to analyze health proposals for the Obama administration.'b''b'Neil Sadick'b', a famed Manhattan dermatologist, was quoted in a 'b'Skin Deep column'b' discussing electronic devices for the home treatment of acne, but the article did not say that Sadick has a business relationship with a company that makes one of the devices.'b'These examples have resulted in five embarrassing editors\xe2\x80\x99 notes in the last two months \xe2\x80\x94 two of them last week \xe2\x80\x94 each of them saying readers should have been informed of the undisclosed interest.  And on Thursday,  the standards editor sent Times journalists a memo urging them to be \xe2\x80\x9cconstantly alert\xe2\x80\x9d to the outside interests of expert sources.  The cases raised timeless issues for journalists and sources about what readers have a right to know and whose responsibility it is to find it out or disclose it.'b'The ideal expert source is entirely independent, with no stake in an outcome. But in reality, the most informed sources often have involvements, which is why they know what they know. Readers are entitled to disclosure so they can decide if there is a conflict that would affect the credibility of the information.'b'But each recent Times case showed how tricky it can be to navigate the ethics of disclosure.'b'Chertoff, who championed full-body scanners as head of the Department of Homeland Security, long before he went into private business, said it was no secret that he had become a consultant to corporate clients through 'b'the Chertoff Group'b', a risk-management firm he formed in March. He said that when two Times reporters, 'b'Eric Lipton'b'and 'b'John Schwartz'b', called and the subject turned to scanners, it was up to them to ask whether he had ties to that industry. \xe2\x80\x9cI always answer when I\xe2\x80\x99m asked,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is my obligation to put myself in the head of a reporter\xe2\x80\x9d to decide what the reporter needs to know.'b'Chertoff did tell NPR and CNN interviewers when they asked.'b'Lipton and Schwartz agreed that they should have asked Chertoff, but both expressed disappointment that he did not volunteer obviously germane information. 'b'Bob Steele'b', a professor at DePauw University and a journalism values scholar at the Poynter Institute, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe a source does have an affirmative obligation to reveal any competing loyalties, even if the source isn\xe2\x80\x99t sure they create a direct conflict of interest.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Interestingly, Chertoff wrote 'b'an Op-Ed article'b' for The Washington Post, published New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, that carried a one-sentence biography divulging that his clients included a scanner manufacturer \xe2\x80\x94 a note he said he volunteered.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99m affirmatively getting out there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as opposed to being called by a reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cI make it my business to disclose.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s a distinction I don\xe2\x80\x99t buy. What difference does it make whether a source seeks a forum or a reporter happens to call? Knowing Washington\xe2\x80\x99s culture of revolving doors and news spin, the Times reporters should have asked the obvious question. But if Chertoff had a connection he thought the public needed to know in one instance, he should have made it clear in the others.'b'Galbraith said he regretted not telling Times editors that he had business interests in Kurdistan when he wrote Op-Ed columns published 'b'in 2005'b' and 'b'2006.'b' He did provide a vague disclosure for 'b'one in 2007'b'. But he disputed the 'b'November editors\xe2\x80\x99  note'b' that said he could have benefited from an independent Kurdistan because he had a stake in an oil field there.'b'He said his support of an independent Kurdistan was against the interests of 'b'DNO International'b', the oil company with which he had a relationship, because it had invested $300 million in Iraq, expecting it to remain unified. \xe2\x80\x9cI did not promote or discuss matters of specific interest to my clients and, indeed, my generally pessimistic view of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s future was not consistent with the interests of companies trying to attract investors for projects in the country,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Galbraith asked where the line was if an Op-Ed contributor was writing about political issues in a country where he also had economic interests. Because politics and economics so often go hand in hand, I would say someone in his shoes should disclose all interests to editors and discuss whether any pose a conflict that needs to be disclosed to readers. That is what The Times requires of all Op-Ed columnists, in plain, written language.'b'Gruber, the health care economist, wrote an Op-Ed column in July supporting an excise tax on so-called Cadillac health plans. Not long before, he had signed a contract with the Department of Health and Human Services to analyze the economic impact of various health care proposals in Congress. He did not tell Op-Ed editors, nor was the contract mentioned on at least 12 other occasions when he was quoted in The Times after he was consulting for the administration. After a 'b'blogger reported'b' on Gruber\xe2\x80\x99s government contract on the Daily Kos Web site, Gruber did volunteer it to Steven Greenhouse, a Times reporter interviewing him for an article on the excise tax. Greenhouse said he included the fact in a draft but struck it because the article was too long.  Greenhouse said that Gruber\xe2\x80\x99s views on the tax were so well-known that he did not think they would be influenced by a consulting contract. But had he realized how large the contract was, Greenhouse said, \xe2\x80\x9cI would have stood up and paid lots more attention.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Gruber said, \xe2\x80\x9cI guess it never occurred to me that the fact that I was doing technical modeling would matter.\xe2\x80\x9d He said he has long supported the tax and that the administration opposed it when he wrote his column, so he was hardly bending his views to a government paymaster.'b'Sometimes, there can be misunderstandings even when a reporter asks. Camille Sweeney, the freelancer who interviewed Sadick about acne treatments, said she asked the dermatologist a specific question: Had he been paid by any manufacturer for tests he performed on the products? He said he had not. But after the article was published, a Times editor recalled seeing an endorsement by Sadick for a hair removal product by one of the manufacturers.'b'What is the lesson from all this? Lipton said, \xe2\x80\x9cI do need to ask whenever I call a person for comment as an expert if they have any financial relationship with the topic.\xe2\x80\x9d He said he has posted a reminder on his computer: \xe2\x80\x9cAsk if hired gun.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The American Federation of Teachers, the second-largest teachers\xe2\x80\x99 union, has been working hard to distance itself from its competitor, the National Education Association, which tends to resist sensible reforms.'b'The federation\xe2\x80\x99s  president, Randi Weingarten, set the contrast quite effectively with a speech last week in Washington,  in which she offered a proposal to reform teacher evaluation. She not only echoed Education Secretary Arne Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s call for evaluation systems that take student achievement into account but also expressed support for \xe2\x80\x9ca fair, transparent and expedient process to identify and deal with ineffective teachers.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The shortcomings of evaluations were laid out last year in an eye-opening study by a New York research group, the New Teacher Project. Where they can be said to exist at all, evaluations are typically short, pro forma and almost universally positive. Poorly trained evaluators visit the classroom once or twice for observations that last for a total of an hour or less. Nearly every teacher passes and the overwhelming majority of teachers receive top ratings. Yet more than half the teachers surveyed said they knew a tenured teacher who deserved to be dismissed for poor performance.'b'The process shortchanges students, who are saddled with ineffective teachers. It also hurts the careers of the talented beginners who rarely get the help and guidance they need to become master teachers.'b'Ms. Weingarten called for a new collaboration between schools and unions that would replace this \xe2\x80\x9cperfunctory waste of time.\xe2\x80\x9d She called on the states to adopt basic professional teaching standards that would spell out what teachers should know and be able to do.'b'She rightly warned against using test scores in crude, statistically invalid ways, and proposed a sophisticated analysis to determine if students were showing real growth under a given teacher. Just as important, Ms. Weingarten said districts that so often take a sink-or-swim approach to teaching should develop support and mentoring programs that both improve teachers\xe2\x80\x99 abilities and keep them from leaving the profession.'b'These proposals should help to change the national conversation on the subject by putting pressure on the N.E.A. At the same time, critics of unions who are pleased to see Ms. Weingarten talk the talk will be watching closely in the coming months to see if she walks the walk.'b'Over the past year, the New York Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Special Enforcement has closed at least 64 of the storefront businesses that line the sidewalks of Canal Street from West Broadway to Lafayette Street, an area known as the Counterfeit Triangle. On one  recent night, 10 buildings and 31 stalls were shut down, and a daisy chain of undercover and uniformed police officers filled an 18-wheeler with garbage bags holding $1 million worth of knockoff merchandise.'b'If this turns out to be the end for the Counterfeit Triangle, we want to remember the Canal Street we\xe2\x80\x99ve always loved: a place notorious the world over for providing customers with what they want, for as cheaply as they want it.'b'Political theater and public scolding are good ways to draw attention to important issues and bad behavior, and Phil Angelides, chairman of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, made use of both last week. As he swore in four of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s top bankers, it was impossible not to think of that famous scene with executives from the tobacco industry. During the questioning, he rebuked Lloyd Blankfein, head of Goldman Sachs, for his firm\xe2\x80\x99s practice of selling mortgage-related securities and at the same time betting they would fall in value.'b'Now that he has everyone\xe2\x80\x99s attention, Mr. Angelides and his fellow commissioners can get to the hard part.'b'Inconclusive sparring at hearings will not fulfill the mandate Congress gave the panel to investigate the causes of the crisis. Indeed, the bankers who testified last week did not say much they had not said before.'b'The commission must uncover what bankers, investors, government officials and other people in positions of power, past and present, would prefer not to say \xe2\x80\x94 or perhaps do not know or understand \xe2\x80\x94 about the crash and the bailouts. The primary aim is not to air issues and foster debate, but to test views, resolve contradictions and arrive at evidence-based conclusions.'b'Yet the commission \xe2\x80\x94 which is supposed to file a final report by Dec. 15 \xe2\x80\x94 has not issued a single subpoena for documents. Instead, investigators have apparently been relying on voluntary cooperation, public records and information-sharing agreements that have been negotiated with federal agencies. A thorough investigation requires source documents that reveal what people were thinking and doing at the time of the events and that illuminate, buttress or contradict testimony.'b'Take, for example, Mr. Blankfein\xe2\x80\x99s explanation that the clients Goldman bet against were sophisticated investors who demanded the doomed securities that Goldman sold them. Apart from the fact that the notion of \xe2\x80\x9csophisticated investors\xe2\x80\x9d has been discredited by the crisis, does that explanation go far enough?'b'Without peering into the internal workings of Goldman and other financial firms that engaged in similar practices, it is hard to know how far bankers went in creating demand rather than responding to it, or if the securities were purposely designed to perform poorly.'b'The answers could cast light on when Wall Street practices cross the line from prudent hedging to excessive speculation.'b'A crucial related issue is whether Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s role as the underwriter of securities, which implies a level of approval of the investments being offered for sale, misled investors into buying questionable securities, and thus contributed to the credit bubble. If so, that would make the argument for barring too-big-to-fail banks from operating hedge funds all the more compelling.'b'Given the stakes, the chances seem remote that Wall Street will voluntarily hand over the papers that could get to the bottom of it all.'b'The inquiry is getting under way at a critical moment. The House has passed a financial regulatory reform bill that was enfeebled in important respects by bank lobbyists. The Senate banking committee recently rejected a generally robust proposal by Senator Christopher Dodd. It has yet to produce an alternative, but it is likely that lobbying and partisan politics will generate a weak bill. President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s call for a new tax on big banks is a good idea, but must not pre-empt other needed changes, including a tax on bankers\xe2\x80\x99 bonuses and more direct regulation to limit the size of financial firms.'b'Serious investigative work is the only way to counter the banks\xe2\x80\x99 political power and alter the course of a reform effort that is headed in the wrong direction.'b'Barring marriage by same-sex couples is not the only way that New York State\xe2\x80\x99s policies on marriage are stuck in the past and inflict needless pain.'b'In 2006, a special blue-ribbon state commission sensibly called for overhauling state law to allow no-fault divorce. The reform enjoys broad support within legal circles and well beyond. Practically every New Yorker has a bitter divorce story, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s not his or her own. Yet four years, and a countless number of traumatized parents and children later, Albany has yet to act.'b'As a result of that inaction, New York remains the only state in the union that will not permit marriages to end without one spouse\xe2\x80\x99s alleging fault, such as cruel and inhumane treatment, adultery or abandonment.'b'Further dawdling would be inexcusable.

But there is something wrong with spending upward of $200 million per year on security for a multiyear trial and   disrupting the lives of people who have homes and jobs in  Lower Manhattan, where the trial is to be held.  Fortunately, there is a relatively easy solution to this problem:   Governors Island.'b'Conducting the Mohammed trial there  would not be the first time the 172-acre island, situated in the East River off Lower Manhattan, has been used for law enforcement. Before the federal government sold the island to New York State in 2003, it had long been  a military installation. During the Civil War, enlisted Confederate soldiers  were imprisoned  in its fortress-like Castle Williams; officers were held in Fort Jay (at the time called Fort Columbus).  After the Civil War, Castle Williams was  a military stockade. British and American forces  used the island for more than 200 years precisely because it was so easy to secure.'b'Residents of Lower Manhattan who live close to the federal courthouse where the trial is to be held have rightly expressed concern about the safety measures that will be needed. They argue persuasively that a community that has already dealt with some of the worst aspects of the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks \xe2\x80\x94 years of rebuilding, environmental hazards and security checkpoints \xe2\x80\x94 should not have to face additional burdens. This epic courtroom drama, they say, should not be played out in the midst of a dense residential and office neighborhood.'b'Mayor Michael Bloomberg and elected officials like Senator Charles Schumer correctly insist that the federal government pay for the entire cost of the trials. However, they have not addressed the central question of whether, in the midst of an economic recession, it makes sense for anyone to spend more than $200 million on security.'b'Enough questions have been raised that  it is worth urging Attorney General Eric Holder to  vet other locations for the federal trial \xe2\x80\x94 beyond the courthouse \xe2\x80\x94 and to reassess costs and security issues with the police.'b'As part of that vetting, Governors Island should be given serious consideration. The island has no residents and few office workers. Access is by ferry only, which should  enhance security and thus potentially reduce  costs.'b'Though a trial date has not yet been set, Mr. Holder needs to move swiftly to ensure that the Governors Island option receives  thorough consideration.  Preserving the values of democracy and the rule of law are of the utmost importance, and a federal trial in New York, which I fully support, certainly accomplishes that. Let us show the world that these values are of paramount importance not by imposing an extravagant ring of steel around a community that is still rebounding from 9/11, but rather by selecting a far safer, less expensive and arguably more appropriately historic location.'b'For a brief shining moment, late in the 2008 campaign, Democrats thought that they might own the Internet.'b'For decades, they had watched their Republican rivals exploit alternative media to raise money, organize voters and whip up outrage. In the 1970s, conservatives pioneered direct-mail fund-raising. In the early 1990s, they ruled the talk-radio dial. Early in the Bush era, they dominated cable news.'b'But the Internet was going to be different. Direct mail, talk radio, the cable shoutfests  \xe2\x80\x94  these were inherently conservative technologies, pitched to senior citizens and middle-aged suburbanites. The Internet was for the young, the hip, the multicultural, the liberal. Let the G.O.P. be the party of Fox News. The Democrats would be the party of Google, YouTube and Facebook.'b'During the 2008 campaign, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what they were. In a race where the Republican nominee didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to use the Internet, Barack Obama was the Internet: sleek, protean and ubiquitous. The Obama campaign dominated online fund-raising, online organizing and social media. This virtual edge translated into an enormous real-world advantage  \xe2\x80\x94  in dollars raised, enthusiasm harnessed and Election Day boots on the ground.'b'A year later, some of the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 advantage is still there. But it\xe2\x80\x99s been crumbling ever since Obama took office. Republican politicians have taken over Twitter. Sarah Palin has 1.2 million followers on Facebook. And in liberal Massachusetts, Scott Brown, the Republican Senate candidate, has used Internet fund-raising to put the fear of God into the Bay State\xe2\x80\x99s establishment.'b'Last Monday, Brown raised $1.3 million from an online \xe2\x80\x9cmoney bomb,\xe2\x80\x9d and his campaign reportedly went on to raise a 'b'million dollars a day'b' throughout the week. The 'b'race\xe2\x80\x99s online landscape'b' looks like last November\xe2\x80\x99s in reverse: from YouTube views to Facebook fans to Twitter followers, Brown enjoys an Obama-esque edge over his Democratic rival, Martha Coakley.'b'In a recent 'b'tweet'b' (how else?), Markos \xe2\x80\x9cDaily Kos\xe2\x80\x9d Moulitsas, the left-wing blogosphere\xe2\x80\x99s \xc3\xa9minence grise, compared the Brown campaign to Paul Hackett\xe2\x80\x99s bid for an Ohio House seat in 2005. A liberal Democrat running in a conservative district, Hackett came up just short on Election Day. But his campaign offered a preview of the online surge that pushed Democrats over the top in 2006 and 2008.'b'Brown\xe2\x80\x99s race might actually end in triumph, rather than a close defeat. But win or lose, he\xe2\x80\x99s demonstrated there\xe2\x80\x99s no necessary connection between online organizing and liberal politics. The Web is just like every pre-Internet political arena: ideology matters less than the level of anger at the incumbent party, and the level of enthusiasm an insurgent candidate can generate.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s like other arenas, too, in its capacity to disappoint idealists. Indeed, it may be crueler to dreamers, because it offers an artificial sense of intimacy with politicians, without delivering any practical results. You can be Sarah Palin\xe2\x80\x99s pal on Facebook, or have Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s running-mate selection text-messaged to your cellphone. But Washington is still Washington, the legislative process is still the legislative process, and the power of an online community matters less than the power of the powerful.'b'This is the bitter lesson many net-roots types have drawn from Obama\xe2\x80\x99s first year in office. The promises of transparency have given way to the reality of backroom deal-cutting. The attempts to turn the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s online community, weakly re-dubbed Organizing for America, into a permanent political force have'b' flopped'b'. In a recent 'b'post'b'  on the Web site Personal  Democracy Forum, Micah Sifry captured the free-floating sense of anger with Obama\xe2\x80\x99s governance: \xe2\x80\x9cThe people who voted for him weren\xe2\x80\x99t organized in any kind of new or powerful way, and the special interests ... sat first at the table and wrote the menu. Myth met reality, and came up wanting.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If liberals are feeling disillusioned, though, their right-wing imitators may be ripe for an even greater letdown. The Obama administration has at least gone some distance toward enacting an agenda that the net-roots left supports. The \xe2\x80\x9cright roots\xe2\x80\x9d activists are rallying around politicians who are promising to shrink government without offering any plausible sketch of how to do it. When Scott Brown pledges an across-the-board 'b'tax cut'b' and sweeping deficit reduction all at once, he\xe2\x80\x99s setting the conservative grass roots up for a major disappointment.'b'Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s for the best. The Internet breeds utopian hopes, and sometimes even fulfills them. (The incredible outpouring of financial support for Haiti would have been smaller, slower and less effective in an offline age.)'b'But where our political process is concerned, this utopianism needs to be tempered by a realism that only hard experience can teach. Better if both right and left learn their lesson quickly  \xe2\x80\x94  that technology changes, but politics remains the same.'b'Lately many people have been second-guessing the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s political strategy. The conventional wisdom seems to be that President Obama tried to do too much \xe2\x80\x94 in particular, that he should have put health care on one side and focused on the economy.'b'I disagree. The Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s troubles are the result not of excessive ambition, but of policy and political misjudgments. The stimulus was too small; policy toward the banks wasn\xe2\x80\x99t tough enough; and Mr. Obama didn\xe2\x80\x99t do what Ronald Reagan, who also faced a poor economy early in his administration, did  \xe2\x80\x94  namely, shelter himself from criticism with a narrative that placed the blame on previous administrations.'b'About the stimulus: it has surely helped. Without it, unemployment would be much higher than it is. But the administration\xe2\x80\x99s program clearly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t big enough to produce job gains in 2009.'b'Why was the stimulus underpowered? A number of economists (myself included) called for a stimulus substantially bigger than the one the administration ended up proposing. According to The New Yorker\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Ryan Lizza'b', however, in December 2008 Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s top economic and political advisers concluded that a bigger stimulus was neither economically necessary nor politically feasible.'b'Their political judgment may or may not have been correct; their economic judgment obviously wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. Whatever led to this misjudgment, however, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t failure to focus on the issue: in late 2008 and early 2009 the Obama team was focused on little else. The administration wasn\xe2\x80\x99t distracted; it was just wrong.'b'The same can be said about policy toward the banks. Some economists defend the administration\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to take a harder line on banks, arguing that the banks are earning their way back to financial health. But the light-touch approach to the financial industry further entrenched the power of the very institutions that caused the crisis, even as it failed to revive lending: bailed-out banks have been reducing, not increasing, their loan balances. And it has had disastrous political consequences: the administration has placed itself on the wrong side of popular rage over bailouts and bonuses.'b'Finally, about that narrative: It\xe2\x80\x99s instructive to compare Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s rhetorical stance on the economy with that of Ronald Reagan. It\xe2\x80\x99s often forgotten now, but unemployment actually soared after Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s 1981 tax cut. Reagan, however, had a ready answer for critics: everything going wrong was the result of the failed policies of the past. In effect, Reagan spent his first few years in office continuing to run against Jimmy Carter.'b'Mr. Obama could have done the same  \xe2\x80\x94  with, I\xe2\x80\x99d argue, considerably more justice. He could have pointed out, repeatedly, that the continuing troubles of America\xe2\x80\x99s economy are the result of a financial crisis that developed under the Bush administration, and was at least in part the result of the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to regulate the banks.'b'But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Maybe he still dreams of bridging the partisan divide; maybe he fears the ire of pundits who consider blaming your predecessor for current problems uncouth  \xe2\x80\x94  if you\xe2\x80\x99re a Democrat. (It\xe2\x80\x99s O.K. if you\xe2\x80\x99re a Republican.) Whatever the reason, Mr. Obama has allowed the public to forget, with remarkable speed, that the economy\xe2\x80\x99s troubles didn\xe2\x80\x99t start on his watch.'b'So where do complaints of an excessively broad agenda fit into all this? Could the administration have made a midcourse correction on economic policy if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been fighting battles on health care? Probably not. One key argument of those pushing for a bigger stimulus plan was that there would be no second chance: if unemployment remained high, they warned, people would conclude that stimulus doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work rather than that we needed a bigger dose. And so it has proved.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember, also, how important health care reform is to the Democratic base. Some activists have been left disillusioned by the compromises made to get legislation through the Senate  \xe2\x80\x94  but they would have been even more disillusioned if Democrats had simply punted on the issue.'b'And politics should be about more than winning elections. Even if health care reform loses Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 votes (which is questionable), it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.'b'So what comes next?'b'At this point Mr. Obama probably can\xe2\x80\x99t do much about job creation. He can, however, push hard on financial reform, and seek to put himself back on the right side of public anger by portraying Republicans as the enemies of reform \xe2\x80\x94  which they are.'b'And meanwhile, Democrats have to do whatever it takes to enact a health care bill. Passing such a bill won\xe2\x80\x99t be their political salvation  \xe2\x80\x94  but not passing a bill would surely be their political doom.'b'When it looked as if Dubai would go bust last month, making global financial markets swoon, its wealthy neighboring emirate stepped in and bailed it out with a $10 billion loan. Unfortunately Dubai isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only one teetering on the brink. Greece is also in trouble; so is Ireland. Others could follow. Unless the world\xe2\x80\x99s richest nations come to the rescue of weakened states, the global financial crisis might sprout another leg and stop the nascent recovery in its tracks.'b'Dubai created its problems. The oil-poor emirate borrowed lavishly to pay for a construction binge, and went bust when its housing bubble imploded. Other countries, like Greece and Ireland, are also suffering a hard landing from a decade of debt-fueled profligacy. But there are also innocent bystanders who could be swept away by the financial tide. Government budgets have been battered across the board by the global recession \xe2\x80\x94 reducing tax revenues as unemployment insurance and fiscal stimulus measures have increased expenditures. This has reduced governments\xe2\x80\x99 options to fight the continued economic weakness.'b'The most immediately vulnerable countries are in the European Union. Greece\xe2\x80\x99s budget deficit exploded as recession took its toll, leading to a downgrade of its credit rating and a collapse in the price of its bonds. Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s economy is expected to contract 7.5 percent in 2009, Italy\xe2\x80\x99s 5.1 percent and Spain\xe2\x80\x99s 3.8 percent.'b'This is a compelling case for the sounder European economies to come to the rescue of their poor neighbors. Statements like the German finance minister\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that Greece sink or swim alone  amount to a shot in the European foot. If Greece were to default on its debts, investors would run from other European countries with low growth and big debts \xe2\x80\x94 pushing some of the weaker ones into a crisis of their own.'b'Growth in these countries is hindered severely by the remarkably strong euro, which has sapped their international competitiveness. With overstretched budgets taking further fiscal stimulus off the table, financial analysts have suggested that nations  may be tempted to abandon the euro to achieve growth. Pain is also spreading outside  Europe. Rating agencies have downgraded the credit of Mexico, whose budget deficit opened sharply as the economy contracted 7.3 percent last year.'b'These strains could have deep and lasting repercussions. A breakdown of the euro would be disastrous \xe2\x80\x94 sending a potent shock through already jittery financial markets \xe2\x80\x94 deepening and extending this worldwide recession. Some observers worry about the secularly tolerant Dubai being driven into the arms of the much more conservative Abu Dhabi. And the world economy is too fragile to withstand another round of careening markets.'b'We understand that voters in the rich, industrial world might be feeling deep bailout fatigue. Still, bailouts will be necessary. To begin with, the more powerful countries of the European Union \xe2\x80\x94 like Germany \xe2\x80\x94  must come to the rescue of their weaker neighbors. But other countries, including the United States and China, must stand ready to provide help. It might be expensive. But it would be cheaper than another round of crisis.'b'We keep waiting \xe2\x80\x94 in vain \xe2\x80\x94 for the Obama administration to stop trying to block judicial scrutiny of some of the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s most outrageous policies on the detention of prisoners.'b'Most recently, Neal Katyal, a deputy solicitor general, tried to persuade a three-judge federal appeals court panel to deny hearings to a group of prisoners who have been held under harsh conditions without adequate review for more than six years. Their prison \xe2\x80\x94 at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan \xe2\x80\x94 is a much larger version of the Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay prison that President Obama has ordered closed.'b'The appellate panel should uphold  the carefully written ruling of last April, by Federal District Judge John Bates, a 2001 appointee of President George W. Bush. Judge Bates based his ruling on Boumediene v. Bush, the Supreme Court decision in 2008 that said President Bush could not deny prisoners at Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay a federal court review of their detention.'b'Judge Bates essentially extended that ruling to non-Afghan detainees captured outside  Afghanistan and spirited to Bagram \xe2\x80\x94 a small segment of the 600 or so prisoners at the base. At the hearing, the bench seemed unpersuaded by the government\xe2\x80\x99s claim that Boumediene was limited to Guant\xc3\xa1namo, but reluctant to order a review of the Bagram detainees.'b'As Judge Bates noted, allowing the government to transfer prisoners to Afghanistan and claim they are beyond the jurisdiction of American courts \xe2\x80\x9cresurrects the same specter of limitless executive power the Supreme Court sought to guard against.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Unlike Guant\xc3\xa1namo, Bagram is in an active theater of war, and habeas corpus has not applied to detainees held abroad in zones of combat. But the prisoners at issue were not captured in the war zone. The federal courts have shown themselves to be fully capable of handling similar cases from Guant\xc3\xa1namo.'b'There is clearly a need for hearings. Judge Bates found that the screening process in Bagram was even \xe2\x80\x9cless sophisticated and more error-prone\xe2\x80\x9d than the sorting process at Guant\xc3\xa1namo, which the Supreme Court deemed inadequate. The administration is housing Bagram prisoners in a new and physically less oppressive facility, and has given prisoners greater ability to challenge their custody without lawyers. But that does not justify stripping courts of their role.'b'The government\xe2\x80\x99s intimation that a few hearings would hurt the expanding war effort in Afghanistan is not credible. As President Obama himself has argued, ensuring the fair treatment of detainees advances America\xe2\x80\x99s national security interests by denying Al Qaeda and the Taliban an effective recruiting tool.'b'If you\xe2\x80\x99re a retiree who relies on interest income, you know that the tap is running dry. In fact, many investors in certificates of deposits, savings accounts and money market accounts are losing money once taxes and inflation are subtracted from today\xe2\x80\x99s extremely low yields.'b'Less well known is that measly savings yields are central to the government effort to buy time for the banks to earn their way back to health. It is important to rebuild the banks. But more attention must be paid to the collateral damage from that effort.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s happening: By lowering the short-term interest rate it controls to virtually zero and creating lending programs, the Federal Reserve has enabled banks to borrow cheaply. The banks re-lend that cheap money, but not necessarily to consumers and businesses. They can, for example, lend it to back to the federal government by buying Treasury securities, and earn a nice spread between their cost of funds and Treasury yields.'b'At the same time, banks are awash in deposits, much of it from investors who have pulled their money out of riskier investments. With money rolling in, big banks don\xe2\x80\x99t need to compete with one another for savers, which further depresses the interest on offer.'b'The result is presumably healthier banks and certainly poorer savers. Or, as Wi'b'lliam  Gross'b', the legendary bond investor told The Times\xe2\x80\x99s Stephanie Strom: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s capitalism, I guess, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not to be applauded.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The situation is especially tough on retirees who depend on interest income to supplement their Social Security. Some will have to spend their capital to make ends meet. Some will probably take on more risk by investing in stocks or bonds, or will have to live on less. Some, as Ms. Strom reported, have taken out reverse mortgages to increase their income \xe2\x80\x94 another example of how Americans\xe2\x80\x99 wealth is being sapped. Reverse mortgages allow people who are 62 and older to convert the equity in their homes into cash, with the loans usually repaid by selling the house after the owner dies.'b'Regulators have put safeguards in place to combat abusive lending on government-insured reverse mortgages, about 90 percent of the market. (They include prohibitions on cross-selling, whereby a lender urges borrowers to use the money from the mortgage to buy other investments from the lender.) Given the nation\xe2\x80\x99s recent experiences \xe2\x80\x94 and the vulnerability of many elderly people \xe2\x80\x94 regulators will have to be vigilant.'b'The effect of the financial crisis on retirees \xe2\x80\x94 and planning for retirement \xe2\x80\x94 has been largely overlooked. It deserves a high place on policy makers\xe2\x80\x99 agendas.'b'The nation\xe2\x80\x99s police chiefs are finding an alarming increase in criminals\xe2\x80\x99 use of assault weapons \xe2\x80\x94 the high-powered battlefield rifles that used to be banned, back when the federal government showed greater concern for public safety. The 10-year ban expired in 2004, despite the vows of presidential nominees from both parties to fight for renewal. Congress hasn\xe2\x80\x99t mustered the guts to try, preferring to roll over for the gun lobby.'b'A survey of more than 130 local police chiefs and officials found 37 percent reporting an increase in assault weapons in street crime. Front-line police find criminals generally packing more powerful heat, with more than half of the chiefs citing increases in large-caliber handguns and high-capacity semiautomatics \xe2\x80\x94 the real-life stuff of tough-guy movie fantasies. Miami police reported that four years after politicians allowed the federal ban to lapse, homicides by assault weapons increased sixfold, including the murder of two police officers.'b'The findings were part of a police brass \xe2\x80\x9csummit on guns and crime\xe2\x80\x9d in Washington last November that was studiously ignored by the capital ruling class. Meeting as members of the Police Executive Research Forum, the attendees   underlined the disheartening fact that \xe2\x80\x9cthere seems to be little or no appetite for gun control legislation in the U.S. Congress or the Obama administration.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In their frustration, the chiefs deserve credit for trying to come up with some local and state solutions \xe2\x80\x94 for example, requiring owners to immediately document lost or stolen guns as a deterrent to the current dodge of selling them as \xe2\x80\x9clost\xe2\x80\x9d in the underground market.'b'The chiefs were collectively enlightened, discovering that in most states gun dealers are monitored not by state or local police but by federal firearm inspectors. They have a force of but 600 covering 115,000 gun dealers \xe2\x80\x94 who may be visited no more than once a year.

Yet there is a major problem brewing there \xe2\x80\x94 one that could jeopardize President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s plan to draw down American forces and even reignite sectarian conflict.'b'Last Thursday, Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s Independent High Election Commission'b' 'b' upheld a ban on nearly 500 Sunni politicians handed down (possibly illegally) some days earlier by the Accountability and Justice Commission. They were accused of having had ties to the Baath Party of Saddam Hussein. Among those proscribed from running in the nationwide elections scheduled for March 7 were Defense Minister Abdul-Kader Jassem al-Obeidi and Saleh al-Mutlaq, one of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s most influential Sunni politicians. Although confusion reigns, it is rumored that the brief appeal process will end Tuesday and, at present, it seems unlikely to ameliorate the situation.'b'The two commissions are dominated by officials appointed by Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising that many Iraqis believe that the prime minister\xe2\x80\x99s Shiite-dominated government is disqualifying large numbers of political rivals, particularly Mr. Mutlaq, who had already allied himself with Ayad Allawi, a former prime minister widely considered Mr. Maliki\xe2\x80\x99s most dangerous foe. There is no evidence of this, but the perception is widespread and in Iraq, perception can do as much damage as reality. Meanwhile, many informed Americans and Iraqis are pointing to Ahmed Chalabi, the one-time political favorite of the Bush administration, as the real culprit. Mr. Chalabi, they say, is trying to manipulate the elections to become prime minister by default.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s true that many of the disqualified politicians were once Baathists. But Iraq needs reconciliation, not payback. Any bans must be careful, selective and well-explained. They should not disqualify people like the defense minister \xe2\x80\x94 a former Baathist, but one who turned against the party in the 1990s and was imprisoned and tortured by the regime. Moreover, in recent years he has served the new Iraqi government loyally.'b'Before the surge of American troops in 2007 and the so-called Anbar Awakening, many Iraqi Sunnis boycotted Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s elections in the belief that the system was rigged against them. This created a self-fulfilling prophecy when the elections took place without them and the resulting government was dominated by Shiite and Kurdish groups. This vicious cycle helped fuel civil war.'b'All of that changed after 2007, when American-brokered cease-fires and political shifts convinced Sunnis that they would have a fair opportunity to elect their own leaders and participate in government at no disadvantage. In the provincial elections of January 2009, Sunnis finally voted in large numbers. Their return to the political process has been a key element in the rapid erosion of sectarianism from Iraqi politics. The end of the civil war and the need to focus on political and economic reconstruction had revealed sharp differences among the various Shiite groups, which have been heightened by the emergence of Sunni parties with similarly varied views.'b'As a result, there has been a complete reorganization of Iraqi politics over the past year, with Shiite, Sunni and even some Kurdish groups creating cross-sectarian alliances that have largely replaced the previous sectarian blocs. It was a sign of this progress that Sunni parties, particularly Mr. Mutlaq\xe2\x80\x99s, were being courted avidly by a number of Shiite and secular parties, including those led by Mr. Maliki and Mr. Allawi.'b'If the ban is allowed to stand, it will do more than just throw a wrench in the works. It will persuade a great many Iraqis that the prime minister or other Shiites, like Mr. Chalabi, are using their control over the electoral mechanics to kneecap their rivals. It may also convince many Sunnis that they will never be allowed to win if they play by the rules, and that violence is their only option.'b'That is an extraordinarily dangerous message to send right now, when the United States is trying hard to withdraw tens of thousands more American troops from Iraq and shift 50,000 or so from combat operations to advisory and training roles. If this ban remains in effect, the likelihood of electoral violence will skyrocket, and American soldiers will inevitably be called on to halt it.'b'All is not yet lost \xe2\x80\x94 over the past few years, Iraqi politicians have developed a penchant for last-minute compromise that has turned a number of near-catastrophes into mere close calls. In every one of those instances, however, it required rapid and determined American pressure to avert disaster.'b'The American Embassy in Baghdad is working feverishly to persuade the Iraqis to change course. Time is of the essence \xe2\x80\x94 especially if the Accountability and Justice Commission\xe2\x80\x99s appeals process ends on Tuesday.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whose legacy we commemorated on Monday, dreamed \xe2\x80\x94 by the content of their character.'b'The Senate leader\xe2\x80\x99s choice of words was flawed, but positing that black candidates who look \xe2\x80\x9cless black\xe2\x80\x9d have a leg up is hardly more controversial than saying wealthy people have an advantage in elections. Dozens of research studies have shown that skin tone and other racial features play powerful roles in who gets ahead and who does not. These factors regularly determine who gets hired, who gets convicted and who gets elected.'b'Consider: Lighter-skinned Latinos in the United States make $5,000 more on average than darker-skinned Latinos. The education test-score gap between light-skinned and dark-skinned African-Americans is nearly as large as the gap between whites and blacks.'b'The Harvard neuroscientist Allen Counter has found that in Arizona, California and Texas, hundreds of Mexican-American women have suffered mercury poisoning as a result of the use of skin-whitening creams. In India, where I was born, a best-selling line of women\xe2\x80\x99s cosmetics called Fair and Lovely has recently been supplemented by a product aimed at men called Fair and Handsome.'b'This isn\xe2\x80\x99t racism, per se: it\xe2\x80\x99s colorism, an unconscious prejudice that isn\xe2\x80\x99t focused on a single group like blacks so much as on 'b'blackness 'b'itself. Our brains, shaped by culture and history, create intricate caste hierarchies that privilege those who are physically and culturally whiter and punish those who are darker.'b'Colorism is an intraracial problem as well as an interracial problem. Racial minorities who are alert to white-black or white-brown issues often remain silent about a colorism that asks \xe2\x80\x9chow black\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chow brown\xe2\x80\x9d someone is within their own communities.'b'If colorism lives underground, its effects are very real. Darker-skinned African-American defendants are more than twice as likely to receive the death penalty as lighter-skinned African-American defendants for crimes of equivalent seriousness involving white victims. This was proven in rigorous, peer-reviewed'b' research'b' into hundreds of capital punishment-worthy cases by the Stanford psychologist Jennifer Eberhardt.'b'Take, for instance, two of Dr. Eberhadt\xe2\x80\x99s murder cases, in Philadelphia, involving black defendants \xe2\x80\x94 one light-skinned, the other dark. The lighter-skinned defendant, Arthur Hawthorne, ransacked a drug store for money and narcotics. The pharmacist had complied with every demand, yet Mr. Hawthorne shot him when he was lying face down. Mr. Hawthorne was independently identified as the killer by multiple witnesses, a family member and an accomplice.'b'The darker-skinned defendant, Ernest Porter, pleaded not guilty to the murder of a beautician, a crime that he was linked to only through a circuitous chain of evidence. A central witness later said that prosecutors forced him to finger Mr. Porter even though he was sure that he was the wrong man. Two people who provided an alibi for Mr. Porter were mysteriously never called to testify. During his trial, Mr. Porter revealed that the police had even gotten his name wrong \xe2\x80\x94 his real name was Theodore Wilson \xe2\x80\x94 but the court stuck to the wrong name in the interest of convenience.'b'Both men were convicted. But the lighter-skinned Mr. Hawthorne was given  a life sentence, while the dark-skinned Mr. Porter has spent more than a quarter-century on Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s death row.'b'Colorism also influenced the 2008 presidential race. In an experiment that fall, Drew Westen, a psychologist at Emory, and other researchers shot different versions of a political advertisement in support of Mr. Obama. One version showed a light-skinned black family. Another version had the same script, but used a darker-skinned black family. Voters, at an unconscious level, were less inclined to support Mr. Obama after watching the ad featuring the darker-skinned family than were those who watched the ad with the lighter-skinned family.'b'Political operatives are certainly aware of this dynamic. During the campaign, a conservative group created attack ads linking Mr. Obama with Kwame Kilpatrick, the disgraced former mayor of Detroit, which darkened Mr. Kilpatrick\xe2\x80\x99s skin to have a more persuasive effect. Though there can be little doubt that as a candidate Mr. Obama faced voters\xe2\x80\x99 conscious and unconscious prejudices, it is simultaneously true that unconscious colorism subtly advantaged him over darker-skinned politicians.'b'In highlighting how Mr. Obama benefited from his links to whiteness, Harry Reid punctured the myth that Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s election signaled the completion of the Rev. King\xe2\x80\x99s dream. Americans may like to believe that we are now color-blind, that we can consciously choose not to use race when making judgments about other people. It remains a worthy aspiration. But this belief rests on a profound misunderstanding about how our minds work and perversely limits our ability to discuss prejudice honestly.'b'It takes a strange frame of mind to believe that demolishing a wooded encampment of homeless immigrant men and evicting them onto the streets during one of the coldest weeks of winter can be an act of prudence and compassion. But that is how the town of Huntington, in Suffolk County on Long Island, describes it.'b'It looks more like something else: an exercise in needless cruelty, in wishing a problem away.'b'This month, the town decided to clean up a large, privately owned lot where a few dozen Latino day laborers had found shelter. The lot, which is behind railroad tracks, is densely overgrown and well suited for an invisible encampment. It was an open secret for years, the laborers occasionally but only half-heartedly rousted.'b'This time was different. The owners were ordered to dismantle and clear out the debris, and a crew went in with chainsaws on Jan. 11.'b'Some men lost all they owned. Now they have no job, no bed, no place to stay all day, no way to get home. But it is not the town\xe2\x80\x99s problem. It has no homeless shelter, and is not about to open one. Suffolk County has a shelter, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t let in immigrants without papers. There is a hiring site with a trailer, but it closes at night.'b'These self-reliant men have been driven into the arms of kind strangers \xe2\x80\x94 volunteers who offer sleeping bags and warm meals in church meeting halls each night during the coldest months. They do it quietly; some in their congregations disapprove of giving help to the \xe2\x80\x9cwrong kind of poor.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The town sees itself as blameless, as having acted for reasons of safety and building codes. No one is to blame, it seems, but the men who came without papers and sought shelter where they weren\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to.'b'As for the possibility of other kinds of blame \xe2\x80\x94 of homeowners and contractors who exploit and discard cheap immigrant labor, of politicians who feed a climate of resentment that has given Suffolk County a grim reputation for intolerance \xe2\x80\x94 no one has owned up to any of it.'b'Here is what a volunteer said: \xe2\x80\x9cPeople say, \xe2\x80\x98Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a complicated problem,\xe2\x80\x99 but it really isn\xe2\x80\x99t. What is so complicated about giving people a place to get warm when it\xe2\x80\x99s below freezing outside? Some people around here would have more outrage about a dog being left outside than a group of hungry, homeless human beings.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Among the leading causes of recidivism are employment policies in the private and public sectors that discriminate against former offenders and too often drive them back to jail. New York State first addressed this problem more than 30 years ago with laws protecting the employment rights of people with criminal convictions. But two investigations by Attorney General Andrew Cuomo suggest that some companies are finding ways around these laws.'b'Employers in New York can, of course, review an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s history. But they cannot deny an applicant a job on the basis of a conviction without considering whether the offense bears a relationship to the job being sought. New York law also forbids employers from shutting out qualified applicants because of convictions that are sealed or dismissed, minor infractions like speeding tickets or for arrests that do not lead to conviction.'b'In a recently completed investigation, the attorney general found that ChoicePoint, a nationally known employee screening company, was involved in creating an online job application system for employers that automatically disqualified thousands of applicants who disclosed criminal convictions. Moreover, investigators found that the company had recommended to employers that they disqualify applicants based on sealed or dismissed convictions and legal outcomes that are regarded as violations \xe2\x80\x94 not crimes \xe2\x80\x94 under New York law. One ChoicePoint client violated state law by withdrawing conditional job offers after information that should not have been taken into account turned up in background checks.'b'In a separate investigation, the attorney general found that RadioShack also had ignored the law by rejecting job applicants whose violations had been sealed, set aside or deemed to be minor. Both companies have agreed to pay financial penalties and to obey the law, without admitting or denying wrongdoing. But the cases raise the disturbing possibility that the practices they engaged in may be more widespread than supposed in a state that has been a national model in giving former prisoners a chance at honest work.'b'Senator Lisa Murkowski\xe2\x80\x99s home state of Alaska is ever so slowly melting away, courtesy of a warming planet. Yet few elected officials seem more determined than she to throw sand in the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to do something about climate change.'b'As part of an agreement that allowed the Senate to get out of town before Christmas, Democratic leaders gave Ms. Murkowski and several other Republicans the chance to offer amendments to a must-pass bill lifting the debt ceiling. Voting on that bill begins this week. Although she has not showed her hand, Ms. Murkowski has been considering various proposals related to climate change \xe2\x80\x94  all mischievous.'b'One would block for one year any effort by the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. This would prevent the administration from finalizing its new and much-needed standards for cars and light trucks and prevent it from regulating greenhouse gases from stationary sources.'b'Ms. Murkowski also is mulling a \xe2\x80\x9cresolution of disapproval\xe2\x80\x9d that would ask the Senate to overturn the E.P.A.\xe2\x80\x99s recent \xe2\x80\x9cendangerment finding\xe2\x80\x9d that carbon dioxide and other global warming gases threaten human health and the environment. This finding flowed from a 2007 Supreme Court decision and is an essential precondition to any regulation governing greenhouse gases. Rescinding the finding would repudiate years of work by America\xe2\x80\x99s scientists and public health experts.'b'Ms. Murkowski says she\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about global warming but worries even more about what she fears would be a bureaucratic nightmare if the E.P.A. were allowed to regulate greenhouse gases. She says she would prefer a broad legislative solution. So would President Obama. But unlike Ms. Murkowski, he would not unilaterally disarm the E.P.A. before Congress has passed a bill.'b'Judging by the latest and daffiest idea to waft from Ms. Murkowski\xe2\x80\x99s office, she may not want a bill at all. Last fall, the Senate environment committee approved a cap-and-trade scheme that seeks to limit greenhouse gas emissions by putting a price on them. The Democratic leadership\xe2\x80\x99s plan is to combine the bill with other energy-related measures to broaden the base of support; by itself, it cannot pass.'b'Knowing that the bill is not ripe, Ms. Murkowski may bring it up for a vote anyway as an amendment to the debt bill. Why? To shoot it down. The tactic would give us a \xe2\x80\x9cbarometric reading\xe2\x80\x9d of where the Senate stands on cap-and-trade, one Murkowski staffer said recently. What it really gives us is a reading on how little the senator \xe2\x80\x94 or for that matter, her party \xe2\x80\x94 has to offer.'b'New York legislators proposed an ethics reform package last week that would definitely improve the miserable status quo in Albany. But the plan is not the full-fledged housecleaning necessary for a place that has gone too long without the slightest dusting of reform.'b'The reforms proposed by Senator John Sampson, the Democratic leader in the State Senate, and the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, would inevitably get the best-we-can-do-at-the-moment label. That\xe2\x80\x99s not good enough. Here\xe2\x80\x99s how the proposals stack up against the need for real reform:'b''b'OUTSIDE INCOME'b' The proposal would mandate more disclosure, including requirements that lawmakers list income ranges to $1 million or more. That is a clear improvement, but there is a big hole: exemptions for the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers, including Mr. Silver, who would not be required to list clients. That is wrong. A lawmaker\xe2\x80\x99s first obligation is to the public, not the clients.'b'The package does require lobbyists to disclose any business dealings with public officials, including legislators who are lawyers. Another section would explicitly ban the private use of public resources. Joseph Bruno, the former Republican leader who was convicted recently of two felony counts, was accused of running his private business out of his state offices.'b''b'THE FRAMEWORK'b' Gov. David Paterson recently proposed a single independent ethics commission to oversee everybody in state government. It is a clean, straightforward approach, but the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s bill would set up three commissions. One would oversee lobbyists, another the governor and the executive branch. Both of those would operate independently. But the third commission, overseeing the Legislature, would be appointed by legislative leaders. That\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of feeble oversight lawmakers enjoy now.'b'To some good-government advocates, the best thing in the package is a muscular new office that would have real powers to investigate complaints of ethical violations by legislators and to make complaints public. That seems to be an improvement.'b''b'CAMPAIGN FINANCE'b' The proposed bill does not seek broad reforms in the state\xe2\x80\x99s abysmal campaign finance system. But it would give the Board of Elections new clout by empowering it to investigate and fine lawmakers who violate the few campaign laws that do exist. Some legislators have failed for years to report campaign donations; the board can, at worst, fine them about $500 per failure. The new proposal would allow fines of up to $10,000 for repeated failures to file.'b'Even some lawmakers who support the legislative package acknowledge that some of Governor Paterson\xe2\x80\x99s reform proposals are more thorough. His independent ethics commission is a better fix. His attack on Albany\xe2\x80\x99s pay-to-play culture requires more disclosure of outside income (including lawyers), drastically reforms the campaign finance rules and establishes a financial board to oversee the state comptroller.'b'The lawmakers\xe2\x80\x99 proposal is an important step forward for a Legislature that has become a national embarrassment. As State Senator Daniel Squadron, a New York City Democrat, put it, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is better to have a good bill than a perfect press release.\xe2\x80\x9d But it is only the beginning, however useful, of what must be a sustained, cathartic effort to restore the public trust.'b'It has been easy for people to forget in the decades since we lost the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. that he was a passionate fighter for economic justice as well as civil rights. The two goals were as closely linked as the hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water.'b'The historic gathering in 1963 at which Dr. King delivered his famous \xe2\x80\x9cI Have a Dream\xe2\x80\x9d speech was officially called the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.'b'And when Dr. King was murdered in Memphis in 1968, he had gone there to support sanitation workers who were striking for higher wages and better working conditions.'b'Jobs and freedom. In America, you can\xe2\x80\x99t have one without the other. Democrats are in deep trouble right now \xe2\x80\x94  just a year after their giddy celebration of Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s ascendance to the presidency \xe2\x80\x94  because so many millions of Americans are out of work, unable to find the gainful employment that would unlock the door to a stable future for themselves and their families.'b'The president and his party may be obsessed with health care, but unemployed and underemployed Americans want a job. Why this has been so hard for the Democrats to realize, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say.'b'As the nation continues to wallow in the trough of widespread unemployment, black Americans are bearing a disproportionate burden of the joblessness. The election of a black president may have been important to African-Americans for myriad reasons, but it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done much for their bottom line, which continues to deteriorate.'b'For example, without a dramatic new intervention by the federal government, the poverty rate for African-American children could eventually approach a heart-stopping 50 percent, according to analysts at the Economic Policy Institute. Already more than a third of black children are living in poverty.'b'Present trends are not good. Communities of color are being crushed economically and the national news media have not fully focused on the carnage. The official unemployment rate for blacks is 16.2 percent and could well pass 17 percent before the year is out. The real jobless rate is far more ghastly. The Boston-based group United for a Fair Economy noted that even \xe2\x80\x9ccollege-educated black men are nearly twice as likely to be unemployed as their white, college-educated counterparts.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In some poor neighborhoods, a man or woman with a traditional full-time job is the exception, not the rule. In five Midwestern states  \xe2\x80\x94  Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin and Oklahoma  \xe2\x80\x94  the jobless rate for blacks is at least three times as high as that for whites.'b'Some decades ago, you would have heard a sustained outcry against such dire conditions among blacks, and there would have been loud demands for policy changes designed to bring more black Americans into the economic mainstream. You don\xe2\x80\x99t hear much of that now. Too many so-called black leaders are much more interested in invitations to the White House and positive profiles in mainstream publications than in raising any kind of ruckus that might benefit people in real trouble.'b'What the politicians and today\xe2\x80\x99s civil rights types won\xe2\x80\x99t tell you is that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking ahead to many long decades of grief and strife in America\xe2\x80\x99s black communities because of our failure to respond effectively to the horrendous impact of the Great Recession and the policies that led up to it. Black Americans are going backward economically, and right now no one is stepping up to stop the retreat.'b'United for a Fair Economy, in its latest \xe2\x80\x9cState of the Dream\xe2\x80\x9d report, which is released annually around the time of Dr. King\xe2\x80\x99s birthday, is urging Congress and the president to identify communities with the highest unemployment rates and develop specific job-creation initiatives for them.'b'That kind of targeted effort is desperately needed, but don\xe2\x80\x99t hold your breath. There is precious little sentiment for programs that would provide real help to communities trapped in the nightmarish depths of this downturn, whether the residents are mostly black, mostly white, mostly Hispanic, or whatever.'b'Speaking about one of his many antipoverty initiatives, Dr. King told Look magazine in 1968: \xe2\x80\x9cWe called our demonstration a campaign for jobs and income because we felt that the economic question was the most crucial that black people, and poor people generally, were confronting.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That was then. The loudest voices against poverty and economic injustice of all kinds have long since faded. The government, reclining comfortably on a vast cushion of campaign contributions, has allied itself with big business and the big banks against the interests of ordinary Americans. Millions upon millions of families are suffering, but mostly in silence.'b'We honor Dr. King with a national holiday, but his long campaign for economic justice has been all but forgotten.'b'When I was in college, I was assigned \xe2\x80\x9cLeviathan,\xe2\x80\x9d by Thomas Hobbes. On the cover was an image from the first edition of the book, published in 1651. It shows the British nation as a large man. The people make up the muscles and flesh. Then at the top, there is the king, who is the head and the mind.'b'When the Pilgrims left Britain to come to America, they left behind that metaphor as well. For these settlers, and the immigrants who have come since, the American nation is not a body with the government as the brain. Instead, America has been defined by its vast landscape and the sprawling energy of its entrepreneurs, scientists and community-builders.'b'In times of crisis, Americans rally around their government, but most of the time they have treated it as a supporting actor in national life. Americans are an unusual people, with less deference to central authority and an unparalleled faith in themselves. They seem to want a government that is helpful but not imperious, strong but subordinate.'b'Over the years, American voters have reacted against any party that threatens that basic sense of proportion. They have reacted against a liberalism that sought an enlarged and corrosive government and a conservatism that threatened to dismantle the government\xe2\x80\x99s supportive role.'b'A year ago, the country rallied behind a new president who promised to end the pendulumlike swings, who seemed likely to restore equilibrium with his moderate temper and pragmatic mind.'b'In many ways, Barack Obama has lived up to his promise. He has created a thoughtful, pragmatic administration marked by a culture of honest and vigorous debate. When Obama makes a decision, you can be sure that he has heard and accounted for every opposing argument. If he senses an important viewpoint is not represented at a meeting, he will stop the proceedings and demand that it gets included.'b'If the evidence leads him in directions he finds uncomfortable, he will still follow the evidence. He is beholden to no ideological camp, and there is no group in his political base that he has not angered at some point in his first year.'b'But his has become a voracious pragmatism. Driven by circumstances and self-confidence, the president has made himself the star performer in the national drama. He has been ubiquitous, appearing everywhere, trying to overhaul most sectors of national life: finance, health, energy, automobiles and transportation, housing, and education, among others.'b'He is no ideologue, but over the past year he has come to seem like the sovereign on the cover of \xe2\x80\x9cLeviathan\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the brain of the nation to which all the cells in the body and the nervous system must report and defer.'b'Americans, with their deep, vestigial sense of proportion, have reacted. The crucial movement came between April and June, when the president\xe2\x80\x99s approval rating among independents fell by 15 percentage points and the percentage of independents who regarded him as liberal or very liberal rose by 18 points. Since then, the public has rejected any effort to centralize authority or increase the role of government.'b'Trust in government has fallen. The share of Americans who say the country is on the wrong track has risen. The share who call themselves conservative has risen. The share who believe government is \xe2\x80\x9cdoing too many things better left to business\xe2\x80\x9d has risen.'b'The country is now split on Obama, because he is temperate, thoughtful and pragmatic, but his policies are almost all unpopular. If you aggregate the last seven polls on health care reform, 41 percent support it and 51 percent oppose.'b'Many Democrats, as always, are caught in their insular liberal information loop. They think the polls are bad simply because the economy is bad. They tell each other health care is unpopular because the people aren\xe2\x80\x99t sophisticated enough to understand it. Some believe they can still pass health care even if their candidate, Martha Coakley, loses the Senate race in Massachusetts on Tuesday.'b'That, of course, would be political suicide. It would be the act of a party so arrogant, elitist and contemptuous of popular wisdom that it would not deserve to govern. Marie Antoinette would applaud, but voters would rage.'b'The American people are not always right, but their basic sense of equilibrium is worthy of the profoundest respect. President Obama has shown himself to be a fine administrator, but he erred in trying to make himself the irreplaceable man in nearly ever sphere of public life. He erred in not sensing that even a pragmatic government could seem imperious and alarming.'b'If I were President Obama, I would spend the next year showing how government can serve a humble, helpful and supportive role to the central institutions of American life. Even in blue states like Massachusetts, voters want a government that is energetic but limited \xe2\x80\x94 a servant, not a leviathan.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Mr. Smith Rewrites the Constitution'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Jan. 11):'b'Thomas Geoghegan\xe2\x80\x99s article is right on the mark.

To be sure, it was lured into these unsavory missions by a truly insane monetary policy under which, most recently, the Federal Reserve purchased $1.5 trillion of longer-dated Treasury bonds and housing agency securities in less than a year. It was an unprecedented exercise in market-rigging with printing-press money, and it gave a sharp boost to the price of bonds and other securities held by banks, permitting them to book huge revenues from trading and bookkeeping gains.'b'Meanwhile, by fixing short-term interest rates at near zero, the Fed planted its heavy boot squarely in the face of depositors, as it shrank the banks\xe2\x80\x99 cost of production \xe2\x80\x94 their interest expense on depositor funds \xe2\x80\x94 to the vanishing point.'b'The resulting ultrasteep yield curve for banks is heralded, by a certain breed of Wall Street tout, as a financial miracle cure. Soon, it is claimed, a prodigious upwelling of profitability will repair bank balance sheets and bury toxic waste from the last bubble\xe2\x80\x99s collapse. But will it?'b'In supplying the banks with free deposit money (effectively, zero-interest loans), the savers of America are taking a $250 billion annual haircut in lost interest income. And the banks, after reaping this ill-deserved windfall, are pleased to pronounce themselves solvent, ignoring the bad  loans still on their books. This kind of Robin Hood redistribution in reverse is not sustainable. It requires permanently flooding world markets with cheap dollars \xe2\x80\x94 a recipe for the next bubble and financial crisis.'b'Moreover, rescuing the banks yet again, this time with a steeply sloped yield curve (that is, cheap short-term money and more expensive long-term rates), is not even a proper monetary policy action. It is a vast and capricious reallocation of national income, which would be hooted down in the halls of Congress, were it properly brought to a vote.'b'National economic policy has come to this absurd pass because for decades the Fed has juiced the banking system with excessive reserves. With this monetary fuel, the banks manufactured, aggressively at first and then recklessly, a tide of new loans and deposits. When Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cheart attack\xe2\x80\x9d struck in September 2008, bank liabilities had reached 100 percent of gross domestic product \xe2\x80\x94 double the ratio of a few decades earlier.'b'This was a measurement of the perilous extent to which bad investments, financed by debt, had come to distort the warp and woof of the economy. Behind the worthless  loans stands a vast assemblage of redundant housing units, shopping malls, office buildings, warehouses, tanning salons and fast food restaurants. These superfluous fixed assets had, over the past decade, given rise to a hothouse economy of jobs that have now vanished. Obviously, the legions of brokers, developers, appraisers, contractors, tradesmen and decorators who created the bad investments are long gone. But now the waitresses, yoga instructors, gardeners, repairmen, sales clerks, inventory managers, office workers and lift-truck drivers once thought needed to work at these places are disappearing into the unemployment statistics, as well.'b'The baleful reality is that the big banks, the freakish offspring of the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s easy  money, are dangerous institutions, deeply embedded in a bull market culture of entitlement and greed. This is why the Obama tax is welcome: its underlying policy message is that big banking must get smaller because it does too little that is useful, productive or efficient.'b'To argue, as some conservatives surely will, that a policy-directed shrinking  of big banking is an inappropriate interference in the marketplace is to miss a crucial point: the big Wall Street banks are wards of the state, not private enterprises. During recent quarters, for instance, the preponderant share of Goldman Sachs\xe2\x80\x99 revenues came from trading in bonds, currencies and commodities.'b'But these profits were not evidence of Mr. Market doing God\xe2\x80\x99s work, greasing the wheels of commerce and trade by facilitating productive financial transactions. In fact, they represented the fruits of hyperactive gambling in the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s monetary casino \xe2\x80\x94 a place where the inside players obtain their chips at no cost from the Fed-controlled money markets, and are warned well in advance, by obscure wording changes in the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s policy statements, about any pending shift in the gambling odds.'b'To be sure, the most direct way to cure the banking system\xe2\x80\x99s ills would be to return to a rational monetary policy based on sensible interest rates, an end to frantic monetization of federal debt and a stable exchange value for the dollar. But Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, and his posse are not likely to go there, believing as they do that central banking is about micromanaging aggregate demand \xe2\x80\x94 asset bubbles and a flagging dollar be damned. Still, there can be no doubt that taxing big bank liabilities will cause there to be less of them. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a start.'b'Chicago'b'WALL STREET is considering legal action to  prevent President Obama from imposing a new tax on bailed-out financial institutions. Because the law that created the Troubled Asset Relief Program compels the government to recoup the bailout money, it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely that banks will succeed in avoiding recompense. So rather than debate the constitutionality of the proposed tax, it is far more productive to design the best possible repayment plan.'b'The consequences of getting this right are huge: with a new tax, the administration aims to raise $90 billion over the next 10 years, which would do much to offset TARP\xe2\x80\x99s estimated $117 billion losses. We therefore suggest taxing banks based on the difference between their assets at the end of August 2008 and their current level of capital. After all, the support these firms received was based on the size of assets before the financial panic began, not the size of those assets today.'b'With the bailout money, the government wound up insuring the bondholders and other creditors of the financial institutions.  The tax we propose would allow the government to effectively collect insurance premiums now that should have been charged ahead of time. (Thus it exempts insurance companies and others that were not bailed out.)'b'Commercial banks might complain that they already pay a fee to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, making the new fee a double tax. That is partly correct, but the deposit insurance they paid for was underpriced. As a compromise, however, we suggest that the current year\xe2\x80\x99s deposit insurance payments be deducted from the new tax payments.'b'Because our version of the tax would require each firm to pay a tax proportionate to the size of its bailout, it would fall hardest on the former investment banks whose very survival was in doubt before the government stepped in. These firms are now making eye-popping profits and are on a path to pay record bonuses, but more importantly they had the most borrowed money that wound up being unexpectedly insured. This is why they ought to pay more.'b'Even TARP recipients that have repaid the bailout funds benefited from the stability the government provided, so they too would have to pay some portion of the tax. But our formula would lower the tax for organizations that have raised capital after August 2008 and would lower it further if they raise more. Regulators around the world have announced a preference for having banks raise more capital, and our tax has the advantage of reinforcing this goal.'b'By focusing on each institution\xe2\x80\x99s assets before the fall of Lehman Brothers almost brought down the system, our plan would make it impossible for banks to shrink their way out of the tax. Since the crisis, banks have been reluctant to take on more risk and lend; some have responded to losses by selling assets and not renewing loans, which has only exacerbated the economic downturn. Our approach would remove the incentive for such behavior because it ties the tax to the size of the firms when the government guarantees were so valuable.'b'Likewise, by focusing on the historical size of a bank, our plan would allow little room to engage in sham accounting transactions to sidestep the tax. As we saw  in the time leading up to the crisis, banks created many legally separate companies \xe2\x80\x94 the infamous \xe2\x80\x9cspecial purpose vehicles\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 to buy certain assets without having to put up the bank\xe2\x80\x99s capital to support them. If the banks had bought the assets directly they would have been required to hold more capital.'b'By August 2008, these tricks had been exposed; financial institutions can\xe2\x80\x99t retroactively cover such vehicles back up, or make themselves seem smaller than we know they were. Nor should they be able to avoid the tax by inventing any new tricks to change the appearance of their current size.'b'It is generally a bad idea to enact after-the-fact penalties. But giving away free insurance, as the government did during the bailout, is also bad. Our tax would merely ask financial institutions to finally pay for the insurance policy that kept them afloat.'b'SAN FRANCISCO'b'Gavin Newsom still looks glossy, like someone who\xe2\x80\x99d play J.F.K. in a Lifetime original movie.'b'But the 42-year-old mayor of San Francisco sees his once glowing political future in less glamorous terms.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, oh, God,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sipping green tea in his elegant office. \xe2\x80\x9cIn a couple of years, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see me as the clerk of a wine store.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to picture the lithe and charming Newsom  \xe2\x80\x94  with the well-cut suits, the electric Tesla, the beautiful blonde wife and baby  \xe2\x80\x94  advising a Pacific Heights couple on a cabernet with aromas of eucalyptus and mint.

I think he came around very recently, and I think there was some pragmatism to that as well, candidly.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I asked whether President Obama, who said at a Martin Luther King Jr. commemoration that the civil rights movement was partly about \xe2\x80\x9cchanging people\xe2\x80\x99s hearts and minds and breaking out of old customs and old habits,\xe2\x80\x9d had disappointed him given that the president is a triumph of civil rights himself.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t get in trouble here,\xe2\x80\x9d Newsom said with a playful wince. \xe2\x80\x9cI want him to succeed. But I am very upset by what he\xe2\x80\x99s not done in terms of rights of gays and lesbians. I understand it tactically in a campaign, but at this point I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. There is some belief that he actually doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in same-sex marriage. But it\xe2\x80\x99s fundamentally inexcusable for a member of the Democratic Party to stand on the principle that separate is now equal, but only on the basis of sexual orientation.

That is what the war over Google is really all about: It is a proxy and a symbol for whether the Chinese will be able to freely search and connect wherever their imaginations and creative impulses take them, which is critical for the future of Network China.'b'Have no doubt, China has some world-class networked companies that are \xe2\x80\x9cin the flow\xe2\x80\x9d already, such as Li &amp; Fung, a $14 billion apparel company with a network of 10,000 specialized business partners, and Dachangjiang, the motorcycle maker. The flows occurring on a daily basis in the networks of these Chinese companies to do design, product innovation and supply-chain management and to pool the best global expertise \xe2\x80\x9care unlike anything that U.S. companies have figured out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hagel.'b'The orchestrators of these networks, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cencourage participants to gather among themselves in an ad hoc fashion to address unexpected performance challenges, learn from each other and pull in outsiders as they need them. More traditional companies driven by a desire to protect and exploit knowledge stocks carefully limit the partners they deal with.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Command China has thrived up to now largely by perfecting the 20th-century model for low-cost manufacturing based on mining knowledge stocks and limiting flows. But China will only thrive in the 21st century  \xe2\x80\x94  and the Communist Party survive in power  \xe2\x80\x94  if it can get more of its firms to shift to the 21st-century model of Network China. That means enabling more and more Chinese people, universities and companies to participate in the world\xe2\x80\x99s great knowledge flows,  especially ones that connect well beyond the established industry and market boundaries.'b'Alas, though, China seems to be betting that it can straddle three impulses  \xe2\x80\x94  control flows for political reasons, maintain 20th-century Command Chinese factories for employment reasons and expand 21st-century Network China for growth reasons. But the contradictions within this straddle could undermine all three. The 20th-century Command model will be under pressure. The future belongs to those who promote richer and ever more diverse knowledge flows and develop the institutions and practices required to harness them.'b'So there you have it: Command China, which wants to censor Google, is working against Network China, which thrives on Google. For now, it looks as if Command China will have its way. If that turns out to be the case, then I\xe2\x80\x99d like to short the Communist Party.'b'Gov. David Paterson of New York presented a lean budget on Tuesday that is a necessarily austere response to the state\xe2\x80\x99s financial crisis. It is certain to make almost everybody unhappy.'b'The overall budget would grow by 0.6 percent, a miniscule increase by Albany\xe2\x80\x99s standards, to about $134 billion. Though the governor has promised (unwisely) that there will be no significant cuts to the state\xe2\x80\x99s work force, he would trim budgets for schools, health care, the environment and most other sectors of government. He asks for about $1 billion in new taxes.'b'Now comes the hard part: persuading the State Legislature to go along. Between now and the April 1 deadline for enacting 'b'the 2010-11 budget'b', legislators will be bombarded by complaints, and, if history holds, they will slip back into their old ways of adding a little here, a lot there and producing an unsustainably large budget. Mr. Paterson\xe2\x80\x99s biggest task will be to keep them in check.'b'Facing an estimated $7.4 billion deficit for the upcoming budget year, the governor proposes cutting $1.1 billion in school aid \xe2\x80\x94 a 5 percent reduction that is the largest proposed cut in education in two decades. The cuts are, properly, concentrated in richer, suburban areas, which means they will be vigorously opposed by state senators from Long Island.'b'He also proposes to slow the growth in Medicaid costs and to decrease spending for state agencies, including the poorly run youth prison system that is now facing a court challenge and federal investigation.'b'The new taxes would include a $1-per-pack addition to the $3.75 state tax on cigarettes and a penny-an-ounce levy on colas and other sugared beverages. The revenue from the cigarette tax is expected to collect $218 million a year, but the far more controversial soda tax could bring in as much as $465 million a year.'b'Both are useful ways to raise money, especially since the governor has promised to use the proceeds for health care. But he has proposed a soda tax before, then caved, after orchestrated industry protests across the state. This time, he should resist and keep the tax.'b''b'Other proposals'b' seem marginal and, indeed, could sidetrack the governor and Legislature from their primary mission, which is to pass a sensible budget. For example, Mr. Paterson wants to legalize mixed martial arts, popularly known as ultimate fighting, which he says would add $2.1 million to state accounts. That\xe2\x80\x99s peanuts, and hardly worth the legalization of a controversial \xe2\x80\x9csport.\xe2\x80\x9d It should be debated as a separate issue.'b'The governor also announced important reforms in higher education, giving state and city institutions much-needed authority to set their own tuition. That could be a hard sell with legislators who resist giving up control of any fund-raising mechanism.'b'Still, Mr. Paterson\xe2\x80\x99s budget makes sense and, for the most part, asks for shared sacrifice. That is a reasonable approach even though this is an election year, when reason does not routinely prevail. The governor has set himself a difficult but necessary task.'b'Americans have long known that the government has been running secretive immigration prisons into which detainees have frequently disappeared, their grave illnesses and injuries untreated, their fates undisclosed until well after early and unnecessary deaths.'b'What we did not know, until 'b'a recent article'b' in The Times by Nina Bernstein, was how strenuously the government has tried to cover up those failings \xe2\x80\x94 keeping relatives and lawyers in the dark, deflecting blame, fighting rigorous quality standards, outside oversight and transparency. These deficiencies endure today.'b'It took digging by The Times and the American Civil Liberties Union to unearth the evidence. A detainee with a broken leg killed himself; his pain had been unbearable but never treated, and someone later faked a medication log to show that he had been given Motrin. A spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement told a reporter asking after a mortally injured African detainee that nothing could be learned, even though the spokesman and top managers already knew the man had fallen, fractured his skull, lain untreated for more than 13 hours, was comatose and dying. The officials fretted by phone over how to avoid unflattering publicity.'b'Here, as evidence of the agency mind-set, is a spokesman\xe2\x80\x99s warning to his supervisors about a Washington Post reporter who was looking into detention deaths and the story of a man whose fatal cancer had been ignored and untreated:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThese are quite horrible medical stories, and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll need to have a pretty strong response to keep this from becoming a very damaging national story that takes on long legs.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The strong response? A misleading public-relations offensive designed to show that mortality in detention was less serious than it really was.'b'The Obama administration has since promised a top-to-bottom reform of the immense detention system, which was erected in sloppy haste during the Bush years, largely by private contractors that had dim regard for oversight and standards. John Morton, the leader of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has promised to create a system of civil detention suitable for inmates who are mostly not criminals.'b'But his agency has a long way to go. And it still is resisting adequate outside oversight and the adoption of legally binding detention standards, insisting instead that it can best change its own rules and police itself. The new disclosures about the agency\xe2\x80\x99s deep-set culture of shameful secrecy do not inspire confidence.'b'A few years ago, Cher, the entertainer, and Nicole Richie, the television personality, uttered brief expletives on separate music awards shows on Fox. The Federal Communications Commission ruled that the comments were indecent. A federal appeals court in New York is now considering the case. The court should rule that the F.C.C.\xe2\x80\x99s decision violates the First Amendment.'b'At the Billboard Music Awards in 2002, Cher directed a four-letter word at her critics. A year later, on the same show, Ms. Richie uttered two brief expletives while talking about a television series she was appearing on.'b'In 2006, the F.C.C. declared the two broadcasts legally indecent, though it did not impose sanctions \xe2\x80\x94 in line with an indecency policy adopted in 2004 when the commission abandoned its longstanding practice of giving legal immunity to so-called fleeting expletives.'b'Fox challenged the ruling,  and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, found that the commission\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning was legally inadequate. The United States Supreme Court reversed that decision by a 5-to-4 vote last year. But it left open the possibility that the F.C.C.\xe2\x80\x99s ruling may have been unconstitutional. A three-judge panel of the appellate court heard oral arguments in Fox\xe2\x80\x99s First Amendment challenge last week.'b'The F.C.C.\xe2\x80\x99s indecency policy is hopelessly vague. Indecency was once limited to forms of expression that were truly outrageous. Now the commission considers itself free to pick and choose among not particularly shocking content based on its opinion about the words and the context.'b'The same epithet that the commission regards as indecent when Cher says it on an awards show may not be considered indecent when showing the movie \xe2\x80\x9cSaving Private Ryan.\xe2\x80\x9d Broadcasters have no way of knowing in advance what sort of content will upset the F.C.C.\xe2\x80\x99s indecency police \xe2\x80\x94 and possibly subject them to enormous financial penalties. When the government punishes speech with vague rules, it has a chilling effect on expression of all kinds. Speakers, unclear on where the lines are, and fearing sanctions, have a strong incentive to avoid engaging in speech that is legally protected.'b'It is always risky to try to predict  a case\xe2\x80\x99s outcome from oral argument. But it appears that the judges who heard this case understood that the commission\xe2\x80\x99s highly subjective standard violates the Constitution.'b'Just more than a year ago, one billion gallons of toxic coal sludge broke loose from a containment pond belonging to the Tennessee Valley Authority, burying hundreds of acres of Roane County in eastern Tennessee and threatening local water supplies and air quality. The Environmental Protection Agency immediately promised new national standards governing the disposal of coal ash to replace a patchwork of uneven \xe2\x80\x94 and in many cases weak \xe2\x80\x94 state regulations.'b'The agency\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations, which have not been made public, are now the focus of a huge dispute inside the Obama administration, with industry lobbying hard for changes that would essentially preserve the status quo. The dispute should be resolved in favor of the environment and public safety.'b'America\xe2\x80\x99s power plants produce 130 million tons of coal ash a year, enough to fill a train of boxcars stretching from the District of Columbia to Australia. Some of this is usefully, safely and profitably recycled to make concrete and other construction materials. Much of it winds up in lightly regulated landfills, some as big as 1,500 acres, where toxic pollutants like arsenic and lead can leach into the water table.'b'One internal E.P.A. proposal suggested reclassifying coal ash as a hazardous material subject to federal regulation. It also recommended national standards requiring safe, sturdy disposal facilities. Industry counterattacked, arguing that the hazardous designation would ruin the recycling market and could trigger burdensome new investments. It also argued for continued state control, with the federal government providing \xe2\x80\x9cguidance.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'These arguments do not hold up. The recycling market will not disappear. Materials that are responsibly recycled are not, typically, designated as hazardous. The real problem is the 60 percent or so of the coal ash that winds up in porous landfills. Evidence suggests that tough but carefully tailored rules could encourage even more recycling, protecting the environment while yielding income to help pay for more secure landfills.'b'This debate is being conducted behind closed doors, mainly at the Office of Management and Budget, where industry usually takes its complaints and horror stories. A better course would be to let the E.P.A. draft a proposal, get it out in the open and offer it for comment from all sides. The Obama administration promised that transparency and good science would govern decisions like these.'b'An Op-Ed article on Friday, about faults, incorrectly described the location of Sichuan Province, the site of a 2008 earthquake. It is in southwestern China, not eastern China.'b'If anyone should have seen it coming in Massachusetts, it is President Obama \xe2\x80\x94 the long-shot candidate who rode to electoral victory on a wave of popular impatience and an ability to identify and address voters\xe2\x80\x99 core anxieties.'b'There are many theories about the import of Scott Brown\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'upset victory'b' in the race for Edward Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s former Senate seat. To our minds, it is not remotely a verdict on Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s presidency, nor does it amount to a national referendum on health care reform \xe2\x80\x94 even though it has upended the effort to pass a reform bill, which Mr. Obama made the centerpiece of his first year.'b'Mr. Obama has done many important things on the environment, and in foreign affairs, and in preventing the nation\xe2\x80\x99s banking system from collapsing in the face of a financial crisis he inherited. But he seems to have lost touch with two core issues for Americans: their jobs and their homes.'b'Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s challenge is that most Americans are not seeing a recovery. They are seeing 10 percent unemployment and a continuing crisis in the housing market. They have watched as the federal government rescued banks, financial firms and auto companies, but they themselves feel adrift, still awaiting the kind of decisive leadership on jobs and housing \xe2\x80\x94 in terms of both style and substance \xe2\x80\x94 that Mr. Obama promised in 2008.'b'Mr. Obama was right to press for health care reform. But he spent too much time talking to reluctant Democrats and Republicans who never had the slightest intention of supporting him. He sat on the sidelines while the Republicans bombarded Americans with false but effective talk of death panels and a government takeover of their doctors\xe2\x80\x99 offices. And he did not make the case strongly enough that the health care system and the economy are deeply interconnected or explain why Americans should care about this huge issue in the midst of a recession: If they lose their jobs, they lose their health insurance.'b'Mr. Obama has not said or done the right thing often enough when it comes to job creation and housing. He appointed an economics team that was entwined with the people and policies that nearly destroyed the economy. He made compromises that resulted in a stimulus bill that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t big enough or properly targeted. Even now, despite a new, rather awkward populist tone, serious relief for homeowners is lacking and financial regulatory reform is in danger of being hijacked by banking lobbyists and partisan politics.'b'The victory by Mr. Brown, a Republican, should be setting off alarms in the White House. Most immediately, it jeopardizes passage of the reform that the nation desperately needs. The Democrats could try to get the House to pass the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s bill, although their chances seem dim, or as Mr. Obama seemed to suggest on Wednesday, they could seek a stripped-down measure that could win bipartisan support.  They certainly should not try to ram a combined House-Senate bill through the Senate before Mr. Brown is sworn in.'b'The Democrats had an exceptionally weak candidate in Massachusetts, but the results call into question their tactical political competence. The party now has less than 10 months to get it right before the midterm elections, when they are in danger of losing more seats in the House and the Senate. It is indisputable that the Republicans have settled on a tactic of obstruction, disinformation and fear-mongering, but it is equally indisputable that the Democrats have not countered it well.'b'Mr. Obama has three years to show the kind of vision and leadership on the economy that got him elected \xe2\x80\x94 not just because his chances of a second term are at stake, but because the nation needs to get a handle on joblessness and mortgages or the nascent economic recovery could turn into a lost decade or a double-dip recession, or both.'b'The president is fighting hard for a consumer financial protection agency, in part because he sees it as one element of financial reform that people will understand. What Mr. Obama has to understand is that the agency is unlikely to be as effective as he intends unless other parts of financial reform \xe2\x80\x94 regulating derivatives and limiting \xe2\x80\x9ctoo big too fail\xe2\x80\x9d banks \xe2\x80\x94 also are robust. And homeowners need mortgage relief \xe2\x80\x94 not just lower interest rates, but the ability to renegotiate and restructure their loan balances.'b'We admire Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence and the careful way he makes decisions. It is reported that he seeks out dissenting views doggedly. He tells Americans the truth. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want Mr. Obama to turn into a hot populist, but he can be too cool and often waits too long to react at big moments. If White House reporters are still making jokes two years from now about checking the president\xe2\x80\x99s pulse, the nation will be in big trouble.'b'The Food and Drug Administration has raised its level of concern over the safety of bisphenol-A, or BPA, an industrial chemical found in baby bottles and the linings of canned goods and other consumer products. That is a welcome shift in attitude by an agency that seemed bent, during the Bush administration, on minimizing the potential for harm. But it sheds little light, for now, on how dangerous the chemical might be in the small amounts that leach out and are imbibed by infants and older people \xe2\x80\x94 or how rigorously it should be regulated.'b'In August 2008, the Bush-era F.D.A. released a draft report asserting that the small amounts of BPA that leach into milk or food are not dangerous. One month later, the National Toxicology Program, an interagency assessment group, came to a less reassuring conclusion. It expressed \xe2\x80\x9csome concern\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 midway between \xe2\x80\x9cnegligible concern\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cserious concern\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 about the potential effects on the brain, behavior and prostate in fetuses, infants and children. Now the F.D.A. has also expressed \xe2\x80\x9csome concern\xe2\x80\x9d about the same risks.'b'Still, the message remained murky. Health officials said they have no proof that the chemical has harmed either children or adults. They have not taken any regulatory action to curb its use. Nor have they urged families to change their use of infant formula or foods because the benefit of good nutrition outweighs the potential risk from BPA exposure.'b'Instead, the two agencies will conduct crucial research on the safety of BPA over the next 18 to 24 months to reduce \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial uncertainties\xe2\x80\x9d in assessing the risks of low-dose exposures. And the F.D.A. will seek more robust and flexible regulatory authority to clamp down on the chemical if the evidence warrants.'b'Meanwhile, the agency is suggesting ways that people can limit exposure to BPA (such as not putting very hot liquids into bottles or cups containing BPA). The six largest manufacturers, in response to consumer preferences, are already producing baby bottles without BPA.'b'Canada has banned BPA from children\xe2\x80\x99s products. And several states, counties and local jurisdictions have bans or restrictions on several uses of BPA in various products. Bills are pending in Congress to do the same.'b'While waiting for the regulators to amass more conclusive evidence, wise consumers will try to avoid BPA.'b'After more than a century of obstruction and delays, still another deadline looms for a settlement that would compensate hundreds of thousands of American Indians for billions of dollars lost by a government that failed miserably to manage tribal lands that had been entrusted to it.'b'A law passed in 1887 conveyed the land in trust to the federal government. The government-controlled trust accounts were mishandled and lost, cheating the Indian owners out of fees from grazing livestock and gas and oil royalties.'b'Last month, after 13 years of court wrangling, 'b'both sides agreed'b' to a historic settlement that would pay $3.4 billion to the Indians. The settlement would provide partial compensation of $1.4 billion to individual holders of the trusts, plus $2 billion more to fractional claimants.'b'By any measure, this was a bargain for the federal government and a small fraction of what is actually owed to the tribes, which agreed to the deal after watching the years roll by, and generations expire, without economic justice.'b'The settlement needs Congressional approval, but Congress \xe2\x80\x94 its agenda clogged with health care and myriad pressing issues \xe2\x80\x94 missed one deadline in December and now confronts another. Failure to approve the deal by the end of February risks throwing the dispute back into fresh rounds of negotiations.'b'The nation\xe2\x80\x99s honor demands that the settlement finally be approved. Surely this Congress does not wish to join the long line of administrations, lawmakers and paternalistic bureaucracies that have made a shell game of justice for American Indians.'b'We are all used to miniaturization in our daily lives  \xe2\x80\x94 the steady shrinking of the electronic tools we use, like telephones and video screens. But what happens when  miniaturization reaches the natural world?'b'The best example is new research on the migratory patterns of the Arctic tern, using a minute electronic device designed by engineers at the British Antarctic Survey. Called a geolocator, the device weighs 1.4 grams, or about 0.05 ounce, and is about the size of a tiny halogen bulb. Affixed to the tern\xe2\x80\x99s leg, the geolocator measures variations in light levels as the bird flies \xe2\x80\x94 data it compresses and stores, creating a map of the tern\xe2\x80\x99s movements.'b'And what a map it is! Ornithologists had guessed at the range of the tern\xe2\x80\x99s migration, but evidence drawn from geolocators confirms that it is almost certainly the longest of any species on the planet \xe2\x80\x94 about 44,000 miles round trip from breeding sites in Iceland and Greenland to its wintering sites in the marginal ice near Antarctica.'b'The long, looping migration, which averages more than 300 miles a day, includes a monthlong hiatus in the North Atlantic. There was no single migratory pattern. Some birds followed the coast of Africa south, while others tracked the eastern edge of South America. The shape of the route is determined both by the biological richness of the waters they pass and by global wind patterns.'b'Our ability to track the movement of Arctic terns does not yet translate into an understanding of how they map the world for themselves. And for all our increasing ability to follow the movements of a creature as expeditionary as this, it still takes all our imagination even to begin to guess what it must be like to have both poles, and the winds and seas between them, as one\xe2\x80\x99s proper habitation.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'G.O.P.

Pat Robertson, the religious broadcaster, went furthest by suggesting that Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s earthquake flowed from a pact with the devil more than two centuries ago. While it\xe2\x80\x99s not for a journalist to nitpick a minister\xe2\x80\x99s theological credentials, that implication of belated seismic revenge on Haitian children seems defamatory of God.'b'Americans have also responded with a huge outpouring of assistance, including more than $22 million raised by the Red Cross from text messages alone. But for those with doubts, let\xe2\x80\x99s have a frank discussion of Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s problems:'b''b'Why is Haiti so poor? Is it because Haitians are dimwitted or incapable of getting their act together?'b''b'Haiti isn\xe2\x80\x99t impoverished because the devil got his due; it\xe2\x80\x99s impoverished partly because of debts due.

A few dozen major shirt factories could be transformational for Haiti.'b'So in the coming months as we help Haitians rebuild, let\xe2\x80\x99s dispatch not only aid workers, but also business investors.

I wonder how long we will have to be so cautious, and I long for normalcy.'b'We sleep; we listen to the radio; we exchange information. Mostly, we have been trying to stay alive and sane since that Tuesday afternoon a week ago when the earthquake changed our lives forever.

That same day, a grief-stricken family identified the body of a 27-year-old mother of a 6-month-old girl, who was not so lucky.'b'In the evening, the digging for bodies ceases, as does the search for drinking water and food, for news about missing parents and friends. Tired; terrified of the dark and its dreams of tremors, of the morning and its bad news; secretly \xe2\x80\x94 or not \xe2\x80\x94 relieved to be alive, we try to sleep.'b'In the background, the few radio stations that can still broadcast convey the messages of agonized families and friends. A father comes all the way from a little village in the south of Haiti looking for his two daughters. Although his voice is breaking, he manages to enunciate their names and please could 'b'somebody, anybody'b' tell him if they are alive? The newscaster quickly repeats the message and introduces someone else. There are so many of them, a litany of desperate voices.'b'Night settles. The stars provide the only light; the electricity has not been restored. We save the energy from our Inverter generator system to run the Internet, so we can stay in contact with friends and family. The telephone lines are unreliable.'b'But we Haitians are nevertheless connected \xe2\x80\x94 regardless of our social conditions, our economic status, our religious beliefs, if only because we share the same uncertainties, the same fears about the monstrous size of the task at hand.'b'Although the earthquake does remind us of our common and fragile destiny, the fact that the earth trembles and destroys with equal brutality luxurious and shabby houses, small and huge enterprises, does not obscure the inequalities that divide Haiti. Social and economic disparities, the unjust distribution of our resources and the dire poverty of the majority of the population cannot magically evaporate with the dust. But maybe this disaster will constitute a new beginning. Maybe the reconstruction effort that is now so urgent will also work to narrow the gaps between us.'b'It is with a sense of warmth that I think of all the messages of solidarity I have received from around the world. Like most Haitians, I marvel at the signs of humanity \xe2\x80\x94 fund-raisers, simple letters of sympathy, offers of help: \xe2\x80\x9cJust tell me what you need!\xe2\x80\x9d But it is our government\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to help those most in need.'b'I am focusing now on what is essential in life: love and friendship. Like most people here, I am not watching the news. We have limited power, and anyway it seems futile and even absurd to be a spectator of my own life, especially when the TV images highlight only the misery of our country. Many of us Haitians are offended by the coverage of the earthquake. Once more, a natural disaster serves as an occasion to showcase the impoverishment, to exaggerate the scenes of violence that are common to any catastrophe of this type.'b'No, I am not watching the news. I am too busy trying to find a way to keep my hope alive because the work in front of us is humongous. I am busy rejoicing in the laughter of the children in the camp near our house, smiling at the comical reactions of a passer-by after a recent aftershock. I am busy shedding tears at the news of a miraculous rescue of six students from the wreckage of a university building. I am busy collecting the fragments of life that reflect the enormous courage and resilience among us.'b'I am busy loving life and my country.'b'TOMORROW will be one year since President Obama signed an executive order outlawing torture, yet our debate about interrogation methods continues. Though the president deserves praise for improving matters, the changes were not as drastic as most Americans think, and elements of our interrogation policy continue to be both inhumane and counterproductive.'b'Americans can now boast that they no longer \xe2\x80\x9ctorture\xe2\x80\x9d detainees, but they cannot say that detainees are not abused, or even that their treatment meets the minimum standards of humane treatment mandated by the Geneva Conventions, the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (the so-called McCain amendment), United States and international law, or even Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s executive order.'b'If I were to return to one of the war zones today \xe2\x80\x94 as an Air Force officer, I was sent to Iraq to head an interrogation team in 2006 \xe2\x80\x94 I would still be allowed to abuse prisoners. This is true even though in my experience, torture or even harsh but legal treatment never got us useful information. Instead, such tactics invariably did just the opposite, convincing detainees to clam up.'b'The adoption last year of the Army Field Manual as the standard for interrogations across the government, including the C.I.A., was a considerable improvement. But we missed a unique opportunity for progress last August when the president\xe2\x80\x99s task force on interrogations recommended no changes to the manual, which was hastily revised in 2006 in the aftermath of the Abu Ghraib torture scandal.'b'For example, 'b'an appendix to the manual'b' allows the military to keep a detainee in \xe2\x80\x9cseparation\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 solitary confinement \xe2\x80\x94 indefinitely. It requires only that a general approve any extension after 30 days. Rest assured, there will be numerous waivers to even that minuscule requirement.'b'Yes, there are legitimate reasons to isolate detainees. Domestic law enforcement agencies do it to prevent suspects from colluding on alibis and allow investigators the leverage to use non-coercive interrogation techniques like confronting one detainee with the other\xe2\x80\x99s statements.'b'But military interrogators do not operate in a vacuum. The consequences of their actions have far-reaching effects \xe2\x80\x94 like  Al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s exploitation of American abuse of prisoners as a recruiting tool. And, in any case, extended solitary confinement is torture, as confirmed by many scientific studies. Even the initial 30 days of isolation could be considered abuse.'b'If we truly wanted to come up with a humane limit on solitary confinement, we would look at the Golden Rule: what would we consider inhumane treatment if one of our own soldiers were captured by the enemy? My answer: Given the youth of our men and women in uniform, that number is probably around two weeks. This limit, however, should be determined by medical professionals, not soldiers or politicians.'b'The Army Field Manual also does not explicitly prohibit stress positions, putting detainees into close confinement or environmental manipulation (other than hypothermia and \xe2\x80\x9cheat injury\xe2\x80\x9d). These omissions open a window of opportunity for abuse.'b'The manual also allows limiting detainees to just four hours of sleep in 24 hours. Let\xe2\x80\x99s face it: extended captivity with only four hours of sleep a night (consider detainees at Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay who have been held for seven years) does not meet the minimum standard of humane treatment, either in terms of American law or simple human decency.'b'And if this weren\xe2\x80\x99t enough, some interrogators feel the manual\xe2\x80\x99s language gives them a loophole that allows them to give a detainee four hours of sleep and then conduct a 20-hour interrogation, after which they can \xe2\x80\x9creset\xe2\x80\x9d the clock and begin another 20-hour interrogation followed by four hours of sleep. This is inconsistent with the spirit of the reforms, which was to prevent \xe2\x80\x9cmonstering\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 extended interrogation sessions lasting more than 20 hours. American interrogators are more than capable of doing their jobs without the loopholes.'b'The Field Manual, to its credit, calls for \xe2\x80\x9call captured and detained personnel, regardless of status\xe2\x80\x9d to be \xe2\x80\x9ctreated humanely.\xe2\x80\x9d But when it comes to the specifics the manual contradicts itself, allowing actions that no right-thinking person could consider humane.'b'The greatest shame of the last year, perhaps, is that the argument over interrogations has shifted from debating what is legal to considering what is just \xe2\x80\x9cbetter than before.\xe2\x80\x9d The best way to change things is to update the field manual again to bring our treatment of detainees up to the minimum standard of humane treatment.'b'The next version of the manual should prohibit solitary confinement for more than, say, two weeks, all stress positions and forms of environmental manipulation,  imprisonment in tight spaces and sleep deprivation. Unless we rewrite the book, we will only continue to give Al Qaeda a recruiting tool, to earn the contempt of our allies and to debase our most cherished ideals.'b'With a single, disastrous 5-to-4 ruling, the Supreme Court has thrust politics back to the robber-baron era of the 19th century. Disingenuously waving the flag of the First Amendment, the court\xe2\x80\x99s conservative majority has paved the way for corporations to use their vast treasuries to overwhelm elections and intimidate elected officials into doing their bidding.'b'Congress must act immediately to limit the damage of this radical decision, which strikes at the heart of democracy.'b'As a result of 'b'Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s ruling'b', corporations have been unleashed from the longstanding ban against their spending directly on political campaigns and will be free to spend as much money as they want to elect and defeat candidates. If a member of Congress tries to stand up to a wealthy special interest, its lobbyists can credibly threaten: We\xe2\x80\x99ll spend whatever it takes to defeat you.'b'The ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission radically reverses well-established law and erodes a wall that has stood for a century between corporations and electoral politics. (The ruling also frees up labor unions to spend, though they have far less money at their disposal.)'b'The founders of this nation warned about the dangers of corporate influence. The Constitution they wrote mentions many things and assigns them rights and protections \xe2\x80\x94 the people, militias, the press, religions. But it does not mention corporations.'b'In 1907, as corporations reached new heights of wealth and power, Congress made its views of the relationship between corporations and campaigning clear: It banned them from contributing to candidates. At midcentury, it enacted the broader ban on spending that was repeatedly reaffirmed over the decades until it was struck down on Thursday.'b'This issue should never have been before the court. The justices overreached and seized on a case involving a narrower, technical question involving the broadcast of a movie that attacked Hillary Rodham Clinton during the 2008 campaign. The court elevated that case to a forum for striking down the entire ban on corporate spending and then rushed the process of hearing the case at breakneck speed. It gave lawyers a month to prepare briefs on an issue of enormous complexity, and it scheduled arguments during its vacation.'b'Chief Justice John Roberts Jr., no doubt aware of how sharply these actions clash with his confirmation-time vow to be judicially modest and simply \xe2\x80\x9ccall balls and strikes,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote a separate opinion trying to excuse the shameless judicial overreaching.'b'The majority is deeply wrong on the law. Most wrongheaded of all is its insistence that corporations are just like people and entitled to the same First Amendment rights. It is an odd claim since companies are creations of the state that exist to make money. They are given special privileges, including different tax rates, to do just that. It was a fundamental misreading of the Constitution to say that these artificial legal constructs have the same right to spend money on politics as ordinary Americans have to speak out in support of a candidate.'b'The majority also makes the nonsensical claim that, unlike campaign contributions, which are still prohibited, independent expenditures by corporations \xe2\x80\x9cdo not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.\xe2\x80\x9d If Wall Street bankers told members of Congress that they would spend millions of dollars to defeat anyone who opposed their bailout, and then did so, it would certainly look corrupt.'b'After the court heard the case, Senator John McCain told reporters that he was troubled by the \xe2\x80\x9cextreme na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x9d some of the justices showed about the role of special-interest money in Congressional lawmaking.'b'In dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens warned that the ruling not only threatens democracy but \xe2\x80\x9cwill, I fear, do damage to this institution.\xe2\x80\x9d History is, indeed, likely to look harshly not only on the decision but the court that delivered it. The Citizens United ruling is likely to be viewed as a shameful bookend to Bush v. Gore. With one 5-to-4 decision, the court\xe2\x80\x99s conservative majority stopped valid votes from being counted to ensure the election of a conservative president. Now a similar conservative majority has distorted the political system to ensure that Republican candidates will be at an enormous advantage in future elections.'b'Congress and members of the public who care about fair elections and clean government need to mobilize right away, a cause President Obama has said he would join. Congress should repair the presidential public finance system and create another one for Congressional elections to help ordinary Americans contribute to campaigns. It should also enact a law requiring publicly traded corporations to get the approval of their shareholders before spending on political campaigns.'b'These would be important steps, but they would not be enough. The real solution lies in getting the court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling overturned. The four dissenters made an eloquent case for why the decision was wrong on the law and dangerous. With one more vote, they could rescue democracy.'b'HAITI is everybody\xe2\x80\x99s cherished tragedy. Long before the great earthquake struck the country like a vengeful god, the outside world, and Americans especially, described, defined, marked Haiti most of all by its suffering. Epithets of misery clatter after its name like a ball and chain: Poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. One of the poorest on earth. For decades Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s formidable immiseration has made it among outsiders an object of fascination, wonder and awe. Sometimes the pity that is attached to the land \xe2\x80\x94 and we see this increasingly in the news coverage this past week \xe2\x80\x94 attains a tone almost sacred, as if Haiti has taken its place as a kind of sacrificial victim among nations, nailed in its bloody suffering to the cross of unending destitution.'b'And yet there is nothing mystical in Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s pain, no inescapable curse that haunts the land. From independence and before, Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s harms have been caused by men, not demons. Act of nature that it was, the earthquake last week was able to kill so many because of the corruption and weakness of the Haitian state, a state built for predation and plunder. Recovery can come only with vital, even heroic, outside help; but such help, no matter how inspiring the generosity it embodies, will do little to restore Haiti unless it addresses, as countless prior interventions built on transports of sympathy have not, the man-made causes that lie beneath the Haitian malady.'b'In 1804 the free Republic of Haiti was declared in almost unimaginable triumph: hard to exaggerate the glory of that birth. Hundreds of thousands of enslaved Africans had labored to make Saint-Domingue, as Haiti was then known, the richest colony on earth, a vastly productive slave-powered factory producing tons upon tons of sugar cane, the 18th-century\xe2\x80\x99s great cash crop. For pre-Revolutionary France, Haiti was an inexhaustible cash cow, floating much of its economy. Generation after generation, the second sons of the great French families took ship for Saint-Domingue to preside over the sugar plantations, enjoy the favors of enslaved African women and make their fortunes.'b'Even by the standards of the day, conditions in Saint-Domingue\xe2\x80\x99s cane fields were grisly and brutal; slaves died young, and in droves; they had few children. As exports of sugar and coffee boomed, imports of fresh Africans boomed with them. So by the time the slaves launched their great revolt in 1791, most of those half-million blacks had been born in Africa, spoke African languages, worshipped African gods.'b'In an immensely complex decade-long conflict, these African slave-soldiers, commanded by legendary leaders like Toussaint Louverture and Jean-Jacques Dessalines, defeated three Western armies, including the unstoppable superpower of the day, Napoleonic France. In an increasingly savage war \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cBurn houses! Cut off heads!\xe2\x80\x9d was the slogan of Dessalines \xe2\x80\x94 the slaves murdered their white masters, or drove them from the land.'b'On Jan. 1, 1804, when Dessalines created the Haitian flag by tearing the white middle from the French tricolor, he achieved what even Spartacus could not: he had led to triumph the only successful slave revolt in history. Haiti became the world\xe2\x80\x99s first independent black republic and the second independent nation in the Western Hemisphere.'b'Alas, the first such republic, the United States, despite its revolutionary creed that \xe2\x80\x9call men are created equal,\xe2\x80\x9d looked upon these self-freed men with shock, contempt and fear. Indeed, to all the great Western trading powers of the day \xe2\x80\x94 much of whose wealth was built on the labor of enslaved Africans \xe2\x80\x94 Haiti stood as a frightful example of freedom carried too far. American slaveholders desperately feared that Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s fires of revolt would overleap those few hundred miles of sea and inflame their own human chattel.'b'For this reason, the United States refused for nearly six decades even to recognize Haiti. (Abraham Lincoln finally did so in 1862.) Along with the great colonial powers, America instead rewarded Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s triumphant slaves with a suffocating trade embargo \xe2\x80\x94 and a demand that in exchange for peace the fledgling country pay enormous reparations to its former colonial overseer. Having won their freedom by force of arms, Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s former slaves would be made to purchase it with treasure.'b'The new nation, its fields burned, its plantation manors pillaged, its towns devastated by apocalyptic war, was crushed by the burden of these astronomical reparations, payments that, in one form or another, strangled its economy for more than a century. It was in this dark aftermath of war, in the shadow of isolation and contempt, that Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s peculiar political system took shape, mirroring in distorted form, like a wax model placed too close to the fire, the slave society of colonial times.'b'At its apex, the white colonists were supplanted by a new ruling class, made up largely of black and mulatto officers. Though these groups soon became bitter political rivals, they were as one in their determination to maintain in independent Haiti the cardinal principle of governance inherited from Saint-Domingue: the brutal predatory extraction of the country\xe2\x80\x99s wealth by a chosen powerful few.'b'The whites on their plantations had done this directly, exploiting the land they owned with the forced labor of their slaves. But the slaves had become soldiers in a victorious revolution, and those who survived demanded as their reward a part of the rich land on which they had labored and suffered. Soon after independence most of the great plantations were broken up, given over to the former slaves, establishing Haiti as a nation of small landowners, one whose isolated countryside remained, in language, religion and culture, largely African.'b'Unable to replace the whites in their plantation manors, Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s new elite moved from owning the land to fighting to control the one institution that could tax its products: the government. While the freed slaves worked their small fields, the powerful drew off the fruits of their labor through taxes. In this disfigured form the colonial philosophy endured: ruling had to do not with building or developing the country but with extracting its wealth. \xe2\x80\x9cPluck the chicken,\xe2\x80\x9d proclaimed Dessalines \xe2\x80\x94 now Emperor Jacques I \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cbut don\xe2\x80\x99t make it scream.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In 1806, two years after independence, the emperor was bayoneted by a mostly mulatto cabal of officers. Haitian history became the immensely complex tale of factional struggles to control the state, with factions often defined by an intricate politics of skin color. There was no method of succession ultimately recognized as legitimate, no tradition of loyal opposition. Politics was murderous, operatic, improvisational. Instability alternated with autocracy. The state was battled over and won; Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s wealth, once seized, purchased allegiance \xe2\x80\x94 but only for a time. Fragility of rule and uncertainty of tenure multiplied the imperative to plunder. Unseated rulers were sometimes killed, more often exiled, but always their wealth \xe2\x80\x94 that part of it not sent out of the country \xe2\x80\x94 was pillaged in its turn.'b'In 1915 the whites returned: the United States Marines disembarked to enforce continued repayment of the original debt and to put an end to an especially violent struggle for power that, in the shadow of World War I and German machinations in the Caribbean, suddenly seemed to threaten American interests. During their nearly two decades of rule, the Americans built roads and bridges, centralized the Haitian state \xe2\x80\x94 setting the stage for the vast conurbation of greater Port-au-Prince that we see today in all its devastation \xe2\x80\x94 and sent Haitians abroad to be educated as agronomists and doctors in the hope of building a more stable middle class.'b'Still, by the time they finally left, little in the original system had fundamentally changed. Haitian nationalism, piqued by the reappearance of white masters who had forced Haitians to work in road gangs, produced the noiriste movement that finally brought to power in 1957 Fran\xc3\xa7ois Duvalier, the most brilliant and bloody of Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s dictators, who murdered tens of thousands while playing adroitly on cold-war America\xe2\x80\x99s fear of communism to win American acceptance.'b'Duvalier\xe2\x80\x99s epoch, which ended with the overthrow of his son Jean-Claude in 1986, ushered in Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s latest era of instability, which has seen, in barely a quarter-century, several coups and revolutions, a handful of elections (aborted, rigged and, occasionally, fair), a second American occupation (whose accomplishments were even more ephemeral than the first) and, all told, a dozen Haitian rulers. Less and less money now comes from the land, for Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s topsoil has grown enfeebled from overproduction and lack of investment. Aid from foreigners, nations or private organizations, has largely supplanted it: under the Duvaliers Haiti became the great petri dish of foreign aid. A handful of projects have done lasting good; many have been self-serving and even counterproductive. All have helped make it possible, by lifting basic burdens of governance from Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s powerful, for the predatory state to endure.'b'The struggle for power has not ended. Nor has Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s historic proclivity for drama and disaster. Undertaken in their wake, the world\xe2\x80\x99s interventions \xe2\x80\x94 military and civilian, and accompanied as often as not by a grand missionary determination to \xe2\x80\x9crebuild Haiti\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 have had as their single unitary principle their failure to alter what is most basic in the country, the reality of a corrupt state and the role, inadvertent or not, of outsiders in collaborating with it.'b'The sound of Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s suffering is deafening now but behind it one can hear already a familiar music begin to play. Haiti must be made new. This kind of suffering so close to American shores cannot be countenanced. The other evening I watched a television correspondent shake his head over what he movingly described as a \xe2\x80\x9cstupid death\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a death that, but for the right medical care, could have been prevented. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to happen,\xe2\x80\x9d he told viewers. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople died today who did not need to die.\xe2\x80\x9d He did not say what any Haitian could have told him: that the day before, and the day before that, Haiti had seen hundreds of such \xe2\x80\x9cstupid deaths,\xe2\x80\x9d and, over the centuries, thousands more. What has changed, once again, and only for a time, is the light shone on them, and the volume of the voices demanding that a \xe2\x80\x9cnew Haiti\xe2\x80\x9d must now be built so they never happen again.'b'Whether they can read or not, Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s people walk in history, and live in politics. They are independent, proud, fiercely aware of their own singularity. What distinguishes them is a tradition of heroism and a conviction that they are and will remain something distinct, apart \xe2\x80\x94 something you can hear in the Creole spoken in the countryside, or the voodoo practiced there, traces of the Africa that the first generation of revolutionaries brought with them on the middle passage.'b'Haitians have grown up in a certain kind of struggle for individuality and for power, and the country has proved itself able to absorb the ardent attentions of outsiders who, as often as not, remain blissfully unaware of their own contributions to what Haiti is. Like the ruined bridges strewn across the countryside \xe2\x80\x94 one of the few traces of the Marines and their occupation nearly a century ago \xe2\x80\x94 these attentions tend to begin in evangelical zeal and to leave little lasting behind.'b'What might, then? America could start by throwing open its markets to Haitian agricultural produce and manufactured goods, broadening and making permanent the provisions of a promising trade bill negotiated in 2008. Such a step would not be glamorous; it would not \xe2\x80\x9cremake Haiti.\xe2\x80\x9d But it would require a lasting commitment by American farmers and manufacturers and, as the country heals, it would actually bring permanent jobs, investment and income to Haiti.'b'Second, the United States and other donors could make a formal undertaking to ensure that the vast amounts that will soon pour into the country for reconstruction go not to foreigners but to Haitians \xe2\x80\x94 and not only to Haitian contractors and builders but to Haitian workers, at reasonable wages. This would put real money in the hands of many Haitians, not just a few, and begin to shift power away from both the rapacious government and the well-meaning and too often ineffectual charities that seek to circumvent it. The world\xe2\x80\x99s greatest gift would be to make it possible, and necessary, for Haitians \xe2\x80\x94 all Haitians \xe2\x80\x94 to rebuild Haiti.'b'Putting money in people\xe2\x80\x99s hands will not make Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s predatory state disappear. But in time, with rising incomes and a concomitant decentralization of power, it might evolve. In coming days much grander ambitions are sure to be declared, just as more scenes of disaster and disorder will transfix us, more stunning and colorful images of irresistible calamity. We will see if the present catastrophe, on a scale that dwarfs all that have come before, can do anything truly to alter the reality of Haiti.'b'We had hoped that the March 7 parliamentary elections would prove the growing maturity of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s fragile democracy and set the country on a stable path as American combat troops get ready for this summer\xe2\x80\x99s planned withdrawal. Instead, the process unfolding is disgracefully unfair and roiling dangerous sectarian tensions.'b'Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s Accountability and Justice Commission unleashed an electoral hand grenade this month 'b'when it disqualified'b' some 500 (out of 6,500) candidates \xe2\x80\x94 many of them prominent Sunni Muslims \xe2\x80\x94 because of alleged ties to the Baath Party of Saddam Hussein. Among those ordered off the ballot: Defense Minister Abdul-Kader Jassem al-Obeidi and Saleh al-Mutlaq, one of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s most influential Sunni politicians. The decision was ratified last week by Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s electoral commission.'b'Sunnis are understandably furious. After boycotting or battling the Shiite-dominated governments for much of the last seven years, Sunni leaders have been struggling to find a constructive new role.'b'The worst of Mr. Hussein\xe2\x80\x99s henchmen should be held accountable for past repression. But there is little doubt that many if not most of the disqualifications are politically motivated and intended to disenfranchise Sunnis. Although Mr. Mutlaq openly solicits support from Mr. Hussein\xe2\x80\x99s admirers, he was permitted to run for Parliament in 2005. And Mr. Obeidi has performed competently \xe2\x80\x94 and loyally \xe2\x80\x94 as defense minister.'b'The accountability commission is the successor to the destructive de-Baathification commission that sought to keep anyone with ties to Mr. Hussein out of government. Its chief, Ali Faisal al-Lami, is hardly an impartial judge. He is a candidate on the slate led by the Shiite leader Ahmed Chalabi, a relentlessly ambitious force in Iraqi politics who lured the Bush administration into the 2003 invasion and wants to be prime minister.'b'Both the accountability and the election commissions are part of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki\xe2\x80\x99s government, and he issued a statement supporting their decisions. But American officials say Mr. Chalabi is the main manipulator. Mr. Chalabi\xe2\x80\x99s absurd charge that the United States wants to return the Baath Party to power is typical of his divisive and destructive brand of politics.'b'There are other reasons to fault the process. Many Iraqis rightly question the legality of both commissions and their procedures, including a disturbing lack of transparency about who was disqualified and why. The ability to ban candidates is a serious authority that must be exercised openly, judiciously and rarely.'b'The Obama administration needs to keep pressing Iraqis to find a compromise that would allow the fullest list of candidates, including Mr. Mutlaq and Mr. Obeidi, to run. It still has leverage over Baghdad \xe2\x80\x94 including billions in aid and the ability to fulfill or deny the Iraqi government\xe2\x80\x99s desire to purchase sophisticated weapons like F-16s. It must use that leverage. Iraqis have learned to play hardball politics. That is far better than fighting in the streets. But it should mean besting adversaries at the ballot box \xe2\x80\x94 not denying them the chance to run. If Sunnis are arbitrarily excluded, the entire election will be compromised. Even worse, the Sunnis may conclude, once again, that there is no role for them in Iraqi politics. That would be a disaster.'b'Here is the latest from the Grand Old Party: After years of eagerly enabling the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s deficit spending and record debt, Republicans in Congress are dusting off their budget hawk costumes and suddenly demanding fiscal responsibility for the nation. In this scenery-chewing role, they are not just denying their own profligate history, but they hardly seem to be serious. Take 'b'their reaction'b' to President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s proposal for a bipartisan commission to tackle debt and budget threats.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a nothing-burger,\xe2\x80\x9d said Senator Judd Gregg, the ranking Republican member of the Senate Budget Committee. He said he finds the proposal for a commission of 10 Democratic and eight Republican experts de facto partisan, and prefers any panel be created and controlled in Congress (where Senate Republicans feast on serial filibustering). Representative John Boehner, the House minority leader,  suggested Republicans would simply boycott posts on the commission, asking why provide political cover for panicky Democrats.'b'Unabashedly feckless, the Republican Party aims to rise from the Congressional minority by brandishing a political agenda of just saying no. As in no to health care reform. (Their new senator-elect from Massachusetts, Scott Brown, ran outright on a promise to be the latest to shoot down health care.) No to global warming repairs; no to real reform of Wall Street; no, in fact, to any act of creative opposition.'b'The proposed commission would make recommendations for facing the most politically painful decisions about how to rein in programs and raise revenues as the national debt rises. The proposal is occasioned by an election-year fight that\xe2\x80\x99s heating up over the current deficit, a good part of which is because of Bush administration spending on such wasteful exercises as the Iraq war. Don\xe2\x80\x99t expect the No Party to own up to their past red ink.'b'Sooner or later constituents must wonder how far Republicans can take pure opposition as a political philosophy without offering believable program alternatives. The party should remember how Speaker Newt Gingrich got into a fight with the Clinton White House over the budget and debt limit, and then played a game of political chicken in which he precipitated a government shutdown in 1995. He did not fare well.'b'A message to House Democrats: This is your moment of truth. You can do the right thing and pass the Senate health care bill. Or you can look for an easy way out, make excuses and fail the test of history.'b'Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s Republican victory in the Massachusetts special election means that Democrats can\xe2\x80\x99t send a modified health care bill back to the Senate. That\xe2\x80\x99s a shame because the bill that would have emerged from House-Senate negotiations would have been better than the bill the Senate has already passed. But the Senate bill is much, much better than nothing. And all that has to happen to make it law is for the House to pass the same bill, and send it to President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s desk.'b'Right now, Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, says that she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the votes to pass the Senate bill. But there is no good alternative.'b'Some are urging Democrats to scale back their proposals in the hope of gaining Republican support. But anyone who thinks that would work must have spent the past year living on another planet.'b'The fact is that the Senate bill is a centrist document, which moderate Republicans should find entirely acceptable. In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s very similar to the plan Mitt Romney introduced in Massachusetts just a few years ago. Yet it has faced lock-step opposition from the G.O.P., which is determined to prevent Democrats from achieving any successes. Why would this change now that Republicans think they\xe2\x80\x99re on a roll?'b'Alternatively, some call for breaking the health care plan into pieces so that the Senate can vote the popular pieces into law. But anyone who thinks that would work hasn\xe2\x80\x99t paid attention to the actual policy issues.'b'Think of health care reform as being like a three-legged stool. You would, rightly, ridicule anyone who proposed saving money by leaving off one or two of the legs. Well, those who propose doing only the popular pieces of health care reform deserve the same kind of ridicule. Reform won\xe2\x80\x99t work unless all the essential pieces are in place.'b'Suppose, for example, that Congress took the advice of those who want to ban insurance discrimination on the basis of medical history, and stopped there. What would happen next? The answer, as any health care economist will tell you, is that if Congress didn\xe2\x80\x99t simultaneously require that healthy people buy insurance, there would be a \xe2\x80\x9cdeath spiral\xe2\x80\x9d: healthier Americans would choose not to buy insurance, leading to high premiums for those who remain, driving out more people, and so on.'b'And if Congress tried to avoid the death spiral by requiring that healthy Americans buy insurance, it would have to offer financial aid to lower-income families to make that insurance affordable  \xe2\x80\x94  aid at least as generous as that in the Senate bill. There just isn\xe2\x80\x99t any way to do reform on a smaller scale.'b'So reaching out to Republicans won\xe2\x80\x99t work, and neither will trying to pass only the crowd-pleasing pieces of reform. What about the suggestion that Democrats use reconciliation  \xe2\x80\x94  the Senate procedure for finalizing budget legislation, which bypasses the filibuster  \xe2\x80\x94  to enact health reform?'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s a real option, which may become necessary (and could be used to improve the Senate bill after the fact). But reconciliation, which is basically limited to matters of taxing and spending, probably can\xe2\x80\x99t be used to enact many important aspects of reform. In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s not even clear if it could be used to ban discrimination based on medical history.'b'Finally, some Democrats want to just give up on the whole thing.'b'That would be an act of utter political folly. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t protect Democrats from charges that they voted for \xe2\x80\x9csocialist\xe2\x80\x9d health care  \xe2\x80\x94  remember, both houses of Congress have already passed reform. All it would do is solidify the public perception of Democrats as hapless and ineffectual.'b'And anyway, politics is supposed to be about achieving something more than your own re-election. America desperately needs health care reform; it would be a betrayal of trust if Democrats fold simply because they hope (wrongly) that this would slightly reduce their losses in the midterm elections.'b'Now, part of Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 problem since Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s special election has been that they have been waiting in vain for leadership from the White House, where Mr. Obama has conspicuously failed to rise to the occasion.'b'But members of Congress, who were sent to Washington to serve the public, don\xe2\x80\x99t have the right to hide behind the president\xe2\x80\x99s passivity.'b'Bear in mind that the horrors of health insurance  \xe2\x80\x94  outrageous premiums, coverage denied to those who need it most and dropped when you actually get sick  \xe2\x80\x94  will get only worse if reform fails, and insurance companies know that they\xe2\x80\x99re off the hook. And voters will blame politicians who, when they had a chance to do something, made excuses instead.'b'Ladies and gentlemen, the nation is waiting. Stop whining, and do what needs to be done.'b'In November 2008, William A. Galston and Elaine C. Kamarck wrote a report called \xe2\x80\x9cChange You Can Believe In Needs a Government You Can Trust.\xe2\x80\x9d Galston and Kamarck, who served in senior positions in the Clinton administration, threw up some warning flags for the incoming Obama administration.'b'Despite the Democratic triumph that month, they noted, public distrust of government remains intensely high. Historically, it has been nearly impossible to pass major domestic reforms in the face of that kind of distrust. Therefore, they counseled, the new administration should move cautiously to rebuild trust before beginning a transformational agenda.'b'The Obama administration interpreted the political climate in an entirely different way. As John F. Harris and Carol E. Lee wrote 'b'in a smart piece'b' in Politico on Wednesday, the administration interpreted the 2008 election as a rejection of not only George W. Bush-style conservatism, but also Bill Clinton-style moderation. The country was ready for a New Deal-size change. It had a leader in Barack Obama who could uniquely inspire a national transformation.'b'As happens every four years, hubris defeated caution, and the administration began its big-bang approach.'b'As always, it backfired. Instead of building trust in government, the Democrats have magnified distrust. The country already believed Washington is out of touch with its core concerns. So while most families were concerned about jobs, Democrats in Washington spent nine months arguing about health care. The country was already tired of self-serving back-room deals, so the Democrats negotiated a series of dirty deals with the pharmaceutical industry, the unions and certain senators. Americans already felt Washington doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand their fears and insecurities. So at the moment when economic insecurity was at its peak, the Democrats in Washington added another layer of insecurity by threatening to change everything at once.'b'Instead of building a new majority, the Democrats have set off a distrust insurrection (which is not the same as a conservative insurrection). Republicans are enraged. Independents are furious. Democrats are disheartened. Health care reform is brutally unpopular. Even voters in Massachusetts decided it was time to send a message.'b'The Democrats now have four bad options. The first is what you might call the Heedless and Arrogant Approach. A clear majority of Americans are against the Congressional health care reform plan. Democrats could say: We know this is unpopular, but we think it is good policy and we are going to ram it through and you voters can judge us by the results.'b'The second route is what you might call the Weak and Feckless Approach. Democrats could say: We have received and respect the message voters are sending. We are not going to shove the biggest social transformation in a generation down the throats of a country that has judged and rejected it. We are not going to concentrate immense new powers in a Washington the country detests.'b'Instead, we will regroup and reorganize. Perhaps we will try incremental reforms. Perhaps we will use federal money to support a series of state reform efforts \xe2\x80\x94 like the one in Massachusetts \xe2\x80\x94 which are closer to the people. (In 2007, Russ Feingold, a Democrat, and Lindsey Graham, a Republican, co-sponsored the State-Based Health Care Reform Act to spark this kind of local experimentation.)'b'The third approach is the Dangerous and Demagogic Approach. This begins with the presumption that what Americans really want is a bunch of pseudopopulists to tell them they can have everything for free. This would mean stripping the health bills of anything that might be unpopular \xe2\x80\x94 like Medicare cuts and tax increases \xe2\x80\x94 and passing the rest regardless of the cost.'b'The fourth approach is the Incoherent and Internecine Approach. This would involve settling on no coherent policy but just blaming each other for cowardice and stupidity for the next month. Liberals, who make up 20 percent of the country, could complain because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get their version of reform. The Senate and the House could bash each other. The intelligentsia could bash the public.'b'Right now, Incoherent and Internecine is winning, but the hard choice is between the first two approaches. Galston, ironically, now supports Heedless and Arrogant. It was a mistake to rush into health care, he believes, but now that the party is down the road it would be suicide to turn back. Democrats should stand for what they believe in. If the policy works, then public trust will follow.'b'I support the Weak and Feckless Approach. Trust is based on mutual respect and reciprocity. If, at this moment of rage and cynicism, the ruling class goes even further and snubs popular opinion, then that will set off an ugly, destructive, and yet fully justified popular rebellion. Trust in government will be irrevocably broken. It will decimate policy-making for a generation.'b'These are the choices ahead. Have a nice day.'b'To the Editor:'b'Your reporting presents many sides of Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s disaster: situational and societal.

Nobody wants a health care bill cobbled together by Congressional sellouts and corporate lobbyists.'b'By failing to lead our nation in a new direction, Mr. Obama has given rise to a tidal wave of reactionary conservatism while at the same time alienating his base of progressive support.

That\xe2\x80\x99s why we first married Phyllis Lyon and the late Del Martin, together for more than 50 years, to give a much-needed human face to the struggle for marriage equality.'b'In that sense, your article is correct that I have been \xe2\x80\x9ceclipsed\xe2\x80\x9d in the fight for marriage equality. Indeed, all of us, whether politician or lawyer or advocate, are eclipsed every day by the stories of Phyllis and Del and the thousands of same-sex couples who have married since 2004. Because the fight for marriage equality is about them \xe2\x80\x94 the men and women whose loving, committed relationships are still treated as unequal in the eyes of the law.'b'I have never been prouder of our decision in 2004 to defy California\xe2\x80\x99s unjust marriage laws and do our part to carry the banner for civil rights. And we will never step back from our commitment to marriage equality until justice prevails in California and in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital.'b'Gavin Newsom'b'\n Mayor'b'\n San Francisco, Jan.\n 20, 2010'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b'Your Jan. 12 editorial \xe2\x80\x9c'b'It Isn\xe2\x80\x99t Working for Anyone Else'b'\xe2\x80\x9d about China\xe2\x80\x99s currency manipulation shows that conventional free trade theory has little in common with the realities of today\xe2\x80\x99s international trade.'b'The orthodoxy simply cannot account for or suggest responses to sustained outlier behavior.

After the Pakistani Taliban got within 60 miles of Islamabad last April they decided that they had no choice but to fight back. They were right. Unfortunately, their understanding of self-interest seems to stop at a border that the Taliban certainly does not respect.'b'During his visit to Pakistan this week, Defense Secretary Robert Gates pressed Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s military leaders to open a new front against Afghan militants using Pakistani territory to stage attacks into Afghanistan \xe2\x80\x94 and was promptly rebuffed.'b'Displaying an alarming denial about the nature and urgency of the threat, an Army spokesman said there would be no offensive in the tribal region of North Waziristan \xe2\x80\x94 where the Afghan Taliban are based \xe2\x80\x94 for at least six months and perhaps as long as 12 months. Given the speed and virulence with which the extremists have spread their hatred and violence in the past year, that\xe2\x80\x99s too long to wait.'b'To its credit, Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s Army has mounted big offensives against Pakistani Taliban factions in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan and paid a steep price: losing 2,000 soldiers in battle. It may need some time to solidify these gains and prepare a new assault. But that is almost certainly not the real reason behind the delay.'b'Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s Army and spy service helped create the Afghan Taliban, and even now they see the group as a proxy force to limit India\xe2\x80\x99s influence in Afghanistan once the Americans leave. That is truly playing with fire.'b'Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s failure to pressure both Taliban groups could doom President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s military and political offensive in Afghanistan \xe2\x80\x94 or force him to make good on his threat to go after militants in the Pakistan border region if Islamabad does not. This is not just America\xe2\x80\x99s fight. As Mr. Gates warned this week,  extremist groups on the border are interconnected and determined to destabilize the entire region.'b'Pakistan cannot afford to give the Afghan Taliban a pass, and Washington must make sure that Islamabad faces up to that reality. Mr. Gates tried to nudge Pakistan when he spoke publicly about how Islamabad cannot \xe2\x80\x9cignore one part of this cancer and pretend it won\xe2\x80\x99t have some impact closer to home.\xe2\x80\x9d We hope he was firmer in private.'b'Mr. Gates and other officials are working hard to persuade Islamabad that the United States will not repeat past mistakes and abandon Pakistan as it did after the Soviets withdrew 20 years ago.'b'The Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s decision this week to grant Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding request for aerial spy drones (unarmed, at Washington\xe2\x80\x99s insistence) should help bridge the \xe2\x80\x9ctrust deficit.\xe2\x80\x9d Washington must also do more to help lessen tensions between Pakistan and India. That may be the best chance of persuading Islamabad that it can and must focus more of its troops and attention on fighting all of the Taliban.'b'President Obama promised this week to reconnect to the concerns and needs of Americans who are suffering from the recession. One important way to do that is to help hard-pressed families hang on to their homes.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not just the moral thing to do. It also would help avoid the spillover effects of the next expected round of defaults. Coupled with high unemployment, a coming surge in foreclosures is likely to further depress house prices. That would hurt an already fragile recovery and, in a worst case, could provoke a double-dip recession.'b'Unfortunately, advance word of coming changes to the antiforeclosure effort are not encouraging.'b'When the effort was announced nearly a year ago, the administration said it would help as many as nine million at-risk families keep their homes by the end of 2012 \xe2\x80\x94 by lower payments through loan modifications, mainly lower interest rates, or by refinancing loans for borrowers who have little or no equity.'b'Yet recent tallies show that through 2009, only 66,465 loans had been successfully modified, and through last November, 155,700 loans had been refinanced. That\xe2\x80\x99s abysmal. An estimated 2.4 million borrowers are expected to lose their homes this year alone because of joblessness, negative equity and, in many cases, unaffordability as teaser rates expire on adjustable mortgages.'b'It would take 100,000 successful modifications a month, starting now, to significantly counter the threat that so many foreclosures would pose to the economy, according to estimates by Moody\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Economy.com'b'.'b'As early as next week, the administration is expected to ease up on the paperwork requirements for a loan modification and to announce temporary assistance \xe2\x80\x94 probably low-cost loans or grants \xe2\x80\x94 to help unemployed people pay their mortgages. A loan would likely be tacked on to the mortgage, for repayment over time.'b'Those changes, however, would not correct the program\xe2\x80\x99s biggest flaw: the current preferred way to modify a loan \xe2\x80\x94 reducing the interest rate \xe2\x80\x94 is of limited use to millions of so-called underwater borrowers, those who owe more than their homes are worth. Reducing the loan\xe2\x80\x99s principal balance is more valuable because it lowers monthly payments and restores equity. Various studies show that having equity also reduces the likelihood of redefault on a modified loan.'b'Administration officials, however, have been unwilling or unable to persuade lenders to reduce the principal on underwater loans. One obstacle is that many troubled borrowers have two loans on their home, and conflicts exist between the first and second mortgage holders over who gets how much out of a loan whose principal has been cut. Several months ago, the Treasury Department detailed a plan aimed at resolving the conflicts, but lenders have yet to cooperate.'b'It is less clear why the refinancing arm of the antiforeclosure program has flopped. But for many borrowers, refinancing may not be worth the cost unless mortgage rates drop and stay low, which is not likely.'b'Treasury officials say that they continually review the antiforeclosure effort and consider changes. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to see what they need to convince them that it\xe2\x80\x99s time to restore some equity to drowning borrowers.'b'Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton picked the right battle this week, calling for an end to Internet censorship and naming governments that suppress the free flow of information \xe2\x80\x94 including China, Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Tunisia and Uzbekistan.'b'Her 'b'speech'b', at the Newseum in Washington, had pointed echoes of the cold war, including a warning that \xe2\x80\x9ca new information curtain is descending across much of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d Anyone who finds that overheated should remember how hard Iran\xe2\x80\x99s government worked to shut down the Web during last summer\xe2\x80\x99s bloody, pro-democracy protests \xe2\x80\x94 and the power of the images and words that managed to get through.'b'Mrs. Clinton 'b'also placed'b' the Obama administration squarely on the side of Google in its fight with China over Internet censorship and cyberattacks. She called on the Chinese government to conduct a thorough and transparent review of Google\xe2\x80\x99s accusations that Gmail accounts used by Chinese human rights activists had been hacked into from the mainland. And she called on other American companies to challenge \xe2\x80\x9cforeign governments\xe2\x80\x99 demands for censorship and surveillance.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It will take more than just a tough speech to change China\xe2\x80\x99s policies, and more than a tough speech to change the policies of far too many companies that enable Beijing and other repressive governments when they accept censorship as a normal price of doing business.'b'But there is no doubt that Chinese authorities \xe2\x80\x94 which had hoped to play down the fight with Google \xe2\x80\x94 are listening and getting nervous.'b'On Friday, the day after the speech, a spokesman for China\xe2\x80\x99s Foreign Ministry called on the United States \xe2\x80\x9cto stop using the so-called Internet freedom question to level baseless accusations.\xe2\x80\x9d The spokesman 'b'also insisted'b' that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Chinese Internet is open.\xe2\x80\x9d The Chinese people know better.

They swirled down out of the Pacific only to fracture and disintegrate when they hit land. No matter what measurements you used \xe2\x80\x94 snowpack depth at Bishop Pass, swell height data from the coastal buoys or the drip rate off the porch roof \xe2\x80\x94 everyone was watching the storms, hoping for a blossoming desert or simply to get over the mountains before the Grapevine closed with snow.'b'On the ground, the palette was far more monotonous. That\xe2\x80\x99s just the way several inches of gray rain falling from gray clouds onto gray looks. Add in traffic, and you get a towering mist rising over the freeways. Even when the rain let up, you could judge the quality of the coming pavement by the detonations of spray when a car hit a brimming pothole.'b'Everything about the storms was muddying. The waves breaking just south of Santa Barbara carried a heavy load of sand, stirred up by four days of storm swells. The terraced slopes of a vineyard \xe2\x80\x94 not yet planted \xe2\x80\x94 near San Luis Obispo were fraying and breaking apart at the edges. At a vegetable farm near Soledad, the fieldworkers\xe2\x80\x99 rain suits, the mud, and the sky all seemed to be a single substance.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to understand the different feel of these Pacific storms \xe2\x80\x94 compared with the nor\xe2\x80\x99easters that vault across my farm in upstate New York. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t just the nostalgic surprise people feel here when thunder and lightning hit Los Angeles. When a nor\xe2\x80\x99easter plasters the Northeast, the rainfall is usually extra because most years there\xe2\x80\x99s been fairly regular rain. In California, of course, these storms are a respite, another deliverance from an arid destiny.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s another difference. When a big winter storm tracks eastward across the nation, you see footage of its effects \xe2\x80\x94 the icy roads, the downed power lines \xe2\x80\x94 long before it reaches you. Not so the Pacific storms. They swoop down on the jet stream, tracking across open water, and when they hit the coast \xe2\x80\x94 and California is essentially all coast \xe2\x80\x94 they are fresh and vigorous, carrying all the energies of a storm surge with them. No matter that this is old water falling from the sky.

Firestone'b'\n Stamford, Conn., Jan.\n 16, 2010'b''b'This is not the hour of the good loser in Democratic circles.'b'On MSNBC, Keith Olbermann called Scott Brown, the senator-elect from Massachusetts, \xe2\x80\x9can irresponsible, homophobic, racist, reactionary, ex-nude model, teabagging supporter of violence against women and against politicians with whom he disagrees.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yipes. It was a Senate race, not the Battle of Hastings.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn the personal scheme of things, I went too far. In the broad scheme of things, this was a blip on the radar,\xe2\x80\x9d said Olbermann, in a telephone interview, citing the multitudinous cases when right-wing talk-show hosts have said much worse. Given the fact that Glenn Beck has already claimed that Brown could wind up \xe2\x80\x9cwith a dead intern,\xe2\x80\x9d I believe he may have a point.'b'Meanwhile, on a radio show in Pennsylvania, Senator Arlen Specter lost it completely and told Representative Michele Bachmann, the irrepressible heroine of the Tea Party movement, to \xe2\x80\x9cact like a lady.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Specter, you will remember, switched parties last year. Democrats must be asking themselves why they wanted him. Oh, yes, the 60th vote. Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s all over. The good news is that Joseph Lieberman is only about one-tenth as important as he was on Monday. The bad news is the remaining 59 includes a self-important 79-year-old who makes wildly patronizing remarks about his female opponent during a radio debate.'b'To be fair, Bachmann does have a terrific talent for driving people nuts. When you ask a person what legislation she\xe2\x80\x99s supported and the answer is \xe2\x80\x9cprosperity,\xe2\x80\x9d you can assume this is not going to be a day for meaningful dialogue.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cProsperity wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a bill,\xe2\x80\x9d snapped Specter.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen why don\xe2\x80\x99t we make it one?\xe2\x80\x9d Bachmann responded, in a tone of extreme reason.'b'Sputtering, Specter said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll treat you like a lady. So act like one.\xe2\x80\x9d Not once, but twice.'b'This is about as inept as you can get. When Bachmann started lecturing him about how Americans want less government, the correct response was: \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, unless it\xe2\x80\x99s $250,000 in subsidies for the Bachmann family farm.\xe2\x80\x9d Instead, Specter kept complaining and calling for ladylike deportment until the host mercifully intervened and ended the show.'b'He has to run for re-election this year. If the Democrats are looking for a wake-up call from Massachusetts, the big rooster in the room is the plethora of underwhelming candidates they are fielding.'b'In Illinois, where Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s former Senate seat is on the line, the leading Democratic contender is a 33-year-old who spent almost all of his adult life working for the bank that his family owns. Perhaps the president forgot that last week when he told Massachusetts voters that \xe2\x80\x9cbankers don\xe2\x80\x99t need another vote in the Senate.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Maybe John Edwards was sniffing desperation in the air when, in the same week that he admitted that the campaign love child was indeed his daughter, he called the White House and said he was going to Haiti to help in the relief efforts.'b'The White House pretended it was a wrong number.'b'A spokeswoman said Edwards also had been doing charitable work in El Salvador. If this was the plan of his wife, Elizabeth, to get him out of the house, it seems reasonable. But is it a road to rehabilitation?'b'Sure \xe2\x80\x94 as long as he stays in disaster zones. It would be great if all our disgraced politicians decided to devote themselves to helping the poor, providing they understand that this is not a second act but the thing they get to do after the curtain has dropped and the audience has gone home.'b'Eliot Spitzer was going to devote himself to good works, too. But now, every time you turn around, there he is talking on TV or blogging about current events. He\xe2\x80\x99s trying to warn the country about evil robber barons. But I was thinking more along the line of distributing mosquito nets in Chad.'b'Meanwhile, a lot of Democrats who ought to be preparing to take the field in November seem to be running for shelter. In Illinois and Connecticut, the best candidates available have announced that they\xe2\x80\x99re running to be the state attorney general. These days, everybody wants to be an attorney general and cuddle up and sue dairies that sell curdled milk until the political weather improves. It is very hard to be unpopular when you\xe2\x80\x99re an attorney general. Even Martha Coakley was a popular attorney general.'b'This would not have happened if Senator Charles Schumer of New York was still in charge of recruiting candidates. Schumer was completely manic. Promising Democrats would open the door to get the newspaper in the morning and they\xe2\x80\x99d find him curled up on the front porch with a dead squirrel he had brought them as a token of love.'b'Bring back Schumer. Maybe he could get Conan O\xe2\x80\x99Brien to run in North Dakota.'b'How loud do the alarms have to get? There is an economic emergency in the country with millions upon millions of Americans riddled with fear and anxiety as they struggle with long-term joblessness, home foreclosures, personal bankruptcies and dwindling opportunities for themselves and their children.'b'The door is being slammed on the American dream and the politicians, including the president and his Democratic allies on Capitol Hill, seem not just helpless to deal with the crisis, but completely out of touch with the hardships that have fallen on so many.'b'While the nation was suffering through the worst economy since the Depression, the Democrats wasted a year squabbling like unruly toddlers over health insurance legislation. No one in his or her right mind could have believed that a workable, efficient, cost-effective system could come out of the monstrously ugly plan that finally emerged from the Senate after long months of shady alliances, disgraceful back-room deals, outlandish payoffs and abject capitulation to the insurance companies and giant pharmaceutical outfits.'b'The public interest? Forget about it.'b'With the power elite consumed with its incessant, discordant fiddling over health care, the economic plight of ordinary Americans, from the middle class to the very poor, got pathetically short shrift. And there is no evidence, even now, that leaders of either party fully grasp the depth of the crisis, which began long before the official start of the Great Recession in December 2007.'b'A new study from the Brookings Institution tells us that the largest and fastest-growing population of poor people in the U.S. is in the suburbs. You don\xe2\x80\x99t hear about this from the politicians who are always so anxious to tell you, in between fund-raisers and photo-ops, what a great job they\xe2\x80\x99re doing. From 2000 to 2008, the number of poor people in the U.S. grew by 5.2 million, reaching nearly 40 million. That represented an increase of 15.4 percent in the poor population, which was more than twice the increase in the population as a whole during that period.'b'The study does not include data from 2009, when so many millions of families were just hammered by the recession. So the reality is worse than the Brookings figures would indicate.'b'Job losses, stagnant or reduced wages over the past decade, and the loss of home equity when the housing bubble burst have combined to take a horrendous toll on families who thought they had done all the right things and were living the dream. A great deal of that bleeding is in the suburbs. The study, compiled by the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program, said, \xe2\x80\x9cSuburbs gained more than 2.5 million poor individuals, accounting for almost half of the total increase in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s poor population since 2000.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Democrats in search of clues as to why voters are unhappy may want to take a look at the report. In 2008, a startling 91.6 million people  \xe2\x80\x94  more than 30 percent of the entire U.S. population  \xe2\x80\x94  fell below 200 percent of the federal poverty line, which is a meager $21,834 for a family of four.'b'The question for Democrats is whether there is anything that will wake them up to their obligation to extend a powerful hand to ordinary Americans and help them take the government, including the Supreme Court, back from the big banks, the giant corporations and the myriad other predatory interests that put the value of a dollar high above the value of human beings.'b'The Democrats still hold the presidency and large majorities in both houses of Congress. The idea that they are not spending every waking hour trying to fix the broken economic system and put suffering Americans back to work is beyond pathetic. Deficit reduction is now the mantra in Washington, which means that new large-scale investments in infrastructure and other measures to ease the employment crisis and jump-start the most promising industries of the 21st century are highly unlikely.'b'What we\xe2\x80\x99ll get instead is rhetoric. It\xe2\x80\x99s cheap, so we can expect a lot of it.'b'Those at the bottom of the economic heap seem all but doomed in this environment. The Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston put the matter in stark perspective after analyzing the employment challenges facing young people in Chicago: \xe2\x80\x9cLabor market conditions for 16-19 and 20-24-year-olds in the city of Chicago in 2009 are the equivalent of a Great Depression-era, especially for young black men.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Republican Party has abandoned any serious approach to the nation\xe2\x80\x99s biggest problems, economic or otherwise. It may be resurgent, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not a serious party. That leaves only the Democrats, a party that once championed working people and the poor, but has long since lost its way.'b'Welcome to the mob: an angry, wounded electorate, riled by recession, careening across the political spectrum, still craving change, nursing a bloodlust.'b'There is a scene in the movie \xe2\x80\x9cGladiator\xe2\x80\x9d where two Roman senators are discussing the games that the emperor has revived. One laments: I think the emperor \xe2\x80\x9cknows what Rome is. Rome is the mob. Conjure magic for them and they\xe2\x80\x99ll be distracted. Take away their freedom and still they\xe2\x80\x99ll roar. The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the senate. It\xe2\x80\x99s the sand of the coliseum. He\xe2\x80\x99ll bring them death. And they will love him for it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That was America during the dawn of W.  \xe2\x80\x94  too many too easily manipulated. But people grew wiser and restless. And they revolted. As they did, a young crowd-pleaser in Chicago, cloaked in hope, sprang up, won them over and shaped the mob into a movement.'b'That was then.'b'Unfortunately, many now see Barack Obama as a left-leaning version of George W. Bush: just another out-of-touch emperor. It seems as if Obama and the Democrats made the mistake of believing that a heart once won was forever won, that people would be patient, and that the mob would accept their reasoning for lack of results.'b'They were wrong. The mob is fickle. And it\xe2\x80\x99s back with a vengeance.'b'While the left slept, the right saw a void and leapt in. They feted the fearful to a steady stream of dread and circuses, and now the pendulum of enthusiasm has swung in the other direction.'b'According to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey 'b'conducted last week'b', the percentage of people who view President Obama \xe2\x80\x9cvery negatively\xe2\x80\x9d has more than doubled since he was elected. Over the same time period, the number of those who view the Democratic Party \xe2\x80\x9cvery negatively\xe2\x80\x9d has increased by three-quarters, while the number of those viewing the Republican Party \xe2\x80\x9cvery negatively\xe2\x80\x9d has dropped slightly.'b'The most recent manifestation of the shifting landscape is the election of Scott Brown, a Republican in reliably Democratic Massachusetts, which shattered the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 filibuster-proof Senate majority and their sense of security.'b'In 'b'an interview'b' with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News this week, Obama acknowledged as much: \xe2\x80\x9cThe same thing that swept Scott Brown into office swept me into office. People are angry, and they\xe2\x80\x99re frustrated.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s smart to acknowledge this, but can he get out in front of it?'b'Obama continued, \xe2\x80\x9cIf there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing that I regret this year, is that we were so busy just getting stuff done and dealing with the immediate crises that were in front of us, that I think we lost some of that sense of speaking directly to the American people about what their core values are.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He underestimated the mob, and his agenda will suffer now that the emperor has no cloture.'b'IN Mayor Michael Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s'b' State of the City speech'b' on Wednesday, he spoke of the City Council as if it were an equal partner in government. Indeed, the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s surprisingly close re-election, the unusual defeat of a handful of council members and some spirited races in the general election in a city where winning the Democratic primary is tantamount to victory, might lead one to expect the 51-member body to be imbued with new democratic vigor. However, the council members inaugurated this month have joined a body whose governance structure is hardly more democratic than a high school student council\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 where the principal calls the shots.'b'Ultimately, all City Council decisions are made by the speaker and the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s staff. The speaker controls which members get to sit on which committees and who heads those committees, what legislation comes up for a vote, the hiring and firing of the 250-plus central staff and the money that members get to dole out to their districts.'b'Since the 1989 City Charter reform enlarged the Council\xe2\x80\x99s powers, a strong speaker has been seen as necessary to counterbalance the mayor, but this balance doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hold. Because the current speaker, Christine Quinn, has so much control over the Council, Mayor Bloomberg can deal almost exclusively with her, ignoring the members and, by extension, their constituents.'b'The consequence of a cozy relationship between the speaker and the mayor is a Council that goes along with the mayor on most major issues. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the City Council approve \xe2\x80\x94 at the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s initiative \xe2\x80\x94 the rezoning of large areas of the city for high-end development, congestion pricing and the overturning of referendum-approved term limits.'b'Fortunately, creating a representative and transparent City Council that can check mayoral power won\xe2\x80\x99t require a wholesale rewriting of the charter. All that is needed are three small but significant changes.'b'First, the Council should reform its process for approving the city budget. The mayor now prepares the budget with his Office of Management and Budget and city agencies, and then submits a relatively final document to the Council. Council committees hold hearings to review the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s plan, but they have no real ability to make changes.'b'The Council\xe2\x80\x99s budget negotiating team then spends torturous hours behind closed doors, proposing a few alternative cuts, which are usually rejected by the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s side, and haggling over additional expenditures, which make up a tiny fraction of the whole. The final size of the Council\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpot\xe2\x80\x9d is decided between the speaker and the mayor.'b'There are better alternatives. For instance, Council committees should vote on the components of the budget under their purview, like Congressional appropriations committees. Votes in committee would be in the form of resolutions and would therefore lack the force of law, but they would be a template for the Council\xe2\x80\x99s negotiations with the mayor and carry more weight than the current closed-door deliberations.'b'This would engage more members earlier in the process, instead of allowing all the action to happen around the end-game exercises of the negotiating team, and encourage the Council to look at the budget in greater detail and more comprehensively. Best of all, city agencies would have to publicly substantiate the worthiness of their programs or risk an embarrassing vote in the Council.'b'Second, we need to restructure how the Council is staffed. The members of the central staff, which provides technical assistance and policy advice, serve at the pleasure of the speaker, meaning they can be fired at any time.'b'So if a councilman requests an analysis of a particular piece of legislation, staff members need to assess whether that councilman is in good standing with the speaker and whether his proposal is likely to get the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s support. If the answer is no to both, then the request gets a low priority on the work pile. This results in some good ideas never getting a full vetting and some bad ones that are never put to rest.'b'As many parliamentary democracies have already done, the Council should establish a legislative services commission that sets the rules for hiring, compensation, promotion and retention of legislative staff. The result would be a professional staff that works for the Council as a whole, is better insulated from politics and better able to provide objective aid and analysis.'b'The third fix is to reform how the speaker is selected, and it would require a charter amendment. Instead of being chosen by the council members, the speaker should be popularly elected citywide (and the redundant public advocate position should be eliminated). The speaker should then be subject to a recall vote by three-fourths of the council members; if the speaker lost that vote, a special election would then be held to fill the position. This would ensure that the speaker remains responsive to council members and the electorate.'b'With these reforms, the speaker would lose some power, but gain a public mandate akin to the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 as well as leadership over a strong institution that could fulfill its true potential as an agent of democracy.'b'It was not a referendum on Barack Obama, who in every poll remains one of the most popular politicians in America. It was not a rejection of universal health care, which 'b'Massachusetts mandated'b' (with 'b'Scott Brown\xe2\x80\x99s State Senate vote'b') in 2006. It was not a harbinger of a resurgent G.O.P., whose numbers remain in the toilet. Brown had the good sense not to identify himself as a Republican in 'b'either his campaign advertising'b' or 'b'his victory speech'b'.'b'And yet 'b'Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s special election'b' was a dire omen for this White House. If the administration sticks to this trajectory, all bets are off for the political future of a president who rode into office blessed with more high hopes, good will and serious promise than any in modern memory. It\xe2\x80\x99s time for him to stop deluding himself. Yes, last week\xe2\x80\x99s political obituaries were ludicrously premature. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s 50-ish percent first-anniversary approval rating 'b'matches not just Carter\xe2\x80\x99s but Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s'b'. (Bushes 41 and 43 both skyrocketed in Year One.) Still, minor adjustments can\xe2\x80\x99t right what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong.'b'Obama\xe2\x80\x99s plight has been unchanged for months. Neither in action nor in message is he in front of the anger roiling a country where high unemployment remains unchecked and spiraling foreclosures are demolishing the bedrock American dream of home ownership. The president is no longer seen as a savior but as a captive of the interests who ginned up the mess and still profit, hugely, from it.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s no place for any politician of any party or ideology to be. There\xe2\x80\x99s a reason why the otherwise antithetical Leno and Conan camps are united in their derision of NBC\xe2\x80\x99s titans. A TV network has become a handy proxy for every mismanaged, greedy, disloyal and unaccountable corporation in our dysfunctional economy. It\xe2\x80\x99s a business culture where the rich and well-connected get richer while the employees, shareholders and customers get the shaft. And the conviction that the game is fixed is nonpartisan. If the tea party right and populist left agree on anything, it\xe2\x80\x99s that big bailed-out banks have and will get away with murder while we pay the bill on credit cards  \xe2\x80\x94  with ever-rising fees.'b'Politically, no other issue counts. In 'b'last weekend\xe2\x80\x99s Washington Post/ABC News poll'b', 42 percent of Americans chose the economy as the country\xe2\x80\x99s most pressing concern. Only 5 percent picked terrorism, and 2 percent Afghanistan. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s highest approval ratings are now on foreign policy and national security issues  \xe2\x80\x94  despite the relentless hammering from the Cheney right  \xe2\x80\x94  but voters don\xe2\x80\x99t care.'b'Does health care matter? Not as much as you\xe2\x80\x99d think after this yearlong crusade. In the Post/ABC poll, the issue was second-tier  \xe2\x80\x94  at 24 percent. Obama has blundered, not by positioning himself too far to the left but by landing nowhere  \xe2\x80\x94  frittering away his political capital by being too vague, too slow and too deferential to Congress. The smartest thing said as the Massachusetts returns came in Tuesday night was by Howard Fineman on MSNBC: \xe2\x80\x9cObama took all his winnings and turned them over to Max Baucus.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Worse, the master communicator in the White House has still not delivered a coherent message on his signature policy. He not only refused to signal his health care imperatives early on but even now he, like Congressional Democrats, has failed to explain clearly why and how reform relates to economic recovery  \xe2\x80\x94  or, for that matter, what he wants the final bill to contain. Sure, a president needs political wiggle room as legislative sausage is made, but Scott Brown could and did drive his truck through the wide, wobbly parameters set by Obama.'b'Ask yourself this: All these months later, do you yet know what the health care plan means for your family\xe2\x80\x99s bottom line, your taxes, your insurance? It\xe2\x80\x99s this nebulousness, magnified by endless Senate versus House squabbling, that has allowed reform to be caricatured by its foes  as an impenetrable Rube Goldberg monstrosity, a parody of deficit-ridden big government. Since most voters are understandably confused about what the bills contain, the opponents have been able to attribute any evil they want to Obamacare, from death panels to the death of Medicare, without fear of contradiction.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s too late to rewrite that history, but it may not be too late for White House decisiveness. Whatever happens now  \xe2\x80\x94  good, bad or ugly  \xe2\x80\x94  must happen fast. Each day Washington spends dickering over health care is another day lost while the election-year economy, stupid, remains intractable for Americans who are suffering.'b'On the economic front, Obama needs both stylistic and substantive makeovers. He has stepped up the populist rhetoric lately  \xe2\x80\x94  and markedly after political disaster struck last week  \xe2\x80\x94  but few find this serene Harvard-trained lawyer credible when 'b'slinging populist rhetoric at \xe2\x80\x9cfat-cat\xe2\x80\x9d bankers'b'. His two principal economic policy makers are useless, if not counterproductive, surrogates. Timothy Geithner, the Treasury secretary, was probably fatally compromised from 'b'the moment his tax lapses surfaced'b'; now he is stalked by the pileup of unanswered questions about 'b'the still-not-transparent machinations at the New York Fed'b' when he was knee-deep in the A.I.G. bailout. Lawrence Summers, the top administration economic guru, is a symbol of the Clinton-era deregulatory orgy that helped fuel the bubble.'b'The White House clearly knows this duo is a political albatross. After 'b'the news broke that 85,000 more jobs had been lost'b' in December despite some economists\xe2\x80\x99 more optimistic predictions, Christina Romer, a more user-friendly (though still academic) economic hand, was dispatched to the 'b'Sunday'b' 'b'shows'b'. This is at best a makeshift solution.'b'Obama needs more independent economists like Paul Volcker, who was hastily retrieved from exile last week after the Massachusetts massacre prompted the White House to 'b' tardily embrace his strictures on big banks'b'. Obama also needs economic spokesmen who are 'b'not 'b'economists and who can authentically speak to life on the ground. Obama must also reconnect. The former community organizer 'b'whose credit card was denied at the Hertz counter during the 2000 Democratic convention'b' now spends too much time at the White House presiding over boardroom-table meetings and stiff initiative rollouts instead of engaging with Americans not dressed in business suits.'b'When it comes to economic substance, small symbolic gestures (the 'b'proposed new bank \xe2\x80\x9cfee\xe2\x80\x9d'b') won\xe2\x80\x99t cut it. Nor will ineffectual presidential sound bites railing against Wall Street bonuses beyond the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s purview. There\xe2\x80\x99s no chance of a second stimulus. The White House will have to jawbone banks on foreclosures, credit card racketeering and the loosening of credit to small businesses. This means taking on bankers who were among the Obama campaign\xe2\x80\x99s biggest backers and whose lobbyists have castrated regulatory reform by buying off congressmen of both parties. It means pressing for all constitutional remedies that might counter 'b'last week\xe2\x80\x99s 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision'b' allowing corporate campaign contributions to buy off even more.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s become so easy to pin financial elitism on Democrats that the morning after Brown\xe2\x80\x99s victory the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee 'b'had the gall to accuse them'b' of being the \xe2\x80\x9cone party who bailed out the automakers and insurance companies.\xe2\x80\x9d Never mind that the Bush White House gave us the bank (and A.I.G.) bailouts, or that the G.O.P. is even more in hock than Democrats to corporate patrons. The Obama administration is so overstocked with Goldman Sachs-Robert Rubin alumni and so tainted by its back-room health care deals with pharmaceutical and insurance companies that conservative politicians, Brown included, can masquerade shamelessly as the populist alternative.'b'Last year the president pointedly studied J.F.K.\xe2\x80\x99s decision-making process on Vietnam while seeking the way forward in Afghanistan. In the end, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t emulate his predecessor and escalated the war. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see how that turns out. Meanwhile, Obama might look at another pivotal moment in the Kennedy presidency  \xe2\x80\x94  and this time heed the example.'b'The incident unfolded in April 1962  \xe2\x80\x94  some 15 months into the new president\xe2\x80\x99s term  \xe2\x80\x94  when J.F.K. was infuriated by the U.S. Steel chairman\xe2\x80\x99s decision to break a White House-brokered labor-management contract agreement and raise the price of steel (but not wages). Kennedy was no radical. He hailed from the American elite  \xe2\x80\x94  like Obama, a product of Harvard, but, unlike Obama, the patrician scion of a wealthy family. And yet he, like that other Harvard patrician, F.D.R., had no hang-ups about battling his own class.'b'Kennedy didn\xe2\x80\x99t settle for the generic populist rhetoric of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s latest threats to \xe2\x80\x9cfight\xe2\x80\x9d unspecified bankers some indeterminate day. He instead took the strong action of dressing down U.S. Steel by name. As Richard Reeves writes in his book \xe2\x80\x9c'b'President Kennedy'b',\xe2\x80\x9d reporters were left \xe2\x80\x9cliterally gasping.\xe2\x80\x9d The 'b'young president called out big steel'b' for threatening \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic recovery and stability\xe2\x80\x9d while Americans risked their lives in Southeast Asia. J.F.K. threatened to sic his brother\xe2\x80\x99s Justice Department on corporate records and then held firm as his opponents likened his flex of muscle to the power grabs of Hitler and Mussolini. (Sound familiar?) U.S. Steel 'b'capitulated in two days'b'. The Times 'b'soon reported on its front page'b' that Kennedy was at \xe2\x80\x9ca high point in popular support.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Can anyone picture Obama exerting such take-no-prisoners leadership to challenge those who threaten our own economic recovery and stability at a time of deep recession and war? That we can\xe2\x80\x99t is a powerful indicator of why what happened in Massachusetts will not stay in Massachusetts if this White House fails to reboot.'b'I wondered how the Governator of California felt about the crumbling Kennedy legacy in Massachusetts and the rocketing Scott Brown, who has promised to scuttle the health care bill.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn Hollywood, people are made a star overnight,\xe2\x80\x9d Arnold Schwarzenegger said, calling from L.A. on Friday. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat he has done is spectacular. Party leaders are telling him: \xe2\x80\x98You could be the next Obama. Two years in office and then you run.\xe2\x80\x99'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSpecifically, this has to do with the health care bill,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, noting that he and many others had gotten turned off by the cost of the bill and the inequity of giving sweetheart deals to some senators, like Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s Ben Nelson.'b'Teddy Kennedy was the uncle of Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and now, as Jon Stewart proclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Kennedy legacy goes down to a naked guy who owns a truck.\xe2\x80\x9d But even though Teddy\xe2\x80\x99s widow, Vicki, is fighting hard for the bill, the governor hopes Brown kills it.'b'Obama, he said, was \xe2\x80\x9ctrying to search very quickly for the sweet spot  \xe2\x80\x94 what would just close the deal. And my point is, let\xe2\x80\x99s not go and do this for the sake of having done it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yet after his own bronco ride running a state that\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculously hard to govern, Arnold has a new understanding of why Teddy  \xe2\x80\x94 and President Obama  \xe2\x80\x94 struggled in their attempts at big changes.'b'On the cusp of the special election for Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s seat, when I interviewed Arnold at his favorite Beverly Hills lunchtime haunt, Caff\xc3\xa9 Roma, the governor was already confident that Martha Coakley was going down.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a major disaster \xe2\x80\x94 the Democrats are in a major panic mode,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, chuckling with satisfaction, leaning back in his black sheepskin-lined jacket and smoking a big stogie. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re going in the dead bed. It will be a punishing blow for the Democrats in 2010.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'About the cinematically handsome Brown, who campaigned in a GMC pick-up truck and once posed in the buff in Cosmo, Arnold ruminated: \xe2\x80\x9cIn acting, they always tell you, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t just talk. Don\xe2\x80\x99t just let words come out of your mouth. Go and get inside the heart.\xe2\x80\x99 I think the guy has that ability.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Recalling his own 2003 campaign, when Bill Clinton and other Democratic stars came West to boost Gray Davis  \xe2\x80\x94 improbably casting Arnold as David rather than Goliath \xe2\x80\x94 he predicted that sending Obama to Boston would backfire:'b'Obama \xe2\x80\x9cup against the little guy no one has ever heard of before, the guy who is with his truck, driving around and shaking hands and really has new vision and energy. People look at that and say, \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to help the little guy.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Tea-party-style voter revolts are just part of \xe2\x80\x9cthe rhythm\xe2\x80\x9d of American politics, he said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been the victim of that myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople change very quickly, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t complain because that\xe2\x80\x99s the way people are. Work somewhere in a soup kitchen or something if you can\xe2\x80\x99t take the pressure.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cObama was a great candidate. He speaks well, looks good, he\xe2\x80\x99s articulate, he\xe2\x80\x99s smart, blah, blah, blah, all these kind of things. They went running towards Obama: \xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s our savior.\xe2\x80\x99 They hated Republicans. So then Obama gets to office and talks about the things he promised. \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99re going to stimulate the economy.\xe2\x80\x99 Well, wh-wh-what is this? Is this handouts? So everything that is put on the table is being fought as if he\xe2\x80\x99s going against his promises, which he isn\xe2\x80\x99t. But that\xe2\x80\x99s the way it works, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a very odd thing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Did Obama make a mistake, using all his capital on health care?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe let other people do the negotiating,\xe2\x80\x9d Arnold replied. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to travel around, if you want to put fires out all over the world, O.K., but you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be there for those negotiations.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'James Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s Terminator likes to look at the big picture, or the \xe2\x80\x9cmaster shot,\xe2\x80\x9d as he puts it. And his own master shot shows him jumping from bodybuilding champ to top movie star to governor, scaling every peak \xe2\x80\x9cwith tunnel vision.\xe2\x80\x9d He overcame movie focus groups that said, as he recalled, \xe2\x80\x9cJeez, he scares the hell out of me, I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m in Germany and the Nazis are back.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He speculated that Democrats and Republicans were too scared of him to pass a law allowing immigrants to run for president, but if they had, he would have jumped in \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it\xe2\x80\x99s there.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Arnold freely talks about his admiration for Jerry Brown.  Would he be upset if the Republicans lost and Brown succeeded him?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, taking a final puff. \xe2\x80\x9cI think the best person should win, whatever party that is.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It all began with a stop at a red light.'b'Kevin Salwen, a writer and entrepreneur in Atlanta, was driving his 14-year-old daughter, Hannah, back from a sleepover in 2006. While waiting at a traffic light, they saw a black Mercedes coupe on one side and a homeless man begging for food on the other.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDad, if that man had a less nice car, that man there could have a meal,\xe2\x80\x9d Hannah protested. The light changed and they drove on, but Hannah was too young to be reasonable. She pestered her parents about inequity, insisting that she wanted to do something.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want to do?\xe2\x80\x9d her mom responded. \xe2\x80\x9cSell our house?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Warning! Never suggest a grand gesture to an idealistic teenager. Hannah seized upon the idea of selling the luxurious family home and donating half the proceeds to charity, while using the other half to buy a more modest replacement home.'b'Eventually, that\xe2\x80\x99s what the family did. The project \xe2\x80\x94 crazy, impetuous and utterly inspiring \xe2\x80\x94 is 'b'chronicled in a book'b' by father and daughter scheduled to be published next month: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Power of Half.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s a book that, frankly, I\xe2\x80\x99d be nervous about leaving around where my own teenage kids might find it. An impressionable child reads this, and the next thing you know your whole family is out on the street.'b'At a time of enormous needs in Haiti and elsewhere, when so many Americans are trying to help Haitians by sending everything from text messages to shoes, the Salwens offer an example of a family that came together to make a difference \xe2\x80\x94 for themselves as much as the people they were trying to help. In 'b'a column a week ago'b', I described neurological evidence from brain scans that altruism lights up parts of the brain normally associated with more primal gratifications such as food and sex. The Salwens\xe2\x80\x99 experience confirms the selfish pleasures of selflessness.'b'Mr. Salwen and his wife, Joan, had always assumed that their kids would be better off in a bigger house. But after they downsized, there was much less space to retreat to, so the family members spent more time around each other. A smaller house unexpectedly turned out to be a more family-friendly house.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe essentially traded stuff for togetherness and connectedness,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Salwen told me, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t figure out why everybody wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want that deal.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'One reason for that togetherness was the complex process of deciding how to spend the money. The Salwens researched causes and charities, finally settling on the 'b'Hunger Project'b', a New York City-based international development organization that has a good record of tackling global poverty.'b'The Salwens pledged $800,000 to sponsor health, microfinancing, food and other programs for about 40 villages in Ghana. They traveled to Ghana with a Hunger Project executive, John Coonrod, who is an inspiration in his own right. Over the years, he and his wife donated so much back from their modest aid-worker salaries that they were among the top Hunger Project donors in New York.'b'The Salwens\xe2\x80\x99 initiative hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone entirely smoothly. Hannah promptly won over her parents, but her younger brother, Joe, was (reassuringly) a red-blooded American boy to whom it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t intuitively obvious that life would improve by moving into a smaller house and giving money to poor people. Outvoted and outmaneuvered, Joe gamely went along.'b'The Salwens also are troubled that some people are reacting negatively to their project, seeing them as sanctimonious showoffs. Or that people are protesting giving to Ghana when there are so many needy Americans.'b'Still, they have inspired some converts. The people who sold the Salwens their new home were so impressed that they committed $100,000 to the project. And one of Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s closest friends, Blaise, pledged half of her baby-sitting savings to an environmental charity.'b'In writing the book, the Salwens say, the aim wasn\xe2\x80\x99t actually to get people to sell their houses. They realize that few people are quite that nutty. Rather, the aim was to encourage people to step off the treadmill of accumulation, to define themselves by what they give as well as by what they possess.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo one expects anyone to sell a house,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hannah, now a high school junior who hopes to become a nurse. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a ridiculous thing to do. For us, the house was just something we could live without. It was too big for us. Everyone has too much of something, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s time, talent or treasure. Everyone does have their own half, you just have to find it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As for Kevin Salwen, he\xe2\x80\x99s delighted by what has unfolded since that encounter at the red light.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the most self-interested thing we have ever done,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m thrilled that we can help others. I\xe2\x80\x99m blown away by how much it has helped us.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The most striking feature of Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s campaign for the presidency was the amazing, young, Internet-enabled, grass-roots movement he mobilized to get elected. The most striking feature of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s presidency a year later is how thoroughly that movement has disappeared.'b'In part, it disappeared because the Obama team let it disappear, as Obama moved to pass what was necessary \xe2\x80\x94 the economic stimulus \xe2\x80\x94 and what he aspired to \xe2\x80\x94 health care \xe2\x80\x94 by exclusively playing inside baseball with Congress. The president seems to have thought that his majorities in the Senate and the House were so big that he never really had to mobilize \xe2\x80\x9cthe people\xe2\x80\x9d to drive his agenda. Obama turned all his supporters into spectators of The Harry and Nancy Show. And, at the same time, that grass-roots movement went dormant on its own, apparently thinking that just getting the first African-American elected as president was the moon shot of this generation, and nothing more was necessary.'b'Well, here\xe2\x80\x99s my free advice to Obama, post-Massachusetts. If you think that the right response  is to unleash a populist backlash against bankers, you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong. Please, please re-regulate the banks in a smart way. But remember: in the long run, Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t rally to angry politicians. They do not bring out the best in us. We rally to inspirational, hopeful ones. They bring out the best in us. And right now we need to be at our best.'b'Obama should launch his own moon shot. What the country needs most now is not more government stimulus, but more stimulation. We need to get millions of American kids, not just the geniuses, excited about innovation and entrepreneurship again. We need to make 2010 what Obama should have made 2009: the year of innovation, the year of making our pie bigger, the year of \xe2\x80\x9cStart-Up America.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Obama should make the centerpiece of his presidency mobilizing a million new start-up companies that won\xe2\x80\x99t just give us temporary highway jobs, but lasting good jobs that keep America on the cutting edge. The best way to counter the Tea Party movement, which is all about stopping things, is with an Innovation Movement, which is all about starting things. Without inventing more new products and services that make people more productive, healthier or entertained  \xe2\x80\x94  that we can sell around the world  \xe2\x80\x94  we\xe2\x80\x99ll never be able to afford the health care our people need, let alone pay off our debts.'b'Obama should bring together the country\xe2\x80\x99s leading innovators and ask them: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat legislation, what tax incentives, do we need right now to replicate you all a million times over\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x94  and make that his No. 1 priority. Inspiring, reviving and empowering Start-up America is his moon shot.'b'And to reignite his youth movement, he should make sure every American kid knows about two programs that he has already endorsed: The first is National Lab Day. Introduced last November by a coalition of educators and science and engineering associations, Lab Day aims to inspire a wave of future innovators, by pairing veteran scientists and engineers with students in grades K-12 to inspire thousands of hands-on science projects around the country.'b'Any teacher in America, explains the entrepreneur Jack Hidary, the chairman of N.L.D., can go to the Web site 'b'NationalLabDay.org'b'  and enter the science project he or she is  interested in teaching, or get an idea for one. N.L.D. will match  teachers with volunteer scientists and engineers in their areas  for mentoring.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as you have a match, the scientists and the students communicate directly or via Skype and collaborate on a project,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hidary. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a class in Chicago asking for civil engineers to teach them how to build a bridge. In Idaho, a class is asking for a scientist to help them build a working river delta inside their classroom.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The president should also vow to bring the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship, or NFTE, to every low-income neighborhood in America. NFTE works with middle- and high-school teachers to help them teach entrepreneurship. The centerpiece of its program is a national contest for start-ups with 24,000 kids participating. Each student has to invent a product or service, write up a business plan and then do it. NFTE ('b'www.NFTE.com'b')  works only in low-income areas, so many of these new entrepreneurs are minority kids.'b'In November, a documentary movie  \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cTen9Eight\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 was released that tracked a dozen students all the way through to the finals of the NFTE competition. Obama should arrange for this movie to be shown in 'b'every'b' classroom in America. It is the most inspirational, heartwarming film you will ever see. You can obtain details about it at  'b'www.ten9eight.com'b'.'b'This year\xe2\x80\x99s three finalists, said Amy Rosen, the chief executive of NFTE, \xe2\x80\x9cwere an immigrant\xe2\x80\x99s son who took a class from H&amp;R Block and invented a company to do tax returns for high school students, a young woman who taught herself how to sew and designed custom-made dresses, and the winner was an African-American boy who manufactured socially meaningful T-shirts.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'You want more good jobs, spawn more Steve Jobs. Obama should have focused on that from Day 1. He must focus on that for Year 2.'b'It was hard to look at some of the pictures of suffering and death caused by t'b'he earthquake in Haiti'b' \xe2\x80\x94 and impossible to turn away.'b'The top of 'b'one front page'b' in The Times was dominated by a woman, her hand to her cheek, as if in shock, walking past partially covered corpses lined up along a dirty curb. The next day, 'b'an even larger photograph'b' at the top of Page 1 showed a man covered in gray dust, lying alone, dead, statue-like, on a stretcher made from a piece of tattered cardboard spread over a crude ladder. Inside that same paper, the Friday after the disaster, was 'b'a gruesome scene'b' from the central morgue in Port-au-Prince: a man mourning the death of his 10-month-old daughter, lying in her diaper atop a pile of bodies.'b'Some readers were offended at these scenes and even more graphic 'b'pictures'b' on the paper\xe2\x80\x99s Web site, calling them exploitive and sensationalistic. \xe2\x80\x9cThe numerous photographs printed in The Times showing the dead strewn about the streets of Port-au-Prince are unnecessary, unethical, unkind and inhumane,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Randy Stebbins of Hammond, La. Christa Robbins of Chicago said, \xe2\x80\x9cI feel that the people who have suffered the most are being spectacularized by your blood-and-gore photographs, which do not at all inform me of the relief efforts, the political stability of the region or the extent of damage to families and infrastructure.\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke for several readers when she added, \xe2\x80\x9cIf this had happened in California, I cannot imagine a similar depiction of half-clothed bodies splayed out for the camera. What are you thinking?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But other readers were grateful for the shocking pictures, even as they were deeply troubled by them. Mary Louise Thomas of Palatka, Fla., said a different photo of the baby, lying on her dead mother, caused her to cry out, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d and to sob for an hour. \xe2\x80\x9cBut run from it? Never,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. People repelled by such images \xe2\x80\x9cshould really try staring truth in the face occasionally and try to understand it,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote.'b'Mary Claire Carroll of Richmond, Vt., asked, \xe2\x80\x9cHow else can you motivate or inspire someone like me to donate money\xe2\x80\x9d to help out in Haiti? Her son, she added, thinks Americans \xe2\x80\x9care too sheltered and protected from the real world.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Every disaster that produces horrific scenes of carnage presents photographers and their editors with the challenge of telling the unsanitized truth without crossing into the offensive and truly exploitive. In 2004, when a giant undersea earthquake 'b'unleashed a tsunami'b' that killed tens of thousands along Indian Ocean coastlines, The Times ran 'b'a dramatic front-page photo'b' of a woman overcome with grief amid rows of dead children, including her own. Some readers protested, but the newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s first public editor, Daniel Okrent, 'b'concluded'b' that the paper was right to publish the picture. It told the story of the tsunami, he said.'b'I asked 'b'Kenneth Irby'b', leader of the visual journalism group at the Poynter Institute in Florida, for his assessment of the pictures from Haiti. Irby brings unusual perspectives to the task. He is a veteran photojournalist and an ordained minister, the pastor of an African Methodist Episcopal church in Palmetto, Fla. His wife\xe2\x80\x99s best friend is Haitian, and her family was still unaccounted for when we talked last week. \xe2\x80\x9cI think the Times coverage has been raw, truthful and tasteful,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me, defending even the most graphic images.'b'Irby, who has been in touch with photographers in Haiti, said survivors want the world to see what has happened. \xe2\x80\x9cThe actual loved ones, the bereaved, implore the journalists to tell their stories,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'That is exactly what Damon Winter told me. He is the Times photographer who 'b'took the pictures'b' that elicited most of the protests to me and much praise on the paper\xe2\x80\x99s Web site. Winter, 'b'who won a Pulitzer Prize'b' last year for 'b'his coverage'b' of the Obama presidential campaign, was the first Times staff photographer on the scene, flying from New York to the Dominican Republic and then into Haiti aboard a chartered helicopter. He had never been to Haiti or covered a natural disaster.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have had so many people beg me to come to their home and photograph the bodies of their children, brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are so many times that I have to apologize and say that I cannot, that I have photographed so many bodies already, and I think it breaks their hearts because they so desperately want people to know what has happened to them, what tremendous pain they are in, and that they desperately need help.\xe2\x80\x9d Winter said it was important \xe2\x80\x9cthat I do whatever I can to try and make our readers understand just how dire the situation is here.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Jessie De Witt, an international photo editor, said Winter sent the paper 26 pictures on his first day in Haiti, including the picture of the bodies along the curb that wound up on the front page. He sent 65 the next day, including the mourning father and the dead man on the stretcher. De Witt and her colleagues think carefully about photo selections. A picture of a dog eyeing a corpse is out, as are stacks of bodies without context. And they think about juxtaposition: an Armageddon-like scene of people scrambling for supplies from a ruined store was played against a quieter picture of people waiting patiently for medical treatment.'b''b'Michele McNally'b', the assistant managing editor in charge of photography, said she was going through all the photos from all sources, and Winter\xe2\x80\x99s photos of the single dead man and the grieving father \xe2\x80\x9cstopped me in my tracks.\xe2\x80\x9d Bill Keller, the executive editor, said editors considered both for the front page, but chose the lone body, played big, because it was dramatic and there was \xe2\x80\x9can intimacy that causes people to pause and dwell on the depth of the tragedy.\xe2\x80\x9d Looking at one person, instead of many, \xe2\x80\x9chumanizes it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'I asked McNally about Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s contention that such pictures would not appear in the paper if the victims were somewhere in the United States. If such pictures existed, she said, she would run them. When'b' Hurricane Katrina'b' hit New Orleans, The Times did publish 'b'a front-page picture'b' of a body floating near a bridge where a woman was feeding her dog. But despite Katrina\xe2\x80\x99s toll, there were relatively few such images in the paper. Irby said that authorities in the United States are generally quick to cordon off disaster scenes.'b'Just as a picture of a grieving mother told the story of the tsunami in 2004, the disturbing images of the last two weeks have been telling the story of Haiti, and The Times is right to publish them. As Patricia Lay-Dorsey, a reader from Detroit, put it, Winter\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccamera was my eye as much as it was his. And every one of his photos told the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The conventional wisdom is that the chances of Congress passing a bill that puts both a cap and a price on greenhouse gases are somewhere between terrible and nil. President Obama can start to prove the conventional wisdom wrong by making a full-throated case for a climate bill in his State of the Union speech this week.'b'Washington has been forecasting the likely death of a climate bill with renewed certainty since Massachusetts elected a Republican senator who promised to block pretty much anything Mr. Obama wants. But even before then we were hearing two reasons why a bill could not pass: The Senate won\xe2\x80\x99t have any strength left when it finishes with health care, and the nation cannot afford a bill that implies an increase in energy prices.'b'The first reason is defeatist, the second greatly exaggerated. The climate change bills pending in the Senate would not begin to bite for several years, when the recession should be over. The cost to households, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would be small. A good program would create more jobs than it cost.'b'The list of reasons to pass a climate bill, on the other hand, is long and persuasive.'b'Start with timing. The long-term trend in greenhouse gas emissions is up (the decade ending in 2009 was the warmest on record), and the sooner emissions decline, the better. The bill passed by the House last year calls for emissions in 2020 to be 17 percent lower than they were in 2005. This is the bare minimum required to give the industrialized world a fighting chance of achieving an 80 percent reduction by midcentury, which most mainstream scientists think will be necessary to avert the worst consequences of global warming.'b'Then there is the race for markets. China is moving aggressively to create jobs in the clean-energy industry. Beijing not only plans to generate 15 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2020, but hopes to become the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading exporter of clean energy technologies. Five years ago, it had no presence at all in the wind manufacturing industry; today it has 70 manufacturers. It is rapidly becoming a world leader in solar power, with one-third of the world\xe2\x80\x99s manufacturing capacity.'b'Finally there\xe2\x80\x99s the question of credibility: Mr. Obama said in Copenhagen that the United States would meet at least the House\xe2\x80\x99s 17 percent target. Success in the Senate is essential to delivering on that pledge. Failure would undo many of the good things he achieved in Copenhagen, and it would give reluctant powers like China an excuse to duck their pledges.'b'The jobs argument should impress the Senate. Yet many Democrats as well as Republicans seem willing to settle for what would be the third energy bill in five years \xe2\x80\x94 loans for nuclear power, mandates for renewable energy, new standards for energy efficiency. These are all useful steps. But the only sure way to unlock the investments required to transform the way the country produces and delivers energy is to put a price on carbon.'b'Some senators understand that. John Kerry, Joseph Lieberman and Lindsey Graham are trying to forge a bill with a price on emissions as its core and enough other bells and whistles to attract the necessary filibuster-proof 60 votes. They will need help. Mr. Obama is the best person to provide it.'b'After New York\xe2\x80\x99s Legislature passed an ethics package last week, Senator Liz Krueger, a Democrat from Manhattan who voted for the bill, told her colleagues, \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to not pat ourselves on the back that much because we have further to go.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Actually, they should not congratulate themselves at all. Gov. David Paterson was right to threaten to veto the bill, and if the Legislature sends it to him, he should do just that. Meanwhile, the governor should negotiate something much better:'b'\xc2\xb6The bill needs a section severely limiting the use of campaign money \xe2\x80\x94 no more pool covers, legal fees or country club bills. And politicians who leave office should be required to clear out their campaign accounts within a few months. Eliot Spitzer still has a campaign fund though he resigned as governor two years ago. Former Senator Roy Goodman, a Republican from Manhattan,  still has $400,000, eight years after retiring.'b'\xc2\xb6Mr. Paterson could help Senate Republicans who offered useful amendments to the ethics bill but got little traction with Democratic majorities in both houses. One would give the attorney general authority to enforce campaign finance laws. Another would require the special counsel at the board of elections to be from a different political party every few years.'b'\xc2\xb6The bill requires much more disclosure about the private businesses of New York\xe2\x80\x99s part-time legislators \xe2\x80\x94 except lawyers. Lawyers like Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, and John Sampson, the Senate leader, do not have to reveal their clients if they have no business with the state. This is unfair to the public and to lawmakers who would have to reveal other clients in detail.'b'\xc2\xb6The ethics bill creates a more independent overseer for the governor and the state government, but not the Legislature. Mr. Paterson should press legislators to make their own ethics commission as strong and independent as the governor\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'\xc2\xb6Governor Paterson should push for two ways to give voters more choices.  One would be to establish public financing of campaigns, as  in New York City. A more fundamental way, however, would be to create a nonpartisan commission on redistricting before the election this fall. Nobody knows who will be in charge of the Legislature next year when political maps are redrawn. That should make it even more imperative that the state establish a fair, independent body to create these districts.'b'If Albany\xe2\x80\x99s lawmakers cannot tell voters that they have started draining their political swamp, then they have nothing to offer this fall. New York voters should let their elected representatives know that they want ethics reform \xe2\x80\x94 or new representatives.

But there you go.'b'Irate at the administration\xe2\x80\x99s decision to impose a fee on the largest banks, the bank lobby has hired a top lawyer to challenge the levy all the way up to the Supreme Court. Their case seems to rest on the perplexing argument that the fee would amount to a bill of attainder, which singles out a specific group of people and violates their right to due process. But the levy is aimed at a class \xe2\x80\x94 very large financial institutions. There are other taxes, fines and fees that operate in the same sort of way.'b'The push-back against the fee underscores bankers\xe2\x80\x99 peculiar sense of entitlement. They feel entitled to the public support dished out by the Treasury, the F.D.I.C. and the Federal Reserve. Yet they do not believe they should be made to contribute toward the effort to save the economy from their reckless behavior.'b'President Obama articulated the fee as a way to recover the $117 billion cost of the direct financial bailout. It would apply to financial institutions with more than $50 billion in assets. (Bank of America, the country\xe2\x80\x99s largest bank, would have to pay about $1.5 billion a year.)'b'Mr. Obama could have gone further. Government assistance to the banks went far beyond the Treasury\xe2\x80\x99s bailout \xe2\x80\x94 large guarantees from the F.D.I.C., copious lending from the Federal Reserve, extremely low interest rates. And the damage caused by the banks exceeded $117 billion by an order of magnitude.'b'A levy on big banks\xe2\x80\x99 assets could also be seen as a way to slow the further consolidation of a banking system that already has too many banks considered too big to fail. It fits the administration\xe2\x80\x99s avowed interest in limiting the size of commercial banks by tightening limits on their market shares. In any case, having spent trillions to drag the economy back from the brink of the abyss, the government needs the money.'b'And the money is there. Goldman Sachs said last week that it would set aside 35.8 percent of last year\xe2\x80\x99s revenue to pay bonuses. That is down from the 48 percent Goldman doled out for bonuses in 2008. But it adds up to an obscene $16.2 billion, more than 10 times what the proposed levy is expected to cost the bank each year.'b'Bankers would do well to stop trying to avoid this fee, and they should stop trying to block broad-based reforms intended to create a more solid financial system.'b'Eventually, time will have its way with Sherlock Holmes, and he will pass fully into the public domain.

Two small shocks in London, in 1750, sent the preachers to their pulpits and pamphlets. The bishop of London blamed Londoners\xe2\x80\x99  lewd behavior; the bishop of Oxford argued that God had woven into his grand design certain incidents to alarm us and shake us out of our sin. In Bloomsbury, the Rev. Dr. William Stukeley preached that earthquakes are favored by God as the ultimate sign of his wrathful intervention.'b'Five years later, when Lisbon was all but demolished by an enormous earthquake, the unholy refrain was heard again \xe2\x80\x94 one preacher even argued that the people of Lisbon had been relatively fortunate, for God had spared more people than he had killed. It was the Lisbon earthquake that prompted Voltaire to attack Leibniz\xe2\x80\x99s metaphysical optimism, in which all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds. Theodicy, which is the justification of God\xe2\x80\x99s good government of the world in the face of evil and pain, was suddenly harder to practice. But the preachers kept at it. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no divine visitation which is likely to have so general an influence upon sinners as an earthquake,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote the founder of Methodism, John Wesley, in 1777.'b'Have we made much of an advance on this appalling discourse? Our own earthquake-sermonizer, the evangelist Pat Robertson, 'b'delivered an instantly notorious defense'b' of the calamity in Haiti. This was classic theodicy. First, good comes out of such suffering. This event, said Mr. Robertson, is \xe2\x80\x9ca blessing in disguise,\xe2\x80\x9d because it might generate a  huge rebuilding program. Second, the Haitians deserve the suffering. According to Mr. Robertson, when the Haitians were throwing off the tyranny of the French, they \xe2\x80\x9cswore a pact to the devil. They said \xe2\x80\x98we will serve you if you will get us free from the French\xe2\x80\x99 ... so the Devil said \xe2\x80\x98O.K., it\xe2\x80\x99s a deal.\xe2\x80\x99 and they kicked the French out. The Haitians revolted and got themselves free but ever since they have been cursed by one thing after the other.\xe2\x80\x9d The Dominican Republic, he said, had done quite well, and had lots of tourist resorts, and that kind of thing. But not Haiti.'b'This repellent cruelty manages the extraordinary trick of combining hellfire evangelism with neo-colonialist complacency, in which the Haitians are blamed not only for their sinfulness but also for the hubris of their political rebellion. Eighteenth-century preachers at least tended to include themselves in the charge of general sinfulness and God\xe2\x80\x99s inevitable reckoning; Mr. Robertson sounds rather pleased with his own outwitting of such reckoning, as if the convenient blessing of being a God-fearing American has saved him from such pestilence. He is presumably on the other side of the sin-line, safe in some Dominican resort.'b'We should expect nothing less from the man who blamed legal abortion for Hurricane Katrina. But even when intentions are the opposite of Mr. Robertson\xe2\x80\x99s, and in a completely secular context, theological language has a way of hanging around earthquakes. In his speech  after the catastrophe, President Obama 'b'movingly invoked'b' \xe2\x80\x9cour common humanity,\xe2\x80\x9d and said that \xe2\x80\x9cwe stand in solidarity with our neighbors to the south, knowing that but for the grace of God, there we go.\xe2\x80\x9d  And there was God once again. Awkwardly, the literal meaning of Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s phrase is not so far from Pat Robertson\xe2\x80\x99s hatefulness. Who, after all, would want to worship the kind of God whose \xe2\x80\x9cgrace\xe2\x80\x9d protects Americans from Haitian horrors?'b'The president was merely uttering an idiomatic version of the kind of thing you hear from survivors whenever a disaster strikes: \xe2\x80\x9cGod must have been watching out for me; it\xe2\x80\x99s a miracle I survived,\xe2\x80\x9d whereby those who died were presumably not being \xe2\x80\x9cwatched out for.\xe2\x80\x9d That President Obama did not really mean this \xe2\x80\x94 he clearly did not \xe2\x80\x94 is telling, insofar as it suggests how the theological language of punishment and mercy lives on unconsciously, well after the actual theology has been discarded.'b'Or has it? If the president simply meant that most of us have been \xe2\x80\x94 so far \xe2\x80\x94 luckier than Haitians, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he say that? Perhaps because, as a Christian, he does not want to believe that he subscribes to such a nonprovidential category as luck, or to the turn of fate\xe2\x80\x99s wheel, which is really a pagan notion. Besides, to talk of luck, or fortune, in the face of a disaster seems flippant, and belittling to those who have been savaged by such bad luck. A toothache is bad luck; an earthquake is somehow theological.'b'The only people who would seem to have the right to invoke God at the moment are the Haitians themselves, who beseech his help amidst dreadful pain. They, too, alas, appear to wander  the wasteland of theodicy. News reports have described some Haitians giving voice to a worldview uncomfortably close to Pat Robertson\xe2\x80\x99s, in which a vengeful God has been meting out justified retribution: \xe2\x80\x9cI blame man. God gave us nature, and we Haitians, and our governments, abused the land. You cannot get away without consequences,\xe2\x80\x9d one man told The Times last week.'b'Others sound like a more frankly theological President Obama: a 27-year-old survivor, Mond\xc3\xa9sir Raymone, was quoted thus: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have survived by the grace of God.\xe2\x80\x9d Bishop \xc3\x89ric Toussaint, standing near his damaged cathedral, said something similar: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy give thanks to God? Because we are here. What happened is the will of God. We are in the hands of God now.\xe2\x80\x9d A survivor\xe2\x80\x99s gratitude is combined with theological fatalism. This response is entirely understandable, uttered in a ruined landscape beyond the experience of most of us, and a likely source of pastoral comfort to the bishop\xe2\x80\x99s desperate flock. But that should not obscure the fact that it is little more than a piece of helpless mystification, a contradictory cry of optimistic despair.'b'Terrible catastrophes inevitably encourage appeals to God. We who are, at present, unfairly luckier, whether believers or not, might reflect on the almost invariably uncharitable history of theodicy, and on the reality that in this context no invocation of God beyond a desperate appeal for help makes much theological sense. For either God is punitive and interventionist (the Robertson view), or as capricious as nature and so absent as to be effectively nonexistent (the Obama view). Unfortunately, the Bible, which frequently uses God\xe2\x80\x99s power over earth and seas as the sign of his majesty and intervening power, supports the first view; and the history of humanity\xe2\x80\x99s lonely suffering decisively suggests the second.'b'SCOTT BROWN\xe2\x80\x99S victory last week in the Massachusetts Senate race, following the Republican gubernatorial triumphs in New Jersey and Virginia, marked the third time in three months that the Democratic Party has lost the support and trust of independent voters.'b'The message these voters sent was clear. With one out of five Americans unemployed or underemployed, President Obama and the Democratic Party need to shift attention away from health care and toward a bold effort to create jobs, improve the economy and rein in the size of government.'b'Here are four simple steps we must take immediately to put us, and the nation, on a better course:'b'First, cut taxes for businesses \xe2\x80\x94 big and small \xe2\x80\x94 and find innovative ways to get Americans back to work. We can start by giving any companies that are less than five years old an exemption from payroll taxes for six months; extending the current capital gains and dividend tax rates through 2012; giving permanent tax credits for businesses that invest in research and development; and reducing the top corporate tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent.'b'America\xe2\x80\x99s primary job-creating machine \xe2\x80\x94 the private sector \xe2\x80\x94 needs to be rejuvenated. Democrats must lead now on job creation or risk forfeiting Congressional majorities in November.'b'Second, we should pass a more focused health reform bill that restructures current health care costs before spending more, prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions, enacts responsible reform on malpractice suits and extends health coverage to all children. And we must allow states to have input into the expansion of health coverage, as they will have to pay for much of the reform themselves.'b'This program isn\xe2\x80\x99t all that Democrats wanted from health care reform right now, but it\xe2\x80\x99s what the country wants. And it\xe2\x80\x99s what the country can afford.'b'Third, we should reform our immigration policy to ensure that those who contribute to our economy, especially foreign math and science graduates of American universities, have a clear path to citizenship.'b'Finally, we need to address budget deficits now rather than waiting for some ideal future economic situation. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good sign that the Obama administration is following the advice of Senators Kent Conrad of North Dakota, Evan Bayh of Indiana and other Democratic fiscal pragmatists who embrace the idea of a bipartisan commission to recommend spending cuts to rein in deficit growth. But we must be sure that the administration and Congress heed the commission\xe2\x80\x99s advice.'b'By focusing on job creation and deficit reduction, we can expand our economy and balance the budget. We\xe2\x80\x99ve done it before: When President Bill Clinton took office in 1993, he inherited a record fiscal deficit after years of Republicans in the White House. After eight years in office (and 22 million jobs created), President Clinton had balanced the budget and left his successor with a surplus. This can be done again.'b'To be sure, President Obama has achieved some important successes. His policies prevented the financial system from collapsing, saved America\xe2\x80\x99s auto industry from extinction and avoided a depression. But that extreme crisis is over \xe2\x80\x94 what our country needs now is better, not more, government.'b'A Democratic Party refocused on revitalizing our economy, protecting the United States from terrorism and re-establishing itself as the party for the middle class is what Americans are demanding. If we do this, victory at the polling booths will take care of itself.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'How Retirees Saved the Banks'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 18):'b'Kudos to the editors for highlighting the ramifications of low interest rates.

But this would address just half the problem because taxing to disincentivize risky behavior does nothing to incentivize what is needed from the banks to bring about a robust recovery \xe2\x80\x94 namely, more lending to consumers and businesses.'b'So if banks were taxed on returns from their \xe2\x80\x9cinvestments\xe2\x80\x9d in Treasuries and other bonds at a significantly higher rate than returns from real lending to consumers and businesses, such real lending would begin in earnest and the economic recovery would accelerate and strengthen.'b'In short, then, deterring risky conduct and having healthy banks is good, but adding an incentive tax to promote productive conduct and commerce would be even better.'b'Eugene D.

This is why a one-time tax on bonuses is warranted.'b'Instead of using all of the free money to support lending and strengthen their balance sheets, Wall Streeters used much of it to pay themselves bonuses under the false claim that they earned it. Hypocrites without shame.'b'Joe Messinger'b'\n Cedarburg, Wis., Jan. 18, 2010'b''b'EARLIER  this month, the 'b'United States Fish and Wildlife Service announced'b' it would designate \xe2\x80\x9ccritical habitat\xe2\x80\x9d for the endangered jaguar in the United States and take the first steps toward mandating a jaguar recovery plan. This is a policy reversal and, on the surface, it may appear to be a victory for the conservation community and for jaguars, the largest wild cats in the Western Hemisphere.'b'But as someone who has studied jaguars for nearly three decades, I can tell you it is nothing less than a slap in the face to good science. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, by changing the rules for animal preservation, it stands to weaken the Endangered Species Act.'b'The debate on what to do about jaguars  started in 1997, when, at the urging of many biologists (including me), the Fish and Wildlife Service put the jaguar on the United States endangered species list, because there had been occasional sightings of the cats crossing north over the United States-Mexico border. At the same time, however, the agency ruled that it would not be \xe2\x80\x9cprudent\xe2\x80\x9d to declare that the jaguar  has critical habitat \xe2\x80\x94 a geographic area containing features the species needs to survive \xe2\x80\x94 in the United States. Determining an endangered species\xe2\x80\x99 critical habitat is a first step toward developing a plan for helping that species recover.'b'The 1997 decision not to determine critical habitat for the jaguar was the right one, because  even though they  cross the border from time to time, jaguars don\xe2\x80\x99t occupy any territory in  our country \xe2\x80\x94 and that probably means the environment here is no longer ideal for them.'b'In prehistoric times, these beautiful cats  inhabited significant areas of the western United States, but in the past 100 years, there have been few, if any, resident breeding populations here. The last time a female jaguar with a cub was sighted in this country was in the early 1900s. (Jaguars \xe2\x80\x94 the world\xe2\x80\x99s third-largest wild cats, weighing up to 250 pounds, with distinctive black rosettes on their fur \xe2\x80\x94 are a separate species from the smaller, tawny mountain lions, which still roam large areas of the American West.)'b'Two well-intentioned conservation advocacy groups, the Center for Biological Diversity and Defenders of Wildlife, sued the Fish and Wildlife Service to change its  ruling. Thus in 2006, the agency reassessed the situation and 'b'again determined'b' that no areas in the United States met the definition of critical habitat for the jaguar. Despite occasional sightings, mostly within 40 miles of the Mexican border, there were still no data to indicate  jaguars had taken up residence inside the United States.'b'After this second ruling was made, an Arizona rancher, with support from the state Game and Fish Department, set infrared-camera traps to gather more data, and essentially confirmed the Fish and Wildlife Service\xe2\x80\x99s findings.  The cameras did capture transient jaguars, including one male jaguar, nicknamed Macho B, who roamed the Arizona borderlands for more than a decade. But Macho B, now dead, might have been the sole resident American jaguar, and his extensive travels indicated he was not having an easy time surviving in this dry, rugged region.'b'Despite the continued evidence, the two conservation advocacy groups continued to sue the government. Apparently, they want jaguars to repopulate the United States even if jaguars don\xe2\x80\x99t want to. Last March, a federal district judge in Arizona ordered the Fish and Wildlife Service to revisit its 2006 determination on critical habitat.'b'The facts haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed: there is still no area in the United States essential to the conservation of the jaguar. But, having asserted this twice already, the service, now under a new president, has bent to the tiresome litigation. On Jan. 12, Fish and Wildlife officials claimed to have evaluated new scientific information that had become available after the July 2006 ruling. Lo and behold, they determined that it is now prudent to designate critical habitat for the jaguar in the United States.'b'This means that Fish and Wildlife must now also formulate a recovery plan for the jaguar. And since jaguars have not been able to reestablish themselves naturally over the past century, the government will likely have to go to significant expense to attempt to bring them back \xe2\x80\x94 especially if the cats have to be reintroduced.'b'So why not do everything we can, at whatever cost, to bring jaguars back into the United States? To begin with, the American Southwest is, at best, marginal habitat for the animals. More important, there are better ways to help jaguars. South of our border, from Mexico to Argentina, thousands of jaguars live and breed in their true critical habitat. Governments and conservation groups (including the one I head) are already working hard to conserve jaguar populations and connect them to one another through an initiative called the Jaguar Corridor.'b'The jaguars that now and then cross into the United States most likely come from the northernmost population of jaguars, in Sonora, Mexico. Rather than demand jaguars return to our country, we should  help Mexico and other jaguar-range countries conserve the animals\xe2\x80\x99 true habitat.'b'The recent move by the Fish and Wildlife Service means that the sparse federal funds devoted to protecting wild animals will be wasted on efforts that cannot help save jaguars. It also stands to weaken the Endangered Species Act, because if critical habitat is redefined as any place where a species might ever have existed, and where you or I might want it to exist again, then the door is open for many other senseless efforts to bring back long-lost creatures.'b'The Fish and Wildlife officials whose job it is to protect the country\xe2\x80\x99s wild animals need to grow a stronger backbone \xe2\x80\x94 stick with their original, correct decision and save their money for more useful preservation work. Otherwise, when funds are needed to preserve all those small, ugly, non-charismatic endangered species at the back of the line, there may be no money left.'b'A Republican won in Massachusetts \xe2\x80\x94 and suddenly it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear whether the Senate will confirm Ben Bernanke for a second term as Federal Reserve chairman. That\xe2\x80\x99s not as strange as it sounds: Washington has suddenly noticed public rage over economic policies that bailed out big banks but failed to create jobs. And Mr. Bernanke has become a symbol of those policies.'b'Where do I stand? I deeply admire Mr. Bernanke, both as an economist and for his response to the financial crisis. (Full disclosure: before going to the Fed he headed Princeton\xe2\x80\x99s economics department, and hired me for my current position there.) Yet his critics have a strong case. In the end, I favor his reappointment, but only because rejecting him could make the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s policies worse, not better.'b'How did we get to the point where that\xe2\x80\x99s the most I can say?'b'Mr. Bernanke is a superb research economist. And from the spring of 2008 to the spring of 2009 his academic expertise and his policy role meshed perfectly, as he used aggressive, unorthodox tactics to head off a second Great Depression.'b'Unfortunately, that\xe2\x80\x99s not the whole story. Before the crisis struck, Mr. Bernanke was very much a conventional, mainstream Fed official, sharing fully in the institution\xe2\x80\x99s complacency. Worse, after the acute phase of the crisis ended he slipped right back into that mainstream. Once again, the Fed is dangerously complacent \xe2\x80\x94 and once again, Mr. Bernanke seems to share that complacency.'b'Consider two issues: financial reform and unemployment.'b'Back in July, Mr. Bernanke spoke out against a key reform proposal: the creation of a new consumer financial protection agency. He urged Congress to maintain the current situation, in which protection of consumers from unfair financial practices is the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility.'b'But here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing: During the run-up to the crisis, as financial abuses proliferated, the Fed did nothing. In particular, it ignored warnings about subprime lending. So it was striking that in his testimony Mr. Bernanke didn\xe2\x80\x99t acknowledge that failure, didn\xe2\x80\x99t explain why it happened, and gave no reason to believe that the Fed would behave differently in the future. His message boiled down to \xe2\x80\x9cWe know what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing \xe2\x80\x94 trust us.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As I said, the Fed has returned to a dangerous complacency.'b'And then there\xe2\x80\x99s unemployment. The economy may not have collapsed, but it\xe2\x80\x99s in terrible shape, with job-seekers outnumbering job openings six to one. Nor does Mr. Bernanke expect any quick improvement: last month, while predicting that unemployment will fall, he conceded that the rate of decline will be \xe2\x80\x9cslower than we would like.\xe2\x80\x9d So what does he propose doing to create jobs?'b'Nothing. Mr. Bernanke has offered no hint that he feels the need to adopt policies that might bring unemployment down faster. Instead, he has responded to suggestions for further Fed action with boilerplate about \xe2\x80\x9cthe anchoring of inflation expectations.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s harsh but true to say that he\xe2\x80\x99s acting as if it\xe2\x80\x99s Mission Accomplished now that the big banks have been rescued.'b'What happened here? My sense is that Mr. Bernanke, like so many people who work closely with the financial sector, has ended up seeing the world through bankers\xe2\x80\x99 eyes. The same can be said about Timothy Geithner, the Treasury secretary, and Larry Summers, the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s top economist. But they\xe2\x80\x99re not up before the Senate, while Mr. Bernanke is.'b'Given that, why not reject Mr. Bernanke? There are other people with the intellectual heft and policy savvy to take on his role: among the possible choices would be my Princeton colleague Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman, and Janet Yellen, the president of the San Francisco Fed.'b'But  \xe2\x80\x94  and here comes my defense of a Bernanke reappointment \xe2\x80\x94 any good alternative for the position would face a bruising fight in the Senate. And choosing a bad alternative would have truly dire consequences for the economy.'b'Furthermore, policy decisions at the Fed are made by committee vote. And while Mr. Bernanke seems insufficiently concerned about unemployment and too concerned about inflation, many of his colleagues are worse. Replacing him with someone less established, with less ability to sway the internal discussion, could end up strengthening the hands of the inflation hawks and doing even more damage to job creation.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s not a ringing endorsement, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the best I can do.'b'If Mr. Bernanke is reappointed, he and his colleagues need to realize that what they consider a policy success is actually a policy failure. We have avoided a second Great Depression, but we are facing mass unemployment \xe2\x80\x94 unemployment that will blight the lives of millions of Americans \xe2\x80\x94 for years to come. And it\xe2\x80\x99s the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to do all it can to end that blight.'b'Wanted: a smart, honest, tough-minded administrator to head up the Transportation Security Administration \xe2\x80\x94 before the country faces another terrorist threat.'b'Erroll Southers, the White House\xe2\x80\x99s nominee for the job, threw in the towel last  week, after failing to tell Congress the truth about a worrying incident in his past. He was right to withdraw. But the post has now stood vacant for a year. And the White House and Congress, which are also culpable in the delay, need to agree quickly on a strong leader and get him or her into place.'b'The administration was at fault for waiting until September to nominate Mr. Southers, a respected, apolitical police and homeland security professional. And Senator Jim DeMint was egregiously at fault in blocking the nominee\xe2\x80\x99s progress with a partisan, red-herring warning that the Obama administration was intent on unionizing airport security workers.'b'Mr. Southers did not help his or the country\xe2\x80\x99s cause when he misled a Senate hearing about an incident 20 years ago: he was censured for accessing a police database without authorization to check on his estranged wife\xe2\x80\x99s  companion. Initially, he testified that he asked a colleague to check. When this was challenged, he confirmed he had twice gone into the database himself.'b'While the Senate committee members accepted his explanation that this was an inadvertent memory lapse and approved the nomination, other Republicans did not. Administration officials said the discrepancies weren\xe2\x80\x99t known until they were reported in The Washington Post in November.'b'Mr. Southers\xe2\x80\x99s story is another costly example of the need for rigorous vetting of nominees and a reminder that people who aspire to public trust must tell the truth to be worthy of that trust. \xe2\x80\x9cRigorous\xe2\x80\x9d cannot be an excuse for bureaucratic foot-dragging or self-serving politicking. The country needs a strong T.S.A. chief now.'b'In calling for new limits on the size and activities of big banks, President Obama has given the effort to enact serious financial regulatory reform something it lacked: a rational starting point.'b'The premise of the White House\xe2\x80\x99s earlier approach to reform was that behemoth multitasking banks were an immutable fact of life and the best way to cope with them was to ensure that their failures would not endanger the rest of the financial system. As a response to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, \xe2\x80\x9cmake the world safe for giant banks\xe2\x80\x9d was unsatisfactory.'b'It ignored history, and suggested a devotion to the status quo that made real reform seem unlikely. It also ignored that large and complex banks are a problem long before they fail: an overgrown banking sector diverts resources from more productive uses and, in the process, amasses riches at the expense of everyone else. The entire country can see the evidence of that in stagnating wages, disappearing retirement savings, vanishing home equity and taxpayer-supported bonuses.'b'Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s new proposals begin to correct those problems. They would ban banks with federally insured deposits from making risky bets in the capital markets. And they would  prevent the banks from owning, investing or sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds. Mr. Obama has also called for new caps on the size of banks, to limit the damage that a failure could inflict and to promote healthy competition.'b'Affected banks would include giants like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citibank.  Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley would also fall under the new rules because they were  converted to bank holding companies during the crisis  so they could qualify for help from the Federal Reserve. But if regulators allow them to drop their bank charters, they would escape the new rules.'b'The new proposals have yet to go through Congress, so it is not yet clear  exactly how much they  would restrict or shrink today\xe2\x80\x99s banks. But it is clear that they  could separate the casino of Wall Street from the banking system on which everyone relies.'b'That, in turn, would reassert the principle \xe2\x80\x94 lost through the bailouts \xe2\x80\x94 that the government does not support or stand behind Wall Street-style trading. The proposals  would also enshrine in law the principle that the nation does not want and will counter outsized banks with huge concentrations of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s financial assets. At the very least, a cap on size could stop a dismaying trend of big banks getting ever bigger and more powerful.'b'Of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough to be right on principle. But with core and credible principles reasserted and reflected in law, the other pillars of financial regulatory reform take on a coherence that has been missing.'b'There are several ways to pursue the bedrock principles of controlling size and risk, including higher capital requirements, the regulation of derivatives and the creation of an independent consumer financial protection agency. It is also imperative to develop a  resolution authority that would force shareholders, creditors and the financial industry to bear the cost of failures, while precluding the government from rushing forward with bailouts.'b'Now that Mr. Obama has set the stage and committed to leading the effort, those and other crucial reforms may yet happen.'b'Killing Taliban fighters won\xe2\x80\x99t be enough. If there is any hope of defeating the insurgency, Afghanistan\xe2\x80\x99s government will have to persuade a large number of militants to put down their weapons.'b'At an international conference in London on Afghanistan this week, President Hamid Karzai is expected to unveil a plan to try to bring low and midlevel Taliban fighters in from the cold. Any plan will need strong financial backing. The cost is expected to be about $1 billion to provide jobs, security and other benefits for  the Taliban defectors. Allies that refuse to send more troops to Afghanistan should pledge more cash.'b'Money alone won\xe2\x80\x99t be enough. The government must persuade defectors that they will be protected and given a political voice. The initiative will surely collapse if the first Taliban who lay down their guns are assassinated by former comrades or current neighbors.'b'The plan will also need a clear set of principles. Rehabilitation should be on offer only  to Taliban members \xe2\x80\x94 mainly foot soldiers \xe2\x80\x94 who joined up because they needed jobs or were bullied into it. True believers will have to prove that they have renounced not only violence but also the Taliban\xe2\x80\x99s brutality and medieval values. The government must make clear that it is not going to cede an inch, especially when it comes to education for women and girls.'b'We find it worrying that Mr. Karzai and his aides have been talking about reconciling with the Taliban leader Mullah Omar and removing his name from the United Nations\xe2\x80\x99 terrorist blacklist. (He has shown no interest in reconciliation.) Ruthless leaders like Mullah Omar, who gave sanctuary to Al Qaeda before 9/11, deserve to be brought to justice, not given a free pass or a seat at the table.'b'Mr. Karzai has made it far too easy for the Taliban. His government\xe2\x80\x99s corruption and incompetence have driven thousands of Afghans into the arms of the insurgency. To prevent thousands more from joining, Mr. Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s  government will have to quickly improve its performance.'b'Many fighters are unlikely to even think about switching sides until they see the military balance shifting. That is supposed to start happening this spring or summer when the bulk of the 30,000 additional American troops are on the ground. President Karzai, the United States and other partners must have a comprehensive reconciliation plan before then. They also need to be crystal clear about what\xe2\x80\x99s on offer \xe2\x80\x94 and what\xe2\x80\x99s not.'b'As huge corporations merge and get even huger, we find ourselves yearning for some old-fashioned competition, and maybe a little diversity.'b'Banks have gotten so big that they can unleash havoc and bill us for the pleasure. Big Oil is so big that Royal Dutch Shell is the world\xe2\x80\x99s 25th-biggest economy, bigger than Norway. Four -fifths of the chips in the world\xe2\x80\x99s PCs come from Intel. In the United States, AT&amp;T and Verizon account for over half of all cellular phone customers. Big companies are likely to become even bigger. Between 2003 and 2007, the number of big mergers reported to American antitrust regulators doubled to 2,201. Though merger activity fell during the financial crisis, it is expected to rebound sharply.

But the answer is not simply to walk away from manufacturing. To avoid a \xe2\x80\x9cjobless recovery,\xe2\x80\x9d the administration needs to enforce United States trade laws and prevent China\xe2\x80\x99s mercantilist policies from dismantling another American industry.'b'Scott N.

It was a way of gaining confidence with a gun, of venting your rage on another living creature. Now it seems human beings are used for target practice.'b'This month, rioting by African immigrants broke out in Rosarno, in southern Italy, after at least one immigrant was shot with an air rifle. The riots were widely portrayed as clashes between immigrants and native Italians, but they were really a revolt against the \xe2\x80\x99Ndrangheta, the powerful Calabrian mafia. Anyone who seeks to negate or to minimize this motive is not familiar with these places where everything \xe2\x80\x94 jobs, wages, housing \xe2\x80\x94 is controlled by criminal organizations.'b'The episode in Rosarno was the second such uprising against organized crime in Italy in the last few years. The first took place in 2008 in Castel Volturno, a town near Naples, where hit men from the local mob, the Camorra, killed six Africans. The massacre was intended to intimidate, but it set off the immigrants\xe2\x80\x99 anger instead.'b'In Castel Volturno, the immigrants work in construction. In Rosarno, they pick oranges. But in both places the mafias control all economic activity. And the only ones who\xe2\x80\x99ve had the courage to rebel against them are the Africans.'b'An immigrant who lands in France or Britain knows he\xe2\x80\x99ll have to abide by the law, but he also knows he\xe2\x80\x99ll have real and tangible rights. That\xe2\x80\x99s not how it is in Italy, where bureaucracy and corruption make it seem as if the only guarantees are prohibitions and mafia rule, under which rights are nonexistent. The mafias let the African immigrants live and work in their territories because they make a profit off them. The mafias exploit them, but also grant them living space in abandoned areas outside of town, and they keep the police from running too many checks or repatriating them.'b'The immigrants are temporarily willing to accept peanut wages, slave hours and poor living conditions. They\xe2\x80\x99ve already handed over all they owned, risked all they had, just to get to Italy. But they came to make a better life for themselves \xe2\x80\x94 and they\xe2\x80\x99re not about to let anyone take the possibility of that life away.'b'There are native Italians who reject mafia rule as well, but they have the means and the freedom to leave places like Rosarno, becoming migrants themselves. The Africans can\xe2\x80\x99t. They have to stand up to the clans. They know they have to act collectively, for it\xe2\x80\x99s their only way of protecting themselves. Otherwise they end up getting killed, which happens sometimes even to the European immigrant workers.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake to view the Rosarno rioters as criminals. The Rosarno riots were not about attacking the law, but about gaining access to the law.'b'There are African criminals of course, African mafiosi, who do business with the Italian mafias. An increasing amount of the cocaine that arrives here from South America comes via West Africa. African criminal organizations are amassing enormous power, but the poor African workers in Italy are not their men.'b'The Italian state should condemn the violence of the riots, but if it treats the immigrants as criminals, it will drive them to the mafias. After the Rosarno riots, the government moved more than a thousand immigrants to detention centers, allegedly for their own safety, and destroyed the rudimentary camp where many of them had lived.  This is the kind of reaction that will encourage those immigrants to see the African criminal organizations as necessary protection.'b'For now, the majority resist; they came to Italy to better themselves, not to be mobsters. But if the Africans in Rosarno had been organized at a criminal level, they would have had a way to negotiate with the Calabrian Mafia. They would have been able to obtain better working and living conditions. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had to riot.'b'Italy is a country that\xe2\x80\x99s forgotten how its emigrants were treated in the United States, how the discrimination they suffered was precisely what allowed the Mafia to take root there. It was extremely difficult for many Italian immigrants, who did not feel protected or represented by anyone else, to avoid the clutches of the mob. It\xe2\x80\x99s enough to remember Joe Petrosino, the Italian-born New York City police officer who was murdered in 1909 for taking on the Mafia,  to recognize the price honest Italians paid.'b'Immigrants come to Italy to do jobs Italians don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do, but they have also begun defending the rights that Italians are too afraid, indifferent or jaded to defend. To those African immigrants I say: don\xe2\x80\x99t go \xe2\x80\x94 don\xe2\x80\x99t leave us alone with the mafias.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ve been here before.'b'Not with this much melodrama, maybe. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t take a rakish Senate candidate in a pick-up truck to stop George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s push for Social Security reform in 2005. MSNBC wasn\xe2\x80\x99t around in 1994, so we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to watch Keith Olbermann\xe2\x80\x99s head explode on live TV during the defeat of Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s health care plan.'b'But the pattern is the same. Since Ronald Reagan tried and failed to purge Washington of wasteful spending, nearly every major attempt at reforming the way our government does business has found itself where the Democratic health care bill is now \xe2\x80\x94 losing altitude, shedding supporters and tailspinning toward defeat.'b'If the legislation fails, liberals will have a long list of scapegoats. They can blame Max Baucus\xe2\x80\x99s delays, Joe Lieberman\xe2\x80\x99s demands and Olympia Snowe\xe2\x80\x99s dithering. They can blame the filibuster, Fox News and Sarah Palin. They can blame Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s lack of passion, Harry Reid\xe2\x80\x99s lack of finesse and House Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 lack of guts.'b'But they might want to save some blame for the welfare state their predecessors built.'b'Under Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson, liberals created a federal leviathan that taxes, regulates and redistributes across every walk of American life. In the process, though, they bound the hands of future generations of reformers. Programs became entrenched. Bureaucracies proliferated. Subsidies became \xe2\x80\x9centitlements,\xe2\x80\x9d tax breaks became part of the informal social contract. And our government was transformed, slowly but irreversibly, into a \xe2\x80\x9clarge, incoherent, often incomprehensible mass that is solicitous of its clients but impervious to any broad, coherent program of reform.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s a quote from Jonathan Rauch\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Government\xe2\x80\x99s End: Why Washington Stopped Working'b',\xe2\x80\x9d a book that should be required reading for Democrats as they contemplate their predicament this week. First published amid the collapse of Clintoncare, and then reissued after the failure of the Gingrich Revolution, Rauch\xe2\x80\x99s analysis makes mincemeat of the popular theory that sinister \xe2\x80\x9cspecial interests\xe2\x80\x9d are to blame for derailing reforms the common man wholeheartedly supports.'b'Instead, he suggests that sweeping reforms are difficult because we\xe2\x80\x99re all special interests, in one sense or another. We all benefit from something (or many things) the government does, and so we all have an incentive to resist dramatic changes to the way Washington spends money.'b'Consider how the health care debate has played out. When people think of health-related \xe2\x80\x9cspecial interests,\xe2\x80\x9d they think of drug manufacturers and insurance companies \xe2\x80\x94 and sure enough, buying off Pfizer and appeasing Aetna were among the Obama White House\xe2\x80\x99s first priorities.'b'But that\xe2\x80\x99s just the beginning of the story. Once you\xe2\x80\x99ve enticed Big Pharma and Big Insurance inside the tent, you still have to contend with everyone else who might stand to lose from health care reform.'b'This means seniors who get Medicare and hospitals that accept it. It means patients and doctors in states that spend \xe2\x80\x9ctoo much\xe2\x80\x9d on health care, according to the Office of Management and Budget, and who would bear the brunt of cost controls. It means upper-income taxpayers who object to being singled out for tax increases. It means union members who like the current health-insurance tax deduction exactly as it is. And judging by last week\xe2\x80\x99s election, it means the citizens of Massachusetts, who already pay for semi-universal health care and don\xe2\x80\x99t see why they should subsidize Mississippi and Montana as well.'b'Chances are that you belong to at least one of these \xe2\x80\x9cspecial\xe2\x80\x9d interest groups. And so whatever your political views, chances are that your concerns have played a role in delaying the health care bill, warping it, and possibly killing it off altogether.'b'None of this means that government cannot be reformed. Rauch\xe2\x80\x99s book does not counsel despair. Rather, it counsels modesty, simplicity and incrementalism in legislative efforts. You can make big changes to small programs, and small changes to big ones. But comprehensive solutions tend to produce comprehensive resistance. And the more sweeping the stakes, the greater the chance of political disaster \xe2\x80\x94 whether your name is Clinton or Gingrich, Bush or Obama  \xe2\x80\x94  when your bill goes down to defeat.'b'The lesson for Democrats should be obvious. They wanted, admirably, to help the low-income uninsured, and Americans with pre-existing conditions. And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what they should have done \xe2\x80\x94 with tax credits or vouchers or a Medicaid expansion for the poor, and better-funded risk pools for the sick.'b'Such a bill would have had many fewer beneficiaries \xe2\x80\x94 but far fewer enemies as well. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have transformed the system, controlled costs for the long term, or guaranteed universal care. But permanent solutions are probably beyond what any single piece of legislation can accomplish.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am not the first president to take up this cause,\xe2\x80\x9d Barack Obama said of health care reform last September, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am determined to be the last.\xe2\x80\x9d In hindsight, that looks like his mistake.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Between God and a Hard Place'b',\xe2\x80\x9d by James Wood (Op-Ed, Jan. 24):'b'Instead of admitting that we do not know how to reconcile a loving God with terrible disasters like Haiti and Indonesia, some theologians come up with cruel solutions that contradict the whole Christian enterprise (God wills it for our good, God punishes us for our good, we are to blame because of our sins, and so on).'b'We do not know the answer to this conundrum except to say that is the nature of freedom in an imperfect world and that is the mystery of the providence of God.

Their goal was to eliminate birth defects, but increasing the number of biological parents beyond two could add a futuristic twist to an area where the law already is a mess: the question of who, in this age of artificial insemination and surrogacy, should be considered the legal parents of a baby.'b'Researchers at the Oregon National Primate Research Center were looking for ways to eliminate diseases that can be inherited through maternal DNA. They developed, as the magazine Nature reported last summer, a kind of swap in which defective DNA from the egg is removed and replaced with genetic material from another female\xe2\x80\x99s egg. The researchers say the procedure is also likely to work on humans.'b'The result would be a baby with three biological parents \xe2\x80\x94 or \xe2\x80\x9cfractional parents,\xe2\x80\x9d as Adam Kolber, a professor at the University of San Diego School of Law, calls them.'b'He mentioned the idea over lunch at The Times, and it provided plenty of grist for debate among law junkies: Could a baby one day have 100 parents? Could anyone who contributes DNA claim visitation rights? How much DNA is enough? Can a child born outside the United States to foreigners who have DNA from an American citizen claim U.S. citizenship?'b'One reason these questions are so difficult to resolve definitively is that, even in simpler cases, the law of parenthood is badly muddled. That has been true since the 1980s saga of Baby M.'b'Mary Beth Whitehead had agreed to a payment of $10,000 to bear a child for William and Elizabeth Stern.

Some states have laws expressly permitting surrogate parenthood; others make it illegal; and others have no law at all.'b'The problem, as Janet Dolgin, a Hofstra Law School professor, wrote in the Akron Law Review, is that legal thinking is deeply divided over how to judge what makes a family.'b'Since the 1960s, there has been a shift toward recognizing people\xe2\x80\x99s intent in creating familial relationships, as reflected in the rise of no-fault divorce, prenuptial agreements and civil unions. But when it comes to deciding parenthood, courts remain deeply influenced by biology, even when it clashes with intent.'b'This concern is playing out now in A.G.R. v. D.R.H. &amp; S.H., the biggest surrogacy case in New Jersey since Baby M\xe2\x80\x99s. A woman served as a surrogate for her brother and his male spouse, giving birth to twins conceived with the spouse\xe2\x80\x99s sperm and donor eggs.

Moreover, questions were raised about Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s candor when he spoke about health care. In his acceptance speech, for example, candidate Obama took a verbal shot at John McCain, sharply criticizing him for offering \xe2\x80\x9ca health care plan that would actually tax people\xe2\x80\x99s benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Now Mr. Obama favors a plan that would tax at least some people\xe2\x80\x99s benefits. Mr. Obama also repeatedly said that policyholders who were pleased with their plans and happy with their doctors would be able to keep both under his reform proposals.'b'Well, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily so, as the president eventually acknowledged. There would undoubtedly be changes in some people\xe2\x80\x99s coverage as a result of \xe2\x80\x9creform,\xe2\x80\x9d and some of those changes would be substantial. At a forum sponsored by ABC News last summer, Mr. Obama backed off of his frequent promise that no changes would occur, saying only that \xe2\x80\x9cif you are happy with your plan, and if you are happy with your doctor, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to have to change.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'These less-than-candid instances are emblematic of much bigger problems. Mr. Obama promised during the campaign that he would be a different kind of president, one who would preside over a more open, more high-minded administration that would be far more in touch with the economic needs of ordinary working Americans. But no sooner was he elected than he put together an economic team that would protect, above all, the interests of Wall Street, the pharmaceutical industry, the health insurance companies, and so on.'b'How can you look out for the interests of working people with Tim Geithner whispering in one ear and Larry Summers in the other?'b'Now with his poll numbers down and the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 filibuster-proof margin in the Senate about to vanish, Mr. Obama is trying again to position himself as a champion of the middle class. Suddenly, with the public appalled at the scandalous way the health care legislation was put together, and with Democrats facing a possible debacle in the fall, Mr. Obama is back in campaign mode. Every other utterance is about \xe2\x80\x9cfighting\xe2\x80\x9d for the middle class, \xe2\x80\x9cfighting\xe2\x80\x9d for jobs, \xe2\x80\x9cfighting\xe2\x80\x9d against the big bad banks.'b'The president who has been aloof and remote and a pushover for the health insurance and pharmaceutical industries, who has been locked in the troubling embrace of the Geithners and Summers and Ben Bernankes of the world, all of a sudden is a man of the people. But even as he is promising to fight for jobs, a very expensive proposition, he\xe2\x80\x99s proposing a spending freeze that can only hurt job-creating efforts.'b'Mr. Obama will deliver his State of the Union address Wednesday night. The word is that he will offer some small bore assistance to the middle class. But more important than the content of this speech will be whether the president really means what he says. Americans want to know what he stands for, where his line in the sand is, what he\xe2\x80\x99ll really fight for, and where he wants to lead this nation.'b'They want to know who their president really is.'b'Politics, some believe, is the organization of hatreds. The people who try to divide society on the basis of ethnicity we call racists. The people who try to divide it on the basis of religion we call sectarians. The people who try to divide it on the basis of social class we call either populists or elitists.'b'These two attitudes \xe2\x80\x94 populism and elitism \xe2\x80\x94 seem different, but they\xe2\x80\x99re really mirror images of one another. They both assume a country fundamentally divided. They both describe politics as a class struggle between the enlightened and the corrupt, the pure and the betrayers.'b'Both attitudes will always be with us, but these days populism is in vogue. The Republicans have their populists. Sarah Palin has been known to divide the country between the real Americans and the cultural elites. And the Democrats have their populists. Since the defeat in Massachusetts, many Democrats have apparently decided that their party has to mimic the rhetoric of John Edwards\xe2\x80\x99s presidential campaign. They\xe2\x80\x99ve taken to dividing the country into two supposedly separate groups \xe2\x80\x94 real Americans who live on Main Street and the insidious interests of Wall Street.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to see why politicians would be drawn to the populist pose. First, it makes everything so simple. The economic crisis was caused by a complex web of factors, including global imbalances caused by the rise of China. But with the populist narrative, you can just blame Goldman Sachs.'b'Second, it absolves voters of responsibility for their problems. Over the past few years, many investment bankers behaved like idiots, but so did average Americans, racking up unprecedented levels of personal debt. With the populist narrative, you can accuse the former and absolve the latter.'b'Third, populism is popular with the ruling class. Ever since I started covering politics, the Democratic ruling class has been driven by one fantasy: that voters will get so furious at people with M.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s that they will hand power to people with Ph.D.\xe2\x80\x99s. The Republican ruling class has been driven by the fantasy that voters will get so furious at people with Ph.D.\xe2\x80\x99s that they will hand power to people with M.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s. Members of the ruling class love populism because they think it will help their section of the elite gain power.'b'So it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to see the seductiveness of populism. Nonetheless, it nearly always fails. The history of populism, going back to William Jennings Bryan, is generally a history of defeat.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s because voters aren\xe2\x80\x99t as stupid as the populists imagine. Voters are capable of holding two ideas in their heads at one time: First, that the rich and the powerful do rig the game in their own favor; and second, that simply bashing the rich and the powerful will still not solve the country\xe2\x80\x99s problems.'b'Political populists never get that second point. They can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to grasp that a politics based on punishing the elites won\xe2\x80\x99t produce a better-educated work force, more investment, more innovation or any of the other things required for progress and growth.'b'In fact, this country was built by anti-populists. It was built by people like Alexander Hamilton and Abraham Lincoln who rejected the idea that the national economy is fundamentally divided along class lines. They rejected the zero-sum mentality that is at the heart of populism, the belief that economics is a struggle over finite spoils. Instead, they believed in a united national economy \xe2\x80\x94 one interlocking system of labor, trade and investment.'b'Hamilton championed capital markets and Lincoln championed banks, not because they loved traders and bankers. They did it because they knew a vibrant capitalist economy would maximize opportunity for poor boys like themselves. They were willing to tolerate the excesses of traders because they understood that no institution is more likely to channel opportunity to new groups and new people than vigorous financial markets.'b'In their view, government\xe2\x80\x99s role was not to side with one faction or to wage class war. It was to rouse the energy and industry of people at all levels. It was to enhance competition and make it fair \xe2\x80\x94 to make sure that no group, high or low, is able to erect barriers that would deprive Americans of an open field and a fair chance. Theirs was a philosophy that celebrated development, mobility and work, wherever those things might be generated.'b'The populists have an Us versus Them mentality. If they continue their random attacks on enterprise and capital, they will only increase the pervasive feeling of uncertainty, which is now the single biggest factor in holding back investment, job creation and growth. They will end up discrediting good policies (the Obama bank reforms are quite sensible) because they will persuade the country that the government is in the hands of reckless Huey Longs.'b'They will have traded dynamic optimism, which always wins, for combative divisiveness, which always loses.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Jamaica High May Close, but Memories Will Live On'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (news article, Jan. 24):'b'I, too, benefited from a fine education at Jamaica High School. I, too, mourn its imminent demise as New York City prepares to close it along with other ailing public schools. But let us temper our nostalgia with a reality check.'b'Jamaica High in its heyday thrived in a different city. It was a zoned neighborhood school, its boundaries surely deliberately drawn to include middle-class and wealthy white neighborhoods and exclude poor black neighborhoods nearby. I went through my yearbook the other day and saw that out of 1,050 students in my 1963 graduating class, 40 were African-American \xe2\x80\x94 less than 4 percent. Our class had a smattering of Asian students \xe2\x80\x94 I counted seven \xe2\x80\x94 and even fewer students with apparently Latino names.'b'New York\xe2\x80\x99s neighborhoods were even more segregated then than they are today, and the public schools reflected that. But the segregation at Jamaica went even further. The stronger academic students studied together in honors classes, more solidly white (and Jewish because Jamaica\xe2\x80\x99s zoned catchment area was overwhelmingly Jewish) than the school at large.'b'We honors students attended the equivalent of a private school within a restricted school, taught by the best, most dedicated teachers on the faculty. Our principal, a demanding, old-line disciplinarian, saw to that, focusing on the strong academic students \xe2\x80\x94 encouraging them to apply to the Ivy League and to compete in national science contests \xe2\x80\x94 and ignoring the rest.'b'Small wonder that the neighborhood\xe2\x80\x99s most affluent parents sent their children to Jamaica High instead of private schools.'b'Jamaica High was once a great place \xe2\x80\x94 for some. We can remember it fondly, but see it for what it was \xe2\x80\x94 an educational artifact of an era long gone.'b'Joyce Purnick'b'\n  New York, Jan. 25, 2010'b''b''b'The writer, a former columnist and editor at The New York Times, is the author of \xe2\x80\x9cMike Bloomberg: Money, Power, Politics.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b''b'To the Editor:'b'In \xe2\x80\x9c'b'A Leaner Budget for Lean Times'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 20), you call mixed martial arts, which Gov. David A. Paterson is proposing to legalize, \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversial.\xe2\x80\x9d In fact, the sport is not only legal in all but eight states, but if it should come to New York, our State Athletic Commission already has the mechanisms in place to ensure that such competitions follow the highest guidelines of health and safety.'b'Across the country, mixed martial arts matches do not represent something out of \xe2\x80\x9cFight Club\xe2\x80\x9d; rather, they are akin to boxing in how closely they are watched by highly trained medical staff and referees. Just like boxers, mixed martial arts competitors receive comprehensive neurological and physical examinations before fighting. They are drug-tested and are placed in strict weight classes, and all matches must be approved by a regulating body to reduce the likelihood of a mismatch resulting in serious injury.'b'In New York, a medical advisory board would be established and charged with developing educational programs for medical staff and officials, so that health risks may be readily identified, minimized and prevented.'b'In terms of revenue for the state, a recent study found that one event in the New York City area, for example, would generate $5.3 million in event spending and a total of $11.3 million in total economic activity for the local economy.'b'Governor Paterson understands that this is a sport that when properly regulated will provide the citizens of New York with both financial and entertainment value while maintaining high standards regarding the safety and health of participants.'b'Lorraine Cortes-Vazquez'b'\n  Secretary of State'b'\n  Albany, Jan. 20, 2010'b''b''b'It would be a terrible mistake for Democrats to abandon comprehensive health care reform just because voters in the Massachusetts Senate race last week decided that they liked the Republican, Scott Brown, more than the Democrat, Martha Coakley.'b'There is no question that without a filibuster-proof majority it will be a lot harder to pass a bill. But it should not be impossible if Congressional Democrats and the White House show courage and creativity. Health care reform is too important to throw away, and it is not too late to persuade voters that it is in their interest.'b'Congress is achingly close to passing legislation that would cover most uninsured Americans and provide much more security for all Americans \xe2\x80\x94 guaranteeing that if they lose their jobs they will be able to buy affordable policies and can\xe2\x80\x99t be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions.'b'If the Democrats quit now, so close to the goal line, the opportunity for large-scale reform could be lost for years. Meanwhile, the number of uninsured, currently more than 46 million, will keep going up and the cost of health care will continue to soar.'b'Many panicky Democrats see Mr. Brown\xe2\x80\x99s win as proof that angry voters will punish them in November if they press ahead with reform. We believe that is a misreading of what happened and what\xe2\x80\x99s possible.'b'Ms. Coakley ran an inept campaign. And the White House hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done enough to address voters\xe2\x80\x99 profound and legitimate fears about losing their jobs and their homes. But President Obama and Congressional Democrats have also clearly failed to explain why reform will make Americans\xe2\x80\x99 lives more secure \xe2\x80\x94 not less.'b'What makes this all the more frustrating is that Massachusetts, which adopted its own very similar health care reform in 2006, is a compelling example of both the benefits and popularity of the effort.'b'A 'b'poll taken in Massachusetts'b' after the election by The Washington Post, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and the Harvard School of Public Health found that a surprising 68 percent of those who had voted said that they supported their own state\xe2\x80\x99s plan, including slightly more than half of those who had voted for Mr. Brown.'b'Mr. Brown, who promised to block reform in Washington, voted for his state\xe2\x80\x99s program in 2006 and did not campaign against it this year. Instead, he argued that since Massachusetts\xe2\x80\x99 citizens already have coverage, why should they help pay to expand coverage elsewhere.'b'That cynical I\xe2\x80\x99ve-got-mine argument doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make a lot of sense \xe2\x80\x94  even in Massachusetts. The Senate bill would funnel additional money into the Massachusetts program and federal efforts to rein in costs should ultimately benefit all of the states.'b'Democrats should take another look at what really happened in Massachusetts and then summon the nerve to enact comprehensive reform. They must make clear to voters that they have little to fear. Even the mandate requiring everyone to buy insurance doesn\xe2\x80\x99t kick in until 2014. And they must make clear that reform offers immediate gains, especially for middle-class Americans.'b'Once the bill becomes law, many dependent children could remain on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 policies until age 26. Insurers would no longer be able to set lifetime caps on the amount they will pay for health care. Children could not be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions. The gap in drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries, known as the doughnut hole, would begin to close. And small businesses would immediately get tax credits to cover their employees.'b'Recent polls show that the public is divided, with more opposing the bills than favoring them. The negatives have been driven up by critics\xe2\x80\x99 distortions about a supposed government takeover of medicine and the tawdry deal-making necessary to win 60 votes to overcome a Republican filibuster in the Senate.'b'Still, 'b'a recent national poll'b' by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation found that large shares of people became more supportive when told about such provisions as tax credits for small businesses that offer coverage, exchanges where people could choose among competing policies, and rules against denying coverage.'b'We are hearing a lot of talk in Washington, including from President Obama, about possibly paring down the current bills \xe2\x80\x94 to cover many fewer of the uninsured and focus instead on reeling in the worst abuses of the insurance industry and reining in health care costs. That could be difficult technically; many of the parts are not easy to disentangle without undermining their effectiveness. And the politics on Capitol Hill \xe2\x80\x94 where the Republicans are determined to oppose pretty much anything President Obama endorses \xe2\x80\x94 are unlikely to get easier.'b'The most promising path forward would be for House Democrats to pass the Senate bill as is and send it to the president for his signature. That would allow the administration and Congress to pivot immediately to job creation and other economic issues. The Senate bill is not perfect, but it would expand coverage to 94 percent of all citizens and legal residents by 2019, reduce the deficit for decades to come, and create pilot programs to move the medical system toward better care at lower costs.'b'Rank-and-file House Democrats apparently won\xe2\x80\x99t accept the Senate bill without modification. So Congressional leaders are looking for ways to commit both the House and the Senate to changes  \xe2\x80\x94 such as better subsidies to make insurance more affordable \xe2\x80\x94 that could be approved through parallel \xe2\x80\x9cbudget reconciliation\xe2\x80\x9d legislation that could be approved by a simple majority in both the Senate and House.'b'This is a once-in-a-generation chance. President Obama must explain to the American people why reform is essential to their health and security and this nation\xe2\x80\x99s future. And he must insist that Congress finish the job.'b'\xc2\x95'b''b'This editorial is a part of a comprehensive examination of the debate over health care reform. You can read all of these articles at: 'b'nytimes.com/editorials'b'.'b''b'Because of a disagreement over charter schools, legislative leaders in Albany are in danger \xe2\x80\x94 once again \xe2\x80\x94 of letting hundreds of millions of federal dollars slip through their fingers.'b'Washington is making $4 billion in education funds available under a program called Race to the Top. The money is aimed at encouraging states to improve or close failing schools, keep the most-qualified teachers and expand well-run charter schools. New York\xe2\x80\x99s share could be as much as $700 million.  The deadline for state applications was last Tuesday,  and most states jumped at the opportunity. New York submitted its application, but it lacked a crucial ingredient: a plan that would allow for more charter schools.'b'A bill favored by legislative leaders would have doubled the number of charter schools allowed in the state to 400. But the bill was flawed and faced an almost certain veto from Gov. David Paterson. The big problem was that it would have undercut the schools\xe2\x80\x99 independence by transferring the power to create charter schools from local authorities to the Board of Regents, which is appointed by the Legislature.'b'This shift particularly offended Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He called the bill a \xe2\x80\x9cwolf in sheep\xe2\x80\x99s clothing.\xe2\x80\x9d It would definitely have been a step backward from a system that has mostly worked well, especially in New York City. Charter schools are not without flaws. Their finances should be more transparent. And public-school parents often resent sharing much-needed space with charter schools. But none of these criticisms are a reason for Albany to undercut the whole system or give up on federal funds, especially during a state budget crisis.'b'A second round of applications for federal aid is due this summer. By then, the Legislature should be able to organize hearings and come up with a plan for the entire state. Otherwise, New York runs the risk of forfeiting, once again, money it needs badly. In 2008, Albany failed to approve even an experimental version of Mayor Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s congestion pricing plan that would have imposed fees on cars coming into Manhattan during rush hours. That cost the city millions of dollars in federal transportation funds. New York can\xe2\x80\x99t afford a repeat performance.'b'Washington'b'WITH the national unemployment rate at 10 percent, and more than 15 million Americans looking for work,  ideas to spur job creation are at the forefront of everyone\xe2\x80\x99s minds. While we may represent different political philosophies, we recognize that high unemployment \xe2\x80\x94 particularly long-term unemployment \xe2\x80\x94 is not a liberal problem or a conservative problem; it\xe2\x80\x99s a national problem that takes a huge toll on families.'b'The idea for some sort of jobs tax credit is percolating again, but the jobs credit that existed in the late 1970s was of limited success, and it was excruciatingly complicated. Recalling this experience, members of Congress from both parties have been lukewarm to such a credit, and the idea was dropped from the stimulus package last year.'b'We have an idea that is simple, straightforward and easy to explain and administer. In fact, it is so simple that the legislative text of the proposal is only a few pages long \xe2\x80\x94 a rarity when it comes to tax policy.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s the idea: Starting immediately after enactment, any private-sector employer that hires a worker who had been unemployed for at least 60 days will not have to pay its 6.2 percent Social Security payroll tax on that employee for the duration of 2010. The Social Security trust fund will then be made whole with spending cuts elsewhere in the budget between now and 2015. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. Simple to understand, and easy to explain.'b'The beauty of this proposal goes beyond its simplicity. Unlike a jobs tax credit of a specific dollar amount, this credit is \xe2\x80\x9cfront-loaded\xe2\x80\x9d in that it provides an incentive for businesses to hire workers earlier in the year \xe2\x80\x94 because the tax benefit will be greater. A $60,000 worker hired on Feb. 1 will save a business about $3,400 in taxes, while that same worker hired on  May 1 will save it about $2,500.'b'Unlike some versions of a payroll-tax holiday, which provide a much bigger benefit for higher-paid workers, this proposal is not biased toward either low-wage or high-wage workers. Yes, if you pay people more, you save more in taxes \xe2\x80\x94 but the savings as a percentage of pay remains constant. Under this plan, a business saves 6.2 percent on both a $40,000 worker and a $90,000 worker.'b'In the current environment, no business wants to wait until 2011 to receive a tax credit for someone it hires today. Another obvious benefit of this proposal to forgive payroll taxes is that it keeps  money in a business\xe2\x80\x99s pockets, since the tax is simply not collected in the first place.'b'In addition, because the benefit starts on the date of hiring and does not have an arbitrary cap, more businesses will want to use it. And since it is an elimination of the employer\xe2\x80\x99s share of the Social Security  tax for these workers \xe2\x80\x94 rather than a fixed or capped dollar amount \xe2\x80\x94 the complexities of making the incentive work with a firm\xe2\x80\x99s payroll software are greatly reduced because employers will know simply to zero out the tax for these workers.'b'To promote long-term employment as the recovery gains steam, we would also add the following bonus: For any eligible employee kept on payroll for a continuous 52 weeks, the employer would receive an additional $1,000 credit on its 2011 tax return. (This would apply to any worker hired in 2010.)'b'Our two-pronged approach would be a far more efficient use of taxpayer dollars than other proposals  under discussion, all of which could cost many times more with very little guaranteed improvement in unemployment.'b'Imagine that three million unemployed workers were to be hired this year under our plan. If they all worked an average of six months in 2010 at a salary of $50,000, and every single one stayed on payroll for 52 consecutive weeks into 2011, the gross cost of the Social Security tax cut and the additional credit would be only $7.6 billion. And that\xe2\x80\x99s before we consider the offsets from income and payroll taxes paid by these workers.'b'There are some additional rules that would have to be put in place. For example, eligible workers would have to be hired for a minimum of 30 hours per week, and workers who are family members of the employer would not be eligible. The payroll tax reduction would be for private-sector jobs only; new jobs that are created by tax dollars in the first place would not be eligible. And any employer with a lower total payroll in 2010 than it had in 2009 would have to forfeit the benefit \xe2\x80\x94 businesses shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be allowed to shed jobs and still receive a tax benefit.'b'We urge Congress and President Obama to consider this idea to help jumpstart hiring and turn our focus back on jobs.'b'Washington'b'IN just seven years, the Supreme Court has declared most of the fabled McCain-Feingold law unconstitutional. The court has struck down the law\xe2\x80\x99s bans on contributions by minors, on independent spending by political parties and on issue ads within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election, as well as restrictions on \xe2\x80\x9cmillionaire\xe2\x80\x9d candidates. With last week\xe2\x80\x99s ruling in 'b'Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission'b', the court has now declared that corporations and unions may spend money on political advertising that urges the election or defeat of a candidate for public office.'b'The reaction was swift and intense. Conservatives and libertarians praised the ruling\xe2\x80\x99s preservation of the First Amendment and freedom of speech. Liberals and reformers expressed horror. 'b'President Obama predicted'b' a \xe2\x80\x9cstampede of special-interest money in our politics\xe2\x80\x9d  and 'b'declared'b', \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t think of anything more devastating to the public interest.\xe2\x80\x9d (Disclosure: I filed a brief with the Supreme Court in support of Citizens United.)'b'One would think from all this that corporations and unions are now free to buy candidates on the open market. But what, if anything, will be different in our elections?'b'Will corporations and unions be able to give money to candidates or political parties? No. Federal law, which regulates campaigns for president, the Senate and the House, prohibits such contributions. The ban was left untouched by the Supreme Court.'b'Can corporations spend money in cahoots with candidates and political parties? No. The Supreme Court decision addressed only \xe2\x80\x9cindependent expenditures,\xe2\x80\x9d which are, by definition, \xe2\x80\x9cnot coordinated with a candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d Monies spent in collaboration with candidates or parties are treated as contributions \xe2\x80\x94 and are still banned.'b'Perhaps all of this corporate spending will be secret? Wrong again. The Supreme Court upheld the laws that require any corporate or union spender to file reports with the Federal Election Commission within 24 hours of spending the first dime.'b'What about the \xe2\x80\x9cstampede of special-interest money\xe2\x80\x9d? The president\xe2\x80\x99s comment implies there must not have been any corporate or union spending before Citizens United. In fact, in the final days of the Massachusetts special election for senator, corporations and unions spent at least $2.7 million on television and radio advertising.  How do we know? Those reports were filed with the F.E.C. And while this was a good deal of spending, it was not unusual.'b'So what will actually occur as a result of the Citizens United case? The answer is at once mundane and momentous.'b'Since the 1970s, Congress has passed an assortment of laws that banned anyone from spending money on independent ads \xe2\x80\x94 laws that were uniformly declared unconstitutional when they restricted spending by individuals, political action committees and political parties. But in a 1990 decision, 'b'Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce'b', the court upheld a ban on corporate spending to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate.'b'Because of the 1990 ruling, corporations and unions have been limited to so-called issue ads, which usually end with statements like \xe2\x80\x9ccall Candidate Jones and tell her\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 take your choice \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cto stop raising taxes/ support health care reform/ support alternative energy sources.\xe2\x80\x9d Now that Citizens United has overturned Austin, corporations and unions can run independent ads that contain words of express advocacy. So instead of \xe2\x80\x9cCall Candidate Jones and demand that she not  raise taxes,\xe2\x80\x9d it can be: \xe2\x80\x9cVote for Candidate Smith because Candidate Jones wants to raise taxes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There is also no factual basis to predict that there will be a \xe2\x80\x9cstampede\xe2\x80\x9d of additional spending. As the court noted, 26 states and the District of Columbia already permit independent corporate and union campaign spending. There have been no stampedes in those states\xe2\x80\x99 elections. Having a constitutional right is not the same as requiring one to exercise it, and there are many reasons  businesses and unions may not spend much more on politics than  they already do. As such, the effect of Citizens United on the  2010 campaigns is debatable.'b'However, the effect of Citizens United on further legislative meddling with campaign speech is clear. In recent years, Congress interpreted its power to regulate campaigns as a license to limit, restrict, burden and confuse anyone who wished to engage in political campaigns.'b'But the court has reminded us that the First Amendment is not a license to regulate \xe2\x80\x94 it is a limitation on Congress. As the court said in its ruling, \xe2\x80\x9cThe First Amendment does not permit laws that force speakers to retain a campaign finance attorney, conduct demographic marketing research, or seek declaratory rulings before discussing the most salient political issues of our day.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'While this may be disheartening to Washington lawyers and lawmakers, it should be a breath of fresh air to everyone else. The greatest benefit of Citizens United is that it will restrain Congress from flooding us with arcane, burdensome, convoluted campaign laws that discourage political participation.'b'The history of campaign finance reform is the history of incumbent politicians seeking to muzzle speakers, any speakers, particularly those who might publicly criticize them and their legislation. It is a lot easier to legislate against unions, gun owners, \xe2\x80\x9cfat cat\xe2\x80\x9d bankers, health insurance companies and any other industry or \xe2\x80\x9cspecial interest\xe2\x80\x9d group when they can\xe2\x80\x99t talk back.'b''b'Americans tend to think of the State of the Union as our singular event.

The other, intended to signal President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to cut the budget deficit, calls for a three-year spending freeze in many discretionary domestic programs, and for increases no greater than inflation after that. The freeze would apply to lower priority programs in a sliver of the overall budget, while spending on administration priorities \xe2\x80\x94 like education and environment \xe2\x80\x94 would continue to grow.'b'The freeze would have a relatively small effect on spending \xe2\x80\x94 about $10 billion less in 2011 out of about $500 billion in programs. It would be foolish to cut any more deeply when the economy is still so troubled. The real value of the freeze would lie in Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s ability to use it politically \xe2\x80\x94 say by trading this deficit reduction for lawmakers\xe2\x80\x99 votes on a jobs bill this year.'b'The problem with the initiatives is that even if they work as planned, Americans need much more. They need leadership that is more inspired and an agenda that is bigger and more detailed than these ideas. The country desperately needs bold moves, starting with the State of the Union address Wednesday night.'b'The Obama administration has done some important things. Without last year\xe2\x80\x99s stimulus package, the economy would be in a far weaker state. Health care reform would be good for the economy and the budget, if it can be saved.'b'But there\xe2\x80\x99s a crater in the economy where the job market used to be, a hole so deep that it would take at least 10 million new jobs to fill it. There are more than six jobless workers for every job opening, which means prolonged spells of unemployment for many of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s 15.3 million jobless workers.'b'A lack of jobs also means delays in getting hired or lower entry-level wages for millions of high school and college graduates \xe2\x80\x94  long-lasting setbacks. It portends little to no wage gains well into the future for millions of underemployed Americans, and even for the majority who have held on to their jobs as the economy has tanked. It means intractable budget deficits \xe2\x80\x94  because without new jobs, economic performance and tax revenues will remain inadequate.'b'Mr. Obama owes the country an unflinching assessment of the dire job situation and a plan for fixing it that starts with a commitment to lead the effort himself. If he leaves it up to Congress, lawmakers are unlikely to deliver. Even the $154 billion jobs bill passed by the House in December is only a starting point for the repair and recovery work that needs to be done.'b'To create jobs, Mr. Obama must make it clear that he will not abandon the states at this time of budget crises. Bolstered aid to states is unpopular. But it is among the surest ways to preserve and create jobs because the money is pushed through quickly to employees, contractors and beneficiaries. The alternative is recovery-killing spending cuts and tax increases on the state level.'b'Mr. Obama also must champion increased small business lending and direct creation of both skilled and low-skilled jobs. He must embrace ways to pay for initiatives, such as redeploying money from the bank bailout or endorsing a financial-transactions tax on Wall Street.'b'The danger is that the initiatives announced so far this week will move to center stage, eclipsing more difficult and more important needs. It is Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s job to make sure that does not happen.'b'It is easy to see that a woman\xe2\x80\x99s human rights are violated when a government requires her to wrap her body and face in an all-concealing veil, as the Taliban used to do when it ran Afghanistan. It should be just as easy to see the violation when a French parliamentary panel recommends, 'b'as it did this week'b', barring women who wear such veils \xe2\x80\x94  the burqa and the niqab \xe2\x80\x94  from using public services, including schools, hospitals and public transportation. (Muslim head scarves have been banned from public school classrooms since 2004.)'b'People must be free to make these decisions for themselves, not have them imposed by governments or enforced by the police.'b'Instead of condemning the recommendation, President Nicolas Sarkozy seems determined to outdo it. He already has declared that full-body veils are \xe2\x80\x9cnot welcome\xe2\x80\x9d in France. His party\xe2\x80\x99s leader in Parliament wants to pass a law that bans women wearing burqas and niqabs from the streets. The Taliban would be pleased. The rest of the world should declare its revulsion.'b'Unfortunately, French politicians seem willfully blind to the violation of individual liberties. With regional elections scheduled for March, Mr. Sarkozy and his allies are desperately looking for ways to deflect public anger over high unemployment. It is hard to produce jobs and far too easy to fan anti-Muslim prejudices.'b'France has more than five million Muslim residents, the most of any Western European country. Fewer than 2,000 are said to wear full-body veils, posing no obvious threat to French identity or security. But because they are so few, they make a temptingly cheap electoral target.'b'Muslim-bashing has been a potent vote-getter for French far-right politicians, most notably Jean-Marie Le Pen. In a clear bid to peel off some of those votes, Mr. Sarkozy\xe2\x80\x99s center-right government has spent months promoting a sometimes foolish, sometimes menacing \xe2\x80\x9cnational debate\xe2\x80\x9d on French identity. No political gain can justify hate-mongering.'b'Radiation treatments have helped save the lives of countless cancer patients, but when medical personnel get sloppy and manufacturers fail to provide technical safeguards the results can be devastating. Two tragic cases at hospitals in New York City illustrate the dangers, and a look at cases elsewhere reinforces the feeling that much more needs to be done to protect patients.'b'The dark side of radiation therapy in an age when the technology is getting more powerful, complex and medically useful was laid bare in two investigative articles in The Times this week by Walt Bogdanich.'b'The first, 'b'published Sunday'b', described the plight of two patients who died in New York City after receiving extremely high doses of radiation from linear accelerators. In the first case, a man being treated for tongue cancer at St. Vincent\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital in Manhattan was subjected to high-energy radiation that was supposed to be directed precisely at the tumor but blasted his brain stem and neck for three days because of a computer problem. Technicians did not notice the warnings on their computer screens.'b'In the second case, a woman being treated for breast cancer at the state\xe2\x80\x99s Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn got three times the prescribed radiation for 27 days because a therapist programmed a computer improperly, a vital filter was not activated and therapists again failed to notice indicators on their screens.'b'Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s article 'b'described cases'b' in several other states where patients were overradiated because medical teams made mistakes or failed to detect errors.'b'Radiation oncologists typically respond that such accidents, while heartrending, occur in only a tiny fraction of the radiation treatments delivered annually. But no one really knows how often radiotherapy accidents occur because there is no central clearinghouse of cases. Accidents are thought to be hugely underreported.'b'Manufacturers need to develop software that will shut down the linear accelerators before they can deliver extreme amounts of radiation. Medical teams that deliver the radiation must be far better trained than many now are. Surely it should be standard procedure to run a test before the first treatment to be sure the computer is programmed correctly. Once the damage is done to a patient, there is little that can be done to correct it.'b'The news that Charles \xe2\x80\x9cMac\xe2\x80\x9d Mathias had died at 87 of Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s disease aroused fond memories of a slightly round and rumpled man who drove a battered blue station wagon to his Senate office and sometimes brought his black Labrador retriever with him.'b'It also brought back memories of a time when legislative combat could be as fierce as it is now but when there seemed to be more room for independent judgment \xe2\x80\x94 or, more accurately, when there were more legislators willing to ignore their party\xe2\x80\x99s disciplinarians and demagogues and act on principle alone. Mr. Mathias, a Republican variously described as moderate or liberal, was just such a person. He represented Maryland for 26 years in Congress, eight in the House and 18 in the Senate, before retiring in 1987.'b'Though he never considered leaving the Republican Party and supported Richard Nixon in 1968 and 1972, he was one of President Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s most nettlesome opponents on legislation and the Vietnam War. He was an early champion of campaign finance reform (never accepting a contribution, after Watergate, of more than $100) and opposed the death penalty.'b'His signature issue was civil rights. It is not much remembered, but when President John F. Kennedy failed to submit a promised civil rights bill, three Republicans introduced one of their own. This inspired Mr. Kennedy to deliver on his promise, and it built Republican support for what became the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The three were Representatives William McCulloch, John Lindsay and Mr. Mathias.'b'The lofty way to describe him would be to say that he voted his conscience. But as he saw it, he was simply voting for things that everyone of conscience ought to support: respect for constitutional rights, respect for the environment, respect for the balance of powers.'b'He once told The Times\xe2\x80\x99s Tom Wicker that the senators he most admired were Democrats J. William Fulbright, Mike Mansfield and Philip Hart, and Republicans John Sherman Cooper, Jacob Javits, George Aiken and Clifford Case.'b'Why these? \xe2\x80\x9cIndividual responsibility,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cEach one of these people would take an issue on his own responsibility. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to have the cover of some ideology.

Our economy is still very fragile, yet you would never know that by the way the political class is acting. We\xe2\x80\x99re like a patient that just got out of intensive care and is sitting up in bed for the first time when, suddenly, all the doctors and nurses at bedside start bickering. One of them throws a stethoscope across the room; someone else threatens to unplug all the monitors unless the hospital bills are paid by noon; and all the while the patient is thinking: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you people crazy? I am just starting to recover. Do you realize how easily I could relapse? Aren\xe2\x80\x99t there any adults here?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Sometimes you wonder: Are we home alone? Obviously, the political and financial elites to whom we give authority often act on the basis of personal interests. But we still have a long way to go to get out of the mess we are in, and if our elites do not behave with a greater sense of the common good we could find our economy doing a double dip with a back flip.'b'Dov Seidman, the C.E.O. of LRN, which helps companies build ethical cultures, likes to talk about two kinds of values: \xe2\x80\x9csituational values\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csustainable values.\xe2\x80\x9d Leaders, companies or individuals guided by situational values do whatever the situation will allow, no matter the wider interests of their communities. A banker who writes a mortgage for someone he knows can\xe2\x80\x99t make the payments over time is acting on situational values, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be gone when the bill comes due.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'People inspired by sustainable values act just the opposite, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI will never be gone. I will always be here. Therefore, I must behave in ways that sustain  \xe2\x80\x94  my employees, my customers, my suppliers, my environment, my country and my future generations.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Lately, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen an explosion of situational thinking. I support the broad proposals President Obama put forth last week to prevent banks from becoming too big to fail and to protect taxpayers from banks that get in trouble by speculating and then expect us to bail them out. But the way the president unveiled his proposals  \xe2\x80\x94  \xe2\x80\x9cif those folks want a fight, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fight I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to have\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x94  left me feeling as though he was looking for a way to bash the banks right after the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 loss in Massachusetts, in order to score a few cheap political points more than to initiate a serious national discussion about an incredibly complex issue.'b'President Obama is so much better when he takes a heated, knotty issue, like civil rights or banking reform, and talks to the country like adults. He is so much better at making us smarter than angrier. Going to war with the banks for a quick political sugar high after an electoral loss will just work against him and us. It will spook the banks into lending even less and slow the recovery even more.'b'That said, part of me can\xe2\x80\x99t blame the president. The behavior of some leading Wall Street banks, particularly Goldman Sachs, has been utterly selfish. U.S. taxpayers saved Goldman by saving one of its big counterparties, A.I.G. By any fair calculation, the U.S. Treasury should own a slice of Goldman today. Goldman has been the poster boy for banks behaving by \xe2\x80\x9csituational values\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x94  exploiting whatever the situation, or rules that it helped to write, allowed.'b'Also, President Obama tried to create a bipartisan commission to come up with a plan to reduce the national debt  \xe2\x80\x94  a plan that would inflict pain on both parties by cutting some programs and raising some taxes. But the Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, said the G.O.P. would not cooperate with any commission that proposes raising taxes. And some liberal Democrats rejected cutting their favorite programs. Way to take one for the country, guys.'b'Then let\xe2\x80\x99s look at the unions  \xe2\x80\x94  hardly paragons of sustainable thinking for the country. We all know they got more than their fair share in the General Motors settlement and in the Obama health care proposals because they could shake down the Democrats in return for votes.'b'And, finally, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget both the Democratic and Republican senators who have decided to get a quick populist boost by turning one of the few adults we have left  \xe2\x80\x94  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke  \xe2\x80\x94  into a pi\xc3\xb1ata. No, Mr. Bernanke is not blameless for the 2008 crisis. But since then he has helped steer the country back from the brink and kept us out of a depression. He absolutely deserves reappointment.'b'No doubt, this is a lousy season to be the leader of any institution. We are in the midst of a long period of austerity, where all that most leaders will be able to do is cut, fire and trim. It is so easy to play populism and run against them. But this time 'b'is different'b'. When our government is this deeply involved in propping up our economy, and the economy is this fragile, politics as usual will kill us. We badly need leaders inspired by sustainable values, not situational ones. Without that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll just be digging our hole deeper and making the reckoning, when it comes, that much more ferocious.'b'We all have blind spots, and I think one of mine  \xe2\x80\x94  shared by many other Americans, perhaps including you  \xe2\x80\x94  has to do with prisons.'b'Over the years, I\xe2\x80\x99ve written many columns about Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay, Abu Ghraib and torture, not to mention the abuses that go on in Chinese and North Korean prisons. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve never written about the horrors that unfold in American prisons  \xe2\x80\x94  especially juvenile correctional facilities  \xe2\x80\x94  on a far larger scale than at Guant\xc3\xa1namo.'b'Consider Rodney Hulin Jr., who was a 16-year-old when he was convicted of arson. A first-time offender and a slight figure at 5 feet 2 inches tall and some 125 pounds, he was sent to a men\xe2\x80\x99s prison. There, he was the smallest person around. Within a week, he was raped, according to an account by Human Rights Watch, an advocacy group. The prison doctor  ordered an H.I.V. test, since up to one-third of the inmates were H.I.V.-positive.'b'Rodney asked to be placed in protective custody, but he was denied. His father,  Rodney Hulin Sr., 'b'picks up the story'b': \xe2\x80\x9cFor the next several months, my son was repeatedly beaten by the older inmates, forced to perform oral sex, robbed, and beaten again. ... He could no longer stand to live in continual terror.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Rodney Jr. hanged himself.'b'Maybe Rodney would have been safer in a juvenile correctional facility, but then again maybe not. A stunning new Justice Department 'b'special report'b', released just this month, underscores how widespread rape is in youth correctional facilities. It found that almost one youth in eight reported being sexually assaulted while behind bars in the last year.'b'That means that a child in custody is about twice as likely to be raped as an adult behind bars, based on similar surveys of adult prisoners. As The New York Review of Books 'b'wrote on its blog'b', we face a \xe2\x80\x9ccrisis of juvenile prison rape.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The National Prison Rape Elimination Commission, a blue-ribbon panel that issued 'b'its final report'b' last year, described how a 14-year-old boy weighing 98 pounds was assaulted after he was made to share a cell with two older teenagers. Both were 6 feet 2 inches, and one weighed 160 pounds and the other 195 pounds.'b'Surprisingly, the new survey suggests that the biggest predators are not other inmates but prison staff  \xe2\x80\x94  and female staff members offend as much as the males do. More than 10 percent of boys in juvenile correctional facilities said that they had had sex with staff, most of whom were women.'b'Among girls, almost 5 percent said that they had engaged in sexual activity with staff, most of whom were men.'b'Reggie Walton, a federal judge in the District of Columbia who led the prison rape commission, said that the figures may even be an undercount because of the stigma of rape. \xe2\x80\x9cI was shocked at the level of abuse,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'One lesson from the surveys is that we should rethink the way male guards are sometimes assigned to female inmates, and female guards to male inmates, without sufficient respect for inmates\xe2\x80\x99 privacy or dignity. That won\xe2\x80\x99t stop same-sex violence or inmate-on-inmate abuses, but it would address one important component of the abuse problem.'b'By some accounts, the majority of guards at women\xe2\x80\x99s prisons are now men. Investigators at one juvenile correctional facility found that a male guard watched as girls showered, while a woman watched over boys showering.'b'Jamie Fellner of Human Rights Watch, also a member of the prison rape commission, described a Virginia prison where men were stripped naked and asked to spread their buttocks in front of a female officer. When a male inmate asked to be searched in front of  a man instead, Ms. Fellner said he was Tasered.'b'In the last few years, a growing number of states have limited the ability of guards to strip-search members of the opposite sex or watch them showering. And a landmark law, the Prison Rape Elimination Act, created Judge Walton\xe2\x80\x99s commission, which has made excellent recommendations to reduce violence and abuse behind bars. The Obama administration should quickly implement those recommendations.'b'Surveys have found that well-managed prisons and correctional facilities with strong accountability have almost no rape, by guards or inmates. Others have astonishingly high levels. If we want to rehabilitate young offenders and help them get their lives in order, a starting point is to end the criminal abuse of them.'b'The legacy of Rodney Hulin Jr. should be a concerted drive to end the way inmates are raped with impunity behind bars. The survey results indicating the ubiquity of sexual assault behind bars, often by guards, should be an awakening  \xe2\x80\x94  and an end to this blind spot that so many of us have shown. We need to be as alert to human rights abuses in our youth correctional facilities as to those at Guant\xc3\xa1namo.'b'To the Editor:'b'I applaud Defense Secretary Robert M.

The House hates the Senate. The liberal Democrats hate the moderate Democrats. The normal conservative Republicans hate the hyper Tea Party-types. The Tea Party-ists are having so many internal fights that there\xe2\x80\x99s a definite danger of broken crockery.'b'And, of course, everybody hates the bankers, except the Republicans who sat on their hands when the president called for taxing them.'b'Obama does not really do angry. Peeved, yes. He looked pretty peeved when he was being interviewed by Diane Sawyer of ABC News the other night. If he can\xe2\x80\x99t manage mellow with Diane Sawyer, what\xe2\x80\x99s he going to do on Friday when he has scheduled a meeting with the House Republicans? Have you ever seen all the House Republicans in one place? It\xe2\x80\x99s like a herd of rabid otters.'b'Looking out at the motley crew seated before him for the big speech, the president seemed at times to be pretending that he had never seen these people before in his life. \xe2\x80\x9cWashington has been telling us to wait for decades,\xe2\x80\x9d he complained at one point, as if he was a visitor from the heartland with a petition that he wanted to deliver if only he could get an appointment with someone on the appropriations committee.'b'Obama Year One began with euphoria. At the start of Year Two, crankiness rules. The House Democrats jumped up in triumph whenever the president dissed the Senate for holding things up. The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid \xe2\x80\x94 has Harry Reid had a single sunny moment in the last year? \xe2\x80\x94 got caught yawning by the cameras. There were occasionally scattered Republican jeers, although it probably counts as an improvement that nobody shouted a full insult at the president this time around. When  Justice Samuel Alito took exception to the president\xe2\x80\x99s assault on the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s recent campaign finance decision, he shook his head and mouthed \xe2\x80\x9cnot true.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Justice John Paul Stevens, who hated that decision more than anyone, was absent for the speech. There are rumors that he\xe2\x80\x99s planning to retire. And can you imagine how Congress is going to behave if Obama has to try to name a successor? There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a single jurist in the United States who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hold some opinion that 41 members of the Senate would find outrageous. Maybe they can locate a nice 50-year-old lawyer who was plunged into a coma on the day he or she passed the bar, and emerged only last week.'b'On Wednesday, the things that seemed to elicit the most bipartisan reactions were: hope (standing ovation), cutting the capital gains tax for small businesses (ditto) and Obama\xe2\x80\x99s plan for deficit control, which caused a cold breeze to blow from both the Republican and Democratic camps.'b'Democrats hate the proposed freeze on discretionary spending because they 'b'like 'b'discretionary spending. Republicans say it\xe2\x80\x99s too little too late, and, besides, it\xe2\x80\x99s their issue. Hands off.'b'While the reaction certainly suggested this idea is a goner, it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that Obama\xe2\x80\x99s most conservative proposals are still the ones with the best odds of survival. The last few presidents had their best \xe2\x80\x94 and often only \xe2\x80\x94 luck getting big domestic bills passed when they were the other party\xe2\x80\x99s programs. Bill Clinton got welfare reform. George W. Bush got No Child Left Behind and the Medicare drug plan. Both of those were basically Democratic ideas, although Bush added his own personal twist of not paying for them.'b'But Obama insisted he was going to hang in there and fight the good fight for health care reform and energy and \xe2\x80\x94 good for him \xe2\x80\x94 getting rid of the military\xe2\x80\x99s don\xe2\x80\x99t-ask-don\xe2\x80\x99t-tell rule.

Although those porky earmarks are certainly an undesirable thing, ever since John McCain\xe2\x80\x99s presidential campaign I have regarded calls for their reform as a small sign of desperation. On Wednesday, earmark reform got more time than immigration reform.'b'Obama has been saying that he\xe2\x80\x99d rather be \xe2\x80\x9ca really good one-term president than a mediocre two-term president.\xe2\x80\x9d Being a good one-term president probably sounds great to him right now. Run the Obama Foundation and never have to deal with Joe Lieberman again.'b'But he\xe2\x80\x99s definitely going for the double.

A year ago, the Pew Center on the States found that more than one-third of states do not provide military voters stationed abroad with enough time to vote, or are at high risk of not providing enough time. To address this problem, the new Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act requires states in most cases to get ballots to military and overseas voters well in advance of   regularly scheduled federal elections.'b'But the value of removing roadblocks is undermined when votes are put at risk, which can happen when ballots are returned by e-mail or are actually cast on a Web site. Massachusetts recently enacted a law allowing service members to vote by e-mail overseas.

President Obama did not create these problems, and none could be solved in one year. But 2009 offered powerful and, at times, bruising lessons for a new president struggling to fulfill the seismic promise of his election.'b'Mr. Obama used his first State of the Union address to show the country what he has learned and how he intends to govern in the next three years.'b'He was right to make the creation of jobs and the reform of the far too vulnerable financial system his top priorities. And Mr. Obama made it clear that he would not be cowed by Washington\xe2\x80\x99s venomous politics, his own mistakes, or the Massachusetts election into giving up on health care reform. It was a relief to see him challenge the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s Republicans for their obstruction and his party for tending to \xe2\x80\x9crun for the hills\xe2\x80\x9d rather than wield the power of its majority.'b'Watching Mr. Obama, we were also reminded of the world\xe2\x80\x99s relief that he is very much not George W. Bush. He is managing the necessary exit from Iraq. His decision to send more troops to Afghanistan was courageous and sound. On Wednesday, he rejected \xe2\x80\x9cthe false choice\xe2\x80\x9d between security and the rule of law.'b'At home, Mr. Obama won an economic recovery bill that was too small but staved off an even deeper recession. He raised fuel standards for cars and appointed Sonia Sotomayor to a Supreme Court that had been drifting dangerously rightward. That is good, but not enough, and the president acknowledged that before Congress and the nation on Wednesday night.'b'Like Mr. Obama, we, too, would like to see bipartisan cooperation. But all too often Mr. Obama has underestimated the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 determination to block anything he proposed. When the economy was imploding only three Republican senators voted for the absolutely essential stimulus bill; none agreed to back health care reform or even vote to end a filibuster.'b'So it was good to see him get tougher and clearer about going forward. If the Republicans want to continue to block bills that the country wants and needs, he should let them filibuster so the public can take notice. We would have liked to have heard a more forceful demand \xe2\x80\x94  rather than a polite invitation \xe2\x80\x94 for the Republicans to either support his health care reform plan or produce their own plan, one that provides real security for all Americans and has a real chance to reduce costs.'b'After their taxpayer-financed bailout, Mr. Obama was right to call for additional taxes on the big banks. (And he should support the drive in the House to tax bankers\xe2\x80\x99 obscene bonuses.)'b'On Wednesday, Mr. Obama said he would veto any financial regulatory reform bill that was not strong enough and warned that lobbyists in the Senate were weakening the version passed by the House. To our minds, the House bill was not good enough \xe2\x80\x94  creating a weak consumer protection agency and leaving loopholes in derivatives regulation. We hope Mr. Obama quickly spells out his bottom line for the reform package.'b'Mr. Obama acknowledged Americans\xe2\x80\x99 anxiety about the deficit, and he was right to announce that he would create a bipartisan panel to come up with ideas to address it now that Senate Republicans have rejected the idea without a vote. But  the first priority must be creating more jobs and helping more Americans with their mortgages.'b'The private sector seems unlikely to propel a self-sustaining recovery any time soon. That means more stimulus spending, not less, much more than the $154 billion jobs bill the House has passed. Mr. Obama offered some additional ideas, lending money to small businesses and giving them incentives for capital investments. The country will need to hear a lot more about that and how he plans to keep Americans in their homes.'b'We respect Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s deliberative nature. But too often in the last year he lingered on the sidelines, allowing his opponents to define and distort the issues and, sometimes, him \xe2\x80\x94 as happened last year in the health care debate.'b'His speech Wednesday was a reminder that he is a gifted orator, able to inspire with grand vision and the simple truth frankly spoken.

Outraged residents point out that South Carolina has one of the highest poverty rates in the nation, with unemployment rising to 12.6 percent in a Great Recession the poor hardly caused. Fifty-eight percent of the state\xe2\x80\x99s students receive subsidized lunches.'b'Now watch Mr. Bauer backpedal. He insists he was a victim of the media, not his own overreach in the politics of class resentment. But his words are out there. With a lieutenant governor like Mr. Bauer in the wings, it\xe2\x80\x99s become clearer why the South Carolina Legislature declined to impeach Gov. Mark Sanford for going AWOL at taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 expense in pursuit of his mistress.

We saw this after the 2004 tsunami. In Aceh, Indonesia, children today have better schools, health care and safer housing thanks to resources and resolve boosted by terrible tragedy.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s true that Haiti has long struggled, but foreign aid there has been a big part of successes like cutting the child mortality rate in half over the last 20 years. Foreign aid done right can and does make an enormous difference in people\xe2\x80\x99s lives.'b'By combining the current generosity with a focus on helping Haitians build strong national systems, we have the chance to pay lasting tribute to those who lost their lives in the devastating earthquake.

Japan\xe2\x80\x99s new prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, is refusing, so far, to commit to the agreement, and the Obama administration is being less than patient. Before any serious damage is done to this important alliance, both countries must work harder to find a compromise.'b'The 2006 agreement was designed to lessen tensions between Okinawans and the more than 20,000 American troops they host. The deal includes moving 2,000 Marines from the Futenma United States Marine air station in the city of Ginowan to the less populated Nago on Okinawa\xe2\x80\x99s northern coast, and relocating 8,000 other Marines to Guam.'b'Before his party\xe2\x80\x99s landslide election in August, Mr. Hatoyama called for moving the base off of Okinawa or out of Japan altogether. The Pentagon got off to a bad start by insisting that Tokyo abide by its commitments. Mr. Hatoyama now says that he will defer any decision until May. Nago\xe2\x80\x99s newly elected mayor has announced that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want the Marines to move to his city.'b'We hope the Obama administration shows flexibility and patience when two senior officials visit Japan for security talks this week. They should encourage Mr. Hatoyama to prove his commitment to being an \xe2\x80\x9cequal partner\xe2\x80\x9d by offering  solutions. And the United States must make a more compelling case for stationing troops in Japan. (There are another 20,000 American troops stationed elsewhere in Japan or just off the coast.)'b'The alliance is more important than the basing agreement. But the longer the agreement is in limbo, the more it stirs questions about the future of the alliance. There are worrying signs that many of Japan\xe2\x80\x99s new leaders and its postwar generation don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the full value of the security partnership.'b'A half-century of American protection remains a bargain for the Japanese. In much of Asia, it\xe2\x80\x99s seen as an essential balance against a rising China and a defense, if needed, against North Korea. The United States must respect Mr. Hatoyama\xe2\x80\x99s desire to strike a more independent course, including by seeking improved ties with China. A strong and equal partnership between Tokyo and Washington is in both countries\xe2\x80\x99 overwhelming interest.'b'To the Editor:'b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'If Your Children Are Awake, Then They\xe2\x80\x99re Probably Online'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 20) confirmed my observations as a high school English teacher of the increased use of electronic devices by the young.'b'Over the recent December break, I challenged my students to enjoy the richness of life free of entertainment technology for three days, and then to write about their experiences.'b'Some were able to get through the 72 hours only by unplugging their computers and televisions and turning their iPods and iPhones over to helpful and enabling parents.

The United States government and other governments around the world, for their part, have sent thousands of relief workers and have pledged $1 billion so far. But Haitians need something more fundamental than relief from the present situation; they need  jobs that they can count on for years ahead. For this, the private business sector is essential. Luckily, business leaders  are meeting now in Davos, Switzerland, and Haiti is prominent on their agenda.'b'Haiti is by far the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, and yet it need not be so, because unexploited economic opportunities abound there. Some of the best mangoes in the world grow in Haiti \xe2\x80\x94 though  too many of them rot, offshore from the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest market, for want of adequate roads and well-governed ports. Excellent coffee is grown in the Haitian mountains, but much of it is sold informally across the border to coffee producers in the Dominican Republic, who reap most of the profits.'b'Haiti also has many qualities attractive to tourists: a warm climate; magnificent white-sand beaches and turquoise water; Tortuga, the famous pirate island off the northern coast; and the Citadel, a mountain fortress erected after Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s independence in the early 19th century to fend off colonial powers, now a World Heritage site. Still, it is one of the least  visited places in the Caribbean.'b'The Hope II trade pact with the United States, signed in 2008, granted Haiti duty-free access to the American apparel market for the next decade. Already, as a result of the deal, many garment factories situated along Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s eastern border (so as to use Dominican electricity and ports) have become profitable and competitive with Chinese garment makers. But light manufacturing could be much bigger in Haiti \xe2\x80\x94 if the Haitian government and donors would credibly commit  to providing functioning roads, electrical grids and ports, and if outside private capital would invest, patiently, in Haitian businesses.'b'Poverty and a history of  coups and trade embargoes have pushed Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s reputation as a place to do business to near the bottom of the global pile, alongside countries like Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq. But Haiti is far safer and offers far more  market opportunities  than those conflict-ridden nations.'b'The obvious difficulty in Haiti is that its economic center, Port-au-Prince, is now in shambles. Private investors are naturally wary of jumping into a market too soon, before it is lively enough to provide certain kinds of support. After all, many businesses can be profitable only if other businesses exist alongside them. Ships don\xe2\x80\x99t sail directly from Haiti to Florida because  there aren\xe2\x80\x99t enough goods to warrant dedicated routes. In the meantime, without reliable routes for direct export of goods, investment in production in Haiti is stymied.'b'Even within a single manufacturing sector, it helps to have many businesses operating together. Garment factories, for example, cluster together, because they share a common need for support services. In Haiti, the cluster of garment makers has been too small even to keep repair shops  in business; it can take weeks to fly in a technician to fix a broken sewing machine. So, production costs are high because there are too few investors, and there are too few investors because costs are so high.'b'The way to address this chicken-and-egg problem is for individual private investors to coordinate with one another. This would not be a new strategy; in the 19th century, the American West was developed not as a process of gradual diffusion but in spasms of local investment booms, financed by enthusiastic outsiders. The earthquake could usher in such a boom in Haiti.'b'The World Economic Forum in Davos provides an opportunity for businesses that might invest in Haiti \xe2\x80\x94 international fashion brands, hotels and coffee chains, for example \xe2\x80\x94 to coordinate with companies that provide logistics and markets, so that together they could make mutual commitments. The foundation for such coordination has already been laid \xe2\x80\x94 by Bill Clinton, who led 200 international investors to Haiti last October. As a result of this effort, international chains like Best Western and Choice Hotels started building new hotels in Haiti.'b'The earthquake has, of course, changed opportunities in Haiti, but it has not necessarily reduced them. The American construction industry is mired in deep recession and so has the excess capacity to meet Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s sudden need for low-cost housing, roads, bridges and other structures. If American construction firms can harness Haitian labor to reconstruct (safer) homes, then the challenge will be to lure other businesses in their wake  so that temporary jobs in reconstruction are replaced by long-term jobs in manufacturing, agriculture and tourism.'b'In meeting this challenge, banks and private venture capital also have an important role to play. Haiti needs generous venture capital that encourages some firms to move in first. George Soros, the investor and philanthropist, has recognized this need by committing $25 million for smart investments that catalyze Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s competitive advantages. Many more such commitments are needed.'b'For now, even public sources of risk capital like the World Bank\xe2\x80\x99s International Finance Corporation and Britain\xe2\x80\x99s Commonwealth Development Corporation have no special provision for the kind of coordinated pump-priming investment that\xe2\x80\x99s required in Haiti. Most public capital goes to emerging market economies where private investment no longer needs to be encouraged. Haiti, with its genuine opportunities and immediate needs, provides a chance for public finance organizations to find new relevance. It is also a chance for private business to show it can take a major role in meeting the gravest human needs.'b'Toward the end of his State of the Union address Wednesday night, President Obama said something that untold numbers of Americans who suffer discrimination had wanted to hear for more than 16 years. He promised 'b'to work to repeal the law'b' that bans gay members of the military from living their lives openly.'b'The 1993 law was always pointless and cruel, but today, when numerous polls show that a solid majority of Americans oppose it, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d feels ever more like the relic of a bygone era. There is evidence that the attitude of military officers is shifting. All that is lacking is political will. Congress and the military should work with Mr. Obama to repeal the law quickly.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d is not just a technicality on the books. It is actively being used to drive gay men and lesbians out of the military \xe2\x80\x94 more than 13,000 since the law was adopted, according to the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network. That includes people with vital skills, like Arabic translators. The legal defense network, which helps people facing charges under \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d estimates that 644 people have been discharged under the law since Mr. Obama took office.'b'The policy of drumming gay men and lesbians out of the military is based on prejudice, not performance. Gay people serve openly and effectively in the armies of Britain, Israel, Australia and Canada.'b'The winner of last year\xe2\x80\x99s secretary of defense essay contest was 'b'a piece'b' by an Air Force colonel, published in Joint Force Quarterly, a military journal, that called \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9ccostly failure\xe2\x80\x9d and debunked the canard that unit cohesion would be harmed if gay service members were allowed to be open about their sexuality.'b'The law singles out a group of Americans for second-class treatment, forcing them to hide who they are and to live in fear of being found out and discharged. The policy hurts the military by depriving it of the service of a large number of loyal and talented Americans.'b'There is a bill in the House of Representatives, the Military Readiness Enhancement Act, that would undo the 1993 law. Representative Patrick Murphy, an Iraq war veteran and Democrat of Pennsylvania, is leading the effort to get it passed, and the bill has more than 180 co-sponsors. The forthcoming vote on the Defense Department\xe2\x80\x99s annual budget would also be a good opportunity for repeal.'b'This is a winnable battle, but it will take committed leadership, 'b'starting with Mr. Obama'b', who until Wednesday was not vocal enough on the subject as president. He should prod the Pentagon to speak out, but the military officers will need strong support in Congress, particularly from the many Republican lawmakers who voice their commitment to a strong military. The evidence is clear that this law makes the military weaker.'b'Some supporters of gay rights have been disappointed by the Obama administration, let down, for example, by its decision to file a brief last year in support of the Defense of Marriage Act, the law protecting the power of states to not recognize same-sex marriages. But there also has been important progress, notably the enactment of the Matthew Shepard Act, which makes hate crimes against gay people federal crimes.'b'Much more needs to be done, including recognizing same-sex marriage at the national level and passing a federal law protecting gay people from discrimination on the job. Repealing \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d would be an important step forward.'b'In his budget proposal this week, Mayor Michael Bloomberg had chilling news for New York City\xe2\x80\x99s 300,000 workers. With a $4.9 billion deficit projected for the coming year, he said, the city will have to renegotiate benefits and cut its work force. That was a hard but necessary truth, and Mr. Bloomberg must now steel himself for months of wrestling with the city\xe2\x80\x99s powerful unions.'b'The mayor and his aides are understandably galled that Gov. David Paterson of New York is not talking about any serious cuts to the state work force.'b'With the state in desperate financial shape, 'b'Mr. Paterson\xe2\x80\x99s budget'b' proposes cutting more than $700 million in funds for New York City. Mr. Bloomberg says that if that happens, he will have to lay off even more workers.'b'Mr. Paterson \xe2\x80\x94 who is eager to be re-elected \xe2\x80\x94 apparently made a deal with state workers\xe2\x80\x99 unions that if they would agree to a less-costly pension plan for new employees, he would not let anyone go until next year. The new pension plan was needed, but Mayor Bloomberg is right that it is unfair for city workers to bear the burden now for Governor Paterson\xe2\x80\x99s deal.'b'Although 'b'this early budget'b' is often a worst-case scenario, the mayor estimates that the present gaps will force a reduction in the city\xe2\x80\x99s work force of about 4,200 positions, including many employees in libraries, parks and other services. He warns of as many as 19,000 more layoffs if the state goes ahead with Mr. Paterson\xe2\x80\x99s proposed cuts in funds for the city.'b'Mr. Bloomberg, who has agreed to generous salary increases for teachers in the past, now says that the city has reached its limit. He will ask for either a reduction in future pay increases \xe2\x80\x94 from 4 percent a year to 2 percent \xe2\x80\x94 or a loss of at least 2,500 teaching jobs. As he moves forward, the mayor also indicated that he wants city unions to agree that any raises be based on savings of pension and health care costs, plus new productivity requirements.'b'With unemployment rates of more than 10 percent \xe2\x80\x94  and higher in New York City than in the rest of the state \xe2\x80\x94  nobody wants more layoffs. If jobs can be saved, the state and city should work hard to find ways to adjust workers\xe2\x80\x99 benefits. Most of which are far more generous than those usually offered in the private sector. That said, it will be tough-going for Mayor Bloomberg and the city\xe2\x80\x99s unions \xe2\x80\x94 and tougher than it needs to be. Mr. Paterson has to remember that he is governor for the whole state, including New York City.'b'On Jan. 29, 2009, in the East Room of the White House, President Obama signed his first bill into law, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. It overturned a notorious 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision from 2007 that had denied Ms. Ledbetter restitution for years in which her employer, the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, had paid her less than her male colleagues.'b'The new law could not restore Ms. Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s lost wages because her case could not be retried. But it brought justice, if belatedly, by ensuring that legal protections and civil rights denied to Ms. Ledbetter would not be denied to others. It is past time for Mr. Obama to see that similar justice is done for Evelyn Coke.'b'In 2007, Ms. Coke also had her day in Supreme Court \xe2\x80\x94 and also lost. A retired home care aide, she had sued her employer for decades of unpaid overtime. No one disputed that she had worked extra long hours for no extra pay. But in a 9-to-0 decision, the justices upheld a 1975 federal labor regulation that defines home care aides as \xe2\x80\x9ccompanions.\xe2\x80\x9d That designation exempts home care agencies from having to pay the federal minimum wage or time-and-a-half for overtime.'b'The justices were clear that the law gives the Labor Department the power to change the regulation. Congress also could change the rule. Yet the rule stands more than two years after the Coke decision and a year after lawmakers and Mr. Obama took a bow for the Ledbetter fair-pay law.'b'Like Ms. Coke, who was born in Jamaica, home care workers are often immigrants. Most are women, minorities and earn a low income. They are not mere companions. They typically help to feed, dress and move their elderly and disabled clients, plus keep house. Home care also is one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s fastest-growing occupations. Currently numbering around two million, they are among the lowest-paid and most-exploited in the work force.'b'After signing the Lilly Ledbetter law last year, Mr. Obama gave Ms. Ledbetter the last of many pens used in the ceremony. Ms. Coke 'b'died last July'b' before she saw justice, let alone a White House ceremony. In her memory, Mr. Obama should instruct his Labor Department to undo the companionship exemption. If he does not act, Congress should introduce and pass, without delay, the Evelyn Coke Fair Pay for Caregivers Act.'b'The last, long stage of J. D. Salinger\xe2\x80\x99s life \xe2\x80\x94 the unpublishing of himself \xe2\x80\x94 is now over. It began, more or less, when he moved to Cornish, N.H., in 1953, two years after \xe2\x80\x9cThe Catcher in the Rye\xe2\x80\x9d came out. And it ended 'b'with his death'b' this week at the age of 91.'b'Whether he expected such a substantial stretch of privacy when he withdrew from New York is unknown, as is almost everything about his private life in a place that is not nearly so remote from the world as most of his readers supposed. But then remoteness is also a matter of will, as Mr. Salinger succeeded in proving.'b'Publishing for him was clearly full of a susceptibility that most authors never feel. To send a work out into the world was, to Mr. Salinger, an intrusion. And so he ends up raising, in its purest form, a question that many writers have struggled with: Is it really possible to be a writer without publishing?'b'Mr. Salinger had it both ways. His work was not merely popular. There was an almost idolatrous quality in the public response to \xe2\x80\x9cCatcher\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cNine Stories,\xe2\x80\x9d which appeared the year he moved to Cornish. We do not know whether Mr. Salinger retreated to husband his creativity or simply defend his privacy.'b'It remains to be seen whether death will now publish Mr. Salinger \xe2\x80\x94 whether there is an archive of his later life\xe2\x80\x99s work waiting to be revealed. There was a purity in Mr. Salinger\xe2\x80\x99s separation from the world, whatever its motives, whatever his character. His half-century of solitude and silence was a creative act in itself, requiring extraordinary force of will.'b'This is the core truth that readers \xe2\x80\x94 and writers, too \xe2\x80\x94 often struggle with. Beneath the riches of the creative life, and hidden well away from the claims we place upon the writers we care for, there is still the one life, the ordinary life, to be lived. Mr. Salinger chose to live his in a way that only he and his immediate family could observe. It is as telling a silence as the blank spaces between his sentences.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Obama Says Nation Can\xe2\x80\x99t Afford the Politics of No'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 28):'b'President Obama did not back away from any issue, including partisan politics.

To justify the freeze, Mr. Obama used language that was almost identical to widely ridiculed remarks early last year by John Boehner, the House minority leader. Boehner then: \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican families are tightening their belt, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t see government tightening its belt.\xe2\x80\x9d Obama now: \xe2\x80\x9cFamilies across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions. The federal government should do the same.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s going on here? The answer, presumably, is that Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s advisers believed he could score some political points by doing the deficit-peacock strut. I think they were wrong, that he did himself more harm than good. Either way, however, the fact that anyone thought such a dumb policy idea was politically smart is bad news because it\xe2\x80\x99s an indication of the extent to which we\xe2\x80\x99re failing to come to grips with our economic and fiscal problems.'b'The nature of America\xe2\x80\x99s troubles is easy to state. We\xe2\x80\x99re in the aftermath of a severe financial crisis, which has led to mass job destruction. The only thing that\xe2\x80\x99s keeping us from sliding into a second Great Depression is deficit spending. And right now we need more of that deficit spending because millions of American lives are being blighted by high unemployment, and the government should be doing everything it can to bring unemployment down.'b'In the long run, however, even the U.S. government has to pay its way. And the long-run budget outlook was dire even before the recent surge in the deficit, mainly because of inexorably rising health care costs. Looking ahead, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to find a way to run smaller, not larger, deficits.'b'How can this apparent conflict between short-run needs and long-run responsibilities be resolved? Intellectually, it\xe2\x80\x99s not hard at all. We should combine actions that create jobs now with other actions that will reduce deficits later. And economic officials in the Obama administration understand that logic: for the past year they have been very clear that their vision involves combining fiscal stimulus to help the economy now with health care reform to help the budget later.'b'The sad truth, however, is that our political system doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem capable of doing what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary.'b'On jobs, it\xe2\x80\x99s now clear that the Obama stimulus wasn\xe2\x80\x99t nearly big enough. No need now to resolve the question of whether the administration should or could have sought a bigger package early last year. Either way, the point is that the boost from the stimulus will start to fade out in around six months, yet we\xe2\x80\x99re still facing years of mass unemployment. The latest projections from the Congressional Budget Office say that the average unemployment rate next year will be only slightly lower than the current, disastrous, 10 percent.'b'Yet there is little sentiment in Congress for any major new job-creation efforts.'b'Meanwhile, health care reform faces a troubled outlook. Congressional Democrats may yet manage to pass a bill; they\xe2\x80\x99ll be committing political suicide if they don\xe2\x80\x99t. But there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that Republicans were very successful at demonizing the plan. And, crucially, what they demonized most effectively were the cost-control efforts: modest, totally reasonable measures to ensure that Medicare dollars are spent wisely became evil \xe2\x80\x9cdeath panels.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'So if health reform fails, you can forget about any serious effort to rein in rising Medicare costs. And even if it succeeds, many politicians will have learned a hard lesson: you don\xe2\x80\x99t get any credit for doing the fiscally responsible thing. It\xe2\x80\x99s better, for the sake of your career, to just pretend that you\xe2\x80\x99re fiscally responsible \xe2\x80\x94  that is, to be a deficit peacock.'b'So we\xe2\x80\x99re paralyzed in the face of mass unemployment and out-of-control health care costs. Don\xe2\x80\x99t blame Mr. Obama. There\xe2\x80\x99s only so much one man can do, even if he sits in the White House. Blame our political culture instead, a culture that rewards hypocrisy and irresponsibility rather than serious efforts to solve America\xe2\x80\x99s problems. And blame the filibuster, under which 41 senators can make the country ungovernable, if they choose  \xe2\x80\x94  and they have so chosen.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say this, but the state of the union  \xe2\x80\x94  not the speech, but the thing itself  \xe2\x80\x94  isn\xe2\x80\x99t looking very good.'b'There is a specter haunting America: the specter of a saner, updated version of Ross Perot.

He is large of ego, full of money and cranky in mien.'b'When he enters the arena, he\xe2\x80\x99ll say that Washingtonians, all of them, are a bunch of failures.

In that speech, you began to reclaim the mantle of the permanent outsider.'b'First, you distanced yourself from the Democratic orthodoxy. You embraced some traditional Democratic policies, but also an eclectic grab bag of other policies that play well with independents: a spending freeze that excluded defense, nuclear power, offshore drilling, the elimination of a capital gains tax on small business, a fiscal commission, free trade deals and earmark reform.'b'Second, you distanced yourself from the old debates. You sidestepped the whole big-government-versus-small-government question. Instead of doing the liberal-people-versus-the-powerful shtick, you emphasized targeted tax cuts, deficit reduction and community bank subsidies.'b'Third, you distanced yourself from Washington morality. At times the speech was like a vice principal\xe2\x80\x99s lecture to an unruly middle school classroom. You scolded Democrats and Republicans about excessive partisanship, pettiness and insider-dealing. You cast yourself as the sole coolheaded man in Gomorrah.'b'In short, you made it clear that you will not be going down with the Congressional Titanic. You took a few steps toward recapturing your image as the last thoughtful reformer. Now you have to embrace that role with a vengeance.'b'There aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to be any big new policy initiatives this year anyway. You might as well cross the country on a Perot-like tour of consciousness-raising, complete with charts and everything.'b'The deficits are the issue around which everything else revolves. The mounting deficits both symbolize Washington\xe2\x80\x99s institutional dysfunction and genuinely threaten the nation.'b'You want to cross the country screaming the facts. As you do, states like California and Illinois will be undergoing fiscal implosions to illustrate your ongoing point. You want to use the fiscal crisis as a wedge to change the way the whole system operates.'b'If you get a deficit-reduction deal, you break through the polarized rigidities that encrust everything else. You wipe clean the special-interest barnacles that encrust the tax code. You force the country to think in 30-year increments and deliver a blow to the tyranny of the news cycle. You force the country to accept common sacrifice. This is the issue that unlocks everything else. So will you establish your credibility and offer to raise taxes on the lower 98 percent? Yes, you can!'b'If the setbacks of the last year haven\xe2\x80\x99t radicalized you about the sickness of our current political system, Mr. President, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what will.

For a survivor of these two infernos to still be alive and well, with a new family that has resurrected for me the one I had lost, seems almost unreal. When I entered Adolf Eichmann and Josef Mengele\xe2\x80\x99s gruesome universe at the age of 13, I measured my life expectancy in days, weeks at the most.'b'In the early winter of 1944, World War II was coming to an end. But we in the camps knew nothing. We wondered: What is happening in the world outside? Where is God? Where is the pope? Does anyone out there know what is happening here to us? Does anyone even care?'b'Russia was devastated. Britain had its back against the wall. And America? It was so far away, so divided. How could it be expected to save civilization from the seemingly invincible forces of darkness?'b'It took a long time for the news of the American-led invasion of Normandy to slip into Auschwitz. There were also rumors that the Red Army was advancing quickly on the eastern front. With the ground shrinking under their feet, the Nazis were becoming palpably nervous. The gas chambers spewed fire and smoke as never before.'b'One gray, frosty morning, our guards ordered those of us still capable of slave labor to line up and marched us out of the camp. We were to be shunted westward, from Poland into Germany. I was beside myself with excitement \xe2\x80\x94 and dread. Salvation somehow seemed closer \xe2\x80\x94 yet we also knew that we could be killed at any moment. The goal was to hang on a little longer. I was almost 16 now, and I wanted to live.'b'We marched from camp to camp, day and night, until we and our torturers began to hear distant explosions that sounded like artillery fire. One afternoon we were strafed by a squadron of Allied fighter planes that mistook our column for Wehrmacht troops. As the Germans hit the dirt, their machine guns blazing in all directions, someone near me yelled, \xe2\x80\x9cRun for it!\xe2\x80\x9d I kicked off my wooden clogs and sprinted into the forest. There I hid, hungry and cold, for weeks, until I was discovered by a group of American soldiers. The boys who brought me life were not much older than I. They fed me, clothed me, made me a mascot of their regiment and gave me my first real taste of freedom.'b'Today, the last living survivors of the Holocaust are disappearing one by one. Soon, history will speak about Auschwitz with the impersonal voice of researchers and novelists at best, and at worst in the malevolent register of revisionists and falsifiers who call the Nazi Final Solution a myth. This process has already begun.'b'And it is why those of us who survived have a duty to transmit to humankind the memory of what we endured in body and soul, to tell our children that the fanaticism and violence that nearly destroyed our universe have the power to enflame theirs, too. The fury of the Haitian earthquake, which has taken more than 200,000 lives, teaches us how cruel nature can be to man. The Holocaust, which destroyed a people, teaches us that nature, even in its cruelest moments, is benign in comparison with man when he loses his moral compass and his reason.'b'After so much death, a groundswell of compassion and solidarity for victims \xe2\x80\x94 all victims, whether from natural disasters, racial hatred, religious intolerance or terrorism \xe2\x80\x94 occasionally manifests itself, as it has in recent days.'b'These actions stand in contrast to those moments when we have failed to act; they remind us, on this dark anniversary, of how often we remain divided and confused, how in the face of horror we hesitate, vacillate, like sleepwalkers at the edge of the abyss. Of course, they remind us, too, that we have managed to stave off the irrevocable; that our chances for living in harmony are, thankfully, still intact.'b'Iran has again proved to be a master at playing for time. Six months after a new diplomatic overture from Washington and its partners, Tehran has shown no interest in resolving the dispute over its nuclear program. It is time for President Obama and other leaders to ratchet up the pressure with tougher sanctions.'b'Mr. Obama, who offered a new relationship with Iran, gave its government until the end of 2009 to come to the table. In his State of the Union address this week, he warned Iran\xe2\x80\x99s leaders that they face \xe2\x80\x9cgrowing consequences\xe2\x80\x9d if they continue to ignore their obligations.'b'Four years after the United Nations Security Council first demanded that Iran stop enriching uranium (usable for nuclear fuel or a bomb), Tehran has thousands of centrifuges spinning. Washington plans to soon circulate a new sanctions resolution \xe2\x80\x94 the fourth in four years.'b'Britain, France and Germany share Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s concerns. Russia and China \xe2\x80\x94 which have veto power on the Security Council and strong economic ties with Iran \xe2\x80\x94 have previously insisted on watering down penalties. That has made the Council look feckless and made it far too easy for Iran to press ahead. On Friday, we were glad to see Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton 'b'publicly warn China'b', which seems especially intractable, that it faces diplomatic isolation if it fails to back new sanctions.'b'Last fall, after Iran was caught hiding another illicit enrichment plant, the major powers offered Tehran a reasonable interim deal: open all of its nuclear facilities to international inspectors and send most of its stock of low-enriched uranium abroad to be turned into fuel for a research reactor. That wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have solved the problem, but it would have bought more time for negotiations. A midlevel Iranian diplomat seemed to agree, but then higher-ups said no. Nothing has changed since.'b'This is a delicate time in Iran. Last June\xe2\x80\x99s fraudulent presidential election sparked fierce political protests and a brutal government crackdown \xe2\x80\x94 including political executions. New United Nations sanctions must be deftly targeted to inflict maximum damage on the levers of repression \xe2\x80\x94 especially the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, which also runs the nuclear program \xe2\x80\x94 without imposing additional suffering on the Iranians. That circle must somehow be squared. And the door must remain open to negotiations.'b'If the Security Council does not act quickly, then the United States and Europe must apply more pressure on their own. The Senate on Thursday approved a bill that would punish companies for exporting gasoline to Iran or helping Iran expand its own petroleum refining capability. The House already had passed a similar version. That may be necessary at some point, but right now we are concerned that this approach will hurt too many Iranians outside the government.'b'Some experts say the government is so weakened that the United States should withdraw its offer to improve relations and focus solely on regime change. No one has put forward a compelling plan for achieving that, but military action would be a disaster. As we saw in Iraq, talk of regime change can be an unpredictable and dangerous game.'b'Iran is already, predictably, claiming that the homegrown opposition is a tool of the West. That is absurd. President Obama needs to speak out more strongly on behalf of Iranians who are peacefully seeking change. But the United States and its partners also must be very conscious of the fierce pride and independence of the Iranian people. Squaring that circle will be extremely hard, but it must be done. Meanwhile, the centrifuges keep spinning.'b'A bitter dispute between one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest health insurers and a consortium of New York City hospitals illustrates the difficulties of controlling the ever-rising costs of medical care and insurance premiums. In this case, the insurer appears to be acting responsibly, if a bit heavy-handedly.'b'As described by Anemona Hartocollis 'b'in The Times this week'b',  the struggle pits UnitedHealthcare, which has 25 million members across the country, against Continuum Health Partners, the parent company of five hospitals in the city, including Beth Israel and St. Luke\xe2\x80\x99s-Roosevelt.'b'One issue is how much money UnitedHealthcare will pay the hospitals for services provided to its members. The insurer claims that it was shocked that hospital negotiators were seeking a 40 percent increase in reimbursement rates, especially when subscribers are demanding they rein in premiums. The hospitals say they were appalled to find that UnitedHealthcare wanted a reduction of 7 to 10 percent in reimbursement levels at a time when its largest hospitals are barely breaking even.'b'We don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to know what the proper reimbursement rates should be. We simply note that many experts believe hospital costs generally are too high and that insurers should bargain hard to bring costs down rather than just raise premiums.'b'A second issue is UnitedHealthcare\xe2\x80\x99s demand that the hospitals notify it within 24 hours when a beneficiary is admitted \xe2\x80\x94 or suffer a 50 percent cut in reimbursements for that patient. The insurer says the faster it has that information the faster its case managers can look for ways to shorten a hospital stay \xe2\x80\x94 reducing costs and hospital-borne infections \xe2\x80\x94 and help organize post-hospital care to prevent relapses.'b'Hospitals are notoriously poor at coordinating post-discharge care, and insurers, who have the fullest records of what doctors a patient has been seeing, are in a good position to help do it. The hospitals suspect that UnitedHealthcare is looking for an excuse to cut reimbursements. The company denies that.'b'How hard could it be for admissions offices to alert the insurer \xe2\x80\x94 and the patient\xe2\x80\x99s primary care doctor \xe2\x80\x94 that a patient has arrived? That said, it might be fairer to impose a lesser penalty for, say, the first 10 missed deadlines and bigger penalties after that.'b'The fight should remind insurers and health care providers that they have a shared interest in making sure that medical treatment is better coordinated so that patients get well faster and don\xe2\x80\x99t relapse. That is a good way to rein in costs and premiums.'b'One of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s worthier first-year achievements was to redirect federal sex-education financing from an abstinence-only approach to  broader, more-effective programs that provide information to young people about contraceptives, pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.'b'A 'b'new study'b' from the Guttmacher Institute examining the latest federal data on teenage sex, births and abortion \xe2\x80\x94 along with the group\xe2\x80\x99s own abortion statistics \xe2\x80\x94 suggests the wisdom of that shift.'b'The study found that the pregnancy rate among girls ages 15 to 19 years old increased by 3 percent in 2006 from the year before \xe2\x80\x94 a troubling departure after more than a decade of declining teenage pregnancy.'b'The teenage abortion rate also rose during the same period for the first time in more than a decade, increasing by 1 percent.'b'It remains to be seen whether these increases represent a longer-term trend. No doubt a number of factors contributed to the upticks, including, for example, declining contraceptive use by teenagers. But the institute also sees a link between the rise in the teenage pregnancy and abortion rates and the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on abstinence-only sex education programs that bar teaching about contraception. This is not an unreasonable inference.'b'The study is timely. As part of the broader health care reform effort, abstinence-only advocates are trying hard to restore financing for the narrow, ineffective and fundamentally dishonest approach.'b'As I read over last week\xe2\x80\x99s aggressively wrong 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision greatly escalating the power of corporate and union money in elections, my thoughts turned to  former Justice Sandra Day O\xe2\x80\x99Connor.'b'That is not just because the ruling is another reminder of the court\xe2\x80\x99s rightward shift since Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor was replaced by the starkly conservative Justice Samuel Alito. Since retiring, Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor has been warning about the threat to judicial independence from big-money state judicial campaigns and attack ads paid for by special interests hoping to influence future court decisions. The Citizens United ruling promises to make that problem worse, possibly much worse.'b'Thirty-nine states hold judicial elections. Between 2000 and 2009, State Supreme Court candidates raised $205.8 million, according to the Justice at Stake Campaign, a watchdog group that monitors money in court races. That was more than double the $84.9 million raised the previous decade. One immediate result of the Citizens United ruling, as Justice John Paul Stevens noted in dissent, is that these states \xe2\x80\x9cmay no longer have the ability to place modest limits on corporate electioneering even if they believe such limits to be critical to maintaining the integrity of their judicial systems.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Another result is that all states are now effectively barred from adopting curbs on corporate and union spending on political campaigns, including judicial races. Business and other outside interest groups able to spend the cash could further dominate the airwaves and the debate in campaigns.

His death this week at the age of 87 was a loss that should have drawn much more attention from a press corps that spends an inordinate amount of its time obsessing idiotically over the likes of Tiger Woods and John Edwards.'b'Mr. Zinn was chagrined by the present state of affairs, but undaunted. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there is going to be change, real change,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit will have to work its way from the bottom up, from the people themselves.

In the nitwit era that we\xe2\x80\x99re living through now, it\xe2\x80\x99s fashionable, for example, to bad-mouth labor unions and feminists even as workers throughout the land are treated like so much trash and the culture is so riddled with sexism that most people don\xe2\x80\x99t even notice it. (There\xe2\x80\x99s a restaurant chain called \xe2\x80\x9cHooters,\xe2\x80\x9d for crying out loud.)'b'I always wondered why Howard Zinn was considered a radical. (He called himself a radical.) He was an unbelievably decent man who felt obliged to challenge injustice and unfairness wherever he found it. What was so radical about believing that workers should get a fair shake on the job, that corporations have too much power over our lives and much too much influence with the government, that wars are so murderously destructive that alternatives to warfare should be found, that blacks and other racial and ethnic minorities should have the same rights as whites, that the interests of powerful political leaders and corporate elites are not the same as those of ordinary people who are struggling from week to week to make ends meet?'b'Mr. Zinn was often taken to task for peeling back the rosy veneer of much of American history to reveal sordid realities that had remained hidden for too long. When writing about Andrew Jackson in his most famous book, \xe2\x80\x9cA People\xe2\x80\x99s History of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d published in 1980, Mr. Zinn said:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you look through high school textbooks and elementary school textbooks in American history, you will find Jackson the frontiersman, soldier, democrat, man of the people  \xe2\x80\x94  not Jackson the slaveholder, land speculator, executioner of dissident soldiers, exterminator of Indians.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Radical? Hardly.'b'Mr. Zinn would protest peacefully for important issues he believed in  \xe2\x80\x94  against racial segregation, for example, or against the war in Vietnam  \xe2\x80\x94  and at times he was beaten and arrested for doing so. He was a man of exceptionally strong character who worked hard as a boy growing up in Brooklyn during the Depression. He was a bomber pilot in World War II, and his experience of the unmitigated horror of warfare served as the foundation for his lifelong quest for peaceful solutions to conflict.'b'He had a wonderful family, and he cherished it. He and his wife, Roslyn, known to all as Roz, were married in 1944 and were inseparable for more than six decades until her death in 2008.

He was a treasure and an inspiration. That he was considered radical says way more about this society than it does about him.'b'President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union address soared  \xe2\x80\x94  right over a familiar cliff.'b'The president simply couldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to escape his professorial past, to convey his passion and convictions in the plain words of plain folks, and to breach the chasm between the People\xe2\x80\x99s House and people\xe2\x80\x99s houses.'b'He\xe2\x80\x99s still stuck on studious.'b'He seems to believe that if he does a better job of explaining his aggressive agenda, then he\xe2\x80\x99ll win hearts and minds.

His was arguably the first truly original voice in American  prose fiction after the generation of Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Faulkner. Of course nothing is absolutely original in literature, and Mr. Salinger had his precursors, of whom Hemingway was one, and Mark Twain \xe2\x80\x94 from whose Huck Finn Hemingway said that all modern American literature came \xe2\x80\x94 another. From them he learned what you could do with simple, colloquial language and a na\xc3\xafve youthful narrator. But in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Catcher in the Rye\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Salinger applied their lessons in a new way to create a new kind of hero, Holden Caulfield, whose narrative voice struck a chord with millions of readers.'b'The narrative is in a style the Russians call skaz, a nice word with echoes of jazz and scat in it, which uses the repetitions and redundancies of ordinary speech to produce an effect of sincerity and authenticity \xe2\x80\x94 and humor: \xe2\x80\x9cThe thing is, most of the time when you\xe2\x80\x99re coming pretty close to doing it with a girl ... she keeps telling you to stop.

They tell me to stop, so I stop.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It looks easy, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'Nearly everybody loves \xe2\x80\x9cThe Catcher in the Rye,\xe2\x80\x9d and most readers enjoy Mr. Salinger\xe2\x80\x99s first collection of short stories, \xe2\x80\x9cNine Stories.\xe2\x80\x9d But the work that followed, the four long short stories paired together in two successive books as \xe2\x80\x9cFranny and Zooey\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cRaise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction,\xe2\x80\x9d were less reader-friendly and provoked more critical comment, leading eventually to the retreat of the wounded author into solitude.'b'This was as much the consequence of critical failure as of authorial arrogance. These books challenged conventional notions of fiction and conventional ways of reading as radically as the kind of novels that would later be called post-modernist, and a lot of critics didn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cget it.\xe2\x80\x9d The saga of the Glass family is stylistically the antithesis of \xe2\x80\x9cCatcher\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 highly literary, full of rhetorical tropes, narrative devices and asides to the reader \xe2\x80\x94 but there is also continuity between them. The literariness of the Glass stories is always domesticated by a colloquial informality. Most are narrated by Buddy, the writer in the family, who says at the outset of \xe2\x80\x9cZooey\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cwhat I\xe2\x80\x99m about to offer isn\xe2\x80\x99t really a short story at all but a sort of prose home movie.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The nearest equivalent to this saga in earlier literature is perhaps the 18th-century antinovel \xe2\x80\x9cThe Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d by Laurence Sterne. There is the same minutely close observation of the social dynamics of family life, the same apparent disregard for conventional narrative structure, the same teasing hints that the fictional narrator is a persona for the real author, the same delicate balance of sentiment and irony, and the same humorous running commentary on the activities of writing and reading.'b'How Shandean, for instance, is Buddy\xe2\x80\x99s presentation to the reader in \xe2\x80\x9cSeymour\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cthis unpretentious bouquet of very early-blooming parentheses: (((( )))). I suppose, most unflorally, I truly mean them to be taken, first off, as bow-legged \xe2\x80\x94 buckle-legged \xe2\x80\x94 omens of my state of mind and body at this writing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Seymour Glass first appeared in one of the \xe2\x80\x9cNine Stories,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cA Perfect Day for Bananafish,\xe2\x80\x9d as a disturbed veteran of World War II (as Mr. Salinger himself was), who on vacation with his rather shallow wife, after a charmingly droll conversation with a little girl on the beach, shockingly shoots himself in the last paragraph. The late stories are all in some way about the attempts of Seymour\xe2\x80\x99s surviving siblings to come to terms with this action. This often takes a religious direction, and presents the Glass family as a kind of spiritual elite, struggling against a tide of materialism and philistinism with the aid of Christian existentialism, Eastern mysticism and a select pantheon of great writers.'b'This cultural and spiritual elitism got up the noses of many critics, but I think they overlooked the fact that Mr. Salinger was playing a kind of Shandean game with his readers. The more truth-telling and pseudo-historical the stories became in form (tending toward an apparently random, anecdotal structure, making elaborate play with letters and other documents as \xe2\x80\x9cevidence\xe2\x80\x9d), the less credible became the content (miraculous feats of learning, stigmata, prophetic glimpses, memories of previous incarnations, and so forth). But what were we asked to believe in: the reality of these things, or the possibility of them? Since it is fiction, surely the latter; to suppose it is the former is to lose half the pleasure of reading the books.'b'PRESIDENT OBAMA 10 days ago set out one important element in the needed structural reform of the financial system. No one can reasonably contest the need for such reform, in the United States and in other countries as well. We have after all a system that broke down in the most serious crisis in 75 years. The cost has been enormous in terms of unemployment and lost production. The repercussions have been international.'b'Aggressive action by governments and central banks \xe2\x80\x94 really unprecedented in both magnitude and scope \xe2\x80\x94 has been necessary to revive and maintain market functions. Some of that support has continued to this day. Here in the United States as elsewhere, some of the largest and proudest financial institutions \xe2\x80\x94 including both investment and commercial banks \xe2\x80\x94 have been rescued or merged with the help of massive official funds. Those actions were taken out of well-justified concern that their outright failure would irreparably impair market functioning and further damage the real economy already in recession.'b'Now the economy is recovering, if at a still modest pace. Funds are flowing more readily in financial markets, but still far from normally. Discussion is underway here and abroad about specific reforms, many of which have been set out by the United States administration: appropriate capital and liquidity requirements for banks; better official supervision on the one hand and on the other improved risk management and board oversight for private institutions; a review of accounting approaches toward financial institutions; and others.'b'As President Obama has emphasized, some central structural issues have not yet been satisfactorily addressed.'b'A large concern is the residue of moral hazard from the extensive and successful efforts of central banks and governments to rescue large failing and potentially failing financial institutions. The long-established \xe2\x80\x9csafety net\xe2\x80\x9d undergirding the stability of commercial banks \xe2\x80\x94 deposit insurance and lender of last resort facilities \xe2\x80\x94 has been both reinforced and extended in a series of ad hoc decisions to support investment banks, mortgage providers and the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest insurance company. In the process, managements, creditors and to some extent stockholders of these non-banks have been protected.'b'The phrase \xe2\x80\x9ctoo big to fail\xe2\x80\x9d has entered into our everyday vocabulary. It carries the implication that really large, complex and highly interconnected financial institutions can count on public support at critical times. The sense of public outrage over seemingly unfair treatment is palpable. Beyond the emotion, the result is to provide those institutions with a competitive advantage in their financing, in their size and in their ability to take and absorb risks.'b'As things stand, the consequence will be to enhance incentives to risk-taking and leverage, with the implication of an even more fragile financial system. We need to find more effective fail-safe arrangements.'b'In approaching that challenge, we need to recognize that the basic operations of commercial banks are integral to a well-functioning private financial system. It is those institutions, after all, that manage and protect the basic payments systems upon which we all depend. More broadly, they provide the essential intermediating function of matching the need for safe and readily available depositories for liquid funds with the need for reliable sources of credit for businesses, individuals and governments.'b'Combining those essential functions unavoidably entails risk, sometimes substantial risk. That is why Adam Smith more than 200 years ago advocated keeping banks small. Then an individual failure would not be so destructive for the economy. That approach does not really seem feasible in today\xe2\x80\x99s world, not given the size of businesses, the substantial investment required in technology and the national and international reach required.'b'Instead, governments have long provided commercial banks with the public \xe2\x80\x9csafety net.\xe2\x80\x9d The implied moral hazard has been balanced by close regulation and supervision. Improved capital requirements and leverage restrictions are now also under consideration in international forums as a key element of reform.'b'The further proposal set out by the president recently to limit the proprietary activities of banks approaches the problem from a complementary direction. The point of departure is that adding further layers of risk to the inherent risks of essential commercial bank functions doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense, not when those risks arise from more speculative activities far better suited for other areas of the financial markets.'b'The specific points at issue are ownership or sponsorship of hedge funds and private equity funds, and proprietary trading \xe2\x80\x94 that is, placing bank capital at risk in the search of speculative profit rather than in response to customer needs. Those activities are actively engaged in by only a handful of American mega-commercial banks, perhaps four or five. Only 25 or 30 may be significant internationally.'b'Apart from the risks inherent in these activities, they also present virtually insolvable conflicts of interest with customer relationships, conflicts that simply cannot be escaped by an elaboration of so-called Chinese walls between different divisions of an institution. The further point is that the three activities at issue \xe2\x80\x94 which in themselves are legitimate and useful parts of our capital markets \xe2\x80\x94 are in no way dependent on commercial banks\xe2\x80\x99 ownership. These days there are literally thousands of independent hedge funds and equity funds of widely varying size perfectly capable of maintaining innovative competitive markets. Individually, such independent capital market institutions, typically financed privately, are heavily dependent like other businesses upon commercial bank services, including in their case prime brokerage. Commercial bank ownership only tilts a \xe2\x80\x9clevel playing field\xe2\x80\x9d without clear value added.'b'Very few of those capital market institutions, both because of their typically more limited size and more stable sources of finance, could present a credible claim to be \xe2\x80\x9ctoo big\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ctoo interconnected\xe2\x80\x9d to fail. In fact, sizable numbers of such institutions fail or voluntarily cease business in troubled times with no adverse consequences for the viability of markets.'b'What we do need is protection against the outliers. There are a limited number of investment banks (or perhaps insurance companies or other firms) the failure of which would be so disturbing as to raise concern about a broader market disruption. In such cases, authority by a relevant supervisory agency to limit their capital and leverage would be important, as the president has proposed.'b'To meet the possibility that failure of such institutions may nonetheless threaten the system, the reform proposals of the Obama administration and other governments point to the need for a new \xe2\x80\x9cresolution authority.\xe2\x80\x9d Specifically, the appropriately designated agency should be authorized to intervene in the event that a systemically critical capital market institution is on the brink of failure. The agency would assume control for the sole purpose of arranging an orderly liquidation or merger. Limited funds would be made available to maintain continuity of operations while preparing for the demise of the organization.'b'To help facilitate that process, the concept of a \xe2\x80\x9cliving will\xe2\x80\x9d has been set forth by a number of governments. Stockholders and management would not be protected. Creditors would be at risk, and would suffer to the extent that the ultimate liquidation value of the firm would fall short of its debts.'b'To put it simply, in no sense would these capital market institutions be deemed \xe2\x80\x9ctoo big to fail.\xe2\x80\x9d What they would be free to do is to innovate, to trade, to speculate, to manage private pools of capital \xe2\x80\x94 and as ordinary businesses in a capitalist economy, to fail.'b'I do not deal here with other key issues of structural reform. Surely, effective arrangements for clearing and settlement and other restrictions in the now enormous market for derivatives should be agreed to as part of the present reform program. So should the need for a designated agency \xe2\x80\x94 preferably the Federal Reserve \xe2\x80\x94 charged with reviewing and appraising market developments, identifying sources of weakness and recommending action to deal with the emerging problems. Those and other matters are part of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s program and now under international consideration.'b'In this country, I believe regulation of large insurance companies operating over many states needs to be reviewed. We also face a large challenge in rebuilding an efficient, competitive private mortgage market, an area in which commercial bank participation is needed. Those are matters for another day.'b'What is essential now is that we work with other nations hosting large financial markets to reach a broad consensus on an outline for the needed structural reforms, certainly including those that the president has recently set out. My clear sense is that relevant international and foreign authorities are prepared to engage in that effort. In the process, significant points of operational detail will need to be resolved, including clarifying the range of trading activity appropriate for commercial banks in support of customer relationships.'b'I am well aware that there are interested parties that long to return to \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness as usual,\xe2\x80\x9d even while retaining the comfort of remaining within the confines of the official safety net. They will argue that they themselves and intelligent regulators and supervisors, armed with recent experience, can maintain the needed surveillance, foresee the dangers and manage the risks.'b'In contrast, I tell you that is no substitute for structural change, the point the president himself has set out so strongly.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve been there \xe2\x80\x94 as regulator, as central banker, as commercial bank official and director \xe2\x80\x94 for almost 60 years. I have observed how memories dim. Individuals change. Institutional and political pressures to \xe2\x80\x9clay off\xe2\x80\x9d tough regulation will remain \xe2\x80\x94 most notably in the fair weather that inevitably precedes the storm.'b'The implication is clear. We need to face up to needed structural changes, and place them into law. To do less will simply mean ultimate failure \xe2\x80\x94 failure to accept responsibility for learning from the lessons of the past and anticipating the needs of the future.'b'WASHINGTON'b'It began as a bit of partisan gamesmanship and ended, surprisingly, as illuminating political theater.'b'White House advisers thought that if they asked that cameras and reporters be allowed in for the usually closed Q. and A. with the president at the annual retreat of House Republicans, the Republicans might say no and look obstructionist.'b'But the Republicans realized what the White House was up to, got irritated and opened up the exchange in Baltimore to show they weren\xe2\x80\x99t scared of the smart, facile and newly warmblooded Barack Obama.'b'And during the next hour and a half, our government did not look quite so lame.'b'Obama is always at his best when his back is against the wall, and he is perversely content when he has the challenge of the lion\xe2\x80\x99s den.'b'He may lapse back into his Camus coma at any moment. But on Friday he dropped the diffident debutante act and offered, as he did at the State of the Union, some welcome gumption.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, halfway through his sparring session with Republicans, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m having fun.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When he was running for president, John McCain said that if he won, he would regularly take questions in the peppering style of the British prime minister in the House of Commons.'b'But it was Obama who ended up doing just such a Ping-Pong session, standing in a hotel ballroom and giving as good he got, to-ing and fro-ing in a far more vivid way than in the presidential debates.'b'The president chided his audience for casting his health care plan as a \xe2\x80\x9cBolshevik plot\xe2\x80\x9d and for telling folks back home that he\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdoing all kinds of crazy stuff that\xe2\x80\x99s going to destroy America.\xe2\x80\x9d But Obama also acknowledged that the Republicans have some good ideas, and that, as it turned out, was what they yearned to hear.'b'In the end, the Republicans may well go back to being inflexibly inflexible with this president, but for a moment in time, each side realized that the other side had something to say. It was, as The Times\xe2\x80\x99s reporters Peter Baker and Carl Hulse called it, a televised marriage-therapy session \xe2\x80\x9cas each side vented grievances pent up after a year of partisan gridlock.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Utah Republican Jason Chaffetz picked up on the president\xe2\x80\x99s line in the State of the Union about \xe2\x80\x9ca deficit of trust.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t create this mess, but we are here to help clean it up,\xe2\x80\x9d the freshman member said, before ticking off a litany of things that have soured many Americans on the president who came in trailing fairy dust.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you stood up before the American people multiple times and said you would broadcast the health care debates on C-Span, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'And another good one: \xe2\x80\x9cYou said you weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to allow lobbyists in the senior-most positions within your administration, and yet you did.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And another: \xe2\x80\x9cYou said you\xe2\x80\x99d go line by line through the health care bill. And there were six of us, including Dr. Phil Roe, who sent you a letter and said we would like to take you up on that offer. ... We never got a call.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And this rousing finale: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd when you said in the House of Representatives that you were going to tackle earmarks and in fact you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to have any earmarks in any of your bills, I jumped out of my seat and applauded you.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But that was another disappointment.'b'Obama hedged on a technicality on the health care question, noting that \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelmingly the majority of it actually was on C-Span because it was taking place in Congressional hearings in which you guys were participating.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When Peter Roskam of Illinois complained that they\xe2\x80\x99d been \xe2\x80\x9cstiff-armed\xe2\x80\x9d by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the president promised to bring the Republican and Democratic House leadership together for more play dates.'b'In a way, it was the sort of civic affairs master class that this college-bowl president had wanted from the beginning, before it began to look like W., Cheney and Rove had truly smashed bipartisanship.'b'But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to give Jeb Hensarling a smack-down when the rabid ideologue from Texas asked if the president\xe2\x80\x99s new budget, \xe2\x80\x9clike your old budget,\xe2\x80\x9d would \xe2\x80\x9ctriple the national debt.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Obama crisply told \xe2\x80\x9cJim,\xe2\x80\x9d inadvertently (perhaps) mixing up Jeb\xe2\x80\x99s name, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to have the kind of bipartisan work that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do, because the whole question was structured as a talking point for running a campaign.\xe2\x80\x9d Then the president offered a quick math lesson on what Republicans never admit: that it was W. and the Republican Congress who ran up much of our $12 trillion debt and left us pawning our family jewels to the Chinese.'b'Obama\xe2\x80\x99s advisers must wish they could do this every week for the cameras. It was a lot more elucidating than Joe Wilson shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cYou lie!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'KALEHE, Congo'b'Sometimes I wish eastern Congo could suffer an earthquake or a tsunami, so that it might finally get the attention it needs. The barbaric civil war being waged here is the most lethal conflict since World War II and has claimed at least 30 times as many lives as the Haiti earthquake.'b'Yet no humanitarian crisis generates so little attention per million corpses, or such a pathetic international response.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m here in the lovely, lush and threatening hills west of Lake Kivu, where militias rape, mutilate and kill civilians with a savagery that is almost incomprehensible. I\xe2\x80\x99m talking to a 9-year-old girl, Chance Tombola, an orphan whose eyes are luminous with fear.'b'For Chance, the war arrived one evening last May when armed soldiers from an extremist Hutu militia  \xe2\x80\x94 remnants of those who committed the Rwandan genocide  \xe2\x80\x94 burst into her home. They killed her parents in front of her. Chance ran away, but the soldiers seized her two sisters, ages 6 and 12, and carried them away into the forest, presumably to be turned into \xe2\x80\x9cwives\xe2\x80\x9d of soldiers. No one has seen Chance\xe2\x80\x99s sisters since.'b'Chance moved in with her aunt and uncle and their two teenage daughters. Two months later, the same militia invaded the aunt\xe2\x80\x99s house and held everyone at gunpoint. Chance says she recognized some of the soldiers as the same ones who had killed her parents.'b'This time, no one could escape. The soldiers first shot her uncle, and then, as the terrified family members sobbed, they pulled out a large knife.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey sliced his belly so that the intestines fell out,\xe2\x80\x9d said his widow, Jeanne Birengenyi, 34, Chance\xe2\x80\x99s aunt. \xe2\x80\x9cThen they cut his heart out and showed it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d The soldiers continued to mutilate the body, while others began to rape Jeanne.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne takes a leg, one takes the other leg,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeanne said dully. \xe2\x80\x9cOthers grab the arms while one just starts raping. They don\xe2\x80\x99t care if children are watching.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Chance added softly: \xe2\x80\x9cThere were six who raped her. One raped me, too.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The soldiers left Jeanne and Chance, tightly tied up, and marched off into the forest with Jeanne\xe2\x80\x99s two daughters as prisoners. One daughter is 14, the other 16, and they have not been heard from since.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey kill, they rape, burn houses and take people\xe2\x80\x99s belongings,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeanne said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen they come with their guns, it\xe2\x80\x99s as if they have a project to eliminate the local population.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A 'b'peer-reviewed study'b' found that 5.4 million people had already died in this war as of April 2007, and hundreds of thousands more have died as the situation has deteriorated since then. A catastrophically planned military offensive last year, backed by the governments of Congo and Rwanda as well as the United Nations force here, made some headway against Hutu militias but also led to increased predation on civilians from all sides.'b''b'Human Rights Watch estimates'b' that for every Hutu fighter sent back to Rwanda last year, at least seven women were raped and 900 people forced to flee for their lives. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom a human rights perspective, the operation has been catastrophic,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Philip Alston, a senior United Nations investigator.'b'This is a pointless war  \xe2\x80\x94 now a dozen years old \xe2\x80\x94 driven by warlords, greed for minerals, ethnic tensions and complete impunity. While there is plenty of fault to go around, Rwanda has long played 'b'a particularly troubling role'b' in many ways, including support for one of the militias. Rwanda\xe2\x80\x99s government is dazzlingly successful at home, but next door in Congo, it appears complicit in war crimes.'b'Jeanne and Chance contracted sexually transmitted diseases. Like other survivors in areas that are accessible, they receive help from the International Rescue Committee, but Chance still suffers pain when she urinates.'b'Counselors say that most raped women are rejected by their husbands, and raped girls like Chance have difficulty marrying. In an area west of Lake Kivu where attacks are continuing, I met Saleh Bulondo, a newly homeless young man who was educated and spoke a little English. I asked him if he would still marry his girlfriend if she were raped.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNever,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will abandon her.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A girl here normally fetches a bride price (a reverse dowry, paid by the husband\xe2\x80\x99s family) when she marries. A village chief told me that a typical price would be 20 goats \xe2\x80\x94 but if the girl has been raped, two goats. At most.'b'Thus it takes astonishing courage for Jeanne and Chance to tell their stories (including in a video posted with the on-line version of this column). I\xe2\x80\x99ll be reporting more from eastern Congo in the coming days, hoping that the fortitude of survivors like them can inspire world leaders to step forward to stop this slaughter. It\xe2\x80\x99s time to show the same compassion toward Congo that we have toward Haiti.'b'Davos, Switzerland'b'As a political barometer, the Davos World Economic Forum usually offers up some revealing indicators of the global mood, and this year is no exception. I heard of a phrase being bandied about here by non-Americans  \xe2\x80\x94 about the United States \xe2\x80\x94 that I can honestly say I\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard before: \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical instability.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPolitical instability\xe2\x80\x9d was a phrase normally reserved for countries like Russia or Iran or Honduras. But now, an American businessman here remarked to me, \xe2\x80\x9cpeople ask me about \xe2\x80\x98political instability\xe2\x80\x99 in the U.S. We\xe2\x80\x99ve become unpredictable to the world.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mind you, people at international conferences love to criticize America, poke fun at America and complain about America. It is the only global sport more popular than soccer. But in the past, it was always done knowing that America was this global bedrock that could always be counted upon to lead. But this year is different. This year, Asians and Europeans, in particular, pull you aside and ask you some version of: \xe2\x80\x9cTell me, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in your country?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re making people nervous.'b'Banks, multinationals and hedge funds often hire foreign policy experts to do \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical risk analysis\xe2\x80\x9d before they invest in places like, say, Kazakhstan or Argentina. They may soon have to add the United States to their watch lists.'b'You can understand why foreigners are uneasy. They look at America and see a president elected by a solid majority, coming into office riding a wave of optimism, controlling both the House and the Senate. Yet, a year later, he can\xe2\x80\x99t win passage of his top legislative priority: health care.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOur two-party political system is broken just when everything needs major repair, not minor repair,\xe2\x80\x9d said K.R. Sridhar, the founder of Bloom Energy, a fuel cell company in Silicon Valley, who is attending the forum. \xe2\x80\x9cI am talking about health care, infrastructure, education, energy. We are the ones who need a Marshall Plan now.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Indeed, speaking of phrases I\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard here before, another goes like this: \xe2\x80\x9cIs the \xe2\x80\x98Beijing Consensus\xe2\x80\x99 replacing the \xe2\x80\x98Washington Consensus?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Washington Consensus is a term coined after the cold war for the free-market, pro-trade and globalization policies promoted by America. As Katrin Bennhold reported in The International Herald Tribune this week, developing countries everywhere are looking \xe2\x80\x9cfor a recipe for faster growth and greater stability than that offered by the now tattered \xe2\x80\x98Washington Consensus\xe2\x80\x99 of open markets, floating currencies and free elections.\xe2\x80\x9d And as they do, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is growing talk about a \xe2\x80\x98Beijing Consensus.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Beijing Consensus, says Bennhold, is a \xe2\x80\x9cConfucian-Communist-Capitalist\xe2\x80\x9d hybrid under the umbrella of a one-party state, with a lot of government guidance, strictly controlled capital markets and an authoritarian decision-making process that is capable of making tough choices and long-term investments, without having to heed daily public polls.'b'Personally, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give up on the Washington Consensus so fast. The reason it is ailing is not because of its principles promoting economic openness and trade, many of which China is practicing better than we are lately. It is failing more because of, well, Washington.'b'It was hard to read President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s eloquent State of the Union address and not feel torn between his vision for the coming years and the awareness that the forces of inertia and special interests blocking him \xe2\x80\x94 not to mention the whole Republican Party  \xe2\x80\x94 make the chances of his implementing that vision highly unlikely. That is the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cstuck.\xe2\x80\x9d And right now we are stuck.'b'The sad and frustrating thing is, we are so close to being unstuck. If there were just six or eight Republican senators \xe2\x80\x94 a few more Judd Greggs and Lindsey Grahams \xe2\x80\x94 ready to meet Obama somewhere in the middle on deficit reduction, energy, health care and banking reform, I believe that in the wake of the Massachusetts wake-up call the president would indeed meet them in that middle ground to forge not just incremental compromises, but substantial ones on these key issues. But so far, the Republicans are having a good year politically by just being the Party of No.'b'It is a shame because here we are as a country scrounging around for a few billion more dollars of stimulus to help our unemployed and small businesses  \xe2\x80\x94  when the biggest stimulus of all is hiding in plain sight. And that is ending our political paralysis and the pall of uncertainty it is casting over everything from the cost of my health care to the cost of my energy to the way our biggest banks can do business.'b'If the two parties could get together and remove the clouds of uncertainty over those issues, remove the growing sense that our country is politically paralyzed, you would not need another dime of stimulus money. Investment and lending would take off on their own. If, however, the two parties continue with their duel-to-the-death paralysis, no amount of stimulus will give us the sustained growth and employment we need.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGame Change,\xe2\x80\x9d the gossipy 'b'reconstruction'b' of the 2008 presidential election that opens today atop The New York Times 'b'nonfiction best-seller list'b', is filled with racy anecdotes about dysfunctional marriages and political back-stabbing. What it does not have are identifiable sources.'b'The book is mostly written in an omniscient, novelistic voice, purporting at times to be inside the heads of players and recreating scenes and dialogue that the authors could not have witnessed. There is none of that clunky \xe2\x80\x9cEdwards recalled in an interview,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9caccording to three independent sources\xe2\x80\x9d stuff \xe2\x80\x94 the sort of language that slows down the narrative but that most news organizations insist on for credibility.'b'So, even as it caused a stir \xe2\x80\x94 Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, 'b'having to apologize'b' for remarks about Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s accent and skin tone \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cGame Change\xe2\x80\x9d posed an intriguing dilemma for The Times: How do you deal with a talker of a book reported in a way that the paper\xe2\x80\x99s own standards do not permit?'b'If you repeat some of the more salacious parts, like the supposed details of a fight between John and Elizabeth Edwards in an airport parking lot, are you just letting through the backdoor what you would never allow through the front? If you don\xe2\x80\x99t, are you just burying your head in the sand while readers get the juicy stuff elsewhere?'b'The authors, 'b'John Heilemann'b' and 'b'Mark Halperin'b', two veteran political journalists, have pushed the envelope on the insider story, a genre developed most notably by 'b'Bob Woodward'b'. But while \xe2\x80\x9c'b'State of Denial'b',\xe2\x80\x9d the third volume of Woodward\xe2\x80\x99s examination of the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s war efforts,  contained 29 pages of source notes, Heilemann and Halperin merely say in their book that they conducted more than 300 interviews with more than 200 people and tried to talk with everyone they named. Some declined, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t say who.'b'And they do not say who said what: all the interviews were conducted on deep background, meaning candidates and junior staffers alike were granted cover without being identified in any way.'b'The bottom-line message: trust us. In the particularly vicious context of presidential campaign politics, where chaos reigns and nearly everyone seems to have a score to settle, this is asking a lot.'b'The Times has treated \xe2\x80\x9cGame Change\xe2\x80\x9d as news, but carefully: 'b'a review'b' in the daily paper that raised the sourcing issues; 'b'a Sunday review'b'; coverage of Reid\xe2\x80\x99s apology and 'b'Republican attempts'b' to capitalize on it; 'b'an essay'b' on the death of loyalty among political staffers; 'b'and another'b' on the damage to the image of Elizabeth Edwards, portrayed in the book as \xe2\x80\x9can abusive, intrusive, paranoid, condescending crazywoman.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'None of the articles repeated the most titillating material. 'b'Jill Abramson'b', the managing editor for news, said a review had to give a sense of what a book was about. But she said it was the job of editors to decide if something was newsworthy enough to warrant a separate article and, if so, \xe2\x80\x9cto go back and do our own reporting.\xe2\x80\x9d The Times chose not to, focusing articles about Reid\xe2\x80\x99s apology, for example, on the quotes he was acknowledging and the political fallout.'b''b'Judith Warner'b', who wrote the Style section column about Elizabeth Edwards, said she did not try to verify what the book said because she was examining the issue of image. It\xe2\x80\x99s too bad she did not try, because on the same day her column appeared, former aides to Edwards 'b'told Politico'b', on the record, that the book\xe2\x80\x99s portrayal was accurate but incomplete, failing to capture her warmer side.'b'Reid\xe2\x80\x99s apology gave \xe2\x80\x9cGame Change\xe2\x80\x9d an aura of credibility from the start, and silence from other major figures helped. But, Abramson said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think the lack of denials tells you all that much.\xe2\x80\x9d Some of the players, she said, may figure that denying something only serves to give it longer legs.'b'I was curious about one incident involving 'b'Maureen Dowd'b', the star Times Op-Ed columnist, who in early 2007 quoted 'b'David Geffen'b', the Hollywood mogul, disowning Bill and Hillary Clinton. Geffen, who raised millions for Bill Clinton and then became disenchanted, said of both Clintons, \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody in politics lies, but they do it with such ease, it\xe2\x80\x99s troubling.\xe2\x80\x9d The column had an enormous impact at the time.'b'According to \xe2\x80\x9cGame Change,\xe2\x80\x9d Dowd persuaded Geffen to give her an interview by telling him that, when it was over, if he did not want her to use it, she would not. She read 'b'the finished column'b' to Geffen, the book said, warned him it would be explosive and asked if he wanted to take back anything.  If true, Dowd would, in effect, have surrendered editorial control to her source, an unacceptable situation.'b'The book also implied that Dowd attended a private $2,300-per-person Obama fund-raiser the following night.  Afterward, it said,  she was among a small group of 35 who \xe2\x80\x9crepaired to Geffen\xe2\x80\x99s mansion\xe2\x80\x9d  for a dinner for the Obamas.'b'Dowd said it didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen that way. \xe2\x80\x9cI never gave David Geffen veto power over the column,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. She said she did not read the column to him, warn him that it would be explosive or ask if he wanted to take back his words, and she did not attend the Hollywood fund-raising event at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. She was a guest at the dinner later, she said, although the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s camp sought to have her barred.'b'Dowd said that, as is often her practice, she told Geffen which quotes she was using and checked them for accuracy and context. He had been unsure whether he wanted to say some of the things he told her but agreed to all of it, she said.'b'Geffen, who did not want to get embroiled in a controversy among journalists, would only say: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone imagines Maureen would allow anyone to edit her column. I certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Dowd said the authors did not interview her for the book but that Halperin called at some point to \xe2\x80\x9ccheck a few \xe2\x80\x94 but not all \xe2\x80\x94 of the details.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'So, what is a person to believe: someone speaking on the record, or the word of \xe2\x80\x94 whom? And what does it say about other parts of \xe2\x80\x9cGame Change?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Halperin and Heilemann would not answer specific questions about the discrepancies in the accounts. \xe2\x80\x9cWe stand by everything that\xe2\x80\x99s in the book,\xe2\x80\x9d Halperin said. That response, he said,  was \xe2\x80\x9c a serious, considered answer\xe2\x80\x9d made necessary by promises to sources. While refusing to confirm that anyone had called Dowd, Heilemann said all the fact-checking was done while the book was still being written and while changes could be made.'b'Jacob Heilbrunn, who wrote the review for the Sunday Times, said he did not even mention the sourcing issue because this type of tell-all book has become so established. \xe2\x80\x9cI think they would have been crippled if they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t taken the approach they did,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have a culture here in Washington, they won\xe2\x80\x99t tell you if they had a cup of coffee or not unless they go on background.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That is true, and journalists for The Times operate in the same culture, sometimes giving in to it more than I think they should. But with \xe2\x80\x9cGame Change,\xe2\x80\x9d the paper was right to avoid relying on someone else\xe2\x80\x99s anonymous sources. Dowd could tell you.'b'As the candidate of hope and change, President Obama has doubtless spent some private time around his first anniversary in office wondering whether he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been more specific about the kind of change he\xe2\x80\x99d hoped for. If a single year has so transformed his political fortunes, imagine what cannot be imagined in the next three ahead.'b'If it\xe2\x80\x99s any comfort, the phenomenon isn\xe2\x80\x99t new to the American presidency. To quote the favorite political philosopher of the president I served, it\xe2\x80\x99s d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu all over again. Travel back to January 1990, as President George Bush \xe2\x80\x94 no \xe2\x80\x9cH. W.\xe2\x80\x9d needed back then \xe2\x80\x94 prepared for his first State of the Union address. The invasion of Panama, which returned democracy to that nation by way of the barrel speakers of a boom-box, had officially ended after 23 days. The Revolutions of 1989 across Europe \xe2\x80\x94 in the speech, the president told of a Czech Everyman reciting in accented English the words of the Declaration of Independence \xe2\x80\x94 served to underscore the president\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the State of our Union was strong.'b'And why not: The \xe2\x80\x9cIn-Box President,\xe2\x80\x9d as that month\xe2\x80\x99s Atlantic Monthly called him, was sailing along with a 63 percent approval rating \xe2\x80\x94 a number few in the White House uttered aloud, and never in the presence of the president. As we rehearsed the speech in the White House Family Theater, our focus was on how to \xe2\x80\x9cbolt in the rabbit\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 as in what the magician produces from his hat \xe2\x80\x94 which was the droll code name coined by the national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft,   for the critical, close-hold section of the speech that dealt with reducing our conventional forces in Europe.'b'The other major issue was whether to add a reference near the close of the speech to the president\xe2\x80\x99s newest grandchild. In a podium break, the famously reticent president, almost allergic to the use of the pronoun \xe2\x80\x9cI,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cmaybe it\xe2\x80\x99s O.K. \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s just a grandfather talking.\xe2\x80\x9d The phrase clicked, and it was added to the teleprompter text. Both the grandson and the arms control treaty would receive more attention from the president than any of the domestic policy initiatives contained in his speech.'b'What we didn\xe2\x80\x99t see then from the high ground of Year One were any of the signal events of Year Two. The ill-fated deficit summit meeting at Andrews Air Force Base \xe2\x80\x94 a closed-door exercise that yielded the too-clever-by-180-I.Q.-points \xe2\x80\x9ctax revenue enhancements\xe2\x80\x9d as a substitute for the president\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cread my lips\xe2\x80\x9d no-new-taxes pledge \xe2\x80\x94 was three months away. In six months, Saddam Hussein would roll tanks into Kuwait. In eight months, we would hit what economists would later pinpoint as the beginning of a recession, at roughly the time the White House national security team was focused on reuniting East and West Germany. Working in the White House was a daily lesson in politics and policy, and the critical difference between the two.'b'Seen through the lens of 20 years\xe2\x80\x99 time, what\xe2\x80\x99s telling now is the  capriciousness of what we took to be the issues that would define a presidency. For more than half a century, no man or woman living has had as much power to shape the world as an American president. And yet the world retains an even greater power to challenge, confound and surprise.  \xe2\x80\x94 'b'DANIEL McGROARTY, speechwriter and special assistant to President George H. W. Bush 'b''b'We sympathized with the concerns about security and inconvenience raised by the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s plan to try Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the self-described 9/11 mastermind, at a federal courthouse in downtown Manhattan,  a short walk from ground zero.'b'But caving in to political pressure and agreeing to move the trial, as The Times reported the Obama administration has decided to do, was the wrong move. New York was the right place for this trial. This is where the attack occurred, and New Yorkers should have been proud to see justice done here. The United States District Court in Manhattan has a long, successful record of trying terrorists, including the ones responsible for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.'b'President Obama was right to move Mr. Mohammed and four other high-profile terrorism suspects out of the jurisdiction of military tribunals. President George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s decision to hold prisoners outside the law and then attempt to try them in rigged military courts was legally wrong, and hugely damaging to American values and this country\xe2\x80\x99s global image.'b'Mayor Michael Bloomberg first supported the president\xe2\x80\x99s decision to hold the trial in New York, but reversed field after looking at the costs of what could be a very long process. Local business leaders protested, as did politicians with a variety of motives \xe2\x80\x94 none really sound and some profoundly cynical.'b'Mr. Obama should have worked with the mayor to develop a security plan, one that limited local disruption. The federal government should have paid any additional cost. It will have to do that wherever the trial is held.'b'The trial must remain within the federal court system. Mr. Obama should not put it in a makeshift court on a military base and definitely should not give in to demands from the right to return Mr. Mohammed (and the four other prisoners) to the tribunals.'b'Trying mass murderers in a criminal court is not \xe2\x80\x9csoft on terrorism.\xe2\x80\x9d The federal courts have tried, convicted and imprisoned many terrorists. The tribunals have not held a single trial, and may never have one that Americans can be proud of.'b'For some Republicans, this is really about keeping Guant\xc3\xa1namo open. Others just want to block whatever Mr. Obama wants. Representative Peter King, Republican of New York, has a particularly insidious bill that would obstruct justice by stopping the government from spending money on federal court trials for terrorists.'b'Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, warned that holding the trial in New York \xe2\x80\x9cwould only heighten media and public attention.\xe2\x80\x9d That one baffled us. This trial would draw attention if it were held atop Pikes Peak. And isn\xe2\x80\x99t the idea of a public trial a bedrock principle of American justice?'b'Holding the trial in New York would be inconvenient. Democracy makes demands on its citizens. It is inconvenient to serve on a jury, too. This was just not-in-my-backyard-ism. Nearly 10 years after 9/11, it is sad if this country cannot freely conduct its business in Lower Manhattan.'b'IN April 1969, three months after his inauguration, President Richard Nixon hosted a party at the White House to celebrate Duke Ellington\xe2\x80\x99s 70th birthday and award the Duke the Medal of Freedom. Great American jazz figures were there. Musicians played Ellington songs arranged by Gerry Mulligan. Joe Williams and Mary Mayo sang. Ellington danced with Rose Mary Woods. After dinner, the president had a nightcap with the pianist Earl Hines.'b'It was in many other ways a very good year for President Nixon. He called to congratulate the Apollo 11 astronauts on their moon landing. He initiated a huge expansion of the National Endowment for the Arts and began the processes that led to the desegregation of public schools in the South and a historic reform of the government\xe2\x80\x99s policy toward American Indians. He announced the \xe2\x80\x9cNixon doctrine,\xe2\x80\x9d providing aid \xe2\x80\x94 but not military forces \xe2\x80\x94 to our anticommunist Asian allies. He signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.'b'In 1969 Nixon also committed the United States to continuing its defense of South Vietnam. The Vietnam War had already made a political casualty of President Lyndon Johnson and fatally crippled Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s vice president, Hubert Humphrey, as a presidential candidate. Yet to Nixon and his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, leaving Vietnam meant losing the chance to apply pressure to the Soviet Union through China. In November 1969, toward the end of his first year in office, Nixon 'b'announced'b' a policy of \xe2\x80\x9cVietnamization\xe2\x80\x9d and the gradual withdrawal of American troops. At the end of the year, he told me he thought that we had \xe2\x80\x9cweathered the worst\xe2\x80\x9d of the Vietnam conflict and that if we could \xe2\x80\x9cjust hold on,\xe2\x80\x9d time would now work on our side.'b'But it was too late. A strike by Harvard students had erupted in the spring; the Vietnam Moratorium march had descended on Washington in October. The war had already begun to engulf Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s presidency just as it had destroyed Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s. What began in 1969 continued inexorably until Nixon was forced to resign in 1974. Years later, Nixon reflected that \xe2\x80\x9cif I underestimated the willingness of the North Vietnamese to hang on and resist a negotiated settlement ... they also underestimated my willingness to hold on despite the domestic and international pressures that would be ranged against me.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It may be that a president with fewer personal demons, without such a large capacity for resentment, could have survived the storm. As I look back over an increasing span of years, I am not sure I think so. 'b'\xe2\x80\x94 LEONARD GARMENT, White House counsel for President Richard Nixon'b''b'IN his first State of the Union speech, on Jan. 15, 1975, President Gerald R. Ford told Congress and the American people in his plain-spoken manner: \xe2\x80\x9cI must say to you that the State of the Union is not good.\xe2\x80\x9d And then he listed the particulars: The economy was suffering from stagflation \xe2\x80\x94 simultaneous high inflation and economic recession. Unemployment was rising toward 8 percent. There was an energy shortage and high oil prices because of an embargo on petroleum shipments by Arab nations. The federal budget deficit was approaching $50 billion and the national debt $500 billion \xe2\x80\x94 big money in those days. As we prepared the speech \xe2\x80\x94 the first draft wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even completed until around 3:30 a.m. on the day of the address \xe2\x80\x94 Ford asked Roy Ash, director of the Office of Management and Budget, if he had any good economic news to include. Ash replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll take about four seconds.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Nonetheless, Ford offered a number of specific proposals in his speech, some of which may sound familiar to those who listened to President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s address on Wednesday: capping the federal budget at $300 billion; cutting taxes by giving individuals a rebate of up to $1,000 and by giving industries a $4 billion reward for creating new jobs; imposing new taxes on petroleum products to discourage use and offering new incentives to encourage more domestic production as well as development of nuclear and solar energy.'b'Ford ended his State of the Union speech by declaring, \xe2\x80\x9cIn partnership with the American people, we will achieve these objectives.\xe2\x80\x9d However, Ford\xe2\x80\x99s ability to achieve the goals \xe2\x80\x94 as well as his relationship with Congress, the press corps and the American people \xe2\x80\x94 had been seriously undermined by the pardon of his disgraced predecessor, Richard Nixon, four months earlier. When Nixon resigned, Ford seemed to be a breath of fresh air after the miasma of Watergate \xe2\x80\x94 he was a regular guy who could laugh at his own foibles, down-to-earth, self-confident, liked by both Democrats and Republicans in Congress.'b'All that hope and good will were blown away by the pardon, and by subsequent rumors (never substantiated) of some kind of deal between Ford and Nixon. It was in that atmosphere of anger and disillusionment that Ford delivered his first State of the Union speech. Only decades later was Ford\xe2\x80\x99s presidency \xe2\x80\x94 and the pardon \xe2\x80\x94 reappraised and his reputation restored. 'b' \xe2\x80\x94 RONALD NESSEN, press secretary for President Gerald Ford'b''b'THINGS were tough as Jimmy Carter prepared for his 1978 State of the Union address, one year into his term. But they seemed, strangely, hopeful. The president\xe2\x80\x99s big domestic initiative that year was a national energy policy. The gas-station lines and first-ever spike in fuel prices in the mid-1970s made this a genuine emergency. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet gotten the whole plan through, but the previous summer he had signed legislation creating the Department of Energy and begun imposing standards that, even after he was gone, kept improving the fuel efficiency of American cars, buildings and factories.'b'His big foreign policy initiative was the Panama Canal treaty, to restore Panama\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty over the Canal Zone with safeguards for the canal\xe2\x80\x99s operation. Although the opponents were fierce, employing what we would now call \xe2\x80\x9ctea party\xe2\x80\x9d tactics, they were a minority. Mr. Carter had John Wayne and other tough guys to speak on the treaty\xe2\x80\x99s behalf \xe2\x80\x94 not to mention  61 Democratic votes in the Senate and a more than 2-to-1 Democratic majority under  Tip O\xe2\x80\x99Neill in the House.'b'Just before the speech, the president had traveled across four continents in a marathon world tour. Yes, there were glitches, like a toast in Tehran praising the soon-to-be-deposed shah of Iran as \xe2\x80\x9can island of stability\xe2\x80\x9d in a troubled area of the world. (I remember \xe2\x80\x94 I wrote it!) But I also know firsthand that President Carter was warmly and admiringly received from India to Brazil for his emphasis on a new foreign policy built on traditional American respect for human rights.'b'Inflation was going down. Job creation was going up. So as time came to put the speech together, everyone involved dared think about what else the administration could do, after such a good start. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is all across our land a growing sense of peace and a sense of common purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d  Mr. Carter said in his address \xe2\x80\x94 a sentence I cannot remember writing and in retrospect can hardly believe was uttered at all. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the first time in a generation we are not haunted by a major international crisis\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore have \xe2\x80\x9ca rare and precious opportunity to address persistent problems\xe2\x80\x9d that otherwise would just get worse. And so he laid out his bright plans, which included making government activities more transparent and reducing the role of lobbyists.'b'One year tells us something about a presidency and its capacities. But a lot can change after that. 'b'\xe2\x80\x94'b' 'b'JAMES FALLOWS, chief speechwriter for President Jimmy Carter'b''b'Political platforms are usually written for election campaign purposes, then quickly scrapped after a presidential election. But the 1980 Republican platform bore a simple five-word title: \xe2\x80\x9cFamily, Neighborhood, Work, Peace, Freedom,\xe2\x80\x9d and was planned and written with the purpose of creating an agenda for a Reagan administration on Day One, Jan. 20, 1981. My signal memory of Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s first year in office is that we were actually able to stick to the plan that he insisted we put in place.'b'Coupled with the basic policy framework, Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s was one of the most carefully planned presidential transitions in modern political history, replete with teams of \xe2\x80\x9cReaganauts\xe2\x80\x9d dispatched to each department and agency in the days following the election. Staffing lists were compiled, and presidential and subcabinet appointments were made swiftly, background and vetting checks completed and requisite Senate hearings scheduled.'b'The plan from the outset was to put in place the Reagan economic program as the major priority and foundation for every major initiative, domestic and foreign. Tax cuts were high on the president\xe2\x80\x99s agenda, and work began, quietly and in the background for the most part, on a huge \xe2\x80\x9cget well\xe2\x80\x9d program for the nation\xe2\x80\x99s defenses.'b'While Reagan received an immediate boost with the Inauguration Day release of the American hostages in Iran, it\xe2\x80\x99s doubtful that the incident altered his approach. In his first press conference he declared that the Soviets \xe2\x80\x9creserve the right to lie and cheat\xe2\x80\x9d to achieve their goals, setting some teeth on edge. He knew precisely what he wanted to say and made a point not to reveal it to staff in two preparatory sessions.'b'There were, of course, unexpected moments that first year: Alexander Haig\xe2\x80\x99s bizarre behavior as secretary of state; David Stockman\xe2\x80\x99s effort, as budget director, to undercut the president\xe2\x80\x99s budget; and, of course, the assassination attempt outside the Washington Hilton in March. Remarkably, Reagan recovered from all these.'b'One other thing stands out: Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s ability to get along with Democrats, something he had shown he could do as governor of California. Although the House of Representatives was controlled by Democrats, the president managed to pass his tax reduction package. He also found a way, through one-on-one sessions with senatorial opponents of both parties, to gain Congressional approval of the sale of Awacs radar planes to Saudi Arabia. By 1991, the deployed aircraft were a decisive military asset in the Persian Gulf war.'b'As Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s debut year came to a close, I remember thinking how remarkable it was that he had managed to stay the course. Having watched subsequent presidencies lurch in response to political pressure, I find the president\xe2\x80\x99s first-year feat even more remarkable today. 'b' \xe2\x80\x94 RICHARD V. ALLEN, senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and national security advisor to President Ronald Reagan'b''b'Barack Obama, reeling from the Democratic defeat in the Massachusetts Senate race, isn\xe2\x80\x99t the first president to get an unwelcome anniversary gift a year after taking office. On Jan. 20, 1994, Attorney General Janet Reno announced that, at President Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s request, she had appointed Robert Fiske as special counsel to investigate the Whitewater case. What we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know then was that seven months later, Mr. Fiske would be replaced by Ken Starr, whose investigation would ultimately lead to the president\xe2\x80\x99s impeachment. But what those of us on the Clinton staff were learning fast after 12 tumultuous months on the job was how little control we had over our own unfolding drama. The cockiness of the campaign was giving way to a humility imposed by history.'b'Events large and small \xe2\x80\x94 and so often out of our hands \xe2\x80\x94 could unfurl without warning, or sometimes over time, to upend our day, alter our political fortunes and change the world. In that first year, they often did.'b'Mr. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s first budget went to Congress in June. A plan to invest in jobs and growth, cut wasteful spending and raise taxes on the rich, it passed both houses with nary a vote to spare \xe2\x80\x94 or a single Republican. We celebrated at the time, but victory was short-lived. Eighteen months later, Democrats lost both the House and Senate. Still, the president\xe2\x80\x99s economic strategy proved successful,   fuelling the longest economic expansion in American history.'b'In September, Mr. Clinton presided over the signing of peace accords, and a historic handshake, between Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and Yasir Arafat, the leader of the Palestinian Authority. Even hard-bitten Clinton advisers like Rahm Emanuel, now President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s chief of staff, were moved to tears, and reviews were almost universally positive. But two years later, a deranged opponent of the plan assassinated Rabin, and over time, progress stalled.'b'As the people in the Obama administration look back over the first year, and forward to the future, they should do all they can to move their agenda. But they would be wise to remember that forces more powerful than their best-laid plans will shape their fate. Today\xe2\x80\x99s failure may be tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s success, or vice versa.

We had watched Mr. Bush make the most profound decision a commander in chief can make, committing American lives to battle in Afghanistan. We had witnessed the fall of the Taliban  and worked to calm the panic of anthrax attacks.'b'As President Obama is learning, the first year of a presidency is one in which the rhetoric of campaigning collides with the hard reality of governing. As President Bush took office, the economy was falling into recession; we passed tax cuts to try to stimulate jobs. We had celebrated moments of great achievement: overwhelming bipartisan approval for education reforms. We had wrestled with the  profound  moral ramifications of stem cell research. And we had   experienced the thrills of the presidency: the drama of the first meeting with President Vladimir Putin of Russia; the visit by Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s president, Vicente Fox, which involved a fireworks display so spectacular that Condi Rice joked we could be \xe2\x80\x9ctesting the missile defense system.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'President Obama often seems to suggest that his administration is facing challenges more difficult than others did. He might look back on the first words of President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s first State of the Union address: \xe2\x80\x9cAs we gather tonight, our nation is at war, our economy is in recession and the civilized world faces unprecedented dangers.

But it is important to remember that they are also rare. Patients should not refuse radiation therapy out of safety concerns. It is a proven treatment that can ease pain, control the spread of cancer and, in many cases, cure the disease.'b'The goal of the radiation therapist is to deliver a targeted dose of radiation to the tumor while reducing damage to normal tissue that surrounds it. Thanks to the care provided by registered radiation therapists, millions of Americans are cancer survivors.'b'Unfortunately, 17 states do not require a license to deliver radiation therapy. That is why the American Society of Radiologic Technologists urges Congress to establish national standards for those who perform medical imaging or radiation therapy procedures.

The equipment would be thoroughly vetted and reported on in peer review articles before being accepted and used by the smaller community hospitals.'b'Now the reverse is true. Small community hospitals often far outpace academic medical centers. One example is the proliferation of proton centers run by for-profit companies. Often the staff has limited knowledge and experience with this extraordinarily complex equipment. And new technologies are often assumed by the public to be better, even though there is often little firm clinical data to support that.'b'As we struggle as a country to come to grips with health care costs, this is one area where there is great opportunity for savings. Clinical reviews can prevent the proliferation of needlessly expensive technology.

But well over half of that growth came from large adjustments to business inventories that are unlikely to be repeated on a similar scale in the months to come. As such, they are evidence that the sick economy is recovering, not that it is healthy.'b'Another chunk of growth was due to government stimulus spending, which will wane in 2010. Much of the recent upsurge in business purchases of equipment and software was likely due to a rush to take advantage of an investment tax break before it expired in December.'b'So, what does it take to translate an incipient recovery into a sustained expansion? In a word: jobs. Employment leads to income and to spending. As sales deplete inventories, businesses restock, which creates more jobs and so on in an upward spiral.'b'Unfortunately, with the economy already some 10 million jobs short, there is no job growth on the horizon robust enough to set that upward spiral in motion. And because the economy is already in such a deep hole, a second leg down would mean ever worsening hardship.'b'The House has already passed a bill that is a good starting point for creating jobs. But the Senate is sitting on its version, with Republicans and a handful of Democrats arguing that deficit reduction is more important than jobs. In the medium term, the deficit is a serious problem. But right now there is no way to sustain a recovery unless millions of jobs are created soon \xe2\x80\x94 and the private sector alone cannot do that.'b'In his State of the Union address, President Obama said that he, too, was worried about the deficit. And as a sign of good faith, he committed to cuts in federal discretionary spending starting in the upcoming budget. The Senate can show its good faith now by passing a jobs bill,  ideally this week.'b'A good final bill would combine the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s call for tax credits for hiring and incentives for small-business lending with sound features from the House and Senate versions. It would contain the House\xe2\x80\x99s vital provisions for extending unemployment benefits and providing more aid to states. Without such aid, states will have to make even deeper budget cuts \xe2\x80\x94 laying off large numbers of their own work forces and forcing their private sector contractors to do the same.'b'A final bill should also include provisions from the House and the Senate to create infrastructure jobs and public service jobs. And it should adopt the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s plan to create jobs that foster energy efficiency.'b'Mr. Obama said he wanted a jobs bill on his desk \xe2\x80\x9cwithout delay.\xe2\x80\x9d Getting a good bill passed will be a crucial test of his ability to lead lawmakers, including members of his own party, where America needs them to go.'b'There were predictable howls after the Securities and Exchange Commission told publicly held companies they should warn investors of any potential effects from climate change on their bottom lines. Representative Joe Barton, among the most reliable of the oil, gas and coal industries\xe2\x80\x99 many friends in Congress, complained that the commission\xe2\x80\x99s time would be better spent on \xe2\x80\x9cinvestor protection\xe2\x80\x9d rather than imposing new burdens on corporations and promoting the \xe2\x80\x9csocial agendas\xe2\x80\x9d of environmental groups.'b'Investor protection is exactly what the commission had in mind when it decided, by a 3-to-2 party-line vote, to add global warming to the list of material issues \xe2\x80\x94 plant closing, the sale of assets \xe2\x80\x94 that companies may have to discuss in their financial filings.'b'Mary Schapiro, the chairman, said the commission was not adding new \xe2\x80\x9clegal requirements\xe2\x80\x9d but simply offering guidance to help companies decide when and whether to discuss the potential impact of global warming on their operations and earnings.'b'It makes good sense to us that companies should disclose whether a new law or international treaty limiting greenhouse gas emissions is likely to require new investments or increase operating costs. A climate change law could also help companies that produce renewable fuels or environmentally friendly technologies, like wind turbines. That, too, should trigger disclosure.'b'The commission, which took pains to say that it was not expressing an opinion on whether the world\xe2\x80\x99s climate was changing, has long required companies to reveal financial or legal impacts from other environmental challenges \xe2\x80\x94 potential liabilities under the Superfund law or the Clean Water Act, for instance. It has also been petitioned by investor groups and environmentalists to add climate change to the list of those challenges.'b'At the same time, ordinary stockholders and state insurance regulators have begun expressing increasing alarm about the potential cost of unchecked climate change for American businesses.

After falling ill during a mission to the Philippines, she ignored a recommendation by doctors to abort her fifth child, who became the 2007 Heisman Trophy winner.'b'The National Organization for Women, NARAL Pro-Choice America and other voices for protecting women\xe2\x80\x99s reproductive freedom have called on CBS to yank it.

Others argue that even a mild discussion of such a divisive issue has no place in the marketing extravaganza known as the Super Bowl.'b'The would-be censors are on the wrong track. Instead of trying to silence an opponent, advocates for allowing women to make their own decisions about whether to have a child should be using the Super Bowl spotlight to convey what their movement is all about: protecting the right of women like Pam Tebow to make their private reproductive choices.'b'CBS was right to change its policy of rejecting paid advocacy commercials from groups other than political candidates.

A tax-cut-laden \xe2\x80\x9cstimulus plan\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'endorsed by Jim DeMint'b', the South Carolina senator and Tea Party  hero, \xe2\x80\x9cwould cost more than $3 trillion  \xe2\x80\x94  more than triple the cost of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s stimulus  \xe2\x80\x94  over the next decade,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'in the estimate of Jonathan Chait of The New Republic'b'.'b'On State of the Union day, the Republican National Committee gathered at its winter meeting at Waikiki Beach 'b'to battle over a measure'b' that would deny campaign funds to candidates who didn\xe2\x80\x99t pass a Tea Party ideological purity test. Back in Washington, other party thinkers trotted out some more brilliant ideas. Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin congressman hailed as the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 new intellectual hope, laid out a lengthy \xe2\x80\x9cG.O.P. Road Map for America\xe2\x80\x99s Future\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'on The Wall Street Journal op-ed page'b' that proposed cutting taxes (disproportionately for the wealthy) and privatizing Medicare and Social Security but devoted no bullet point to creating jobs for Americans in urgent need. On the Hill that morning, 'b'Michele Bachmann of Minnesota led House colleagues'b' in signing a \xe2\x80\x9cDeclaration of Health Care Independence\xe2\x80\x9d to complement a bill that would let Americans \xe2\x80\x9cpurchase insurance with their own tax-free money.\xe2\x80\x9d Gee, why did no else think of that ingenious fix for a health care system that leaves 'b'46.3 million uninsured'b' and whose runaway costs are 'b'on track to eat up one-fifth of the American economy'b'?'b'It was a heartening breakthrough when Obama dismissed such idiocies repeatedly in his televised meeting 'b'with House Republicans on Friday.'b' He mocked G.O.P. legislative snake oil that promises to lower all medical costs and \xe2\x80\x9cwon\xe2\x80\x99t cost anybody anything.\xe2\x80\x9d He must keep this up \xe2\x80\x94 and be equally tough on the slackers in his own party who stall his agenda. And he must be less foggy on the specifics of what that agenda is. Though on Wednesday night 'b'he asked Congress'b' to \xe2\x80\x9ctake another look\xe2\x80\x9d at the health care bill, even now it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear what he believes that bill\xe2\x80\x99s bedrock provisions should be. He also said he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sign any financial regulatory bill that \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not meet the test of real reform,\xe2\x80\x9d yet tentatively praised a House bill compromised by a banking lobby that is in bed with Democrats and Republicans alike. The Senate, of course, has yet to produce any financial reform bill.'b'Americans like Obama far more than they like any Congressional leader. They might even like more of his policies if he spelled them out. But none of that matters if no Democrat fears him enough to do any of his bidding and no Republican believes there\xe2\x80\x99s any price to be paid for always saying no.'b'A year in, we have learned that all the conciliatory rhetoric won\xe2\x80\x99t cut it. But a president with a big megaphone and large legislative majorities has more powerful strings to pull, no matter what happened in one special election in Massachusetts. If he can\xe2\x80\x99t get a working government, at least he can shake things up in November.'b'Just look at how a sharp public slap provoked Justice Alito, threw a spotlight on the court\xe2\x80\x99s dubious jurisprudence and sparked an embarrassing over-the-top hissy fit on the right. A do-nothing Congress, at a time when ever more Americans are losing their jobs and homes, is an even riper target than the Supreme Court  \xe2\x80\x94  and far more politically vulnerable. Without strong medicine from Obama, we can be certain of the same result: a heedless Congress will keep doing nothing. If he steps it up, there\xe2\x80\x99s at least a shot that his presidency, and maybe even the country, will be pulled back from the brink.'
