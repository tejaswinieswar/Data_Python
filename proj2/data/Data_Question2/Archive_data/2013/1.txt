b''b'These past few weeks, every media outlet on the Internet, from 'b'Vogue'b' to 'b'CNN'b', has been commemorating the hottest trends of 2012: donating to Kony 2012, taking placenta pills, wearing peplums, compulsively watching the Weather Channel. The lists go on and on. 'b''b''b'But what will we all become obsessed with in 2013? 'b''b'No matter the fad, the following offers a template for novice style writers who want to get started on their coverage of The Next Big Thing. 'b' 'b' 'b''b'AM I crazy or is everybody suddenly doing this thing? Some say it started among teenagers in Tokyo, some insist the fashion crowd brought it back from Paris, and others call it a homegrown Big Apple phenomenon. \xe2\x80\x9cWherever it came from,\xe2\x80\x9d says Denise Carleton, 38, a publicist in Park Slope, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you walk into a coffee bar in Brooklyn it\xe2\x80\x99s happening at every table, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the kids.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Looking around the living room one Sunday evening, it dawned on me that it was trending in my own apartment. Moving quickly through denial, I went right to the bargaining phase: what if everybody agreed to stop doing it for, say, a week? The hue and cry! You\xe2\x80\x99d think I\xe2\x80\x99d just suggested giving up our high-speed wireless.'b'My teenage daughters told me that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get it; their entire popularity-rating index was grounded in this thing. Not to do it would make them look like retrograde losers. They might as well wear gunnysack dresses and those puffy hairdos from \xe2\x80\x9cBig Love.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Sales of accessories have increased exponentially since Justin Bieber was videotaped by someone\xe2\x80\x99s smartphone doing the thing backstage. Gretchen Mol confessed her secret love for the thing to Jon Stewart, who, needless to say, disapproved. Michelle Obama deflected a question about whether her daughters were doing it, saying they \xe2\x80\x9caren\xe2\x80\x99t there yet.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The West Coast has its own version of the thing, according to the life coach Donna de Marco, 34, of Venice Beach, Calif.: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a little more industry-based, a little more spiritually enlightened, but otherwise it\xe2\x80\x99s the same thing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But has it traveled from the coasts to the heartland? I called up the only person I know west of Bucks County, Pa., my old Yale roommate Angela Matz, 41, a professor at Oberlin: \xe2\x80\x9cOf course it\xe2\x80\x99s happening here. Living in a college town, the students import whatever\xe2\x80\x99s happening from the coasts. But it\xe2\x80\x99s more of a seasonal thing. After all, it gets cold here.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some have found the thing, well, addictive. In a desperate attempt to get it under control, Rebecca Marlin, 28, a set designer, meets weekly with an intergenerational group in a church basement in Chelsea. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have the bad coffee and the folding chairs and we\xe2\x80\x99re pretty close to a 12-step program. It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to stop doing the thing that everybody else is doing!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Still others refuse to believe the thing is a thing at all. \xe2\x80\x9cJust because some style reporter has to fill column inches doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it\xe2\x80\x99s a thing,\xe2\x80\x9d sniffs a skeptical Tina Dupuis, 42, a Random House editor.'b'So is this thing a passing fad or is it here to stay? According to Timothy Turner, 36, an associate professor in cultural studies at New York University, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s always been some version of this thing; this is just its latest iteration. Things change according to cultural norms and cultural norms are always changing.\xe2\x80\x9d He recently gave a paper at the Modern Language Association entitled, \xe2\x80\x9cIs This Thing the New Normal?\xe2\x80\x9d Spoiler alert: it is.'b'But what if you\xe2\x80\x99re completely lame at doing it? What if you\xe2\x80\x99re in that slightly older demographic that mastered Napster, the Macarena and The Facebook but find this a bridge too far?'b'Not to fear: coaches and private studios are popping up all over Manhattan to offer remedial classes. Megan Delahunty, 29, who runs a Greenwich Village studio named Thingamajig, says: \xe2\x80\x9cLook, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to have the same kind of facility as those who don\xe2\x80\x99t remember Ross and Rachel. Don\xe2\x80\x99t just throw up your hands. Do something about it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But what will Ms. Delahunty, whose classes run $300 an hour, do once everybody\xe2\x80\x99s learned how to do it? She shrugged blithely as she disappeared into the office with her next client, a 40-ish investment banker dressed in head-to-toe Prada: \xe2\x80\x9cThey can learn how to do it 'b'better'b'. And besides, there\xe2\x80\x99s always the next big thing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'ONE hundred and fifty years ago, on Jan. 1, 1863, Abraham Lincoln presided over the annual White House New Year\xe2\x80\x99s reception. Late that afternoon, he retired to his study to sign the Emancipation Proclamation. When he took up his pen, his hand was shaking from exhaustion. Briefly, he paused \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cI do not want it to appear as if I hesitated,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked. Then Lincoln affixed a firm signature to the document.'b'Like all great historical transformations, emancipation was a process, not a single event. It arose from many causes and was the work of many individuals. It began at the outset of the Civil War, when slaves sought refuge behind Union lines. It did not end until December 1865, with the ratification of the 13th Amendment, which irrevocably abolished slavery throughout the nation.'b'But the Emancipation Proclamation was the crucial turning point in this story. In a sense, it embodied a double emancipation: for the slaves, since it ensured that if the Union emerged victorious, slavery would perish, and for Lincoln himself, for whom it marked the abandonment of his previous assumptions about how to abolish slavery and the role blacks would play in post-emancipation American life.'b'There is no reason to doubt the sincerity of 'b'Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s statement'b' in 1864 that he had always believed slavery to be wrong. During the first two years of the Civil War, despite insisting that the conflict\xe2\x80\x99s aim was preservation of the Union, he devoted considerable energy to a plan for ending slavery inherited from prewar years. Emancipation would be undertaken by state governments, with national financing. It would be gradual, owners would receive monetary compensation and emancipated slaves would be encouraged to find a homeland outside the United States \xe2\x80\x94 this last idea known as \xe2\x80\x9ccolonization.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s plan sought to win the cooperation of slave holders in ending slavery. As early as November 1861, he proposed it to political leaders in Delaware, one of the four border states (along with Kentucky, Maryland and Missouri) that remained in the Union. Delaware had only 1,800 slaves; the institution was peripheral to the state\xe2\x80\x99s economy. But Lincoln found that even there, slave holders did not wish to surrender their human property. Nonetheless, for most of 1862, he avidly promoted his plan to the border states and any Confederates who might be interested.'b'Lincoln also took his proposal to black Americans. In August 1862, he met with a group of black leaders from Washington. He seemed to blame the presence of blacks in America for the conflict: \xe2\x80\x9cbut for your race among us there could not be war.\xe2\x80\x9d He issued a powerful indictment of slavery \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cthe greatest wrong inflicted on any people\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 but added that, because of racism, blacks would never achieve equality in America. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is better for us both, therefore, to be separated,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. But most blacks refused to contemplate emigration from the land of their birth.'b'In the summer of 1862, a combination of events propelled Lincoln in a new direction. Slavery was disintegrating in parts of the South as thousands of slaves ran away to Union lines. With the war a stalemate, more Northerners found themselves agreeing with the abolitionists, who had insisted from the outset that slavery must become a target. Enthusiasm for enlistment was waning in the North. The Army had long refused to accept black volunteers, but the reservoir of black manpower could no longer be ignored. In response, Congress moved ahead of Lincoln, abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia, authorizing the president to enroll blacks in the Army and freeing the slaves of pro-Confederate owners in areas under military control. Lincoln signed all these measures that summer.'b'The hallmark of Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s greatness was his combination of bedrock principle with open-mindedness and capacity for growth. That summer, with his preferred approach going nowhere, he moved in the direction of immediate emancipation. He first proposed this to his cabinet on July 22, but Secretary of State William H. Seward persuaded him to wait for a military victory, lest it seem an act of desperation.'b'Soon after the Union victory at Antietam in September, Lincoln issued the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, a warning to the Confederacy that if it did not lay down its arms by Jan. 1, he would declare the slaves \xe2\x80\x9cforever free.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Lincoln did not immediately abandon his earlier plan. His annual message to Congress, released on Dec. 1, 1862, devoted a long passage to gradual, compensated abolition and colonization. But in the same document, without mentioning the impending proclamation, he indicated that a new approach was imperative: \xe2\x80\x9cThe dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to the stormy present,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must disenthrall our selves, and then we shall save our country.\xe2\x80\x9d Lincoln included himself in that \xe2\x80\x9cwe.\xe2\x80\x9d On Jan. 1, he proclaimed the freedom of the vast majority of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s slaves.'b'The Emancipation Proclamation is perhaps the most misunderstood of the documents that have shaped American history. Contrary to legend, Lincoln did not free the nearly four million slaves with a stroke of his pen. It had no bearing on slaves in the four border states, since they were not in rebellion. It also exempted certain parts of the Confederacy occupied by the Union. All told, it left perhaps 750,000 slaves in bondage. But the remaining 3.1 million, it declared, \xe2\x80\x9care, and henceforward shall be free.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The proclamation did not end slavery in the United States on the day it was issued. Indeed, it could not even be enforced in most of the areas where it applied, which were under Confederate control. But it ensured the eventual death of slavery \xe2\x80\x94 assuming the Union won the war. Were the Confederacy to emerge victorious, slavery, in one form or another, would undoubtedly have lasted a long time.'b'A military order, whose constitutional legitimacy rested on the president\xe2\x80\x99s war powers, the proclamation often disappoints those who read it. It is dull and legalistic; it contains no soaring language enunciating the rights of man. Only at the last minute, at the urging of Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase, an abolitionist, did Lincoln add a conclusion declaring the proclamation an \xe2\x80\x9cact of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Nonetheless, the proclamation marked a dramatic transformation in the nature of the Civil War and in Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s own approach to the problem of slavery. No longer did he seek the consent of slave holders. The proclamation was immediate, not gradual, contained no mention of compensation for owners, and made no reference to colonization.'b'In it, Lincoln addressed blacks directly, not as property subject to the will of others but as men and women whose loyalty the Union must earn. For the first time, he welcomed black soldiers into the Union Army; over the next two years some 200,000 black men would serve in the Army and Navy, playing a critical role in achieving Union victory. And Lincoln urged freed slaves to go to work for \xe2\x80\x9creasonable wages\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 in the United States. He never again mentioned colonization in public.'b'Having made the decision, Lincoln did not look back. In 1864, with casualties mounting, there was talk of a compromise peace. Some urged Lincoln to rescind the proclamation, in which case, they believed, the South could be persuaded to return to the Union. Lincoln refused. Were he to do so, he told one visitor, \xe2\x80\x9cI should be damned in time and eternity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Wartime emancipation may have settled the fate of slavery, but it opened another vexing question: the role of former slaves in American life. Colonization had allowed its proponents to talk about abolition without having to confront this issue; after all, the black population would be gone. After Jan. 1, 1863, Lincoln for the first time began to think seriously of the United States as a biracial society.'b'While not burdened with the visceral racism of many of his white contemporaries, Lincoln shared some of their prejudices. He had long seen blacks as an alien people who had been unjustly uprooted from their homeland and were entitled to freedom, but were not an intrinsic part of American society. During his Senate campaign in Illinois, in 1858, he had insisted that blacks should enjoy the same natural rights as whites (life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness), but he opposed granting them legal equality or the right to vote.'b'By the end of his life, Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s outlook had changed dramatically. In his 'b'last public address'b', delivered in April 1865, he said that in reconstructing Louisiana, and by implication other Southern states, he would \xe2\x80\x9cprefer\xe2\x80\x9d that limited black suffrage be implemented. He singled out the \xe2\x80\x9cvery intelligent\xe2\x80\x9d (educated free blacks) and \xe2\x80\x9cthose who serve our cause as soldiers\xe2\x80\x9d as most worthy. Though hardly an unambiguous embrace of equality, this was the first time an American president had endorsed any political rights for blacks.'b'And then there was his magnificent 'b'second inaugural address'b' of March 4, 1865, in which Lincoln ruminated on the deep meaning of the war. He now identified the institution of slavery \xe2\x80\x94 not the presence of blacks, as in 1862 \xe2\x80\x94 as its fundamental cause. The war, he said, might well be a divine punishment for the evil of slavery. And God might will it to continue until all the wealth the slaves had created had been destroyed, and \xe2\x80\x9cuntil every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword.\xe2\x80\x9d Lincoln was reminding Americans that violence did not begin with the firing on Fort Sumter, S.C., in April 1861. What he called \xe2\x80\x9cthis terrible war\xe2\x80\x9d had been preceded by 250 years of the terrible violence of slavery.'b'In essence, Lincoln asked the nation to confront unblinkingly the legacy of slavery. What were the requirements of justice in the face of this reality? What would be necessary to enable former slaves and their descendants to enjoy fully the pursuit of happiness? Lincoln did not live to provide an answer. A century and a half later, we have yet to do so.'b'New Brunswick, N.J.'b'THE Emancipation Proclamation, signed 150 years ago today, was a revolutionary achievement, and widely recognized as such at the time. Abraham Lincoln himself declared, \xe2\x80\x9cIf my name goes into history it will be for this act, and my whole soul is in it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'On New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve, 1862, \xe2\x80\x9cwatch-night\xe2\x80\x9d services in auditoriums, churches, camps and cabins united thousands, free as well as enslaved, who sang, prayed and counted down to midnight. At a gathering of runaway slaves in Washington, a man named Thornton wept: \xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow my child is to be sold never more.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Day of Jubilee, as Jan. 1, 1863 was called, arrived at last and celebrations of deliverance and freedom commenced. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are all liberated by this proclamation,\xe2\x80\x9d Frederick Douglass observed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe white man is liberated, the black man is liberated.\xe2\x80\x9d The Fourth of July \xe2\x80\x9cwas great,\xe2\x80\x9d he proclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the First of January, when we consider it in all its relations and bearings, even greater.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yet the day never took hold as Emancipation Day, an occasion to commemorate freedom for all Americans. Nearly three years would pass before the ratification of the 13th Amendment officially abolished slavery. All too quickly, the joy of emancipation succumbed to the reality of a circumscribed freedom in which blacks found themselves the victims of economic injustice and racial discrimination.'b'Settling on a single day to celebrate emancipation was further complicated by the variety of dates on which actual freedom, or word of it, came to the slaves: for example, slavery ended on 'b'April 16, 1862'b' in Washington, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t come to Virginia until April 3, 1865; word of the war\xe2\x80\x99s end and emancipation didn\xe2\x80\x99t reach Texas until June 19, 1865, a day celebrated as \xe2\x80\x9cJuneteenth.\xe2\x80\x9d Some areas marked Feb. 1, 1865, when Lincoln signed the joint resolution approving the 13th Amendment. As a result, local traditions took the place of a nationwide anniversary.'b'But those local traditions don\xe2\x80\x99t preclude a national observation. Indeed, today\xe2\x80\x99s sesquicentennial of the Emancipation Proclamation provides an opportunity to observe Jan. 1 as a day of emancipation and to rededicate ourselves to freedom. In 1963, standing before the Lincoln Memorial, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. labeled the Proclamation a \xe2\x80\x9cbeacon light of hope\xe2\x80\x9d to African-Americans and used the centennial to call for a renewed commitment to civil rights in America. Fifty years later, we might consider what a new Emancipation Proclamation would look like, one written for our times.'b'It would, above all, focus American and international attention on the millions of people still held in servitude. In September, the Frederick Douglass Family Foundation, an organization devoted to securing personal freedom and rights for all individuals, began a project called 100 Days to Freedom. Students in schools across the country were invited to craft a New Proclamation of Freedom, which the foundation hopes will be signed by President Obama on Jan. 11, which is recognized worldwide as Human Trafficking Awareness Day.'b'In the United States, thousands are held against their will; minors, especially, are the victims of ruthless exploitation. While other countries are worse offenders, the United States, according to State Department reports, serves as both a source and a destination for the trafficking of children.'b'In a speech delivered in September at the Clinton Global Initiative, President Obama declared that the time had come to call human trafficking by its rightful name: modern slavery. \xe2\x80\x9cThe bitter truth is that trafficking also goes on right here, in the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the migrant worker unable to pay off the debt to his trafficker. The man, lured here with the promise of a job, his documents then taken, and forced to work endless hours in a kitchen. The teenage girl, beaten, forced to walk the streets. This should not be happening in the United States of America.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That same month the president signed an executive order that stated the United States would \xe2\x80\x9clead by example\xe2\x80\x9d and take steps to ensure that federal contracts are not awarded to companies or nations implicated in trafficking. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re making clear that American tax dollars must never, ever be used to support the trafficking of human beings,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Still, the invisibility of modern slavery makes it all the more pernicious and difficult to eradicate. The organization Slavery Footprint asks on 'b'its Web site'b', \xe2\x80\x9cHow many slaves work for you?\xe2\x80\x9d A survey poses a series of seemingly innocuous questions such as what do you eat, what do you wear, what medicine do you take, and what electronics do you use? Upon completion, a number is revealed: I discovered that 60 slaves work for me \xe2\x80\x94 cutting the tropical wood for my furniture, harvesting the Central Asian cotton in my shirts or mining the African precious metals used in my electronics.'b'One way to reduce our complicity and attack human trafficking is to participate in Made in a Free World, a platform started by Slavery Footprint to show companies how to eliminate forced labor from their supply chains. A smartphone app also allows consumers to identify items made by forced labor and send letters to the manufacturers, demanding that they investigate the origins of the raw materials used in their products.'b'At his speech condemning human trafficking, President Obama referred to Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation as having \xe2\x80\x9cbrought a new day \xe2\x80\x94 that \xe2\x80\x98all persons held as slaves\xe2\x80\x99 would thenceforth be forever free. We wrote that promise into our Constitution. We spent decades struggling to make it real.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Today we should celebrate the extraordinary moment in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s history when slavery yielded to freedom. But the work must continue. For those who insist they would have been abolitionists during the Civil War, now is the chance to become one.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Perfect 10?

Some of us take comfort in its resemblance to the Old Year, and some of us wish it were newer than it\xe2\x80\x99s likely to be \xe2\x80\x94 a more radical departure, an unfamiliar train boarding at an unfamiliar station and headed who knows where. Make of this holiday what you will, but it is the only one in the calendar devoted to acknowledging, if not precisely celebrating, time itself. And there is nothing stranger than time.'b'Last night, when we crossed from 2012 into 2013, there were no guards at the border, no passports or visas required.

Instead of feeling that time is recommencing, refreshed, it feels as if we have somehow elongated time, stretched it out from some point in the past. Who in, say, 1980 could imagine entering 2013? From that long ago vantage, this year seemed like a science-fictional year, a date meant to sound far-off, alien, yet not so remote that it is completely unfamiliar.'b'That is the puzzle of beginning the new year. It is always someone\xe2\x80\x99s inconceivable year, unimaginably distant, yet here it is, waiting for what we make of it.'b'College graduates who began their careers during the Great Recession 'b'faced several long-term economic obstacles'b'. These included lower earnings, higher unemployment rates and greater career instability \xe2\x80\x94 all of which made it more difficult to buy homes and save for retirement. It also made it harder to pay off student loans.'b'The Obama administration had this group in mind when it created 'b'the Pay As You Earn Repayment Plan'b' for federal student loans, which allows recent student borrowers to arrange affordable payments and qualify for loan forgiveness. The program, which went 'b'into effect'b' late last month, needs to be broadly advertised if it is to reach the people who need it most.'b'At least two-thirds of college graduates borrow to complete their undergraduate degrees. And there are now about 37 million borrowers with federal student loans. The Pay As You Earn program would reach an estimated 1.6 million people. It is limited to people who started borrowing during the recession, who have high debt relative to their incomes and who entered the work force at the worst possible time.'b'Since 2009, similar relief has been available for student loan borrowers with 'b'the Income Based Repayment program'b', which also allows for lower payments. But the Pay As You Earn program provides more generous relief. According to an analysis by 'b'the Institute for College Access and Success'b', a nonprofit group that monitors student debt, an unmarried student who graduates with loan debt of $26,600 \xe2\x80\x94 the average for student borrowers in 2011 \xe2\x80\x94 and who earns an adjusted gross income of $25,000 a year, would pay about $69 a month under the Pay As You Earn plan. The same student would pay about $103 under the Income Based Repayment program.'b'Pay As You Earn will also provide significant relief to working people who returned to school for retraining during the recession. An online application makes it easier for borrowers to enroll and also allows them to compare the two repayment programs. Borrowers who adhere to the payment arrangement can have their loans forgiven after 20 years and can qualify for forgiveness in 10 years if they hold public-service jobs.'b'Taken together, the two repayment plans offer hope for millions who might otherwise be shackled with student debt all of their lives. But to reach the right borrowers, the government will need an intensive outreach program that explains in clear, consumer-friendly language who is eligible for the plans and how they work.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'In Gabon, Lure of Ivory Is Hard for Many to Resist'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (news article, Dec. 27):'b'Why not offer synthetic ivory instead of the natural product?

Of course, we should provide better services for people suffering from the disorders that may produce violent behavior, not only because we need protection from such sufferers but also because, as fellow citizens, they deserve the same level of care we would provide for people afflicted with serious diseases like cancer and diabetes.'b'Sadly, those legislators who blame mental illness for gun violence are often the same ones who have skimped on services to the mentally ill and would cut them to the bone in their deficit-reducing budget proposals.'b'MARY WEBB'b'\nLexington, Mass., Dec. 22, 2012'b''b'The juvenile justice system in the United States is supposed to focus on rehabilitation for young offenders. But for generations, it has largely been a purgatory, failing to protect them or give them the help and counseling they need to become law-abiding adults. Children who end up in juvenile courts often do not get due process protections like written complaints presenting the charges against them, adequate notice about legal proceedings or meaningful assistance of counsel.'b'The situation has been particularly atrocious in the juvenile system that serves Memphis and the surrounding area in Shelby County, Tenn. A chilling 'b'report'b' by the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s Civil Rights Division issued after a three-year investigation found that the juvenile court \xe2\x80\x94 which handles more than 11,000 matters a year across a range of charges \xe2\x80\x94 failed to provide proper conditions of confinement, systematically violated due process, like failing to advise young offenders of their rights before they were questioned, and violated the right to equal protection of black children, who were much more likely than whites to be locked up in detention and to have their cases transferred to adult criminal court.'b'These conclusions are the basis for 'b'a settlement agreement'b' announced 'b'in December'b' between the Justice Department and the court. The agreement is intended to ensure that every child with a court matter is provided counsel (\xe2\x80\x9cindependent, ethical and zealous advocacy\xe2\x80\x9d).'b'It also calls for a monitor selected by the court and the Justice Department to assess the court\xe2\x80\x99s performance against concrete measures of progress.

Bush began the country\xe2\x80\x99s long slide into debt by cutting taxes in 2001, 'b'an agreement was reached'b' late Monday in the Senate to raise income taxes on the rich. That\xe2\x80\x99s what makes the deal significant: assuming it is approved by the House, it begins to reverse the ruinous pattern of dealing with Washington\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal problems only through spending cuts.'b'Nonetheless, this deal is a weak brew that remains far too generous to the rich and fails to bring in enough revenue to deal with the nation\xe2\x80\x99s deep need for public investments. Given that the Bush-era tax cuts expire on Jan. 1, Republicans were forced to give ground on their philosophical opposition to higher taxes, but they made it impossible to reach a farsighted agreement that truly grappled with government\xe2\x80\x99s role in fostering improvements to education, transportation and manufacturing.'b'The deal, hammered out by the Obama administration and Senate Republican leaders, raises income taxes to Clinton-era levels on families making more than $450,000 a year and individuals making $400,000. That\xe2\x80\x99s a far cry from the $250,000 threshold that Mr. Obama said defined the upper range of the middle class in the campaign.'b'But White House officials said they had to compromise on that number to win renewal of important provisions that would otherwise have expired: unemployment insurance for three million people, tax credits for low-income working families, and a reduction in the impact of the alternative minimum tax on many middle-class families. Republicans cynically used those vital measures as bargaining chips. (What was not a point of contention was allowing the payroll tax to go back up by 2 percentage points.)'b'The higher income threshold isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only price the White House wound up paying. The estate tax on the nation\xe2\x80\x99s biggest inheritances is going up slightly but not nearly enough (estates of more than $5 million would be taxed at 40 percent, up from the current 35 percent) in a big and unnecessary giveaway to the very richest families. Significantly, the estate tax rate would be made permanent, while the credits for low-income families would expire in five years. Capital gains and dividend tax rates go up to 20 percent from the current 15 percent, but again, only for families making more than $450,000 a year.'b'The White House argues that it achieved 85 percent of its revenue goals, raising $600 billion over a decade, a third of which comes by phasing out exemptions and deductions for people with incomes greater than $250,000 a year. And Republicans achieved none of the draconian spending cuts they wanted.'b'But that battle is far from over. Negotiators have yet to work out a deal to stop the arbitrary spending cuts known as the sequester, which are scheduled to slash $110 billion from the defense and domestic budgets beginning this week. And Republicans are waiting for the Treasury to hit its debt limit in a few weeks, hoping to once again extort more spending cuts.'b'President Obama has ruled out any negotiations over the debt ceiling, and, on Monday, 'b'he vowed that revenue increases must match any further spending cuts'b'. But as this deal shows, he often compromises at the last minute, and, in this case, it was Senate Democrats who undercut him on both the estate tax and the income tax threshold, making it hard to remain adamant.'b'The fiscal-cliff agreement could still be blown up by the House, which would not be out of character. But a cleareyed look at the deal\xe2\x80\x99s limitations shows how much Republicans have gotten for their intransigence.'b'Over the course of the 20th century, America built its welfare state. It was, by and large, a great achievement, expanding opportunity and security for millions. Unfortunately, as the population aged and health care costs surged, it became unaffordable.'b'Public debt as a percentage of gross domestic product was around 38 percent in 1965. It is around 74 percent now. Debt could approach a ruinous 90 percent of G.D.P. in a decade and a cataclysmic 247 percent of G.D.P. 30 years from now, according to the Congressional Budget Office and JPMorgan.'b'By 2025, entitlement spending and debt payments are projected to suck up all federal revenue. Obligations to the elderly are already squeezing programs for the young and the needy. Those obligations will lead to gigantic living standard declines for future generations. According to the International Monetary Fund, meeting America\xe2\x80\x99s long-term obligations will require an immediate and permanent 35 percent increase in all taxes and a 35 percent cut in all benefits.'b'So except for a few rabid debt-deniers, almost everybody agrees we have to do something fundamental to preserve these programs. The problem is that politicians have never found a politically possible way to begin. Every time they tried to reduce debt, they ended up borrowing more and making everything worse.'b'So Congress and President Obama set up the \xe2\x80\x9cfiscal cliff,\xe2\x80\x9d an artificial disaster scenario that would force them to do the right thing. Obviously, the fiscal cliff negotiations were not going to lead toward the deep structural reforms that will eventually be needed. But they could have begun the reform process.'b'They could have shown the world that the two parties can work together to avert the eventual calamity. They could have produced a balanced program that would have combined spending cuts and targeted tax increases. They could have reduced Medicare spending on the rich to free up more money for young families.'b'President Obama and Speaker John Boehner both earnestly wanted to achieve these things. But the deal we are heading toward is discouraging. Yes, the deal does raise $600 billion in revenue over 10 years from a tiny sliver of the population (compared with the $8 trillion in new debt likely to be accrued over that time).'b'But the proposal is not a balance of taxes and spending cuts. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t involve a single hard decision. It does little to control spending. It abandons all of the entitlement reform ideas that have been thrown around. It locks in low tax rates on families making less than around $450,000; it is simply impossible to avert catastrophe unless tax increases go below that line.'b'Far from laying the groundwork for future cooperation, it sentences the country to another few years of budget trench warfare. There will be a fight over drastic spending cuts known as sequestration, then over the debt limit and on and on.'b'The White House envisions a series of stages bringing us closer to fiscal sustainability. I hope that\xe2\x80\x99s right. But if Congress couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make a single tough decision under these circumstances, why should we think it\xe2\x80\x99ll make any further down the road? More likely, there will just be more squabbling and brinkmanship, more posturing and punting, which would not only poison future budget talks but also prospects for immigration reform, tax reform, gun control and many other projects.'b'Whom should we blame for this? Again, we should not blame Obama and Boehner. In their different ways, they and a number of other people in the Congress are trying to find a politically palatable way to deal with these hard issues. They got what conditions allowed.'b'Ultimately, we should blame the American voters. The average Medicare couple pays $109,000 into the program and gets $343,000 in benefits out, according to the Urban Institute. This is $234,000 in free money. Many voters have decided they like spending a lot on themselves and pushing costs onto their children and grandchildren. They have decided they like borrowing up to $1 trillion a year for tax credits, disability payments, defense contracts and the rest. They have found that the original Keynesian rationale for these deficits provides a perfect cover for permanent deficit-living. They have made it clear that they will destroy any politician who tries to stop them from cost-shifting in this way.'b'Most members of Congress are responding efficiently to the popular will. A large number of reactionary Democrats reject any measure to touch Medicare or other entitlement programs. A large number of impotent Republicans talk about reducing the debt, but are incapable of forging a deal that balances tax increases with spending cuts.'b'The events of the past few weeks demonstrate that these political pressures overwhelm the few realists looking for a more ambitious bargain. The country either doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know or doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care about the burdens we are placing on our children. No coalition of leaders has successfully confronted the voters, and made them heedful of the ruin they are bringing upon the nation.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Wall Street high rollers inflate prices to astronomical levels.

It is a common problem in our field that psychiatrists speak of schizophrenia as if it were a well-understood condition, with a clear pathology and clear, effective treatment.'b'In fact, our understanding of this phenomenon is evolving and unsettled. What we call schizophrenia is probably a syndrome with many causes, and with a wide range of outcomes, with and without treatment. Many people do benefit from standard treatments, but many do not \xe2\x80\x94 and many find these treatments objectionable because of metabolic and other toxicities.'b'Moreover, many people find the current system of mental health delivery to be disrespectful, coercive and violent. It would be hard to imagine forced treatment for other medical conditions, like cancer or cardiovascular disease.'b'It has been my experience that when people are treated in a respectful way, offering options and choices rather than dictating treatment, better outcomes occur. Similarly, when we doctors are honest about the limitations of our knowledge, and humble about the power of our proffered treatments, there is more room for the person at the center of concern to find a path of care that can be helpful and effective.'b'For a tiny minority of patients, with substantial histories of violence, it is appropriate that the legal system, after an adversarial process, compel patients to accept treatment against their will.'b'I am worried that Dr. Steinberg\xe2\x80\x99s article communicates more certainty about the nature and treatment of schizophrenia than is warranted, and makes too little room for patients and their families to make informed choices about care.'b'CHRISTOPHER GORDON'b'\nFramingham, Mass., Dec. 26, 2012'b''b''b'The writer is a psychiatrist and an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Paul Steinberg makes valuable points about the dismantling of sound psychiatric care for psychotic illness.

Ordinarily, though, except for medical purposes, I will not discuss what I have seen.'b'Last week a colleague asked me to make an exception. The father of two young children, he was moved by the rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., to ask his professional circle to reconsider our silence. I am an expectant father, and his words resonated with me. They reminded me that we doctors are at the front lines of the scourge of gun violence, and that to remain silent as this threat to public health continues unabated would be no different than for an oncologist or a cardiologist to stay mum on the dangers of smoking.'b'The doctor\xe2\x80\x99s balance between discretion and education is complex. But the news from Newtown, and my colleague\xe2\x80\x99s request, convinced me that we have reached the threshold. I can no longer stay silent.'b'Here is just some of what I have seen over the years. In Baghdad, I saw a 5-year-old girl who was shot in the head while in her car seat. Her father, who knew she was dying before I said it, wept in my arms, as bits of her body clung to his shirt.'b'Much of the gun violence I have seen, though, I have seen on home soil, here in the United States. There was a 9-year-old girl, shot in the chest by an assault rifle during a \xe2\x80\x9cdrive-by\xe2\x80\x9d gang shooting, in a botched retaliation for a shooting earlier that day. She was baffled, and in pain, with a gaping hole under her collarbone.'b'I have also seen an 8-year-old who found a shotgun in the closet while playing with a friend. The two boys pointed the weapon at each other a number of times before the gun accidentally discharged. The 8-year-old arrived in my emergency department with most of his face blown off. Miraculously, he survived.'b'Another child I will never forget was a 13-year-old who was shot twice in the abdomen by an older boy who mistook him for one of a group that had bullied and berated him a week earlier. Slick with sweat and barely conscious, he groaned and turned to look at me. Soon after, he died in the operating room. His mother arrived minutes later, wide-eyed and breathless.'b'I do not know exactly what measures should be taken to reduce gun violence like this. But I know that most homicides and suicides in America are carried out with guns. Research suggests that homes with a gun are 'b'two'b' to 'b'three'b' times more likely to experience a firearm death than homes without guns, and that members of the household are 'b'18 times more likely'b' to be the victim than intruders.'b'I know that in 2009, the most recent year for which data is available, nearly 400 American children (age 14 and under) were killed with a firearm and nearly 1,000 were injured. That means that this week we can expect 26 more children to be injured or killed with a firearm.'b'Emergency rooms are themselves volatile environments, not immune to violence.

If the carnage remains undiscussed, we risk complacency about an American epidemic \xe2\x80\x94 one that is profoundly difficult, but necessary, to watch, and to confront. That is why I bear witness.'b'Washington'b'IN the days following the Newtown massacre the nation\xe2\x80\x99s newspapers were filled with heart-wrenching pictures of the innocent victims. The slaughter was unimaginably shocking. But the broader tragedy of gun violence is felt mostly not in leafy suburbs, but in America\xe2\x80\x99s inner cities.'b'The right to bear arms typically invokes the romantic image of a cowboy toting a rifle on the plains. In modern-day America, though, the more realistic picture is that of a young black man gunned down in his prime in a dark alley. When we celebrate gun rights, we all too often ignore their disproportionate racial burdens. Any effort to address gun violence must focus on the inner city.'b'Last year Chicago had some 500 homicides, 'b'87 percent of them gun-related'b'. In the city\xe2\x80\x99s public schools, 319 students were shot in the 2011-12 school year, 24 of them fatally. African-Americans are 33 percent of the Chicago population, but about 70 percent of the murder victims.'b'The same is true in other cities. In 2011, 80 percent of the 324 people killed in Philadelphia were killed by guns, and three-quarters of the victims were black.'b'Racial disparities in gun violence far outstrip those in almost any other area of life. Black unemployment is double that for whites, as is black infant mortality. But young black men die of gun homicide at a rate 'b'eight times'b' that of young white men. Could it be that the laxity of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s gun laws is tolerated because its deadly costs are borne by the segregated black and Latino populations of North Philadelphia and Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s South Side?'b'The history of gun regulation is inextricably interwoven with race. Some of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s most stringent gun laws emerged in the South after the Civil War, as Southern whites feared what newly freed slaves might do if armed. At the same time, Northerners saw the freed slaves\xe2\x80\x99 right to bear arms as critical to protecting them from the Ku Klux Klan.'b'In the 1960s, Huey P. Newton and the Black Panther Party made the gun a central 'b'symbol of black power,'b' claiming that \xe2\x80\x9cthe gun is the only thing that will free us.\xe2\x80\x9d On May 2, 1967, taking advantage of California\xe2\x80\x99s lax gun laws, several Panthers marched through the State Capitol in Sacramento 'b'carrying raised and loaded weapons'b', generating widespread news coverage.'b'The police could do nothing, as the Panthers broke no laws. But three months later, Gov. Ronald Reagan signed into law one of the strictest gun control laws in the country.'b'The urban riots of the late 1960s \xe2\x80\x94 combined with rising crime rates and a string of high-profile assassinations \xe2\x80\x94 spurred Congress to pass federal gun control laws, banning interstate commerce in guns except for federally licensed dealers and collectors; prohibiting sales to felons, the mentally ill, substance abusers and minors; and expanding licensing requirements.'b'These laws contain large loopholes, however, and are plainly inadequate to deal with the increased number and lethality of modern weapons. But as long as gun violence largely targets young black men in urban ghettos, the nation seems indifferent. At Newtown, the often all-too-invisible costs of the right to bear arms were made starkly visible \xe2\x80\x94 precisely because these weren\xe2\x80\x99t the usual victims. The nation took note, and President Obama has promised reform, though he has not yet made a specific proposal.'b'Gun rights defenders argue that gun laws don\xe2\x80\x99t reduce violence, noting that many cities with high gun violence already have strict gun laws. But this ignores the ease with which urban residents can evade local laws by obtaining guns from dealers outside their cities or states. Effective gun regulation requires a nationally coordinated response.'b'A cynic might propose resurrecting the Black Panthers to heighten white anxiety as the swiftest route to breaking the logjam on gun reform. I hope we are better than that. If the nation were to view the everyday tragedies that befall young black and Latino men in the inner cities with the same sympathy that it has shown for the Newtown victims, there would be a groundswell of support not just for gun law reform, but for much broader measures.'b'If we are to reduce the inequitable costs of gun rights, it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough to tighten licensing requirements, expand background checks to private gun sales or ban assault weapons. In addition to such national measures, meaningful reform must include initiatives directed to where gun violence is worst: the inner cities. Aggressive interventions by police and social workers focused on gang gun violence, coupled with economic investment, better schools and more after-school and job training programs, are all necessary if we are to reduce the violence that gun rights entail.'b'To tweak the National Rifle Association\xe2\x80\x99s refrain, \xe2\x80\x9cguns don\xe2\x80\x99t kill people; indifference to poverty kills people.\xe2\x80\x9d We can\xe2\x80\x99t in good conscience keep making young black men pay the cost of our right to bear arms.'b'I LIVED for 24 years in New Delhi, a city where sexual harassment is as regular as mealtime. Every day, somewhere in the city, it crosses the line into rape.'b'As a teenager, I learned to protect myself. I never stood alone if I could help it, and I walked quickly, crossing my arms over my chest, refusing to make eye contact or smile. I cleaved through crowds shoulder-first, and avoided leaving the house after dark except in a private car. At an age when young women elsewhere were experimenting with daring new looks, I wore clothes that were two sizes too large. I still cannot dress attractively without feeling that I am endangering myself.'b'Things didn\xe2\x80\x99t change when I became an adult. Pepper spray wasn\xe2\x80\x99t available, and my friends, all of them middle- or upper-middle-class like me, carried safety pins or other makeshift weapons to and from their universities and jobs. One carried a knife, and insisted I do the same. I refused; some days I was so full of anger I would have used it \xe2\x80\x94 or, worse, had it used on me.'b'The steady thrum of whistles, catcalls, hisses, sexual innuendos and open threats continued. Packs of men dawdled on the street, and singing Hindi film songs, rich with double entendres, was how they communicated. To make their demands clear, they would thrust their pelvises at female passers-by.'b'If only it was just public spaces that were unsafe. In my office at a prominent newsmagazine, at the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office, even at a house party \xe2\x80\x94 I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t escape the intimidation.'b'On Dec. 16, as the world now knows, a 23-year-old woman and a male friend were returning home after watching the movie \xe2\x80\x9cLife of Pi\xe2\x80\x9d at a mall in southwest Delhi. After they boarded what seemed to be a passenger bus, the six men inside 'b'gang-raped and tortured'b' the woman so brutally that her intestines were destroyed. The bus service had been a ruse. The attackers also severely beat up the woman\xe2\x80\x99s friend and threw them from the vehicle, leaving her to die.'b'The young woman didn\xe2\x80\x99t oblige. She had started that evening watching a film about a survivor, and must have been determined to survive herself. Then she produced another miracle. In Delhi, a city habituated to the debasement of women, tens of thousands of people took to the streets and faced down police officers, tear gas and water cannons to express their outrage. It was the most vocal protest against sexual assault and rape in India to date, and it set off nationwide demonstrations.'b'To protect her privacy the victim\xe2\x80\x99s name was not released publicly. But while she remains nameless, she did not remain faceless. To see her face, women had only to look in the mirror. The full measure of their vulnerability was finally understood.'b'When I was 26, I moved to Mumbai. A commercial and financial megalopolis, it has its own special set of problems, but has, culturally, been more cosmopolitan and liberal than Delhi. Giddy with my new freedom, I started to report from the red-light district and traveled across rough suburbs late at night \xe2\x80\x94 on my own and using public transit. It seemed that something good had come out of living in Delhi: I was so grateful for the comparatively safe environment of Mumbai that I took full advantage of it.'b'The young woman, however, will never have such an opportunity. On Saturday morning, 13 days after she was brutalized, this student of physical therapy, who had, no doubt, dreamt of improving lives, lost her own. She died of multiple organ failure.'b'India has laws against rape; seats reserved for women in buses, female officers; special police help lines. But these measures have been ineffective in the face of a patriarchal and misogynistic culture. It is a culture that believes that the worst aspect of rape is the defilement of the victim, who will no longer be able to find a man to marry her \xe2\x80\x94 and that the solution is to marry the rapist.'b'These beliefs aren\xe2\x80\x99t restricted to living rooms, but are expressed openly. In the months before the gang rape, some prominent politicians had attributed 'b'rising rape statistics'b' to women\xe2\x80\x99s increasing use of cellphones and going out at night. \xe2\x80\x9cJust because India achieved freedom at midnight does not mean that women can venture out after dark,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'said'b' Botsa Satyanarayana, the Congress Party leader in the state of Andhra Pradesh.'b'Change is possible, but the police must document reports of rape and sexual assault, and investigations and court cases have to be fast-tracked and not left to linger for years. Of the more than 600 rape cases reported in Delhi in 2012, 'b'only one led to a conviction'b'. If victims believe they will receive justice, they will be more willing to speak up. If potential rapists fear the consequences of their actions, they will not pluck women off the streets with impunity.'b'The volume of protests in public and in the media has made clear that the attack was a turning point. The unspeakable truth is that the young woman attacked on Dec. 16 was more fortunate than many rape victims. She was among the 'b'very few to receive anything close to justice'b'. She was hospitalized, her statement was recorded and within days all six of the suspected rapists were caught and, now, 'b'charged with murder'b'. Such efficiency is unheard-of in India.'b'In retrospect it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the brutality of the attack on the young woman that made her tragedy unusual; it was that an attack had, at last, elicited a response.'b'Every night until dawn, after people in apartment buildings and houses put out their sorted and bagged garbage for pickup from the sidewalks, the waiting piles are quietly picked over by some 5,000 scavengers called \xe2\x80\x9ccanners.\xe2\x80\x9d In the dark, they loom as silhouettes carrying giant plastic sacks to cart away countless soda cans and bottles, redeemable for 5 cents each.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful thing,\xe2\x80\x9d explains Marcus Moore, a canner who roams his unofficial territory barely ahead of the sanitation trucks. He makes maybe $500 a month from canning \xe2\x80\x94 peanuts, he says, compared with the take of Gene Rice, a kind of canning jedi master who tutored him at 'b'Picture the Homeless'b', an organization that serves people living on the city\xe2\x80\x99s edgier corners.'b'Mr. Moore is refashioning himself as an \xe2\x80\x9cecological engineer,\xe2\x80\x9d he says with a laugh, while warily looking out for rats attracted to the same garbage piles.'b'Seven years ago, Ana Martinez de Luco, a Roman Catholic nun, became a canner herself in creating 'b'Sure We Can'b', a project for the destitute, with the help of Eugene Gadsden, a street legend as a scavenger. Sister Ana estimated that the garbage piles back then were worked by about 2,500 people, who were predominantly poor and black, often mentally ill loners. But now in the struggling economy, there are Hispanic families, Chinese couples and other newcomers who are laboring overtime in what Sister Ana says is a doubling of the volume of empties being retrieved and cashed in.'b'This means that Sister Ana now manages a booming depot on McKibbin Street in Brooklyn that lays claim to being the city\xe2\x80\x99s only nonprofit redemption center, collecting 3 1/2 cents from the industry for handling each redeemable. Cans and bottles go through by the hundreds of thousands and canners walk into the morning light with money in their pockets. This year, Sister Ana aims to turn the center into a cooperative, controlled by a board of canners empowered by pride and castoff empties that don\xe2\x80\x99t belong in the garbage. 'b'  FRANCIS X. CLINES 'b''b'On the eve of the third anniversary of 'b'the earthquake that devastated Haiti in January 2010'b', the country remains in a fragile state. Billions of dollars in aid and lofty promises to \xe2\x80\x9cbuild back better\xe2\x80\x9d have brought it only so far. A recent article by Deborah Sontag of The Times showed, 'b'in disheartening detail,'b' the distance between hope and reality.'b'Ambitious projects are stuck on drawing boards or have been held up, she wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cby land and ideological disputes, logistical and contracting problems, staffing shortages and even weather.\xe2\x80\x9d A recovery commission led by the Haitian prime minister and former President Bill Clinton was meant to oversee the great rebuilding, but was slow to get started and is now defunct, with not much to show for its 18-month mission.'b'The flood of aid has slowed to a trickle; much of what was promised was never delivered or remains undisbursed, or was disbursed but not actually spent, or was spent on things like emergency food, water and tents, which are important but don\xe2\x80\x99t leave a lasting imprint. Money for long-term recovery has proved hard to spend, or slow to show results.'b'More than $1 billion allocated for Haiti remains in the United States Treasury, almost all of it for recovery, though America is hardly the only donor sitting on unspent aid. And more than 350,000 people who lost their homes that terrible day are still living in tent camps. The rubble has finally been cleared, but building permanent homes has taken a back seat to other matters.'b'The Times article reads like a catalog of missteps, of old mistakes and new ones that together present \xe2\x80\x94 to put the most optimistic spin on it \xe2\x80\x94 fresh opportunities to learn. One was the tendency of humanitarian aid organizations to go back to what they had been doing before the earthquake, in areas like sanitation, health, education and transportation, without the guidance of a broad plan and clear priorities for how best to repair the nation. Another failure has been the persistent unwillingness to include Haitians in the planning and execution of projects, leaving them feeling like bystanders in their own country and squandering opportunities to build government ministries and institutions capable of sustaining themselves once the world\xe2\x80\x99s attention and donations are gone.'b'Most recovery aid has been channeled through foreign agencies, nonprofit organizations and private contractors, a practice that inflates administrative costs and perpetuates cycles of dependency. And then there was the simple and shameful failure of global donors to meet their promises to deliver money and aid.'b'The State Department and other defenders of the international response point to some progress, like a new industrial park north of Port-au-Prince, the capital, providing the first 1,300 of what are supposed to be many thousands of manufacturing jobs. They say homes are being built, even if permanent ones are rising slowly and expensively. They plead for patience in a country where institutions were weak or nonexistent before the quake, which all but destroyed the government, flattening nearly every ministry and killing 20 percent of Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s civil servants.'b'Throughout the halting recovery, Haitians have borne up under other severe but unrelated afflictions: destructive storms, food shortages and disease. A 'b'recently announced'b' 10-year and $2.2 billion effort to rid Haiti and the Dominican Republic of cholera by improving water and sanitation will require close coordination among the Haitian government, the United Nations, United States and other partners. Senator John Kerry, who has paid astute attention to Haitian issues in the Senate, will be well placed to do so if he becomes the next secretary of state. As long as the miseries continue, the need for the world to get this right remains.'b'When the Supreme Court 'b'reinstated'b' the death penalty in 1976, it said there were two social purposes for imposing capital punishment for the most egregious crimes: deterrence and retribution. In recent months, these justifications for a cruel and uncivilized punishment have been seriously undermined by a growing group of judges, prosecutors, scholars and others involved in criminal justice, conservatives and liberals alike.'b'A distinguished committee of scholars convened by the National Research Council 'b'found'b' that there is no useful evidence to determine if the death penalty deters serious crimes. Many first-rate scholars have tried to prove the theory of deterrence, but that research \xe2\x80\x9cis not informative about whether capital punishment increases, decreases, or has no effect on homicide rates,\xe2\x80\x9d the committee said.'b'A host of other respected experts have also concluded that life imprisonment is a far more practical form of retribution, because the death penalty process is too expensive, too time-consuming and unfairly applied.'b'The punishment is supposed to be reserved for the very worst criminals, but dozens of studies in state after state have shown that the process for deciding who should be sent to death row is arbitrary and discriminatory.'b'Thanks to the 'b'Innocence Project'b' and the overturning of 18 wrongful convictions of death-row inmates with DNA evidence and the exonerations of 16 others charged with capital crimes, the American public is increasingly aware that the system makes terrible mistakes. Since 1973, a total of 142 people have been freed from death row after being exonerated with DNA or other kinds of evidence.'b'All of these factors have led the states to retreat from the death penalty in recent years \xe2\x80\x94 in both law and in practice. In 2012, Connecticut became the fifth state in five years to abolish the penalty. Nine states executed inmates, the fewest in two decades. Three-fourths of the 43 executions in 2012 were carried out in only four states. The number of new death sentences remained low at 77 \xe2\x80\x94 about one-third the number in 2000 \xe2\x80\x94 with just four states accounting for almost two-thirds of those sentences. While 33 states retain the death penalty on their books, 13 of them have not executed anyone for at least 'b'five years'b'.'b'Those 13 states plus the 17 without the penalty means that 30 states are not carrying it out \xe2\x80\x94 and that includes California, which retained the death penalty in a November referendum vote. Almost one-quarter of the 3,146 death row inmates in the United States, as of October, are imprisoned in California, but that state has not executed anyone in seven years.'b'California\xe2\x80\x99s chief justice 'b'said'b' recently that the state\xe2\x80\x99s official moratorium, which has been in place for six years, is likely to continue for at least three more because of problems with the execution method.'b'In January, executions are 'b'scheduled'b' to take place in Pennsylvania, Virginia and Texas. As it happens, major reviews of the death penalty are under way in each of those states. The reviews are very likely to find that those states have failed to meet standards of fairness under the Constitution, just as reviews of the capital systems in other states have concluded in the last decade.'b'The large number of states no longer carrying out executions indicates a kind of national consensus. It points to \xe2\x80\x9cthe evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society,\xe2\x80\x9d an idea that the Supreme Court has evoked in judging the constitutionality of punishments. The court used that analysis most recently when it 'b'ruled'b' that mandatory life sentences without possibility of parole are unconstitutional for juvenile offenders even if they are convicted of homicide.'b'It should similarly recognize that under evolving standards capital punishment is cruel and unusual and should be abolished.'b'WASHINGTON'b'Michael Bennet was supposed to be going off a cliff in Vail.'b'But instead of his usual New Year\xe2\x80\x99s trip to a ski lodge with his wife and three daughters, the junior senator from Colorado found himself in a strange, unfamiliar place in the middle of the night: breaking with the president and his party to become one of only three Democratic senators and eight senators total to vote against President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal deal.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was a little surprised that the margin of the vote was so big,\xe2\x80\x9d said a weary Senator Bennet, who seemed a bit taken aback to be such an outlier. He was munching on a late-afternoon cheese steak sandwich at \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge\xe2\x80\x99s, King of Falafel and Cheese Steaks.\xe2\x80\x9d (The senator loves falafel, which his girls call \xe2\x80\x9cfeel awful.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI almost ordered extra cheese,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sheepishly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I would have been embarrassed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Long before Bennet came to work in the \xe2\x80\x9cland of flickering lights,\xe2\x80\x9d as he mockingly calls the dysfunctional nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital where he grew up, Frank Capra dreamed him up. In a Congress that has become op\xc3\xa9ra bouffe, Bennet is the freckled blond choir boy singing a cappella. The 48-year-old senator looks like the Yale law student he once was, wearing a Jos. A. Bank plaid shirt, gray sweater and khakis. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are the only clothes I have in Washington that\xe2\x80\x99s not a suit,\xe2\x80\x9d he grins.'b'As Katherine Boo wrote in The New Yorker, back when Bennet was the crusading Denver schools superintendent, his open face and amiable manner \xe2\x80\x9conly partly masked the intensity and severity of his judgments.\xe2\x80\x9d He was, Boo wrote, \xe2\x80\x9can overachiever. He liked to announce improbable goals, then defy expectations of failure.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Voting to let the country fall off the cliff was an audacious, even precocious, move by the Democratic golden boy and presidential pet \xe2\x80\x94 one that, oddly, put him on the side of Marco Rubio and Rand Paul rather than Obama and Joe Biden. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is an interesting group,\xe2\x80\x9d he deadpanned about the naysayers.'b'He also had to go against Majority Leader Harry Reid, who anointed the freshman to be the new leader of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.'b'Bennet, the future of his party, comes from the fertile territory of the Mountain West. Asked if his vote was a way to stake out some centrist and independent territory for a future White House run, he demurred, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no.\xe2\x80\x9d Appointed in 2009 and little known in his state, he managed to survive the conservative wave that swept out so many Democrats in 2010 and his coalition of Hispanics and women became the model for the Obama campaign in Colorado in 2012. Democrats are counting on Bennet to recruit a new generation of candidates who will broaden the appeal and geographic reach of the party.'b'In frantic New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day deal-making, he voted \xe2\x80\x9cnay\xe2\x80\x9d at about 2 a.m., and the House passed the bill around 11 p.m. He said he did so because the deal did not have meaningful deficit reduction, explaining: \xe2\x80\x9cGoing over the cliff is a lousy choice and continuing to ignore the fiscal realities that we face is a lousy choice.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He said he thinks the president wants serious deficit cuts but is dealing with people \xe2\x80\x9cso intransigent I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure they could be brought to an agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s meaningful in the absence of going over the cliff. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible thing to say. People at home are so bone-tired of these outcomes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He said his focus now is the same as when he was the Denver superintendent trying to get more poor kids to stay in school.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe burden of proof has to shift from the people who want to change the system to the people who want to keep it the same,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think if we can get people focused to do what we need to do to keep our kids from being stuck with this debt that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t accrue, you might be surprised at how far we can move this conversation.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWashington politics no longer follows the example of our parents and our grandparents who saw as their first job creating more opportunity, not less, for the people who came after. My mother\xe2\x80\x99s parents were refugees from Warsaw who came here after World War II because they could rebuild their shattered lives. But the political debate now is a zero-sum game that creates more problems than solutions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He thinks the trouble is not so much a clash of Democratic and Republican orthodoxies as it is a clash of past and future. \xe2\x80\x9cI think the inhabitants of the past are fighting hard to keep the rents they acquired in the 20th century,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'I noted that his wife said that his special skill is knowing the difference between worthy challenges and impossible ones. He laughed, then mused: \xe2\x80\x9cThis may be one of the impossible ones. But we have to do it. I know this country is not going to allow itself to go bankrupt. It\xe2\x80\x99s challenging, though, because in this town there are all kinds of people whose job it is to obfuscate the facts.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Then the exhausted senator left to see \xe2\x80\x9cSkyfall.\xe2\x80\x9d The one with James Bond, not John Boehner.'b'Roslyn Heights, N.Y.'b'IT\xe2\x80\x99S my last full day as a member of the Congress, and I have it all under control \xe2\x80\x94 I think.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m fulfilled and grateful to have been able to pay back a small portion for the good things that happened to me in life. To retire after 35 years in elected office, with no formulated plan as yet but goofing off with my grandchildren, seems right for the moment. I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to play the rest of life by ear.'b'I had hoped to keep my emotions in check, to put off the question of who I am. Did I become the job? Without it, who will I be? The question tomorrow will be \xe2\x80\x94 as Jean Valjean sings in \xe2\x80\x9cLes Mis\xc3\xa9rables\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cWho am I?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But my emotions have a mind of their own. This week I cast my last vote \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cto extend certain tax relief provisions enacted in 2001 and 2003\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfor other purposes\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 of what I estimate have been more than 16,000 votes cast in my career.'b'Coming from an immigrant family of Polish Jews with peasant origins, sheltered by decent, safe public housing (the Kingsborough Houses in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and the Pomonok Houses in Flushing, Queens), receiving great medical care when I needed it thanks to a generous society (and charity hospitals such as St. Giles the Cripple and St. Luke\xe2\x80\x99s), educated by wonderful public schools, with a priceless, cost-free degree from Queens College, I have lived my entire life knowing that I owed somebody something.'b'And I fancied myself becoming somebody, and paying it forward. I taught in public schools. I helped start a business. (Yes, liberals can be job creators and believe in capitalism.) As a state senator and then a congressman, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had the privilege of trying to do good things for people to whom I owe so much and can never fully repay. I\xe2\x80\x99ve personally demanded that tyrants let their people go. I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to feed the hungry, clothe the poor, protect the elderly and infirm, and defend the needy from the aggressively greedy. I\xe2\x80\x99ve led a blessed life. What a kick for a kid from the projects.'b'I entered government service at a time when America was becoming more and more diverse. Some neighborhoods in my hometown, New York City, were changing so rapidly, welcoming people with so much hope and talent and pride, one just had to know that so much promise could only make a great nation better.'b'I remember from my childhood a wooden jigsaw puzzle map of what were then the 48 states. The puzzle wasn\xe2\x80\x99t complete unless one could fit all the pieces together to make one country, our country. But the House of Representatives has 435 separate pieces, each piece represented by a person speaking for communities with different ideas and approaches. On many occasions, we made it all fit together. Compromise was not heresy. Your opponent was not your enemy. The debate was choosing between better or worse policies, not good or evil ideologies. Of course, between good and bad there is a void of gray.'b'Two months shy of 30 years in the House, I leave a chamber in which we challenge one another\xe2\x80\x99s legitimacy, not one another\xe2\x80\x99s ideas. When I arrived in Washington, in 1983, Ronald Reagan was president, the Republicans controlled the Senate, and the Democrats were the majority in the House. Today the situation is reversed: Barack Obama is about to be sworn in for a second term, the Democrats control the Senate and the Republicans are in the majority in the House.'b'What has changed is the disappearance of the spirit of cooperation and shared sacrifice that, only three decades ago, could bring political opponents together. I came at a time of great hope and leave at a time when finding a middle path has become a much greater challenge.'b'My last votes capped off a chapter of a storybook life I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have dreamed up: the fiscal compromise approved by the House, with the support of nearly all Democrats and a minority of Republicans, staved off what would have been devastating tax-rate increases for nearly all but the wealthiest American households. The background music of Claude-Michel Sch\xc3\xb6nberg sounded in my mind.'b'Sadly, there was a disappointing coda, as House leaders failed to bring to a vote legislation to provide emergency aid to those left desperate and dispirited by Hurricane Sandy. (House Republican leaders are now promising a vote on that legislation on Friday, when the new, 113th Congress will have been seated.) I found myself hoping for \xe2\x80\x9cone day more.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As I walked out of La Guardia Airport this morning, on my last flight as a congressman from Reagan National Airport, I suddenly felt lost.

Or is it?'b'MARK R. GODBURN'b'\nNorth Canaan, Conn., Jan. 2, 2013'b''b'ACCORDING to the United States government, nearly 7 out of 10 American adults weigh too much. (In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention categorized 74 percent of men and 65 percent of women as either overweight or obese.)'b'But a new meta-analysis of the relationship between weight and mortality risk, involving nearly three million subjects from more than a dozen countries, illustrates just how exaggerated and unscientific that claim is.'b'The meta-analysis, published this week in 'b'The Journal of the American Medical Association'b', reviewed data from nearly a hundred large epidemiological studies to determine the correlation between body mass and mortality risk. The results ought to stun anyone who assumes the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chealthy\xe2\x80\x9d weight used by our public health authorities is actually supported by the medical literature.'b'The 'b'study'b', by Katherine M. Flegal and her associates at the C.D.C. and the National Institutes of Health, found that all adults categorized as overweight and most of those categorized as obese have a lower mortality risk than so-called normal-weight individuals. If the government were to redefine normal weight as one that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t increase the risk of death, then about 130 million of the 165 million American adults currently categorized as overweight and obese would be re-categorized as normal weight instead.'b'To put some flesh on these statistical bones, the study found a 6 percent 'b'decrease'b' in mortality risk among people classified as overweight and a 5 percent decrease in people classified as Grade 1 obese, the lowest level (most of the obese fall in this category). This means that average-height women \xe2\x80\x94 5 feet 4 inches \xe2\x80\x94 who weigh between 108 and 145 pounds have a higher mortality risk than average-height women who weigh between 146 and 203 pounds. For average-height men \xe2\x80\x94 5 feet 10 inches \xe2\x80\x94 those who weigh between 129 and 174 pounds have a higher mortality risk than those who weigh between 175 and 243 pounds.'b'Now, if we were to employ the logic of our public health authorities, who treat any correlation between weight and increased mortality risk as a good reason to encourage people to try to modify their weight, we ought to be telling the 75 million American adults currently occupying the government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chealthy weight\xe2\x80\x9d category to put on some pounds, so they can move into the lower risk, higher-weight categories.'b'In reality, of course, it would be nonsensical to tell so-called normal-weight people to try to become heavier to lower their mortality risk. Such advice would ignore the fact that tiny variations in relative risk in observational studies provide no scientific basis for concluding either that those variations are causally related to the variable in question or that this risk would change if the variable were altered.'b'This is because observational studies merely record statistical correlations: we don\xe2\x80\x99t know to what extent, if any, the slight decrease in mortality risk observed among people defined as overweight or moderately obese is caused by higher weight or by other factors. Similarly, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether the small increase in mortality risk observed among very obese people is caused by their weight or by any number of other factors, including lower socioeconomic status, dieting and the weight cycling that accompanies it, social discrimination and stigma, or stress.'b'In other words, there is no reason to believe that the trivial variations in mortality risk observed across an enormous weight range actually have anything to do with weight or that intentional weight gain or loss would affect that risk in a predictable way.'b'How did we get into this absurd situation? That is a long and complex story. Over the past century, Americans have become increasingly obsessed with the supposed desirability of thinness, as thinness has become both a marker for upper-class status and a reflection of beauty ideals that bring a kind of privilege.'b'In addition, baselessly categorizing at least 130 million Americans \xe2\x80\x94 and hundreds of millions in the rest of the world \xe2\x80\x94 as people in need of \xe2\x80\x9ctreatment\xe2\x80\x9d for their \xe2\x80\x9ccondition\xe2\x80\x9d serves the economic interests of, among others, the multibillion-dollar weight-loss industry and large pharmaceutical companies, which have invested a great deal of money in winning the good will of those who will determine the regulatory fate of the next generation of diet drugs.'b'Anyone familiar with history will not be surprised to learn that \xe2\x80\x9cfacts\xe2\x80\x9d have been enlisted before to confirm the legitimacy of a cultural obsession and to advance the economic interests of those who profit from that obsession.'b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t expect those who have made their careers on fomenting panic to understand that our current definition of \xe2\x80\x9cnormal weight\xe2\x80\x9d makes absolutely no sense.'b'Tampa, Fla.'b'LAST month, HSBC admitted in court pleadings that it had allowed big Mexican and Colombian drug cartels to launder at least $881 million. The bank also admitted to using various schemes to move hundreds of millions of dollars to nations subject to trade sanctions, including Iran, Cuba and Sudan, in violation of the Trading With the Enemy Act. \xe2\x80\x9cOn at least one occasion,\xe2\x80\x9d according to a statement by Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer, \xe2\x80\x9cHSBC instructed a bank in Iran on how to format payment messages so that the transactions would not be blocked or rejected by the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Those were some of the transgressions uncovered during a two-year investigation led by the Justice and Treasury Departments and acknowledged by HSBC in a settlement, known as a 'b'deferred prosecution agreement'b', that was filed in a federal court in December. Not a single executive was charged with a crime. Instead, the bank paid 'b'$1.9 billion'b' in fines and forfeitures \xe2\x80\x94 or roughly 10 percent of the pretax profits it earned in just 2010, one of the more than five years during which it admitted to criminal conduct.'b'HSBC is hardly alone. Court filings show that, since 2006, more than a dozen banks have reached settlements with the Justice Department regarding violations related to money laundering. 'b'ING Bank paid'b' a $619 million fine for altering records and secretly transferring more than $2 billion for entities trading with Iran and other nations under sanctions. American Express Bank International acknowledged that more than $55 million in drug proceeds may have been laundered through offshore shell accounts it maintained. The Justice Department has signed similar agreements, withholding prosecution in exchange for bank promises to tighten oversight, with Wachovia, Union Bank of California, Lloyds, Credit Suisse, ABN Amro Holding (now owned by Royal Bank of Scotland), Barclays and Standard Chartered. All admitted to criminal offenses; all were handed the equivalent of traffic tickets \xe2\x80\x94 pay a fine on your way out the door.'b'This has been the government\xe2\x80\x99s playbook in fighting terrorism and the drug trade. For make no mistake, without the ability to \xe2\x80\x9cwash\xe2\x80\x9d billions of dollars of money from illicit sources each year and bank the untraceable profits, both of these criminal enterprises would falter.'b'In November, the House Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations and Management issued a shocking 'b'report'b' documenting the collaboration between Mexican and Colombian drug cartels and Hezbollah in narcotics and human trafficking, smuggling and financial crimes in the United States and Latin America \xe2\x80\x94 a partnership that, in just the border region between Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina, produces an estimated $12 billion in cash each year.'b'Yet data from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture Fund and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime Research Report show that United States law enforcement tracks down and seizes no more than 1 percent of the drug fortunes generated each year by global cartels.'b'The rest isn\xe2\x80\x99t hiding in mattresses. It\xe2\x80\x99s being washed \xe2\x80\x94 stripped clean of information that would identify its source, then transferred from one account to another, and often moved surreptitiously through various business enterprises, until it can settle safely in a criminal\xe2\x80\x99s private 'b'offshore bank'b' account. None of this happens without help from bankers, lawyers and businessmen.'b'I have seen this firsthand. I was a federal agent for 27 years and worked undercover as a money launderer within this murky realm for five of them. I worked on teams that put leaders of drug cartels behind bars. The largest and most sophisticated of these criminal enterprises don\xe2\x80\x99t trick banks into laundering their money \xe2\x80\x94 they partner with that small segment of the international banking and business community that recirculates drug profits and cash from other illicit trades, like black-market arms dealing.'b'The only way to stop the flow of this dirty money is to get tough on the bankers who help mask and transfer it around the world. Banks themselves don\xe2\x80\x99t launder money, after all; people do.'b'The standard of proof needed to charge and convict a bank officer of money laundering is simple. If the person knows that funds are proceeds of a crime and, thereafter, he attempts to disguise or conceal the true source of the funds, he has committed the criminal offense of money laundering. Any individual who intentionally provides financial services to criminal organizations should be dealt with as harshly as possible under the law.'b'Bank officers at HSBC branches in Mexico who facilitated the transfer of $881 million for the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico, the Norte del Valle Cartel in Colombia and other narcotics traffickers \xe2\x80\x94 deposits that were often passed through teller windows in cash-filled boxes, some with hundreds of thousands of dollars in them \xe2\x80\x94 might contend that they were na\xc3\xafve about this money\xe2\x80\x99s source. But there\xe2\x80\x99s little incentive for them, or any bank officer, to be more vigilant when turning a blind eye comes with little or no penalty.'b'The stakes are simply too high for such a soft-glove approach on money laundering. As long as drug traffickers can wash the stain from 99 percent of their ill-gotten gains, as long as terrorists can move their cash freely around the world, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have no chance to halt their deadly trades. We can help put an end to both of these scourges by putting the bankers who facilitate them in jail.'b'Washington'b'CALLING the massacre in Newtown, Conn., \xe2\x80\x9cthe worst day of my presidency,\xe2\x80\x9d President Obama recently told NBC\xe2\x80\x99s David Gregory: \xe2\x80\x9cMy response is, something has to work. And it is not enough for us to say, \xe2\x80\x98This is too hard, so we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to try.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Almost 20 years ago, Senator Dianne Feinstein and other lawmakers took the same approach to build a bipartisan majority in Congress, tortuously, vote by vote, for legislation banning the future manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines.'b'As Senator Feinstein\xe2\x80\x99s counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1993, I worked with her to get the assault weapons bill to President Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s desk. But the legislation expired in 2004 and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been renewed. Understanding what worked then is the key to doing it again in the new Congress, as Senator Feinstein has vowed to do.'b'Then, as now, legislation was the product of spectacular violence. On July 1, 1993, a man carrying two semiautomatic pistols equipped with high-capacity ammunition magazines and \xe2\x80\x9chellfire\xe2\x80\x9d triggers, and another pistol, strolled off an elevator in a San Francisco building. He entered the offices of a law firm and killed eight people and injured six others before taking his own life. In the wake of that horror, Senator Feinstein asked me to review earlier bills by two other Democratic senators at the time, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio, and blend them with her own proposals to create meaningful new legislation that could pass Congress.'b'The law that resulted is best known for regulating certain semiautomatic weapons and large ammunition magazines, but it\xe2\x80\x99s worth remembering that its official name was the Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act.'b'That title wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a euphemism: the law needed support from lawmakers who had viewed prior legislative efforts as toothless, as well as those who feared that a ban on assault weapons could lead to the confiscation of guns used for hunting and target shooting.'b'The bill had three main components. The first was a list of well-known, deeply feared guns that were banned by name (like Uzis). The second banned the future manufacture and sale of any new semiautomatic weapon with a detachable magazine and more than two of several assault-style features (like a forward handgrip). The third and most critical section was Appendix A, which listed every single hunting rifle and shotgun in use at the time \xe2\x80\x94 there were hundreds \xe2\x80\x94 that didn\xe2\x80\x99t run afoul of the features test in the second component. Those firearms were unequivocally exempted from the bill.'b'At the time, gun-control advocates resisted the incorporation of Appendix A. But the idea behind it was and remains crucial to making any meaningful changes in America\xe2\x80\x99s gun laws. They must gain the support of gun owners, most of whom are heartsick over senseless carnage.'b'By explicitly protecting hundreds of popular sporting guns, the bill enabled senators and representatives to push back against the tide of protests \xe2\x80\x94 many of them generated by the National Rifle Association \xe2\x80\x94 at town hall-style meetings in their states and districts. They could show their constituents that their ordinary hunting rifles and shotguns were protected in Appendix A or that their guns could be added to it, if need be. Proponents of the legislation distributed blue booklets describing all three parts of the bill, including pictures of the assault weapons banned by name and the full list of guns protected by Appendix A.'b'The nation\xe2\x80\x99s principal law enforcement organizations, whose leaders testified and lobbied aggressively for the bill, also made great use of the booklets and Appendix A. In fact, it was a survey showing overwhelming support for an assault-weapons ban from police chiefs in and around his Congressional district that persuaded Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee at the time, to support the bill. His surprise yes vote offset the no vote of the committee\xe2\x80\x99s conservative chairman, Representative Jack Brooks, a Texas Democrat, so that the bill could move to the floor of the House.'b'The existence of Appendix A also made it possible for Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a Colorado Democrat and longtime N.R.A. member \xe2\x80\x94 coupled with his own reaction to a torrent of gun-lobby phone calls \xe2\x80\x94 to commit to supporting Senator Feinstein\xe2\x80\x99s bill if it was essential. That moment came when a motion to table, or effectively kill, the bill came before the Senate. Although the motion would have failed with a tie vote of 50 to 50, Senator Feinstein asked Senator Campbell for his vote to show that a majority of senators supported the bill. He honored his commitment, and the motion to table failed, 49 to 51, paving the way for the ultimate passage of the bill by a vote of 57 to 43.'b'Following the Newtown tragedy, inaction is not an option, morally or politically. President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. (who championed the original assault-weapons ban when he served in the Senate) are on the right track with their plan to present legislation before the new Congress.'b'Preventing another slaughter will require not just new gun regulations, but also education, mental health care, greater access by law enforcement agencies to mental health records and assistance for parents, while respecting the whole Bill of Rights.'b'But the lesson from nearly two decades ago remains clear. If any meaningful change is to come, legislators must again devise a bill that both regulates assault weapons and respects and protects gun owners.'b'If we want to reimpose a permanent assault-weapons ban and restrict high capacity ammunition magazines, let\xe2\x80\x99s include a new list of exempted rifles and shotguns used for recreational shooting in a new Appendix A (updated annually) and actively solicit input from the shooting community to make it work.'b'If we want to require background checks for all private sales at gun shows, let\xe2\x80\x99s cap the cost so that private sales aren\xe2\x80\x99t prohibitively expensive. Better yet, when we do this, let\xe2\x80\x99s find an efficient way to allow individual sellers to directly use the same F.B.I.-managed background check system they must now pay federally licensed gun dealers to access for them.'b'If, once and for all, we want to revoke the de facto exemption from consumer product safety regulation that, thanks to the N.R.A., guns have historically enjoyed, let\xe2\x80\x99s bring them under the jurisdiction of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and require gun makers to build state-of-the-art gunlock technology (like palm- or fingerprint-recognition sensors) into every handgun or rifle. But then let\xe2\x80\x99s also relieve gun owners of the burden of identifying and complying with a patchwork of different state laws covering the transport of firearms and permit, under federal law, the transport of any lawfully owned gun across state lines if it\xe2\x80\x99s unloaded and locked in the trunk of a car, in a childproof case.'b'Finally, if only because it\xe2\x80\x99s the fair thing to do, let\xe2\x80\x99s require states and localities to process gun registration and other applications by law-abiding gun owners within a reasonable period of time, and with firm deadlines.'b'We need comprehensive proposals that can gain wide support. As always, the resulting legislation won\xe2\x80\x99t be perfect. For example, just as in 1993, it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely that a new bill would address assault weapons that people already lawfully own \xe2\x80\x94 like the one Adam Lanza took from his mother before he killed her, 20 first graders, six educators and himself. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to address that problem with publicly and privately sponsored buyback programs and other approaches. But once enacted, a comprehensive bill would, over time, make \xe2\x80\x9cgrandfathered\xe2\x80\x9d weapons and ammunition magazines more expensive, harder to find and harder to repair. If such a compromise kept the wrong gun out of the wrong hands just once, I\xe2\x80\x99d take it, any day.'b'Right now you are probably asking yourself: Will the new Congress being sworn in this week work any better than the last one?'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s always a chance. Because, you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'new'b'. Also, the bar is low, since some people believe the departing 112th Congress was the worst in history, because of its stupendous lack of productivity and a favorability rating that once polled lower than the idea of a Communist takeover of America.'b'On the very last day the Republican-led House of Representatives was in session, the Republican governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, announced it was \xe2\x80\x9cwhy the American people hate Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d This was after Speaker John Boehner failed to bring up a bill providing aid to the victims of the megastorm Sandy. Disaster relief joined a long list of bills that the 112th Congress could not get its act together to approve, along with reforming the farm subsidies and rescuing the Postal Service. Those particular pieces of legislation were all written and passed by the Senate, a group that\xe2\x80\x99s generally less proactive than a mummy.'b'Ah, the House. To be fair, it takes a lot of effort to vote to repeal Obamacare 33 times.'b'Our outgoing lawmakers did retrieve us from that \xe2\x80\x9cfiscal cliff.\xe2\x80\x9d Although they were the ones who pushed us off in the first place. And they left the new Congress facing a debt chasm, a sequestration void and a government-stoppage bottomless pit.'b'So, yeah, this last one was pretty darned bad. The best argument I can make for it is that none of the outgoing members walked onto the floor and brained a colleague with a cane, as did happen in the 34th Congress. Which also was being led by President Franklin Pierce. So I would give the 34th the ribbon. But definitely the 112th is a contender.'b'The new Congress will have a few more Democrats in the House and Senate, which will not make any difference whatsoever. On the plus side, the proportion of political nut jobs may be a little lower. Representative Allen West of Florida, who once called President Obama \xe2\x80\x9ca low-level socialist agitator,\xe2\x80\x9d is, many recounts later, a member no more. Representative Joe Walsh of Illinois was defeated by Tammy Duckworth, a military veteran who lost both legs in Iraq and who Walsh claimed was not one of \xe2\x80\x9cour true heroes.\xe2\x80\x9d Walsh was also an excellent reminder of an important rule in American politics: refrain from criticizing the other party for fiscal irresponsibility until you can work out a resolution of that child support issue.'b'Tea Party favorite Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina has departed, too, even though his term was only half over, to answer the siren call of a seven-figure job at the helm of the Heritage Foundation.'b'Thanks to the blog Smart Politics, I am able to report that this is normal behavior in South Carolina: one-third of all U.S. senators from South Carolina have resigned over the course of our history. (South Carolina is also the state that gave us the guy with the cane back in 1856.) DeMint was replaced by Representative Tim Scott, whose seat will be filled in a special election this spring. Right now one of the possible candidates is Mark Sanford, the governor who we all remember for flying to Argentina for an assignation with his lover while his staff claimed he was hiking on the Appalachian Trail.'b'Another much-discussed potential contender is Jenny Sanford, former wife of the above. People, while you are praying for a safe, sane and peaceful new year, I want you to make a small exception and pray that Jenny and Mark Sanford run against each other.'b'DeMint\xe2\x80\x99s departure was only unusual for its abruptness. Members of Congress regularly glom onto high-paying jobs in the private sector, none of which involve the use of their skills in computer technology. The Center for Responsive Politics counts 373 former House and Senate members who are currently working as lobbyists.'b'That includes the former Utah Senator Bob Bennett, who announced that he would be filing his official papers on Thursday, the exact moment the legal two-year revolving door ban expires. Bennett had complained bitterly about the cooling-off period being a restraint of his constitutional rights, which left him forced to eke out a living as a consultant for the BennettGroup and a member of a high-profile Washington law firm.'b'When it comes to a sudden departure, though, the new titleholder has to be Representative Jo Ann Emerson of Missouri, who quit Congress to become president and chief executive of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association less than a month after she was re-elected to another term. She said she had found \xe2\x80\x9ca new way to serve.\xe2\x80\x9d The Center for Responsive Politics noted that the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association was not only a big lobbying group, but also Emerson\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbiggest lifetime campaign contributor.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Still, remember, could be worse.

So the authorities block mainstream social media Web sites and, lately, 'b'The New York Times and Bloomberg'b', after reports about family members of Chinese leaders becoming fabulously wealthy.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a tribute to China\xe2\x80\x99s stunning economic development that 'b'the country now has some 540 million Internet users'b', more than any other country. It\xe2\x80\x99s sad to see current leaders reverting to a tighter vision of the Internet. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can we develop our skills,\xe2\x80\x9d one Chinese friend asked me rhetorically, \xe2\x80\x9cif we can\xe2\x80\x99t even visit some of the most popular Web sites around the world?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Many Chinese vault over the Great Firewall of China to get to banned sites with 'b'a virtual private network or VPN'b'. But, in the last month China, has rolled out new software that interferes with VPNs, even ones used by American corporations to access their internal networks. The government is also trying to crack down on Sina Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, by 'b'making users register with their real names'b'.'b'These Internet crackdowns annoy many young Chinese, who may not think much about multiparty democracy but do want to be able to see YouTube videos.'b'My hope is that 'b'the new Chinese leader, Xi Jinping'b', will recognize that China\xe2\x80\x99s economic competitiveness and ability to fight corruption depend upon openness. Deng Xiaoping used to compare reform to opening a window, admitting a few flies along with fresh air. During Deng\xe2\x80\x99s watch, China embraced potentially troublesome communications technologies \xe2\x80\x94 photocopiers, cellphones, fax machines \xe2\x80\x94 because they are also indispensable to modernization. So is a free Web.'b'So to the new Politburo, a suggestion: How about cracking down on Web sites that sell guns and drugs, while leaving alone those that traffic in ideas and information?'b'It took more than four decades, but 'b'a full pardon has finally been issued'b' by Gov. Bev Perdue of North Carolina, proclaiming the innocence of the Wilmington 10, a group of civil rights activists who were wrongly convicted and imprisoned when a white-owned grocery store was firebombed in 1971.'b'The injustice of their trial was fully documented by a federal appeals court in a 1980 ruling that overturned the conviction on the grounds of perjured testimony and prosecution misconduct. But the 10 activists remained under an official cloud for decades, their lives shadowed by public doubts and the theoretical possibility of a new trial on the old charges.'b'Governor Perdue put an end to those questions Monday with 'b'a forthright acknowledgment'b' that \xe2\x80\x9cthese convictions were tainted by naked racism and represent an ugly stain on North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s criminal justice system.\xe2\x80\x9d The convictions fell apart when the crucial witness recanted his testimony amid mounting evidence that the prosecution abused the rights of the defendants as they maintained their innocence.'b'The governor said she was \xe2\x80\x9cappalled\xe2\x80\x9d by the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s recently uncovered notes showing that he had favored Ku Klux Klan members in putting a white majority on the jury.'b'Four of the Wilmington 10 have died, and others have had trouble recovering from the ordeal. Ben Chavis, who was a 24-year-old civil rights activist when he was sentenced to 34 years in prison at the trial, thanked the governor for showing \xe2\x80\x9ctremendous courage\xe2\x80\x9d in declaring that the 10 were never guilty of anything. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have justice today,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chavis, now 64. The pardon by Ms. Perdue, who leaves office this month, helps to close a dark chapter in the state\xe2\x80\x99s history.'b'Few relationships are as important to stability in Asia as the one between Japan and South Korea. Yet Japan\xe2\x80\x99s new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, seems inclined to start his tenure with a serious mistake that would inflame tensions with South Korea and make cooperation harder. 'b'He has signaled'b' that he might seek to revise Japan\xe2\x80\x99s apologies for its World War II aggression, including one for using Koreans and other women as sex slaves.'b''b'In 1993'b', Japan finally acknowledged that the Japanese military had raped and enslaved thousands of Asian and European women in army brothels, and offered its first full apology for those atrocities. A broader apology by Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama 'b'in 1995'b' conceded that \xe2\x80\x9cthrough its colonial rule and invasion,\xe2\x80\x9d Japan had caused \xe2\x80\x9ctremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In an interview with the Sankei Shimbun newspaper, Mr. Abe, a right-wing nationalist, was quoted by Reuters on Monday as saying he wants to replace the 1995 apology with an unspecified \xe2\x80\x9cforward looking statement.\xe2\x80\x9d He said that his previous administration, in 2006-7, had found no evidence that the women who served as sex slaves to Japan\xe2\x80\x99s wartime military had, in fact, been coerced. However, at a news conference last week, the chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said that Mr. Abe would uphold the 1995 apology but hinted he may revise the 1993 statement.'b'It is not clear how Mr. Abe, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, might modify the apologies, but he has previously made no secret of his desire to rewrite his country\xe2\x80\x99s wartime history. Any attempt to deny the crimes and dilute the apologies will outrage South Korea, as well as China and the Philippines, which suffered under Japan\xe2\x80\x99s brutal wartime rule.'b'Mr. Abe\xe2\x80\x99s shameful impulses could threaten critical cooperation in the region on issues like North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear weapons program. Such revisionism is an embarrassment to a country that should be focused on improving its long-stagnant economy, not whitewashing the past.'b'Republicans won more in the fiscal-cliff deal than they had any right to expect. Permanent tax cuts for the middle class and millions of wealthy families, a permanent break on the estate tax and dividends, a five-year limit on tax credits for low-income families, and only a single year of extended unemployment insurance. Yet 'b'64 percent of House Republicans'b' 'b'voted against it Tuesday night'b'.'b'Their explanations reeked of tired ideology about never raising anyone\xe2\x80\x99s taxes and the lack of spending cuts. If not for Speaker John Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s last-moment decision to allow the bill to pass without a Republican majority, everyone\xe2\x80\x99s income taxes would have gone up.'b'The unwillingness of Mr. Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s caucus to join such decisions for the common good suggests that the 113th Congress, which begins on Thursday, will be bitterly unproductive, and possibly even more dangerous than the last Congress. Republicans say they are more determined than ever to extract the maximum amount of budget-cutting pain in the next two months by threatening not to 'b'raise the debt ceiling'b'.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s a far more serious prospect than going over the fiscal cliff. Letting the Treasury run out of borrowing authority would mean a default on the nation\xe2\x80\x99s credit, a catastrophic prospect for holders of government bonds around the world. It could result in further credit downgrades and lead to sharply higher borrowing costs. It is an unimaginable prospect for a responsible country, yet 'b'it almost happened in 2011'b' because of the irresponsibility of Congressional Republicans.'b'Mr. Obama sounded resolute on Tuesday night in vowing he will not submit to this blackmail. \xe2\x80\x9cI will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they\xe2\x80\x99ve already racked up through the laws that they passed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. But will he really keep this promise?'b'The White House won several victories in the fiscal-cliff package, but its eagerness for a deal disappointed many who believed the president\xe2\x80\x99s promise to raise far more revenue. It is hard to see how he avoids giving in to Republican demands, as he was forced to do in 2011.'b'Mr. Obama has also said he will demand equivalent revenue increases for every dollar of spending cuts won by Republicans over the next year. That could be done by further limits on deductions and loopholes for corporations and the rich, including eliminating the carried-interest loophole that lets hedge fund managers declare that their income is a form of capital gains. But it will be a struggle to uphold that pledge, given the maddening nature of his opponents.'b'In the weeks to come, Republicans will use not just the debt-ceiling threat, but also the $100 billion across-the-board cuts known as the sequester, delayed for two months in this week\xe2\x80\x99s deal, and the potential shutdown of the government when the current spending resolution expires in March. Standing up to brinkmanship will require a level of resolve that the president has yet to fully demonstrate.'b'We have a deal. But please hold your applause, indefinitely.'b'We momentarily went over the fiscal cliff but clawed our way back up the rock face. Unfortunately, we are most likely in store for a never-ending series of cliffs for our economy, our government and indeed our country. Soon we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to deal with the sequester, a debt-ceiling extension and possibly a budget, all of which hold the specter of revisiting the unresolvable conflicts and intransigence of the fiscal cliff. Imagine an M. C. Escher drawing of cliffs.'b'Be clear: there is no reason to celebrate. This is a mournful moment. We \xe2\x80\x94 and by we I mean Congress, and by Congress I mean the Republicans in Congress \xe2\x80\x94 have again demonstrated just how broken and paralyzed our government has become, how beholden to hostage-takers, how vulnerable to extremism.'b'A fiscal cliff deal was cut at the last possible minute, covering a minimal number of issues. It was far from perfect and barely palatable. It was a compromise, and compromises are inherently imperfect. No one likes the whole of it, but they balance the bad parts against the good and see beyond dissension.'b'As the fiscal cliff votes came down to the wire, many repeated the aphorism: don\xe2\x80\x99t let the perfect be the enemy of the good. But sadly, we are beyond even that. Now the perfunctory has become the victim of the grueling.'b'The American people suffered through another moment of manufactured suspense brought on by political malpractice. There was no grand bargain. There was only a begrudging acquiescence.'b'Not only is the 'b'era of grand bargains \xe2\x80\x9cover,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' as Jennifer Steinhauer wrote in The Times on Tuesday, I believe that the era of basic governance is screeching to a halt.'b'As Steinhauer 'b'pointed out in September'b':'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe 112th Congress is set to enter the Congressional record books as the least productive body in a generation, passing a mere 173 public laws as of last month. That was well below the 906 'b'enacted from January 1947 through December 1948'b' by the body President Harry S. Truman referred to as the \xe2\x80\x98do-nothing\xe2\x80\x99 Congress, and far fewer than even a single session of many prior Congresses.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s an abominable shame. The one function of a lawmaker is to make laws. They can no longer seem to do that in any meaningful way.'b'It is no wonder that Gallup finds Congress\xe2\x80\x99s approval rating 'b'stuck in the teens'b'.'b'We have moved from a type of governance where the art of the compromise was invaluable to one where adherence to ridiculous pledges is inviolable. (By approving this fiscal cliff deal, many Republicans voted to broadly raise taxes for the first time in decades and many are still grousing about it.)'b'The change has taken place primarily among Republicans, who have struggled to balance the responsibilities and prerogatives of minority-party status with the anxiety of losing their long-held power at the expense of the growing influence of minority and historically marginalized constituencies like women and gays.'b'Smaller federal government! Out-of-control federal spending! States\xe2\x80\x99 rights! Defense of Marriage! Defund Planned Parenthood! There is an individual argument (merit not withstanding) to be made about each of these issues in its own right. But only a person who is willfully blind or hopelessly ignorant would not acknowledge the common thread that runs through them: the fear of a future in which income, wealth and cultural inequalities dissipate and traditional power structures dissolve.'b'The country\xe2\x80\x99s debt and solvency are real and legitimate concerns, but the true crux of the friction lies in the implicit arguments about the cause of our troubles. It is the tired and worn takers vs. makers argument just slathered in lipstick \xe2\x80\x94 Resistance Red, I suppose.'b'And since some of these Republicans are from safely gerrymandered districts, they have little to lose and something to gain by holding the line even if it continually pushes the country to the brink.'b'House Republicans like to say that Americans voted for a divided government and this gridlock is what becomes it. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not entirely correct. As 'b'The Economist'b' pointed out in November:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Democrats won 50.6% of the votes for president, to 47.8% for the Republicans; 53.6% of the votes for the Senate, to 42.9% for the Republicans; and... 49% of the votes for the House, to 48.2% for the Republicans (some ballots are still being counted). That\xe2\x80\x99s not a vote for divided government. It\xe2\x80\x99s a clean sweep.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Republicans control the House in part because of the geography of ideology \xe2\x80\x94 cities tend to have high concentrations of Democrats and rural areas have high concentrations of Republicans \xe2\x80\x94 and because of the way district lines were redrawn, in many cases by Republican-led state legislatures.'b'So we will be soon be pushed back into a state of panic because Republican members of Congress demand a state of paralysis.'b'We are stuck with this reckless, whining and ultimately dangerous gaggle of wounded spirits. As many people can attest, an animal is often at its most dangerous when it\xe2\x80\x99s sick, wounded or afraid. Brace yourselves.'b'There is a lot of finger-pointing in Washington about who is responsible for the mess made of the so-called fiscal-cliff negotiations, but there is no doubt about who 'b'failed thousands of residents and businesses devastated by Hurricane Sandy'b' and still waiting for help: Speaker John Boehner.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s not just our view. Ask Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Representative Peter King of New York, both dedicated Republican soldiers. Mr. Christie said there was \xe2\x80\x9conly one group to blame\xe2\x80\x9d for the money being delayed six times longer than relief for Hurricane Katrina: the Republican majority and Mr. Boehner personally.'b'In 'b'a joint statement'b', Mr. Christie and Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen American citizens are in need, we come to their aid. That tradition was abandoned in the House last night.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Christie called the delay in aid \xe2\x80\x9cdisappointing and disgusting.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Boehner had promised to allow the House to vote this week on a $60.4 billion aid package that easily passed the Senate. But he reneged while trying to get out of the way of a final agreement on the fiscal cliff. Now the relief effort will have to begin again with the incoming Congress, and that means more time wasted and possibly less help for those who need it.'b'Whether Mr. Boehner can revive the Senate package in a few weeks, as now promised, is uncertain, because it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear whether he actually leads the right-dominated Republican caucus anymore. House Republicans are now looking at a patchwork response, starting with a $9 billion down payment mostly for flood insurance. The rest, if it comes at all, would come in other measures.'b'It has been more than 66 days since Hurricane Sandy slammed into New York and New Jersey killing more than 130 people and causing an estimated $82 billion in damage. Within 10 days after Hurricane Katrina flooded the Gulf Coast in 2005, Washington agreed on more than $60 billion in aid with more to come.'b'Residents and political leaders in the areas hit hardest by Sandy are understandably outraged about the delay. Mr. King was right both in substance and tenor on Wednesday when he said: \xe2\x80\x9cThese Republicans have no problem finding New York when they\xe2\x80\x99re out raising millions of dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. King said Northeasterners should stop donating money to Republican lawmakers, who he said had \xe2\x80\x9cput a knife in the back of New Yorkers and New Jerseyans.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The $60.4 billion falls short of the original request by Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Christie, but it would at least make a good start. The Senate bill included money to reimburse local governments for overtime. There was $17 billion to help finance the rebuilding of homes and businesses that the Federal Emergency Management Agency would not cover. There was $11 billion for rebuilding and hardening the transportation system in the region, and more than $5 billion for flood control and shore strengthening projects.'b'The aid was overdue before Mr. Boehner tossed the Senate package aside on Tuesday.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'So Many Snapshots, So Few Voices Saved'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Sunday Observer, Dec. 30): Let\xe2\x80\x99s hear it for Verlyn Klinkenborg.

Yields on Treasury bonds jumped as traders quickly dumped 10- and 30-year government bonds.'b'What was the profound economic news that caused this mini-convulsion in the market? Did the minutes reveal a weak spot in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s economic-growth prospects? Was word of December\xe2\x80\x99s employment numbers, scheduled for announcement on Friday, somehow leaked?'b'No. What spooked traders was surprise. The Fed minutes revealed deeper divisions within the central bank\xe2\x80\x99s ranks about the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s aggressive bond-buying efforts than many observers had supposed.'b'The events in the bond market today are an instructive lesson in the power of communication: when the Fed speaks, the fewer surprises, the better.'b'In the 1990s, those who hoped to divine the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s next move would study the girth of 'b'Alan Greenspan\xe2\x80\x99s briefcase'b'. If the Fed chairman\xe2\x80\x99s worn black satchel appeared to be bulging, many believed that a new monetary policy action was imminent. If not, then no change was foretold.'b'Until that time, the Fed chairman, governors and regional Fed bank presidents, like most central bankers around the world, gave few, if any, hints about the group\xe2\x80\x99s long-term thinking on interest rates and strategies for regulating the nation\xe2\x80\x99s money supply \xe2\x80\x94 decisions that would ultimately affect the borrowing costs for tens of millions of Americans. And when the Fed did speak, it was mostly in impenetrable syntax-bending tidbits of Delphic inscrutability.'b'The grand tradition of the oracular tight-lipped central banker, however, ended with a bang last month, when the current Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said it would keep short-term interest rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate 'b'remained above 6.5 percent'b' and as long inflation and inflation expectations continued to be contained. As the meeting minutes released on Thursday showed, this was a controversial change within the Fed; most of the group wanted to give an explicit unemployment threshold rather than continue the traditional approach of elegant vagueness \xe2\x80\x94 but not all.'b'All of this may seem like mumbo-jumbo to those unfamiliar with the jargon of monetary policy. But to veteran Fed watchers, this was a \xe2\x80\x9cReal Housewives\xe2\x80\x9d-level of candor.'b'Strong arguments can be made for whether or not it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate for the Fed to continue its extraordinary effort to stimulate the economy by flatlining interest rates, by buying up Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities and by flooding the economy with bank reserves \xe2\x80\x94 a policy known as quantitative easing. I believe the two previous rounds helped to prevent a 1930s-style deflation from taking hold but share the group\xe2\x80\x99s concern, as revealed in the December minutes, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe benefits of ongoing purchases were uncertain and that the potential costs could rise as the size of the balance sheet increased.\xe2\x80\x9d (It was that concern \xe2\x80\x94 that the program of asset purchases could be 'b'cut short'b' \xe2\x80\x94 that caused the ruckus in the markets on Thursday.)'b'But that said, the fewer surprises and mixed messages in communication there are, the more likely the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to shore up the American economy will be effective. In this regard, the central bank\xe2\x80\x99s newest strategy of talking about itself \xe2\x80\x94 and notably, of its decision to tie its interest-rate moves to an unemployment threshold \xe2\x80\x94 is a great step forward in economic stewardship. Now, everyone knows what criteria Fed officials are using to guide future policy.'b'As stark as this move to transparency may seem, it has actually been some two decades in the making. An unlikely proponent was Mr. Greenspan himself when, under his chairmanship, the Fed began to issue brief explanations after each monetary policy meeting, including the votes of each member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank\xe2\x80\x99s policy body. This was in contrast to the first eight decades of the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s existence, when the Fed would simply buy or sell securities in the market to try to affect credit conditions \xe2\x80\x94 so-called open market operations \xe2\x80\x94 without acknowledging its actions or revealing its intentions.'b'Under Mr. Bernanke, lips have loosened rapidly with quarterly news conferences, forecasts by F.O.M.C. members of key economic indicators, countless testimonies before Congress and, now, the explicit adoption of a 2 percent inflation goal.'b'The advantage of such glasnost is that it can give the Fed greater bang for its buck. Buying more government bonds may bring down interest rates today, but getting people to believe that the Fed will continue such \xe2\x80\x9caccommodative\xe2\x80\x9d policies adds to the potency of its actions in two ways: expectations of future borrowing costs stay low, and uncertainty about future monetary policy (and hence, future borrowing costs) declines. Such knowledge lets firms be more confident about investing and hiring, and gives homeowners and potential home buyers more faith that mortgages will stay affordable, providing support for the housing market.'b'Still, for the 'b'open-mouth strategy'b' to work, the words must be consistent with the direction of the policy action, otherwise those words can sabotage the impact of the actions. That\xe2\x80\x99s the lesson we learned from the Bank of Japan.'b'After the Japanese economy declined in the early 1990s and fell into deflation, the Bank of Japan dropped interest rates to nearly zero and embarked on a huge asset-purchase program (the pioneering \xe2\x80\x9cquantitative easing\xe2\x80\x9d program). The actions were on a much larger scale relative to G.D.P. than what the Fed has done.'b'Japan\xe2\x80\x99s central bank, however, made the mistake of emphasizing that these purchases were only temporary and would be reversed at the first signs of the proverbial \xe2\x80\x9cgreen shoots\xe2\x80\x9d of recovery. Despite the bank\xe2\x80\x99s large-scale asset purchases, the uncertainty that these statements created undermined confidence and the willingness to borrow. The bank\xe2\x80\x99s words spoke louder than actions.'b'The highest priority in the economic revival plan of the newly elected prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is to strong-arm the 'b'Bank of Japan'b' into acknowledging that it will do simply \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever it takes\xe2\x80\x9d to reverse deflation there and allow a recovery to take root.'b''b'Mark J.

Aberu means face \xe2\x80\x94 as in, saving face. In the nearly 34 years since the Islamic revolution in Iran, expediency has been a pillar of decision making, but within a framework that has allowed Iranian leaders to save face. If there is to be any resolution of the nuclear standoff, Western leaders must grasp these concepts. \xc2\xa0'b'Two examples illustrate this point. In 1988, after eight years of devastating war with Saddam Hussein\xe2\x80\x99s Iraq, Iran\xe2\x80\x99s first supreme leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, accepted a United Nations-brokered cease-fire agreement, deeming it to be in Iran\xe2\x80\x99s maslahat. It was crucial that Iraqi forces had been pushed off Iranian soil, so Tehran could claim a victory.'b'Thirteen years later, after the 9/11 attacks, the United States overthrew the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, which had sheltered Al Qaeda, in a matter of weeks. American troops would never have made it to Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif with such speed had Iran\xe2\x80\x99s leaders not acquiesced to the toppling of their enemies to the east. But the George W. Bush administration squandered an opportunity for dialogue by spurning this potential diplomatic overture by Iran.'b'For thousands of years, Persian culture has been distinguished by customs that revolve around honor and esteem. Preserving one\xe2\x80\x99s aberu is tantamount to maintaining one\xe2\x80\x99s dignity. There are almost no instances in modern Iranian history when maslahat has trumped aberu. The West has poorly understood these concepts. This was particularly true under President Bush, who rewarded Iran\xe2\x80\x99s tacit acceptance of the American invasion of Afghanistan by labeling Iran a member of an \xe2\x80\x9caxis of evil.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Following the 2003 allied invasion of Iraq, the Swiss ambassador to Iran 'b'reached out'b' to Washington with an unofficial outline for a \xe2\x80\x9cgrand bargain\xe2\x80\x9d with Tehran that would cover everything from Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program to its support for militant groups in the region. Despite this bold step, Iran was left out in the cold. Vice President Dick Cheney 'b'is said to have dismissed the initiative'b', reportedly asserting that \xe2\x80\x9cwe don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to evil.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We now know, thanks to a recent memoir by the former Iranian nuclear negotiator Hassan Rowhani, that the Bush administration reached out to Tehran a year after dismissing the proposal. Not surprisingly, partly because of the blow to its pride, the Iranian government rejected the offer of direct, high-level talks as insincere. In the nine years since, Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program \xe2\x80\x94 a major symbol of prestige for Iranians \xe2\x80\x94 has grown immensely. Things have gotten a lot more complicated.'b'The pattern of missed opportunities has persisted for more than three decades now. The result is that Barack Obama is the sixth consecutive president who has been led to view Iran as a threat rather than an opportunity. It is time for America to exit this vicious cycle and disregard irrational voices intent on sabotaging efforts to reach an understanding.'b'When Mr. Obama took office in 2009, he promised a real dialogue with Iran. Many in Tehran are still waiting for him to deliver on that promise. But how?'b'The foundation of post-1979 decision making in Iran is the pursuit of sovereignty within a framework that balances maslahat and aberu. We believe Iran would be open to new measures regarding the transparency of its nuclear program, and would agree not to pursue any capability to enrich uranium beyond that needed to fuel atomic power plants, if its legitimate right to enrichment under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty was recognized and if an agreement to remove sanctions was reached.'b'Equally important is how a deal would be implemented. Decades of mutual, institutionalized hostility have created a gulf of mistrust that neither side can unilaterally bridge. So getting the sequence right would be crucial to any accord.'b'While Tehran views a deal on its nuclear program as being in its self-interest, Western leaders need to grasp that it would be devastating for Iran\xe2\x80\x99s aberu to take the first step solely in exchange for promises. The dominant discourse in Tehran portrays the 2004 decision by the former Iranian president Mohammad Khatami to suspend uranium enrichment on a voluntary, temporary basis as a failure because it resulted only in humiliating calls by the West for an indefinite suspension. The moral of this narrative is that placing maslahat above aberu, even temporarily, leads to nothing good.'b'In the coming months, Iran is expected to again engage with the so-called P5+1 (the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France, along with Germany). Mr. Obama and his team, including his chief Iran negotiator, Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, should reflect on the meaning of maslahat and aberu. Understanding the Iranian mentality is key to grasping why the Iranians won\xe2\x80\x99t put expediency above dignity. The only way to stop the dispute over Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program from spinning out of control is to offer the Islamic Republic a face-saving way out.'b'The centrist fantasy of a Grand Bargain on the budget never had a chance. Even if some kind of bargain had supposedly been reached, key players would soon have reneged on the deal \xe2\x80\x94 probably the next time a Republican occupied the White House.'b'For the reality is that our two major political parties are engaged in a fierce struggle over the future shape of American society. Democrats want to preserve the legacy of the New Deal and the Great Society \xe2\x80\x94 Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid \xe2\x80\x94 and add to them what every other advanced country has: a more or less universal guarantee of essential health care. Republicans want to roll all of that back, making room for drastically lower taxes on the wealthy. Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s essentially a class war.'b'The fight over the fiscal cliff was just one battle in that war. It ended, arguably, in a tactical victory for Democrats. The question is whether it was a Pyrrhic victory that set the stage for a larger defeat.'b'Why do I say that it was a tactical victory? Mainly because of what didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen: There were no benefit cuts.'b'This was by no means a foregone conclusion. In 2011, the Obama administration was reportedly willing to raise the age of Medicare eligibility, a terrible and cruel policy idea. This time around, it was willing to cut Social Security benefits by changing the formula for cost-of-living adjustments, a less terrible idea that would nonetheless have imposed a lot of hardship \xe2\x80\x94 and probably have been politically disastrous as well. In the end, however, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen. And progressives, always worried that President Obama seems much too willing to compromise about fundamentals, breathed a sigh of relief.'b'There were also some actual positives from a progressive point of view. Expanded unemployment benefits were given another year to run, a huge benefit to many families and a significant boost to our economic prospects (because this is money that will be spent, and hence help preserve jobs). Other benefits to lower-income families were given another five years \xe2\x80\x94 although, unfortunately, the payroll tax break was allowed to expire, which will hurt both working families and job creation.'b'The biggest progressive gripe about the legislation is that Mr. Obama extracted less revenue from the affluent than expected \xe2\x80\x94 about $600 billion versus $800 billion over the next decade. In perspective, however, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t that big a deal. Put it this way: A reasonable estimate is that gross domestic product over the next 10 years will be around $200 trillion. So if the revenue take had matched expectations, it would still have amounted to only 0.4 percent of G.D.P.; as it turned out, this was reduced to 0.3 percent. Either way, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make much difference in the fights over revenue versus spending still to come.'b'Oh, and not only did Republicans vote for a tax increase for the first time in decades, the overall result of the tax changes now taking effect \xe2\x80\x94 which include new taxes associated with Obamacare as well as the new legislation \xe2\x80\x94 will be a significant reduction in income inequality, with the top 1 percent and even more so the top 0.1 percent taking a much bigger hit than middle-income families.'b'So why are many progressives \xe2\x80\x94 myself included \xe2\x80\x94 feeling very apprehensive? Because we\xe2\x80\x99re worried about the confrontations to come.'b'According to the normal rules of politics, Republicans should have very little bargaining power at this point. With Democrats holding the White House and the Senate, the G.O.P. can\xe2\x80\x99t pass legislation; and since the biggest progressive policy priority of recent years, health reform, is already law, Republicans wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have many bargaining chips.'b'But the G.O.P. retains the power to destroy, in particular by refusing to raise the debt limit \xe2\x80\x94 which could cause a financial crisis. And Republicans have made it clear that they plan to use their destructive power to extract major policy concessions.'b'Now, the president has said that he won\xe2\x80\x99t negotiate on that basis, and rightly so. Threatening to hurt tens of millions of innocent victims unless you get your way \xe2\x80\x94 which is what the G.O.P. strategy boils down to \xe2\x80\x94 shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be treated as a legitimate political tactic.'b'But will Mr. Obama stick to his anti-blackmail position as the moment of truth approaches? He blinked during the 2011 debt limit confrontation. And the last few days of the fiscal cliff negotiations were also marked by a clear unwillingness on his part to let the deadline expire. Since the consequences of a missed deadline on the debt limit would potentially be much worse, this bodes ill for administration resolve in the clinch.'b'So, as I said, in a tactical sense the fiscal cliff ended in a modest victory for the White House. But that victory could all too easily turn into defeat in just a few weeks.'b'Recently I was reading a magazine profile of a brilliant statistician. The article mentioned, in passing, that this guy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t suffer fools gladly.'b'I come across that phrase a lot. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that Al Gore and former Representative Barney Frank don\xe2\x80\x99t suffer fools gladly. Neither, apparently, did Steve Jobs, George Harrison, Pauline Kael or even Henry David Thoreau.'b'The phrase originally came from William Tyndale\xe2\x80\x99s 1534 translation of the Bible. In it, Paul was ripping into the decadent citizens of Corinth for turning away from his own authoritative teaching and falling for a bunch of second-rate false apostles. \xe2\x80\x9cFor ye suffers fool gladly,\xe2\x80\x9d Paul says with withering sarcasm, \xe2\x80\x9cseeing ye yourselves are wise.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Today, the phrase is often used as an ambiguous compliment. It suggests that a person is so smart he has trouble tolerating people who are far below his own high standards. It is used to describe a person who is so passionately committed to a vital cause that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have time for social niceties toward those idiots who stand in its way. It is used to suggest a level of social courage; a person who has the guts to tell idiots what he really thinks.'b'Sure, it would be better if such people were nicer to those around them, the phrase implies, but this is a forgivable sin in one so talented. The actor Ed Harris\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpenetrating gaze signals that this is a serious, somber man on a singular quest,\xe2\x80\x9d a writer observed in The Toronto Sun. \xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t suffer fools gladly, if at all.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This sounds fine in the abstract, but when you actually witness somebody in the act of not suffering fools gladly, it looks rotten. Once I watched a senior member of the House of Representatives rip into a young reporter after she nervously asked him an ill-informed question.'b'She was foolish about that particular piece of legislation, but, in the moment, he looked the bigger fool. He was making a snap judgment about a person with no real information about her actual qualities. He was exposing a yawning gap between his own high opinion of himself and his actual conduct in the world. He was making the mistake, which metaphysical fools tend to make, that there is no connection between your inner moral quality and the level of courtesy you present to others.'b'Smart people who\xe2\x80\x99ve thought about this usually understand that the habits we put in practice end up shaping the people we are within. \xe2\x80\x9cManners are of more importance than laws,\xe2\x80\x9d Edmund Burke wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cManners are what vex or soothe, corrupt or purify, exalt or debase, barbarize or refine us, by a constant, steady, uniform, insensible operation, like that of the air we breathe in.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In his extremely French book, \xe2\x80\x9cA Small Treatise on the Great Virtues,\xe2\x80\x9d the contemporary philosopher Andr\xc3\xa9 Comte-Sponville argues that \xe2\x80\x9cpoliteness is the first virtue, and the origin perhaps of all the others.\xe2\x80\x9d Politeness is a discipline that compels respectful behavior. Morality, he writes \xe2\x80\x9cis like a politeness of the soul, an etiquette of the inner life, a code of duties, a ceremonial of the essential.\xe2\x80\x9d (I told you it was very French.)'b'Jane Austen is the novelist most famous for advocating this point of view. In her novel \xe2\x80\x9cEmma,\xe2\x80\x9d the lead character is rude to a foolish and verbose old woman named Miss Bates. Emma\xe2\x80\x99s friend George Knightley rebukes her.'b'If Miss Bates were rich or smart or your equal, maybe this rudeness would have been tolerable, Mr. Knightley tells her, but \xe2\x80\x9cshe is poor; she has sunk from the comforts she was born to; and, if she live to old age, must probably sink more. Her situation should secure your compassion. It was badly done, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t give myself high marks on suffering fools. I\xe2\x80\x99m not rude to those I consider foolish, but I strenuously and lamentably evade them. But I do see people who handle fools well. Many members of the clergy do, as do many great teachers. In my experience, Midwesterners are more likely to treat fools well. Natural politicians do so, too. Joe Biden is effective because he loves humanity in all its shapes and sizes.'b'G. K. Chesterton had the best advice on suffering fools gladly. He put emphasis on the gladly. When you\xe2\x80\x99re with fools, laugh with them and at them simultaneously: \xe2\x80\x9cAn obvious instance is that of ordinary and happy marriage. A man and a woman cannot live together without having against each other a kind of everlasting joke. Each has discovered that the other is a fool, but a great fool. This largeness, this grossness and gorgeousness of folly is the thing which we all find about those with whom we are in intimate contact; and it is the one enduring basis of affection, and even of respect.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For years, President Obama has been stretching executive power to claim that the authorization to use military force against Al Qaeda gives him the unilateral authority to order people killed away from any battlefield without judicial oversight or public accountability \xe2\x80\x94 even when the target is an American citizen.'b'On Wednesday, a federal judge in Manhattan 'b'came down on the side of preserving secrecy'b' regarding how this dangerous view of executive power gets exercised. Judge Colleen McMahon 'b'refused to require the Justice Department to disclose a memorandum'b' providing the legal justification for the targeted killing of a United States citizen, Anwar al-Awlaki, in a 2011 drone strike in Yemen.'b'The decision came in response to a lawsuit for the memorandum and related materials filed under the Freedom of Information Act by The New York Times and two of its reporters, Charlie Savage and Scott Shane, and also a broader request under the act from the American Civil Liberties Union. We strongly disagree with Judge McMahon\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that she was compelled by a \xe2\x80\x9cthicket of laws and precedents\xe2\x80\x9d to deny access to the legal memo \xe2\x80\x94 prepared by the Department of Justice\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Office of Legal Counsel'b' \xe2\x80\x94 and other documents that provided the legal and factual basis for the killings.'b'For starters, various government officials have spoken publicly about the American role in killing Mr. Awlaki and the circumstances under which the government considers targeted killings, including of American citizens. At President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s nominating convention last summer, a video prepared by his campaign listed the killing of Mr. Awlaki prominently among Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s national security achievements.'b'Such a selective and self-serving \xe2\x80\x9cpublic relations campaign,\xe2\x80\x9d as the judge termed it, should have been deemed a waiver of the government\xe2\x80\x99s right to withhold its legal rationale from public scrutiny. Moreover, disclosing the document would not have jeopardized national security or revealed any properly classified operational details. The ruling, which is inconsistent with the purpose and history of the information disclosure law, richly deserves overturning on appeal.'b'However, we appreciate Judge McMahon\xe2\x80\x99s honest recognition of the \xe2\x80\x9cAlice-in-Wonderland nature\xe2\x80\x9d of her decision, which allows the executive branch to publicly proclaim the legality of the targeted killing program while insisting that the public may not know the reasons for that conclusion. The administration has opposed all legal efforts by Mr. Awlaki\xe2\x80\x99s father and others to compel a court review of the decision to have him killed.'b'Judge McMahon took pains to acknowledge the serious questions the targeted killing program raises about the appropriate limits on government authority in our constitutional system and expressed the view that, as a matter of policy, the administration\xe2\x80\x99s legal analysis should be made public.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMore fulsome disclosure of the legal reasoning on which the administration relies to justify the targeted killing of individuals, including united States citizens, far from any recognizable \xe2\x80\x98hot\xe2\x80\x99 field of battle, would allow for intelligent discussion and assessment of a tactic that (like torture before it) remains hotly debated,\xe2\x80\x9d the judge wrote.'b'President Obama, who pledged more government transparency in his first campaign and early days in office, should heed those sentiments and order the legal memo released along with other information that would shed light on the government\xe2\x80\x99s legal reasoning and the evidence leading to Mr. Awlaki\xe2\x80\x99s killing.'b'It is past time he did so.'b'If it were possible to compound the reasons for outrage over the serial child rape committed at Penn State, Gov. Tom Corbett took a brazenly misguided step in that direction Wednesday. 'b'The governor filed a federal lawsuit'b' to force the N.C.A.A. to revoke the highly deserved sanctions imposed on the school and its powerful football program for a scandal that reached the highest levels of the university.'b'Governor Corbett barely mentioned the young victims in complaining that the state\xe2\x80\x99s economy, its citizens, students and, of course, the all-important Pennsylvania State University football fans were being unfairly penalized for the abuse and rape of children by Jerry Sandusky, the imprisoned former assistant coach who for years used the football program as a lure for his young victims.'b'Surrounded by a claque of business leaders, students, politicians and athletes, Governor Corbett held a pep rally to announce 'b'the suit'b'. He denounced the N.C.A.A. as unfairly crimping the lucrative football program \xe2\x80\x94 largely ignoring the core finding by a special inquiry last July that \xe2\x80\x9cthe most powerful men at Penn State failed to take any steps for 14 years to protect the children who Sandusky victimized.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'The inquiry found'b' concern for the vaunted football program led to a long-running cover-up of Sandusky\xe2\x80\x99s behavior by top university officials, including Joe Paterno, the disgraced football coach 'b'who died last January'b'. The sanctions were agreed to in July by the university, which is not a party to the governor\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit. They included a $60 million fine, four years\xe2\x80\x99 suspension from bowl game participation and the expunging of the university\xe2\x80\x99s victory records during the Sandusky years. They were initially endorsed by Governor Corbett, a member of the Penn State board of trustees, as \xe2\x80\x9cpart of the corrective process.\xe2\x80\x9d But Mr. Corbett, who is facing re-election next year, said he since concluded the N.C.A.A. violated its own rules and sought to \xe2\x80\x9cpile on\xe2\x80\x9d the university to counteract complaints that it was too often \xe2\x80\x9csoft\xe2\x80\x9d in disciplining misbehavior.'b'In his foolhardy lawsuit, the governor bypassed incoming state attorney general 'b'Kathleen Kane'b' to hire an outside law firm to pursue his case in the name of the state. Ms. Kane declined to comment, but in her election campaign last year she promised to look into why it took so long for the pedophilia scandal to be investigated when Mr. Corbett previously served as attorney general.'b'In his complaints, the governor only confirmed the inquiry finding that the university\xe2\x80\x99s obsession with football predominance helped drive the cover-up of Mr. Sandusky\xe2\x80\x99s crimes. Mr. Corbett extolled football\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic engine\xe2\x80\x9d and bemoaned the \xe2\x80\x9cdiminution in value of the Penn State educational and community experience\xe2\x80\x9d because it relied, he emphasized, \xe2\x80\x9cin part on the prominence of the Penn State football program.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It would be hard to imagine a more shortsighted misunderstanding of the scandal that continues to shake Penn State. The university is wise to accept the sanctions, whatever the governor hopes to accomplish. The penalties have caused considerable resentment among the more avid Penn State fans, but Mr. Corbett denied politics underlies his complaint. He pictured Penn State caught in the \xe2\x80\x9ceye of a media storm\xe2\x80\x9d and left to \xe2\x80\x9cclean up this tragedy that was created by the few.\xe2\x80\x9d The governor should know better than anyone that the tragedy is all about the outrageous abuse of children at Penn State, not continuing the business of football for Penn State fans.'b'Al Jazeera, the pan-Arab news network, has long wanted to gain a bigger American television audience, and it may have finally found a way to do that by buying Current TV. But as the deal was being signed, Time Warner Cable announced it would immediately 'b'stop carrying Current'b', a struggling channel partly owned by former Vice President Al Gore. While the cable company has the legal right to cut off Current, the decision is unfortunate and could block access to an important news source.'b'Many American policy makers and cable companies have had doubts about the impartiality of Al Jazeera, which is owned and financed by the emir of Qatar. Some have questioned the decision of Mr. Gore and his co-founder, Joel Hyatt, to sell Current, which is available to roughly 60 million American homes, to the Qatari government.'b'The emir, though he works closely with Washington on some issues, has interests and agendas that are sometimes at odds with United States interests. Recently, for instance, Qatar along with other Arab nations is believed to have provided arms and other assistance to terrorist organizations operating in Syria. Al Jazeera says its journalism is not directed by the policies and views of its government, but the fact that it is owned by Qatar means that there is 'b'no guarantee'b' of its independence.'b'Nonetheless, Al Jazeera could bring an important international perspective to American audiences and should be given a chance to prove itself commercially before cable companies remove Current TV from their lineups. If Al Jazeera America, the channel that the company plans to create in New York to replace Current, fails to attract a critical mass of viewers, cable companies would be justified in removing it. On Thursday, Time Warner suggested that it might add the new channel to its systems in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere later \xe2\x80\x9cas the service develops.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the Middle East, where good, independent journalism is hard to find, Al Jazeera has distinguished itself by its thorough and smart coverage of many important stories, particularly the Arab Spring. In the early days of the revolution in Egypt, many people in America and around the world turned to it because it did a much better job on the ground than many of its international peers.'b'Al Jazeera often brings a nuance to international stories that can be lacking on American networks, because it has more foreign correspondents and overseas bureaus than many established Western networks. Its coverage of the Arab Spring won a George Foster Peabody Award and its English-language service is broadcast to more than 250 million homes in 130 countries, including Britain, South Africa and India.'b'Doubts about'b' the independence'b' of Al Jazeera do not justify removing it from cable and satellite systems. With the exception of a few places, like Washington and New York City, 'b'Al Jazeera English'b' is not available to most American viewers. Why not let them make up their own minds about the network and its journalism?'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Paul Campos\xe2\x80\x99s argument in \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Our Absurd Fear of Fat'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Jan. 3) irresponsibly plays down the imminent obesity epidemic we face.'b'To support his argument, Mr. Campos quotes a 'b'recent meta-analysis'b' showing 6 percent lower mortality among those who are overweight compared with those of normal weight.'b'But epidemiologists have long suggested that this paradoxical finding has other explanations.

This safe harbor is intended to be an integral part of tough new rules and penalties to ensure that all future loans are underwritten in the interests of consumers.'b'Consumer protection rules in 2013 will be different from the past.

Though President Obama got 'b'a watered-down version'b' of his tax hikes for the wealthy, the spending cuts were pushed off into the future, infuriating many Republicans. Because 'b'Republicans will no longer negotiate with Obama'b', he had to outsource the negotiations to his vice president, Joe Biden.

In Rhode Island, a new law has raised the state\xe2\x80\x99s minimum wage by 35 cents an hour, to $7.75, which will work out to an average annual raise of $510 for 11,000 Rhode Islanders. In nine other states \xe2\x80\x94 Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont and Washington \xe2\x80\x94 laws that peg the minimum wage to inflation will result in increases of 10 cents to 15 cents an hour, for hourly wages ranging from $7.35 in Missouri to $9.19 in Washington.'b'By contrast, the federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009. In all, 19 states and the District of Columbia set their minimums above that level, providing a much needed lift for the lowest-paid workers. But state efforts are no substitute for a higher federal minimum because the ability to earn a minimally acceptable income should not depend on where a worker lives.'b'Will Congress finally raise the federal minimum wage this year? It would be the least that lawmakers could do. In the fiscal cliff deal, lawmakers locked in big tax breaks for wealthy investors and for heirs of multimillion-dollar estates. At the same time, they allowed the payroll tax cut for low- and middle-income taxpayers to expire, without enacting new provisions to ease the blow. The lowest-paid workers will be hit the hardest. In the states that raised their minimum wage this year, much of the increase will be eaten up by the higher payroll tax. In the other states, paychecks will simply be smaller.'b'Efforts to raise the minimum invariably run into arguments that employers, especially small businesses, cannot afford to pay a higher wage. But the 'b'evidence'b' shows that most low-wage employees work for large companies, which have largely recovered from the recession and have reinstituted generous pay packages for executives. As for low-wage workers at small businesses, many are waitresses and other \xe2\x80\x9ctipped\xe2\x80\x9d workers for whom the federal minimum wage is $2.13 an hour, where it has been since 1991. Clearly, there is ample room for an increase.'b'A related argument is that a higher minimum wage destroys jobs, especially employment for teenagers. But research shows that most low-wage workers are over the age of 20 and 'b'suggests'b' that paying them 'b'a higher wage'b' could actually create jobs by bolstering consumer spending.'b'A higher minimum wage is also an obvious way to counter the accelerating trend toward low-wage work and growing income inequality. For decades, various forces, including the decline in unionization and the global competition for jobs, have pushed down wages in the United States. But the situation has become worse in the last few years, as most of the middle-wage jobs lost during the recession have been replaced with lower-paid work.'b'Raising the minimum wage is always a fight. Congress has approved legislation to do so only three times in the last 30 years. President Obama promised to take on this fight back in 2008, when he called for a federal minimum wage of $9.50 an hour by 2011, indexed to inflation. It is past time to keep the promise.'b'The murders of charity and aid workers in Pakistan has dealt a devastating blow to a national campaign to wipe out polio and other deadly diseases. 'b'On Tuesday'b', assassins ambushed and killed seven Pakistani teachers and health workers, six of them women, as they returned home from work at a children\xe2\x80\x99s community center in the Swabi district of the northwestern province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. They were affiliated with a private Pakistani aid group, Support With Working Solution, that runs health and education projects in Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s poor and lawless tribal region.'b'On Wednesday, there were reports that local police had promised extra protection for aid workers who are planning to conduct a polio vaccination campaign on Saturday in Peshawar and other cities in northwest Pakistan. That move is clearly necessary, though far from sufficient. The federal authorities need to make sure that the killers are brought to justice and make clear that murdering health workers is a terrorist act against the nation itself.'b'This week\xe2\x80\x99s slaughter followed a series of attacks across the country last month that killed nine Pakistani health workers involved in a polio vaccination drive. Most of those victims also were women, earning about $2 a day and critical in campaigns to persuade families to participate in immunization programs.'b'No one has claimed responsibility for the most recent attack, but suspicions point to the Pakistani Taliban and other militant groups that have opposed the vaccination drives, calling them a cover for government or international spies, or part of a plot to sterilize Muslim children. Those conspiracy theories intensified when the Central Intelligence Agency used a vaccination team, led by a Pakistani doctor, to visit Osama bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s house in 2011.'b'The vaccination programs are essential to the protection of Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s citizens. After a two-decades-long global vaccination campaign, the world is on the verge of eradicating polio. Only in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria is the disease still endemic. In 2011, Pakistan counted 198 new infections, the highest in the world. Without safety for health workers, this scourge will never be eradicated.'b'A small but important 'b'provision'b' of the military budget bill 'b'just signed'b' by President Obama ends a longstanding act of discrimination against women who serve in America\xe2\x80\x99s military.'b'Offered by Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, the provision lifts a statutory ban on giving female service members insurance coverage for abortions in cases of rape and incest. Since 1988, 'b'military health plans'b' have paid for abortions only when a pregnancy endangers a women\xe2\x80\x99s life.'b'That policy was all the more unjustifiable given the serious and 'b'continuing problem'b' of sexual assault among service members, and in light of the more respectful treatment accorded civilians who work for the federal government or rely on Medicaid. These nonsoldiers are allowed to use their government insurance to pay for abortions in cases of rape as well as in life-threatening situations.'b'The new provision does not end the difficulty that military women have in accessing safe abortion care. Next, Congress and the administration must end another longstanding restriction that prevents servicewomen from obtaining abortions at military hospitals and clinics, even if the women pay the bill. Current law bans abortions at military facilities, except in instances of rape or incest, or when a pregnancy threatens a woman\xe2\x80\x99s life.'b'The rule is a special hardship for servicewomen stationed in foreign countries, particularly in a war zone like Afghanistan. Women serving overseas should have the same basic health care that other American women enjoy and should not have to risk their health, privacy or future career advancement in order to exercise a constitutionally protected right.'b'Two New York Democrats, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Representative Louise Slaughter, will soon be reintroducing legislation to allow women to obtain abortions on military bases with private funds. It asks members of Congress to stop burdening soldiers with ideological restrictions on their health care.'b'A tour of the old World\xe2\x80\x99s Fair grounds in Queens on a recent weekday felt a little like walking through an aging Hollywood stage set. In the 1930s, superbuilder Robert Moses converted what had been a miserable ash heap covering more than 1,300 acres into a suitable site for the 1939-40 World\xe2\x80\x99s Fair \xe2\x80\x94 complete with grand pools, fountains and boulevards. The 140 feet high 'b'Unisphere'b', built for the 1964-65 World\xe2\x80\x99s Fair, languishes at one end of what is now known as Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, a vast, overused and underfinanced public space and the largest city park in Queens.'b'For all its shabbiness, this park is greatly coveted, not only by Queens residents but by popular and profitable sports enterprises. The United States Tennis Association has been a major leaseholder since the United States Open arrived in 1978. Now Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Major League Soccer officials are talking about a new soccer stadium, partly as a way to help rejuvenate the park.'b'The 25,000-seat stadium would replace a large, gummy pond once referred to as the Pool of Industry, and the league has promised to completely restore the park\xe2\x80\x99s raggedy public soccer fields before it breaks ground on a new facility. One argument for having a major league team in Queens is that many New Yorkers who came from soccer-mad nations now live nearby and would presumably support a local franchise. Another is that it could provide a source of revenue to help fix up the park.'b'But there is a long way to go before this tantalizing idea becomes a workable reality. City and league officials will have to convince the community that replacing about 13 acres of open parkland with a private facility would be an improvement. They would also have to find an equivalent amount of suitable parkland elsewhere in the community. City Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras calls the park \xe2\x80\x9cthe heart and lungs\xe2\x80\x9d of a community that, she says, \xe2\x80\x9ccannot afford to lose one inch of public green space.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Flushing Meadows has already lost some of its territory to the tennis association, which is seeking to enlarge its existing footprint. Though the association, whose courts are mostly public, has made some efforts to reach out to the community, many Queens residents see the center as a playground for Manhattanites with little connection to their community. Local skepticism about another stadium is thus to be expected. To overcome it, major league soccer will have to add more public resources before taking away a few acres of a beloved park.'b'America has slavery on the brain these days.'b'There were the recent releases of the movies \xe2\x80\x9cLincoln\xe2\x80\x9d (which I found enlightening and enjoyable) and \xe2\x80\x9cDjango Unchained\xe2\x80\x9d (which I found a profound love story with an orgy of excesses and muddled moralities). I guess my preferences reflect my penchant for subtlety. Sometimes a little bit of an unsettling thing goes a long way, and a lot goes too far. Aside from its gratuitous goriness, \xe2\x80\x9cDjango Unchained\xe2\x80\x9d reportedly used the N-word more than 100 times. \xe2\x80\x9cLincoln\xe2\x80\x9d used it only a handful. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly where my threshold is, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s well shy of the century mark.'b'And there was this week the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, one of the most important documents in this country\xe2\x80\x99s archives.'b'All of this has caused me to think deeply about the long shadow of slavery, the legacy of that most grievous enterprise and the ways in which that poison tree continues to bear fruit.'b'To be sure, America has moved light-years forward from the days of slavery. But the idea that progress toward racial harmony would or should be steady and continuous is fraying. And the pillars of the institution \xe2\x80\x94 the fundamental devaluation of dark skin and strained justifications for the unconscionable \xe2\x80\x94 have proved surprisingly resilient.'b'For instance, in October, The Arkansas Times 'b'reported'b' that Jon Hubbard, a Republican state representative, wrote in a 2009 self-published book that \xe2\x80\x9cthe institution of slavery that the black race has long believed to be an abomination upon its people may actually have been a blessing in disguise.\xe2\x80\x9d His misguided point was that for all the horrors of slavery, blacks were better off in America than in Africa.'b'This was a prevailing, wrongheaded, ethically empty justification for American slavery when it was legal.'b'Robert E. Lee wrote in 1856: \xe2\x80\x9cThe blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally, physically, and socially. The painful discipline they are undergoing is necessary for their further instruction as a race, and will prepare them, I hope, for better things.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And in a famous 1837 speech on the Senate floor, John C. Calhoun declared: \xe2\x80\x9cI hold that in the present state of civilization, where two races of different origin, and distinguished by color, and other physical differences, as well as intellectual, are brought together, the relation now existing in the slaveholding States between the two, is, instead of an evil, a good \xe2\x80\x94 a positive good.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Lee was later appointed commander in chief of the armies of the South, and Calhoun had been vice president and became secretary of state. But in November, Hubbard lost his seat; I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s progress.'b'Still, the persistence of such a ridiculous argument does not sit well with me. And we should all be unsettled by the tendency of some people to romanticize and empathize with the Confederacy.'b'A 'b'Pew Research Center poll'b' released in April 2011 found that most Southern whites think it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate for modern-day politicians to praise Confederate leaders, the only demographic to believe that.'b'A 'b'CNN poll'b' also released that month found that nearly 4 in 10 white Southerners sympathize more with the Confederacy than with the Union.'b'What is perhaps more problematic is that negative attitudes about blacks are increasing. According to an October 'b'survey by The Associated Press'b': \xe2\x80\x9cIn all, 51 percent of Americans now express explicit anti-black attitudes, compared with 48 percent in a similar 2008 survey. When measured by an implicit racial attitudes test, the number of Americans with anti-black sentiments jumped to 56 percent, up from 49 percent during the last presidential election.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Not progress.'b'In fact, it feels as though slavery as an analogy has become subversively chic. Herman Cain, running as a Republican presidential candidate, built an entire campaign around this not-so-coded language, 'b'saying'b' that he had left \xe2\x80\x9cthe Democrat plantation,\xe2\x80\x9d calling blacks \xe2\x80\x9c'b'brainwashed'b'\xe2\x80\x9d and arguing, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe racism in this country today holds anybody back in a big way.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As the best-selling author Michelle Alexander pointed out in her sensational 2010 book \xe2\x80\x9cThe New Jim Crow,\xe2\x80\x9d various factors, including the methodical mass incarceration of black men, has led to the disintegration of the black family, the disenfranchisement of millions of people, and a new and very real era of American oppression.'b'As Alexander confirmed to me Friday: \xe2\x80\x9cToday there are more African-American adults under correctional control \xe2\x80\x94 in prison or jail, on probation or parole \xe2\x80\x94 than were enslaved in 1850, a decade before the Civil War began.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Definitely not progress.'b'2012: I call it the year in \xe2\x80\x9cmeh.\xe2\x80\x9d Not the worst we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever experienced, but nothing particularly great to say about it either.

K., the Standup program, engineered by a team of computer scientists in Scotland, is one of the more successful efforts to emerge from a branch of artificial intelligence known as computational humor, which seeks to model comedy using machines.'b'As verbal interaction between humans and computers becomes more prominent in daily life \xe2\x80\x94 from Siri, Apple\xe2\x80\x99s voice-activated assistant technology, to speech-based search engines to fully automated call centers \xe2\x80\x94 demand has grown for \xe2\x80\x9csocial computers\xe2\x80\x9d that can communicate with humans in a natural way. Teaching computers to grapple with humor is a key part of this equation.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHumor is everywhere in human life,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Purdue computer scientist 'b'Julia M. Taylor'b', who helped organize the first-ever United States symposium on the artificial intelligence of humor, in November. If we want a computational system to communicate with human life, it needs to know how to be funny, she says.'b'As it turns out, this is one of the most challenging tasks in computer science. Like much of language, humor is loaded with abstraction and ambiguity. To understand it, computers need to contend with linguistic sleights like irony, sarcasm, metaphor, idiom and allegory \xe2\x80\x94 things that don\xe2\x80\x99t readily translate into ones and zeros.'b'On top of that, says 'b'Lawrence J. Mazlack'b' of the University of Cincinnati, a seminal figure in the field of computational linguistics, humor is context-dependent: what\xe2\x80\x99s funny in one situation may not be funny in another. As an example, he cites Henny Youngman\xe2\x80\x99s signature line, \xe2\x80\x9cTake my wife \xe2\x80\x94 please,\xe2\x80\x9d which came about by 'b'accident'b' when an usher seating Youngman\xe2\x80\x99s wife mistook the comedian\xe2\x80\x99s request for a gag.'b'The cognitive processes that cause people to snicker at this sort of one-liner are only partly understood, which makes it all the more difficult for computers to mimic them. Unlike, say, chess, which is grounded in a fixed set of rules, there are no hard-and-fast formulas for comedy.'b'To get around that cognitive complexity, computational humor researchers have by and large taken a more concrete approach: focusing on simple linguistic relationships, like double meanings, rather than on trying to model the high-level mental mechanics that underlie humor.'b'Standup, for instance, 'b'writes jokes'b' by searching through a \xe2\x80\x9clexical database\xe2\x80\x9d (basically, a huge dictionary) for words that fit linguistic patterns found in puns \xe2\x80\x94 phonetic and semantic similarities, mostly \xe2\x80\x94 and comes up with doozies like: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you call a fish tank that has a horn? A goldfish bull.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Another tack has been to apply machine-learning algorithms, which crunch mountains of data to identify statistical features that can be used to classify text as funny or unfunny. This is more or less how spam filters work: they decide which messages to tag by analyzing billions of e-mails and compiling a database of red flags (like any urgent message from a deposed Nigerian prince).'b'Figuring out when a joke is a joke is where artificial intelligence researchers have made, perhaps, the most progress. For her Ph.D. dissertation, Dr. Taylor 'b'built a system'b' that could identify children\xe2\x80\x99s jokes out of various selections of prose with remarkable accuracy. Not only that, but it could also explain why it found something funny, which suggests that on some level it \xe2\x80\x9cgot\xe2\x80\x9d the jokes.'b'In a related 'b'experiment'b', the computer scientists Rada Mihalcea at the University of North Texas, Denton, and Carlo Strapparava, now at Fondazione Bruno Kessler in Italy, trained computers to separate humorous one-liners from nonhumorous sentences borrowed from Reuters headlines, proverbs and other texts. By 'b'analyzing'b' the content and style of these sentences, the program was able to spot the jokes with an average accuracy of 87 percent.'b'Putting such research to good use, a pair of wags at the University of Washington last year taught a computer when to use the refrain \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what she said\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 theirs being one of the few academic papers to cite \xe2\x80\x9cThe Office\xe2\x80\x9d among its references.'b'Some will surely wonder if the point of such research goes beyond devising software that can make the C++ set crack up at hackathons. Thankfully, it does. The goal of computational humor, and of computational linguistics as a whole, is to design machines akin to the shipboard computer on \xe2\x80\x9cStar Trek\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 ones that can answer open-ended questions and carry on casual conversations with human beings, even William Shatner.'b'In the process, scientists hope to gain insights into the nature of humor: Why do we laugh at certain things and not at others? Why does anyone watch \xe2\x80\x9cTwo and a Half Men\xe2\x80\x9d?'b'If computer humorists can answer any of these questions, we won\xe2\x80\x99t just get a deeper understanding of how language works but also, ultimately, what it means to be human.'b'Google scored a big victory 'b'last week'b' when the Federal Trade Commission concluded that the company was not manipulating search results in ways that harmed consumers. But the 'b'agency\xe2\x80\x99s finding'b' does not completely settle the question of whether the company, which is used for more than 70 percent of all Internet searches in the United States, has abused its dominance. The European Commission and attorneys general in Texas, New York and other states who are also investigating Google could come to very different conclusions about that question.'b'While reaching a settlement with Google on a handful of relatively modest issues, the F.T.C. has left unresolved the legitimate fears that Internet companies like Expedia and Yelp have about how Google uses its power to push into online businesses like travel bookings and restaurant reviews while pushing aside rivals.'b'Even if that does not immediately leave users worse off, Google\xe2\x80\x99s critics rightly argue that it could eventually result in fewer choices for consumers if worthy Internet services fail because Google actively makes it difficult for people to find them. Competitors of Google, including Microsoft, have argued that Google often displays search results to highlight its own products, like Google Maps, Google Flights and Google Shopping. They say that by doing so it is acting as Microsoft did in the 1990s when it forced PC makers to pre-install its Internet Explorer software with the Windows operating system at the expense of rivals like Netscape.'b'But the F.T.C. did not buy that argument and concluded that Google had not harmed competition in the marketplace, even if it may have hurt individual rivals.'b'Although Google dominates Internet search today, Web users have many options. And the company\xe2\x80\x99s continued dominance is far from assured when it comes to the fast-growing world of smartphones and tablets, where many users download apps without relying on Google. But the company clearly stepped over the line with the practices it has agreed to change.'b'Google will now be required to make it easier for competitors to license certain patents that it had previously agreed to provide. It will also change policies that make it hard for businesses to manage their advertising campaigns on Google and other search engines, and it will give Web sites the ability to opt out of having their content used to bolster its specialized services like Google Local.'b'Fifteen years ago, few people predicted that Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s commanding position would be undercut so drastically by the rise of Google, Apple and others. History, however, is not necessarily prologue to the future. Antitrust regulators must remain watchful that Google does not abuse its dominant position in ways that unfairly limit consumer choices and competition.'b'Capt. Mark Kelly is a former Navy pilot and NASA astronaut and is the husband of the former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who survived an assassination attempt in 2011. The couple has formed a political action committee, 'b'Gabby PAC'b', to promote civil political discourse and the election of moderates to Congress. Captain Kelly is also the author of 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMousetronaut,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' a recently published children\xe2\x80\x99s book loosely based on a mouse that accompanied him on one of his space shuttle missions.'b''b'READING'b' I used to read a lot of science fiction \xe2\x80\x94 Robert Heinlein and Isaac Asimov \xe2\x80\x94 but then I started doing science reality. Now I read more nonfiction, particularly if it has a military aspect to it. I\xe2\x80\x99m about halfway through 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cUnbroken,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' by Laura Hillenbrand. The strength, toughness and tenacity of the main character reminds me of my wife, Gabby. Also I flew ground attack in Operation Desert Storm, which is what the character in \xe2\x80\x9cUnbroken\xe2\x80\x9d was doing in World War II, so I could relate to the story a little bit. I got shot at a lot, but I never got shot down like he did.'b''b'LISTENING'b' That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change much for me: 'b'U2'b' and 'b'Aerosmith'b'. Also Coldplay. We picked their song 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSpeed of Sound\xe2\x80\x9d'b' to go along with a slide show we put together for my second space shuttle flight. It went really well with the pictures. Also, Chris Martin, the lead singer of Coldplay, is married to Gabby\xe2\x80\x99s second cousin, Gwyneth Paltrow. 'b'Calexico'b' is one of Gabby\xe2\x80\x99s favorite bands. They\xe2\x80\x99re from Tucson and are a rock band but their music has a heavy Mexican influence, with mariachis. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty neat with the horns.'b''b'WATCHING'b' Gabby and I saw the latest James Bond movie, 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSkyfall.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b' It was good, but my personal favorite 007 movie is \xe2\x80\x9cCasino Royale,\xe2\x80\x9d because of the poker scene. I used to have a poker game at home a couple of times a month. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good, but more important than that, the people I was playing with \xe2\x80\x94 other astronauts and a few neighbors \xe2\x80\x94 were really bad.'b''b'PURCHASING'b' I bought my wife a new engagement ring for our fifth anniversary \xe2\x80\x94 a diamond with a couple of sapphires. I never was happy with the first one. She was happy with it, but I thought she deserved better.'b''b'RACING'b' I recently went with a friend and drove a couple of racecars \xe2\x80\x94 a Porsche 911 and 944 \xe2\x80\x94 at 'b'Inde Motorsports Ranch'b', a private track in Willcox, Ariz. It was a lot of fun. Without spaceflight being available to me anymore, I have to find a replacement. It reminded me of flying high-speed, low-altitude routes in the military.'b''b'EATING'b' I\xe2\x80\x99ve started to eat more 'b'kale'b'. But delicious and kale are not synonymous. If you put it in scrambled eggs, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t so bad.'b'IN a recent conversation with a fellow journalist, I voiced my exasperation at the endless talk about faith in God as the only consolation for those devastated by the unfathomable murders in Newtown, Conn. Some of those grieving parents surely believe, as I do, that this is our one and only life. Atheists cannot find solace in the idea that dead children are now angels in heaven. \xe2\x80\x9cThat only shows the limits of atheism,\xe2\x80\x9d my colleague replied. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all about nonbelief and has nothing to offer when people are suffering.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This widespread misapprehension that atheists believe in nothing positive is one of the main reasons secularly inclined Americans \xe2\x80\x94 roughly 'b'20 percent of the population'b' \xe2\x80\x94 do not wield public influence commensurate with their numbers. One major problem is the dearth of secular community institutions. But the most powerful force holding us back is our own reluctance to speak, particularly at moments of high national drama and emotion, with the combination of reason and passion needed to erase the image of the atheist as a bloodless intellectual robot.'b'The secular community is fearful of seeming to proselytize. When giving talks on college campuses, I used to avoid personal discussions of my atheism. But over the years, I have changed my mind because such diffidence contributes to the false image of the atheist as someone whose convictions are removed from ordinary experience. It is vital to show that there are indeed atheists in foxholes, and wherever else human beings suffer and die.'b'Now when students ask how I came to believe what I believe, I tell them that I trace my atheism to my first encounter, at age 7, with the scourge of polio. In 1952, a 9-year-old friend was stricken by the disease and clinging to life in an iron lung. After visiting him in the hospital, I asked my mother, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy would God do that to a little boy?\xe2\x80\x9d She sighed in a way that telegraphed her lack of conviction and said: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. The priest would say God must have his reasons, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they could be.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Just two years later, in 1954, Jonas Salk\xe2\x80\x99s vaccine began the process of eradicating polio, and my mother took the opportunity to suggest that God may have guided his research. I remember replying, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, God should have guided the doctors a long time ago so that Al wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in an iron lung.\xe2\x80\x9d (He was to die only eight years later, by which time I was a committed atheist.)'b'The first time I told this story to a class, I was deeply gratified when one student confided that his religious doubts arose from the struggles of a severely disabled sibling, and that he had never been able to discuss the subject candidly with his fundamentalist parents. One of the most positive things any atheist can do is provide a willing ear for a doubter \xe2\x80\x94 even if the doubter remains a religious believer.'b'IT is primarily in the face of suffering, whether the tragedy is individual or collective, that I am forcefully reminded of what atheism has to offer. When I try to help a loved one losing his mind to Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s, when I see homeless people shivering in the wake of a deadly storm, when the news media bring me almost obscenely close to the raw grief of bereft parents, I do not have to ask, as all people of faith must, why an all-powerful, all-good God allows such things to happen.'b'It is a positive blessing, not a negation of belief, to be free of what is known as the theodicy problem. Human \xe2\x80\x9cfree will\xe2\x80\x9d is Western monotheism\xe2\x80\x99s answer to the question of why God does not use his power to prevent the slaughter of innocents, and many people throughout history (some murdered as heretics) have not been able to let God off the hook in that fashion.'b'The atheist is free to concentrate on the fate of this world \xe2\x80\x94 whether that means visiting a friend in a hospital or advocating for tougher gun control laws \xe2\x80\x94 without trying to square things with an unseen overlord in the next. Atheists do not want to deny religious believers the comfort of their faith. We do want our fellow citizens to respect our deeply held conviction that the absence of an afterlife lends a greater, not a lesser, moral importance to our actions on earth.'b'Today\xe2\x80\x99s atheists would do well to emulate some of the great 19th-century American freethinkers, who insisted that reason and emotion were not opposed but complementary.'b'Robert Green Ingersoll, who died in 1899 and was one of the most famous orators of his generation, personified this combination of passion and rationality. Called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Great Agnostic,\xe2\x80\x9d Ingersoll insisted that there was no difference between atheism and agnosticism because it was impossible for anyone to \xe2\x80\x9cknow\xe2\x80\x9d whether God existed or not. He used his secular pulpit to advocate for social causes like justice for African-Americans, women\xe2\x80\x99s rights, prison reform and the elimination of cruelty to animals.'b'He also frequently delivered secular eulogies at funerals and offered consolation that he clearly considered an important part of his mission. In 1882, at the graveside of a friend\xe2\x80\x99s child, he declared: \xe2\x80\x9cThey who stand with breaking hearts around this little grave, need have no fear. The larger and the nobler faith in all that is, and is to be, tells us that death, even at its worst, is only perfect rest ... The dead do not suffer.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Today\xe2\x80\x99s secularists must do more than mount defensive campaigns proclaiming that we can be \xe2\x80\x9cgood without God.\xe2\x80\x9d Atheists must stand up instead of calling themselves freethinkers, agnostics, secular humanists or \xe2\x80\x9cspiritual, but not religious.\xe2\x80\x9d The last phrase, translated from the psychobabble, can mean just about anything \xe2\x80\x94 that the speaker is an atheist who fears social disapproval or a fence-sitter who wants the theoretical benefits of faith, including hope of eternal life, without the obligations of actually practicing a religion. Atheists may also be secular humanists and freethinkers \xe2\x80\x94 I answer to all three \xe2\x80\x94 but avoidance of identification with atheism confines us to a closet that encourages us to fade or be pushed into the background when tragedy strikes.'b'We must speak up as atheists in order to take responsibility for whatever it is humans are responsible for \xe2\x80\x94 including violence in our streets and schools. We need to demonstrate that atheism is rooted in empathy as well as intellect. And although atheism is not a religion, we need community-based outreach programs so that our activists will be as recognizable to their neighbors as the clergy.'b'Finally, we need to show up at gravesides, as Ingersoll did, to offer whatever consolation we can.'b'In his speech at an interfaith prayer vigil in Newtown on Dec. 16, President Obama observed that \xe2\x80\x9cthe world\xe2\x80\x99s religions \xe2\x80\x94 so many of them represented here today \xe2\x80\x94 start with a simple question: Why are we here? What gives our life meaning?\xe2\x80\x9d He could easily have amended that to \xe2\x80\x9cthe world\xe2\x80\x99s religions and secular philosophies.\xe2\x80\x9d He could have said something like, \xe2\x80\x9cWhether you are religious or nonreligious, may you find solace in the knowledge that the suffering is ours, but that those we love suffer no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0'b'Somewhere in that audience, and in the larger national audience, there were mourners who would have been comforted by the acknowledgment that their lives have meaning even if they do not regard death as the door to another life, but \xe2\x80\x9conly perfect rest.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'BEIJING'b'HERE is my prediction about China: The new paramount leader, 'b'Xi Jinping'b', will spearhead a resurgence of economic reform, and probably some political easing as well. Mao\xe2\x80\x99s body will be hauled out of Tiananmen Square on his watch, and Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning writer, will be released from prison.'b'These won\xe2\x80\x99t happen immediately \xe2\x80\x94 Xi won\xe2\x80\x99t even be named president until March \xe2\x80\x94 and I may be wrong entirely. But my hunch on this return to China, my old home, is that change is coming.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s my case for Xi as a reformer.'b'First, it\xe2\x80\x99s in his genes. His father, Xi Zhongxun, was a pioneer of economic restructuring and publicly denounced the massacre of pro-democracy protesters in 1989. Xi\xe2\x80\x99s mother chooses to live in Shenzhen, the most capitalist enclave in the country.'b'Xi is also one of the first Chinese leaders to send a child to the United States as an undergraduate. His daughter is a junior at Harvard, reflecting her parents\xe2\x80\x99 emphasis on learning English and their admiration for American education.'b'It helps that the bar is low for Xi: he follows President Hu Jintao, who is widely regarded in China as a failure. Even government ministers complain that he squandered his 10 years as leader. Today there is pent-up demand for change.'b'President Hu, who always reads speeches from texts, is a robot who surrounds himself with robots. One such robot aide is Ling Jihua, whose 23-year-old son was driving a Ferrari one night last March with two half-naked women as passengers. The car crashed on a Beijing road, killing the young man and badly injuring the women, one of whom later died.'b'Ling feared a scandal and reportedly 'b'began a cover-up'b'. He went to the morgue, according to the account I got from one Chinese official, and looked at the body \xe2\x80\x94 and then coldly denied that it was his son. He continued to work in the following weeks as if nothing had happened. The cover-up failed, and the episode underscored all that was wrong with the old leadership: the flaunting of dubious wealth, the abuse of power and the lack of any heart.'b'Xi is trying to send a message that he is different. His first act upon becoming Communist Party general secretary in November was to replicate a famous \xe2\x80\x9csouthern tour\xe2\x80\x9d by 'b'Deng Xiaoping'b' in 1992 that revived economic reforms. Xi and his team have also startled officials by telling them to stop reading empty speeches at meetings.'b'Another good sign: I hear that Wang Yang, a reformist who has been the party chief in Guangdong Province and is perhaps the single most capable leader in China today, will be named a vice premier in March.'b'The new leaders would probably prefer to accelerate economic change while minimizing political relaxation, but that is increasingly difficult as China develops an educated, worldly and self-confident middle class. Over the years, most of China\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors \xe2\x80\x94 from Taiwan to Mongolia, South Korea to Thailand \xe2\x80\x94 have become more democratic, and now even Myanmar is joining the parade. How can mighty China be more backward than Myanmar?'b'For 25 years, I\xe2\x80\x99ve regularly been visiting my wife\xe2\x80\x99s ancestral village in the 'b'Taishan'b' area of southern China. At first, the villagers were semiliterate and isolated, but now their world has been transformed. On this visit, we dropped by a farmhouse where a former peasant was using the Internet to trade stocks on his laptop. His daughter is in college, and he watches Hong Kong television on a big screen.'b'People like him are ever harder to control or manipulate, and they\xe2\x80\x99re steamed at China\xe2\x80\x99s worsening corruption. A couple of decades ago, a friend who is a son of a Politburo member was paid several hundred thousand dollars a year to lend his name to a Chinese company so that it could get cheap land from local governments. These days, the family members of leaders can rake in billions of dollars over time.'b'The 70 richest delegates to China\xe2\x80\x99s National People\xe2\x80\x99s Congress have a collective net worth of almost $90 billion, 'b'Bloomberg News reported'b'. That\xe2\x80\x99s more than 10 times the collective net worth of the entire American Congress.'b'Granted, there is evidence to counter my optimistic take. Most troubling, the authorities are cracking down on the Internet. That\xe2\x80\x99s a great leap backward, but I am skeptical that it will be sustained. Right now a fascinating test case is unfolding: a senior propaganda official censored a New Year\xe2\x80\x99s message in a major Guangdong newspaper, and now 'b'journalists are publicly demanding'b' that he be fired. Stay tuned.'b'Xi is also more nationalistic than President Hu, and I worry that a confrontation with Japan over disputed islands could escalate out of control \xe2\x80\x94 in which case all bets are off.'b'Still, the pre-eminent story of our time is the rise of China. For the last decade it has been hobbled by the failed leadership of President Hu. I\xe2\x80\x99m betting that in the coming 10 years of Xi\xe2\x80\x99s reign, China will come alive again.'b'Readers discuss the skyrocketing prices in today\xe2\x80\x99s art market.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Wall Street high rollers inflate prices to astronomical levels.

This November, auctions at 'b'Sotheby\xe2\x80\x99s'b' and 'b'Christie\xe2\x80\x99s'b' together brought in $787.3 million. Amid a financial crisis, no less.'b'In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art bought Vel\xc3\xa1zquez\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPortrait of Juan de Pareja\xe2\x80\x9d for $5.5 million ($31.4 million in 2012 dollars), then the highest price ever paid for a work of art at auction. Scholars recognized the portrait as one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s greatest paintings, yet the price, perceived by many as excessive, sparked considerable debate.'b'So how in the world did we get to the point where people pay tens of millions of dollars for works by the likes of Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Damien Hirst?'b'Do the skyrocketing prices reflect, as one might assume in a free market, the connoisseurship of an exclusive clique of brilliant collectors and their prescient art advisers? I think not.'b'Financiers know the value of hype. They understand that if artworks sell at exorbitant prices, those works \xe2\x80\x94 and the artists who created them \xe2\x80\x94 become newsworthy, regardless of whether they\xe2\x80\x99re actually any good. And the media play right along, almost never questioning the quality of the works or the abilities of the artists.'b'Historically, time has been very cruel to the reputations of all but the very best artists. But today enormous sums of money are devoted to propping up the star power of a small group of wildly overrated cult figures. Have the masters of the universe created the unpoppable bubble? Or will the child\xe2\x80\x99s voice somehow manage to rise above the buzz and proclaim that the emperor is, as many have suspected all along, buck naked?'b'Time will tell.'b'WILLIAM COLE'b' Sitges, Spain, Dec. 28, 2012'b''b''b'The writer is working on a book about art connoisseurship.'b''b''b'Readers React'b''b'Mr. Cole\xe2\x80\x99s attack on \xe2\x80\x9cwildly overrated cult figures\xe2\x80\x9d in the arts, and the allegedly gullible patrons who support them, is wildly out of touch with the current circumstances of contemporary art. The age of the heroic individual working in cheap isolation has given way to a far different and more complex system of production and consumption.'b'Many of today\xe2\x80\x99s artists are more like the Baroque masters \xe2\x80\x94 Peter Paul Rubens, for example \xe2\x80\x94 in that they must maintain complex production facilities, support a raft of artists and assistants as collaborators, use extraordinarily expensive raw materials, and create monumentally scaled works that have to be transported with great difficulty and expense over great distances to reach their fabulously wealthy patrons or public institutions.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s do some math. Let\xe2\x80\x99s say a \xe2\x80\x9cwildly overrated\xe2\x80\x9d piece sells for $10 million. The gallery pockets half. Now the production costs have to be subtracted. An artist might work for a decade on the prototype for a work that must then be painstakingly cast, fabricated and assembled. Meanwhile the foundry, the gallery and the artist incur continuing costs whether or not the work is successfully sold: insurance, transportation, rigging, maintenance. The artist\xe2\x80\x99s share then supports costs for space, staff and materials.'b'What Mr. Cole mischaracterizes is not the quality of individual artists working right now \xe2\x80\x94 certainly many will turn out to be dross, and a few will end up in art history lectures. Instead, he mischaracterizes a new age of artistic production, an age that began in the 1970s and earlier (think of Warhol\xe2\x80\x99s Factory!) and has only gained in momentum and substance in the 21st century.'b'PETER BACON HALES'b' Stone Ridge, N.Y., Jan. 2, 2013'b''b''b'The writer is professor emeritus, School of Art and Art History, the University of Illinois at Chicago.'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'Mr. Cole\xe2\x80\x99s letter about the art market is an expression of my 2 Percent Theory of Art. The theory states that in any given culture, at any given time, only 2 percent of the art, music and literature being produced is truly great.'b'The theory has two important corollaries. The first is that every generation complains about the amount of junk being produced by comparing the present scene to some purported Golden Age. English professors lament the trashy novels cluttering up the best-seller lists by calling up Dickens, Thackeray, Eliot and Hardy, handily ignoring the hundreds upon hundreds of novels that have rightly been forgotten. There was no Golden Age and there never will be.'b'The second corollary, and more directly to Mr. Cole\xe2\x80\x99s point, is that contemporary critics are often wrong about what\xe2\x80\x99s great. Yes, Hemingway, Faulkner and Beckett won Nobel Prizes, but so did Henryk Sienkiewicz, Henrik Pontoppidan and Bjornstjerne Bjornson. Who\xe2\x80\x99s read them lately? And look who didn\xe2\x80\x99t win the prize! Bjornson beat out a fellow Norwegian named Henrik Ibsen.'b'So let the billionaires spend what they will on contemporary art.

As someone who has devoted her career to postwar and contemporary art and traded hundreds of works by each of these artists, I take issue with Mr. Cole\xe2\x80\x99s assessment.'b'The four artists on his list have been commercially successful since they started making art, consistently benefiting from gallery and institutional support.

BROWN'b' Miami, Jan. 2, 2013'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'I would like to put forward the notion that Andy Warhol be removed from his list of artists that he views as flashes in the pan. Quite simply, Warhol changed the visual vocabulary of the United States, and by extension the world, through his radical departure from preconceived notions of what art is, how it functions, and, yes, ultimately how it is sold, traded and collected.'b'By celebrating the mundane and by doing so across all media, Warhol laid the foundations for (love them or hate them) contemporary visual culture, reality TV and nearly all contemporary art production today.'b'Not bad for a kid from a poor family here in Pittsburgh, where an entire museum dedicated to him resides. Oh, and one last thing: Warhol based nearly everything he did on art history and the great artists who came before him. He rethought and refigured the overarching tenets of art history to quite literally change the way we understand the world around us, and for that he is well embedded in the annals of art history, where he so firmly belongs.'b'ERIC SHINER'b' Director, The Andy Warhol Museum'b' Pittsburgh, Jan. 2, 2013'b''b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'Mr. Cole is right that the prices for much of contemporary art have risen dramatically in recent years, and that this increase is not necessarily related to our perception of the quality of the works sold. However, two points should be kept in mind.'b'First, \xe2\x80\x9cquality\xe2\x80\x9d is a highly fluid and subjective term; the consensus of informed opinion changes from year to year and from country to country, and for that matter, within a single individual over time. That volatility is particularly true for the art of one\xe2\x80\x99s own time, which by definition changes day by day. And what is the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cinformed\xe2\x80\x9d? Many \xe2\x80\x9cuninformed\xe2\x80\x9d people have better records as connoisseurs, choosing \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d works of art, than those of us who have Ph.D.\xe2\x80\x99s in art history.'b'Second, quality and price have never been completely in sync, especially (but not exclusively) when it comes to contemporary art. If they were, Rembrandt\xe2\x80\x99s etchings would bring higher prices than Damien Hirst\xe2\x80\x99s sharks and LeRoy Neiman\xe2\x80\x99s paintings.'b'The prices we are talking about are what the works go for on the art market, through dealers or at auction. The art market is not an ideal, academic exercise; it\xe2\x80\x99s a business. People buy and sell works of art for a profit. \xe2\x80\x9cQuality,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cart historical importance\xe2\x80\x9d and recognizable names are all factors in determining price, but hardly the only ones. Other, fairly objective criteria have always included such issues as authenticity, rarity, condition, subject, provenance, medium (etchings versus paintings) and even size.'b'If, in fact, some works of art are overpriced, others are probably underpriced.

But Mr. Hollande has so far done little to turn things around.'b'Since taking office, he has made a great show of talking about growth and resisting the austerity approach pushed by Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. But in practice, he has followed the same flawed policies of higher taxes and flat or lower spending that has hindered growth in other European economies.'b'On Thursday, Mr. Hollande 'b'announced'b' that his government would enact new economic reforms, but he offered few details. A true agenda for growth would include more stimulus and policies that would encourage consumption and improve the economy\xe2\x80\x99s competitiveness.'b'Mr. Hollande could, for example, borrow a page 'b'from Ireland'b', which has increased revenues through carbon taxes that have also had the beneficial effect of lowering greenhouse-gas emissions. The revenues raised could then be channeled into productive public investments in infrastructure and education, which would provide boosts to the economy in both the short and longer term.'b'Other effective reforms include dismantling state support for large corporations, or \xe2\x80\x9cnational champions\xe2\x80\x9d as they are known in France. The country has too long coddled its biggest banks and corporations at the expense of small and entrepreneurial businesses by providing them with cheap financing, thwarting acquisitions of French companies by foreigners and repeatedly bailing out poorly performing companies to prevent bankruptcies.'b'In exchange for reducing corporate welfare, Mr. Hollande could propose more flexible labor laws, say by allowing businesses to respond to slowdowns and recessions by temporarily reducing workweeks and hours. It could follow the example of Germany\xe2\x80\x99s successful government-subsidized program of shorter working hours known as 'b'Kurzarbeit'b', which makes up about two-thirds of workers\xe2\x80\x99 lost wages through a fund that is filled in good times by payroll and corporate contributions.'b'These are just some of the ideas that could provide a way forward, but few have been actively debated in Paris these days. Instead, Mr. Hollande and his government have been busy defending a controversial increase in the marginal income tax rate to 75 percent, from 41 percent, on incomes of more than a million euros (about $1.3 million).'b'The rate increase, which was struck down last month by a court on technical grounds, would last only two years and would hit a few thousand people to raise a few hundred million in new revenues. Mr. Hollande and his government have insisted they will find another way to enact the increase, even though it generates too little to have any meaningful effect on the government\xe2\x80\x99s finances. Still, it has drawn public attention away from meaningful reforms, in part because of the uproar created when the actor G\xc3\xa9rard Depardieu 'b'said he was moving'b' to Belgium to avoid paying high French taxes.'b'Mr. Hollande\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'popularity'b' has been sinking and his mostly symbolic tax increase would not reverse that trend. But a well-thought-out package of fiscal and economic reforms that put France on the path of recovery would do that and much more.'b'THE U.S. military trains its fighter pilots on a principle called the \xe2\x80\x9cOODA Loop.\xe2\x80\x9d It stands for observe, orient, decide, act.

It\xe2\x80\x99s a world in which we face three major challenges: responding to the merger of globalization and the information technology revolution, which is changing every job and workplace; dealing with our mounting debt and entitlement burdens, driven by steadily rising health care costs and unsustainable defined benefits; and, finally, developing energy sources that can grow the world economy without tipping it into disruptive climate change. (At one point last week, the Senate approved a $60.4 billion aid package to help New York and New Jersey recover from Hurricane Sandy.

And because many liberals haven\xe2\x80\x99t thought through the long-term budget implications, or wrongly assume that taxes can rise indefinitely or that the Pentagon can be shrunk to something less than a triangle, they resist sensible steps to slow the growth of Social Security and Medicare, not realizing that this course will assure before long that there isn\xe2\x80\x99t any new money to spend on, say, poor children.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I expect nothing from the G.O.P. It\xe2\x80\x99s lost and leaderless. I expect a lot from Obama, who knows what needs to be done and has said so in the past. I expect him to stop acting as a party leader and start acting like the president of the whole country. When I heard Obama say, after the election, that this time he was going to take his plan to the country, and not make the mistake again of just negotiating with Congress, I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cGreat, I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to hear what he says.\xe2\x80\x9d But all he took to the country was a plan for increasing taxes on \xe2\x80\x9cmillionaires and billionaires.\xe2\x80\x9d There was nothing comprehensive, nothing bold, no great journey for America and no risks for him. Really disappointing.'b'Maybe Obama has a strategy: First raise taxes on the wealthy, which gives him the credibility with his base to then make big spending cuts in the next round of negotiations. Could be. But raising taxes on the wealthy is easy. Now we\xe2\x80\x99re at the hard part: comprehensive tax reform, entitlement cuts, radical cost-saving approaches to health care and new investments in our growth engines. This will require taking things away from people \xe2\x80\x94 to both save and invest. A lot of lobbies will fight it. The president will need to rally the center of the country and the business community to overcome them. He\xe2\x80\x99ll have to change the polls, not just read the polls. He will have to take on his own base and the G.O.P.\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'Obama has spent a lot of time lately bashing the rich to pay their \xe2\x80\x9cfair share.\xe2\x80\x9d You know what? There are definitely some Wall Street bankers and C.E.O.\xe2\x80\x99s who deserve that bashing. But there are many successful Americans who got their wealth the old-fashioned way \xe2\x80\x94 by risk-taking, going into debt to start a business or pursue a dream. It\xe2\x80\x99s time for the president to do some risk-taking \xe2\x80\x94 to stop just hammering the wealthy, which is so easy, and to start selling the country on a strategy to multiply them. We need to tax more millionaires, but we also need more millionaires 'b'and middle classes'b' to tax. The president was elected to grow our national pie, not just re-divide it.'b'WASHINGTON'b'IT was hard not to feel sorry for John Boehner, wounded, weepy, mercilessly flogged by Chris Christie. The miserable-looking Boehner was even scaring small children.'b'After squeaking out re-election as House speaker when crazed conservatives rebelled on Thursday, Boehner summoned gruff bonhomie as he presided at a ceremonial swearing-in for House members.'b'But some of the kids posing for pictures seemed a little alarmed at Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s awkward pats, brusque small talk and barked orders when someone posed the wrong way.'b'The speaker opened his arms to help out Sean Duffy, a Republican congressman from Wisconsin who was juggling five small children and two stuffed animals. Duffy, who met his wife, Rachel, through MTV after they were on different seasons of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Real World,\xe2\x80\x9d tried to hand over his young daughter, who recoiled.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo?\xe2\x80\x9d the rejected speaker asked her, muttering sardonically, \xe2\x80\x9cYou could be a member of our caucus.\xe2\x80\x9d He followed the girl as she rolled away on the floor, trying to tickle her and making Donald Duck quacking noises. That kind of thing may work on Michele Bachmann, but Miss Duffy was having none of it.'b'It was a day for old-pol shtick. And if Boehner was the nicotine-stained prince of darkness in the House, Joe Biden was the garrulous white knight over in the Senate. Fresh from his deal-making triumph with Mitch McConnell \xe2\x80\x94 no Tickle Monster, he \xe2\x80\x94 Biden presided over the Senate ceremonial swearing-in and lived up to his reputation for \xe2\x80\x9cbringing sexy back to the Medicare-eligible set,\xe2\x80\x9d as Politico once put it.'b'Every time Biden spied a member\xe2\x80\x99s mom, he called out with utter delight, \xe2\x80\x9cMom!\xe2\x80\x9d as though she were his own, enfolding the glowing woman in a tender embrace.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMom, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you in a little bit,\xe2\x80\x9d he flirted with the mother of Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope I\xe2\x80\x99ll sneak over and see you.\xe2\x80\x9d To the mother of Senator Deb Fischer, a new Republican from Nebraska, he cooed, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got beautiful eyes, Mom.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The bouncy, irrepressible Biden also had better karma with kids, persuading one little boy to raise his hand to take the oath with his father, the new Connecticut senator, Chris Murphy. It turned into a YouTube moment so adorable it even melted the hearts of jaded journalists who usually prefer videos of Ukrainian pols fistfighting.'b'The prolix vice president had his off-kilter moments, of course. He made a risqu\xc3\xa9 frisking joke to the husband of Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, and he gushed over a brunette accompanying Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are so pretty. God love you, holy mackerel.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But it was hard not to fall for his daffy charm \xe2\x80\x94 a rare 86 minutes of feeling good about a Congress that has now officially entered Ionesco territory as the most absurd place on earth.'b'When the young daughter of Senator Ted Cruz, the new Tea Party hotshot from Texas, began crying, the vice president reassured her, noting that he was a Democrat but that \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s O.K.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When Tim Scott, the first black senator from South Carolina, came up with his muscular brother, a former football player, to pose, the 70-year-old Biden deadpanned, \xe2\x80\x9cNeed any help with your pecs, let me know.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The vice president has come in for his share of mockery by late-night comics. But fox-trotting in to save the day on the fiscal cliff as the \xe2\x80\x9cdancing partner\xe2\x80\x9d of McConnell, Biden seemed more like an indispensable partner to the detached president who loathes dealing with Congress \xe2\x80\x94 a capable, genial Captain Kirk balancing out Obama\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant but rigid Spock.'b'As the presidential historian Michael Beschloss said on Twitter, \xe2\x80\x9cBiden did for the president on Capitol Hill what J.F.K. was always too wary to let the experienced L.B.J. do for him.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A petition even popped up on the White House Web site suggesting that the Obama administration create a reality show around the vice president. C-Span ratings would go through the Capitol dome, giving Julia Louis-Dreyfus\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cVeep\xe2\x80\x9d a run for its money.'b'It was sweet justice for a man who was the victim of friendly fire from White House aides after he blurted out his support for gay marriage during the campaign while the president was still dithering, spurring Obama to do the right thing. From the beginning of their alliance in 2008, Biden felt passionately that he needed to interpret the dispassionate Obama for regular folk. It was an attitude that probably annoyed Obama, who does not like to feel dependent or beholden, having fought his way up in the world mostly under his own steam.'b'But when Obama let Biden take over the cliff talks, and when he noted with asperity that he would not debate Congress again over paying its bills, he dug into his revulsion at playing the game, his reluctance to even fake the flattering, schmoozing and ring-kissing needed to coax Congress into doing what he wants.'b'Even members of his own party have lost faith in his ability to use the White House as a social lubricant to get his agenda passed, or to use that big brain of his to become a more clever negotiator, rather than a scolding lecturer.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHis inability to engage the politicians here has been a real liability,\xe2\x80\x9d one Democratic lawmaker complained. It\xe2\x80\x99s odd, given that he was renowned for making a group of egotists feel that they were being heeded at The Harvard Law Review.'b'The vice president was in the Senate for 36 years while the president merely breezed through. Obama radiates contempt at Congress for not being a bunch of high-minded, effective people, and for expecting him to clean up its mess. He thinks reasonable people should see things his way in a reasonable amount of time, and gets impatient when ideology, ego, identity politics and pork-project whining hold up progress.'b'Biden is a realist. He understands lawmakers\xe2\x80\x99 limitations, motivations and needs. He leans right in and speaks \xe2\x80\x94 and speaks and speaks \xe2\x80\x94 their language. That\xe2\x80\x99s who he is. And he believes, as creaky and unwieldy as the system is, that it still has integrity. More Rocky than Spocky, Biden can spread everything out on the table and negotiate his way through all of his former colleagues\xe2\x80\x99 shortcomings, weaknesses, fears and frailties.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s actually fun for him, while Obama seems so often to be pulling back, aggrieved by the need to engage. The president and his staff seem clueless about what Republicans on the Hill are thinking. And Obama ignores those who urge him to be less insular and \xe2\x80\x94 like Jefferson, Lincoln, L.B.J. and Reagan \xe2\x80\x94 socialize more with political players, combining fairy dust, elbow grease, intimidation and seduction to get his way.'b'Joe Biden has a valuable skill: He knows how to stoop to conquer.'b'MY niece Leslie is still more than nine months away from sending in a college application and more than 18 from stepping into her first college class, but already she\xe2\x80\x99s swimming in numbers: the average SAT scores for one university\xe2\x80\x99s student body; the percentage of applicants another school admits; how much money, on average, the graduates of yet another school tend to make once they\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the work force awhile. This is the kind of information spotlighted in the articles and books that are supposed to guide her and her peers. These are the types of factoids that the adults around them often focus on.'b'Which school will bequeath the best network? Which diploma has the most cachet? Various relatives pitch Leslie on the virtues of their alma maters, and as surely as my niece swims in numbers, she drowns in advice. But much of it strikes me as shortsighted and incomplete, and I worry that she\xe2\x80\x99ll be coaxed to make her choice in a way that disregards the inimitable opportunity that college presents, the full bounty and splendor of those potentially transformative years. I have the same worry about other secondary-school students who, like her, possess the economic and intellectual good fortune \xe2\x80\x94 and the hard-won transcripts \xe2\x80\x94 to entertain a wealth of alternatives, because I think we let them get too distracted by rankings, ratings, brands. We don\xe2\x80\x99t point them toward assessments and dynamics that are arguably more meaningful.'b'Last week was the deadline to apply to many colleges and universities, though the admissions dance \xe2\x80\x94 the dreaming, scheming, waiting and worrying \xe2\x80\x94 has really become a year-round, nonstop phenomenon, starting well before the final stretch of high school. Leslie\xe2\x80\x99s a junior and has already visited half a dozen campuses, to see how they feel.'b'And if she\xe2\x80\x99s like most of my peers when I was her age, she\xe2\x80\x99ll wind up picking one that gives her a sense of comfort, of safety. That\xe2\x80\x99s what too many kids do. They perpetuate what they\xe2\x80\x99re familiar with, gravitating to the same schools that their friends are or duplicating their parents\xe2\x80\x99 paths. And there\xe2\x80\x99s so much lost in that reflex, so much surrendered by that timidity.'b'If you\xe2\x80\x99re among the lucky who can factor more than cost and proximity into where you decide to go, college is a ticket to an adventure beyond the parameters of what you\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced so far. It\xe2\x80\x99s a passport to the far side of what you already know. It\xe2\x80\x99s a chance to be challenged, not coddled. To be provoked, not pacified.'b'Does brand matter? To a point. There are indeed future employers who see certain diplomas as seals of approval, as pre-screening of a sort, and there are many successful people who got that way by milking contacts made at storied universities. But there are just as many who prospered without the imprimatur of one of the hyper-exclusive schools near the top of the annual U.S. News &amp; World Report list. And even if you\xe2\x80\x99re confining yourself to those schools, you can and should ask questions about them that prospective freshmen frequently don\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'How many of a college\xe2\x80\x99s or university\xe2\x80\x99s students are coming from other countries? Favor schools with higher percentages of foreigners, because as much of your education will happen outside as inside any lecture hall, and globalism is here and real. The dexterity with which you can navigate other cultures \xe2\x80\x94 your awareness of, and openness to, them \xe2\x80\x94 could be more valuable and happy-making than any knowledge gleaned from a book.'b'When it comes to the internationalism of a school, don\xe2\x80\x99t assume the loftiest ones win the race. In 'b'one measure of this'b', Carnegie Mellon, Boston University and Brandeis came out ahead of Harvard, Stanford, Williams or Duke.'b'You might also take into account what percentage of a school\xe2\x80\x99s students travel in the opposite direction and do some study abroad. That could be an indication of your future classmates\xe2\x80\x99 daring or curiosity, and those classmates will presumably bring the fruits of their experiences back to campus. According to U.S. News &amp; World Report, of the 'b'41 schools'b' that claim to have sent more than 50 percent of their students to a study-abroad program, only one, Dartmouth, is in the Ivy League.'b'I use the word \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d deliberately and urge skepticism with rankings. They depend on honest reporting from schools, and in recent years both Claremont McKenna College and Emory University were forced to admit inflation in what they\xe2\x80\x99d trumpeted about the test scores or other achievements of their students. Also, what does \xe2\x80\x9cstudy abroad\xe2\x80\x9d mean? A semester or a week, and in Mumbai or just Montreal? As it happens, more than half of the American college students who take an academic detour from the United States still head to Europe, and the most popular destination is Britain, according to the 'b'Institute of International Education'b'. They\xe2\x80\x99re not exactly honing new language skills there.'b'SO dig as deeply as you can into what the statistics that colleges showcase do and don\xe2\x80\x99t assure. And treat your undergraduate education as a rare license, before you\xe2\x80\x99re confined by the burdens of full-fledged adulthood and before the costs of experimentation rise, to be tugged outside your comfort zone. To be 'b'yanked'b', preferably. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve spent little time in the thick of a busy city, contemplate a school in precisely such a place. If you know only the North, think about the South. Seek diversity, not just in terms of nationality, ethnicity and race, but also in terms of financial background, especially if your bearings have been resolutely and narrowly upper middle class. You\xe2\x80\x99ll most likely encounter a different economic cross-section of classmates at one of the top state universities than you will at a small private college. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that have merit, and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that be weighed?'b'And if your interests and circumstances don\xe2\x80\x99t demand an immediate concentration on one field of study, go somewhere that\xe2\x80\x99ll force you to stretch in multiple directions. (A core curriculum isn\xe2\x80\x99t a bad thing at all.) The world is in constant flux, life is a sequence of surprises, and I can think of no better talents to pick up in college than fearlessness, nimbleness and the ability to roll with change, adapt to newness and improvise.'b'I have 11 nieces and nephews in all. There are 10 younger than Leslie. I hope all of them have the options that she seems to, and I hope they ask themselves not which school is the surest route to riches but which will give them the richest experiences to draw from, which will broaden their frames of reference. College can shrink your universe, or college can expand it. I vote for the latter.'b'CONGRESS and President Obama have pushed through a relatively modest stopgap measure to avoid the \xe2\x80\x9cfiscal cliff,\xe2\x80\x9d but over the coming years, the United States will confront another huge cliff: Social Security.'b'In the 'b'first presidential debate'b', Mr. Obama described Social Security as \xe2\x80\x9cstructurally sound,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mitt Romney said that \xe2\x80\x9cneither the president nor I are proposing any changes\xe2\x80\x9d to the program. It was a rare issue on which both men agreed \xe2\x80\x94 and both were utterly wrong.'b'For the first time in more than a quarter-century, Social Security ran a deficit in 2010: It spent $49 billion dollars more in benefits than it received in revenues, and drew from its trust funds to cover the shortfall. Those funds \xe2\x80\x94 a $2.7 trillion buffer built in anticipation of retiring baby boomers \xe2\x80\x94 will be exhausted by 2033, the government currently projects.'b'Those facts are widely known. What\xe2\x80\x99s not is that the Social Security Administration underestimates how long Americans will live and how much the trust funds will need to pay out \xe2\x80\x94 to the tune of $800 billion by 2031, more than the current annual defense budget \xe2\x80\x94 and that the trust funds will run out, if nothing is done, two years earlier than the government has predicted.'b'We reached these conclusions, and presented them in an 'b'article'b' in the journal Demography, after finding that the government\xe2\x80\x99s methods for forecasting Americans\xe2\x80\x99 longevity were outdated and omitted crucial health and demographic factors. Historic declines in smoking and improvements in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease are adding years of life that the government hasn\xe2\x80\x99t accounted for. (While obesity has rapidly increased, it is not likely, at this point, to offset these public health and medical successes.) More retirees will receive benefits for longer than predicted, supported by the payroll taxes of relatively fewer working adults than projected.'b'Remarkably, since Social Security was created in 1935, the government\xe2\x80\x99s forecasting methods have barely changed, even as a revolution in big data and statistics has transformed everything from baseball to retailing.'b'This omission can be explained by the fact that the 'b'Office of the Chief Actuary'b', the branch of the Social Security Administration that is responsible for the forecasts, is almost exclusively composed of, well, actuaries \xe2\x80\x94 without any serious representation of statisticians or social science methodologists. While these actuaries are highly responsible and careful and do excellent work curating and describing the data that go into the forecasts, their job is not to make statistical predictions. Yet the agency badly needs such expertise.'b'With considerable help from the actuaries and other officials at the Social Security Administration, we unearthed how the agency makes mortality forecasts and uses them to predict the program\xe2\x80\x99s solvency. We learned that the methods are antiquated, subjective and needlessly complicated \xe2\x80\x94 and, as a result, are prone to error and to potential interference from political appointees. This may explain why the agency\xe2\x80\x99s forecasts have, at times, changed significantly from year to year, even when there was little change in the underlying data.'b'We have made our methods, calculations and software available online at 'b'j.mp/SSecurity'b' so that others can replicate or improve our forecasts. The implications of our findings go beyond social science. As the wave of retirement by the baby boomers continues, doing nothing to shore up Social Security\xe2\x80\x99s solvency is irresponsible. If the amount of money coming in through payroll taxes does not increase and if the amount of money going out as benefits remains the same, the trust funds will become insolvent less than 20 years from now.'b'To save Social Security, which has lifted generations of elderly people out of poverty, tough choices have to be made. One option is to continue raising the retirement age, perhaps to as high as 69 or 70. While the full retirement age is gradually increasing to 67 (for people born in 1960 or later) from 65, this increase is not enough to counterbalance the gains in longevity.'b'A second option is to increase payroll taxes, for example by taxing wages over $113,700, the current earnings limit. A third is to limit the annual cost-of-living adjustments, possibly by changing how those adjustments are calculated. A fourth is to reduce benefits \xe2\x80\x94 for example, by lowering the initial benefits for workers whose lifetime wages are above the national average (currently $43,000 a year). Other choices, in numerous combinations, are possible, too.'b'One factor that might be considered is new research suggesting that retirement itself, although popular, may reduce life expectancy by breaking lifelong routines and disrupting deep social connections. One might question how much government policy should actively encourage retirement, as opposed to merely making it an option.'b'Americans need to discuss these difficult choices \xe2\x80\x94 and the Social Security Administration needs the ability to improve its forecasting technology by adding statisticians and social science methodologists to help its actuaries institute more formalized quantitative and statistical procedures.'b'In 1983, after the last time the trust funds ran a deficit, the 'b'National Commission on Social Security Reform'b', led by Alan Greenspan and with members appointed by President Ronald Reagan and Congressional leaders, produced a report that led to changes in payroll taxes. But in the quarter-century since, there have been only modest changes in the program.'b'We know much more now about mortality and demography, and so an open debate today about Social Security\xe2\x80\x99s future could be even more productive than it was then. The high levels of partisan strife may not make the present seem like the best time to reach a bipartisan agreement. But few issues are more important to more Americans, of both parties, and the longer we ignore the problem, the more disruptive any change will need to be to keep Social Security alive.'b'HERE are a few things that happened to John Boehner, ostensibly one of the most powerful men in Washington, during the past two weeks.'b'First his own backbenchers blew up his attempt at a fiscal cliff negotiating maneuver. Then he had to step back and let Joe Biden and Mitch McConnell hammer out the details of the fiscal cliff deal, which he then had to shepherd through his own legislative body with more Democratic than Republican votes. The next day he was dressed down on national television by a grandstanding Chris Christie. The day after that, he survived an utterly incompetent 'b'revolt against his re-election'b' as speaker of the House.'b'These tribulations have 'b'earned Boehner'b' 'b'press coverage'b' that\xe2\x80\x99s sympathetic without being particularly respectful. It\xe2\x80\x99s increasingly taken for granted that he\xe2\x80\x99s an ineffective speaker who holds his position mostly because nobody else wants the job \xe2\x80\x94 an anti-Sam Rayburn, a survivor who\xe2\x80\x99s liked but not feared. The only compliments he ever seems to earn are backhanded, rueful, there-but-for-the-grace-of-God-go-I.'b'Yet at the same time, Boehner has done his country a more important service over the last two years than almost any other politician in Washington.'b'That service hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been the achievement of a grand bargain with the White House, which he has at times assiduously sought. Nor has it been the sweeping triumph over liberalism that certain right-wing activists expect him to somehow gain. Rather, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a kind of disaster management \xe2\x80\x94 a sequence of bomb-defusal operations that have prevented our dysfunctional government from tipping into outright crisis.'b'Three realities have made these constant defusing operations necessary. First, there\xe2\x80\x99s the grim economic and budgetary situation \xe2\x80\x94 a mix of slow growth and huge peacetime deficits that constrains policy makers in unprecedented ways. (It\xe2\x80\x99s far, far easier to be a successful legislator when you\xe2\x80\x99re negotiating over an expanding pie.) Second, there\xe2\x80\x99s the combination of gridlocked government and ideological polarization, which simultaneously requires compromise while reducing the common ground available to would-be deal makers.'b'Such obstacles might be enough to frustrate even the legislative giants of the past. Pundits talk blithely about the good old days of bipartisanship, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no real precedent in modern American history for a bipartisan bargain in which two bitterly divided sides both accept so many painful sacrifices.'b'The Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 current position makes things harder still, because Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s party has much more power in Washington than it has support in the nation as a whole. Republicans are a minority party nationally, but thanks to redistricting they control the House despite Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 2012 successes. This mismatch leaves the base spoiling for fights that can\xe2\x80\x99t actually be won: House Republicans have just enough real power to raise conservative expectations but not nearly enough to bend a liberal president and a Democratic Senate to their will.'b'Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s job, then, requires constantly pushing hard enough to persuade his caucus that he\xe2\x80\x99s maximizing Republican leverage, while simultaneously looking for ways to make small, can-kicking deals at the last possible moment. Which he\xe2\x80\x99s always found, by hook or by crook: there was no government shutdown in the spring of 2011, no debt default that summer, and the fiscal cliff was averted (at least temporarily) last week.'b'The fact that all these crises have been resolved at the 11th hour, amid persistent brinkmanship and repeated near-death moments for his speakership, isn\xe2\x80\x99t a sign that he\xe2\x80\x99s a failure. Instead, given the correlation of forces he\xe2\x80\x99s dealing with, this is what success looks like. (For a glimpse of the alternative, just imagine rerunning the last two years with Newt Gingrich in the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s chair.)'b'You might say that this is no way to run a government. I\xe2\x80\x99d agree. But the nation\xe2\x80\x99s polarization and his party\xe2\x80\x99s dysfunction are beyond a speaker\xe2\x80\x99s ability to undo. As Democrats learned across the 1970s and \xe2\x80\x9980s, the House is a poor base from which to rebuild a national party. Nobody blames Tip O\xe2\x80\x99Neill or Jim Wright for failing to do what Bill Clinton and Barack Obama ultimately achieved. And anyone who thinks that Boehner would transform the Republican Party for the better by, say, resigning his leadership position and excoriating his colleagues should watch fewer Aaron Sorkin shows.'b'No, the way out of our predicament is through the ballot box, not the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s office. Either Democrats need to consolidate their advantages and win back the House or Republicans need to find a way to start winning national elections again, at which point the current impasse will be broken and policy will tilt more clearly toward the left or right.'b'Until then, we\xe2\x80\x99re stuck with the cycle of brinkmanship \xe2\x80\x94 another debt-ceiling debate, another shutdown possibility, the spending portion of the fiscal cliff.'b'It would probably be better to call the whole thing off and accept that the fiscal picture won\xe2\x80\x99t change much in two years. But if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go through it again, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that the speaker who prevented dysfunction from producing disaster last time is around to try again.'b'ONE morning in mid-December, Pope Benedict XVI gazed down on an iPad and composed 'b'his first tweet'b'. From a marketing perspective, it was about time. While the pontiff had been issuing his traditional encyclicals online, other world leaders were venturing further, onto Facebook and Twitter. The 'b'Dalai Lama'b', for example, was already spreading his wisdom in 140-character packets to more than five million followers. And as people retweeted his posts, his messages winged through social media, reaching tens of millions. How could the Vatican resist such marketing magic?'b'Growing legions of marketing consultants are pushing social media as the can\xe2\x80\x99t-miss future. They argue that pitches are more likely to hit home if they come from friends on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr or Google+. That\xe2\x80\x99s the new word of mouth, long the gold standard in marketing. And the rivers of data that pour into these networks fuel the vision of precision targeting, in which ads are so timely and relevant that you welcome them. The hopes for such a revolution have fueled a market frenzy around social networks \xe2\x80\x94 and have also primed them for a fall.'b'The drama swirls around data. In the \xe2\x80\x9cMad Men\xe2\x80\x9d depiction of an advertising firm in the \xe2\x80\x9960s, the big stars don\xe2\x80\x99t sweat the numbers. They\xe2\x80\x99re gut followers. Don Draper pours himself a finger or two of rye and flops on a couch in his corner office. He 'b'thinks'b'. His job is to anticipate the needs and desires of fellow human beings, and to answer them with ideas. What slogan would light up the eyes of the dour airline executive, or the dog food people? Fellow humanists dominate Don Draper\xe2\x80\x99s rarefied world, while the numbers people, two or three of them crammed into dingier offices, pore over Nielsen reports and audience profiles.'b'In the last decade however, those numbers people have rocketed to the top. They build and operate the search engines. They\xe2\x80\x99re flexing their quantitative muscles at agencies and starting new ones. And the rise of social networks, which stream a global gabfest into their servers, catapults these quants ever higher. Their most powerful pitches aren\xe2\x80\x99t ideas but rather algorithms. This sends many of today\xe2\x80\x99s Don Drapers into early retirement. Others, paradoxically, hunt down new work on social networks like LinkedIn.'b'Yet this year has brought renewed hope for the humanists \xe2\x80\x94 or at least a satisfying burst of schadenfreude. Facebook made its public offering in May at a valuation of $104 billion, only to see the share price tumble as many began to doubt the network\xe2\x80\x99s potential as a medium for paid ads. Corporate advertisers are devoting only a modest 14 percent of their online budgets to social networks. According to comScore, a firm that tracks online activity, e-commerce 'b'soared 16 percent'b' from last year, to nearly $39 billion this holiday season. But advertising from social networks appeared to play only a supporting role. I.B.M. researchers found that on the pivotal opening day of the season, 'b'Black Friday'b', 'b'a scant 0.68 percent'b' of online purchases came directly from Facebook. The number from Twitter was undetectable. Could it be that folks aren\xe2\x80\x99t in a buying mood when hanging out digitally with their friends?'b'A more likely answer is this: When big new phenomena arrive on the scene, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know what to count. We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this before. During the dot-com bubble in the late \xe2\x80\x9990s, investors threw billions at Internet start-ups that promised to deliver targeted ads to millions of viewers, or \xe2\x80\x9ceyeballs.\xe2\x80\x9d But eyeballs didn\xe2\x80\x99t produce dollars, and the high-flying market crashed. Many naysayers gleefully concluded that the Internet itself had failed.'b'Yet as these cyberskeptics crowed, a company called Overture Services was pioneering an innovative advertising application for the new medium. When Web surfers carried out searches, it turned out, they welcomed related ads. And if they clicked on one, the advertiser paid the search engine. Google soon implemented this system on a mammoth scale and turned clicks into dollars. Advertisers could calculate their return on investment down to the penny. In this domain, the insights of a Mad Man counted for nothing. Search ran on numbers. The quants rushed in.'b'While the rise of search battered the humanists, it also laid a trap that the quants are falling into now. It led to the belief that with enough data, all of advertising could turn into quantifiable science. This came with a punishing downside. It banished faith from the advertising equation. For generations, Mad Men had thrived on widespread trust that their jingles and slogans altered consumers\xe2\x80\x99 behavior. Thankfully for them, there was little data to prove them wrong. But in an industry run remorselessly by numbers, the expectations have flipped. Advertising companies now face pressure to deliver statistical evidence of their success. When they come up short, offering anecdotes in place of numbers, the markets punish them. Faith has given way to doubt.'b'This leads to exasperation, because in a server farm packed with social data, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know what to count. What\xe2\x80\x99s the value of a Facebook \xe2\x80\x9clike\xe2\x80\x9d or a 'b'Twitter follower'b'? What do you measure to find out? In this way, marketing resembles other hot spots of data research, including brain science and genomics. In each one, scientists are combing through petabytes of data, trying to discern whether certain genes or groups of neurons cause something or simply correlate with it. It\xe2\x80\x99s not clear, because these are immensely complex systems with millions of variables \xe2\x80\x94 much like our social networks. Even as researchers swim in data that previous generations would have swooned over, they struggle to answer crucial questions regarding cause and effect. What action can I take to get the response I want?'b'Debates rage as quants accuse one another of counting the wrong things. Take I.B.M.\xe2\x80\x99s Black Friday study. While the numbers indicate that few shoppers clicked directly from a social network to buy a laptop or a fridge, some may have seen ads that later led to a purchase. If so, valuable influence went unmeasured. \xe2\x80\x9cI.B.M. is looking at a single point in time,\xe2\x80\x9d says Dan Neely, the chief executive of Networked Insights, a marketing analytics company. Neely\xe2\x80\x99s team followed Macy\xe2\x80\x99s Black Friday campaign on Twitter, which started weeks before the big day; it generated a viral flurry on the network, he says. Clearly, many big advertisers are still believers: last week, Facebook shares 'b'got a boost'b' from reports that Walmart, Samsung and other boldfaced names have recently stepped up social-media advertising.'b'But gauging the effectiveness of these ads is still a challenge. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to measure influence,\xe2\x80\x9d says Steve Canepa, I.B.M.\xe2\x80\x99s general manager for media and entertainment.'b'That, in fact, may be the ultimate lesson to draw from the social media marketing miracle that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. The impact of new technologies is invariably misjudged because we measure the future with yardsticks from the past.'b'Dave Morgan, a pioneer in Internet advertising and the founder of Simulmedia, an ad network for TV, points to the early years of electricity. In the late 19th century, most people associated the new industry with one extremely valuable service: light. That was what the marketplace understood. Electricity would displace kerosene and candles and become a giant of illumination. What these people missed was that electricity, far beyond light, was a platform for a host of new industries. Over the following years, entrepreneurs would come up with appliances \xe2\x80\x94 today we might call them \xe2\x80\x9capps\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 for vacuuming, laundry and eventually radio and television. Huge industries grew on the electricity platform. If you think of Apple in this context, it\xe2\x80\x99s a $496 billion company that builds the latest generation of electricity apps.'b'Social networks, like them or not, are fast laying out a new grid of personal connections. Even if this matrix of humanity sputters in advertising and marketing, it\xe2\x80\x99s bound to spawn new industries in consulting, education, collaborative design, market research, media and loads of products and services yet to be imagined. Maybe, just maybe, it will even be able to sell soap.'b'Barack Obama has rarely exercised presidential clemency to grant pardons and restore the civil rights of convicted criminals, a power that Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt and other presidents 'b'used'b' with dedication to correct injustices in the legal system.'b'Mr. Obama has 'b'pardoned'b' only 22 people, fewer than any president since the modern era of pardons began in 1900. He has granted a pardon for 1 out of every 50 applicants, compared with 1 out of 33 for George W. Bush, 1 of 8 for Bill Clinton and 1 of 3 for Ronald Reagan.'b'In part, this has been a reaction to Presidents Clinton and Bush, both of whom compromised the pardon power with cronyism. But the basic problem may be that Mr. Obama allowed himself to be crippled by the pardon process itself. That process is managed by the Justice Department, which receives applications for clemency and makes recommendations to the White House.'b'Presumably, the president is willing to use acts of clemency to right the wrongs of the sentencing and judicial systems. Yet the same cannot be said of the Justice Department, which has a prosecutorial mind-set. It has undermined the process with huge 'b'backlogs and delays'b', and sometimes views pardons as an affront to federal efforts to fight crime.'b'Over the years, too, the process appears to have been tainted by racial bias. As ProPublica 'b'documented'b' in an analysis of Bush administration pardons, whites benefited from pardons four times as often as members of minority groups, even though blacks alone made up 38 percent of the federal prison population. That report prompted a continuing Justice Department 'b'review'b' by its Bureau of Justice Statistics.'b'In addition, the department\xe2\x80\x99s pardon office is run by a Bush-appointed lawyer, Ronald L. Rodgers, whose professional conduct has been 'b'excoriated'b' by the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s own inspector general and 'b'referred to the deputy attorney general'b' for possible administrative action. In 2008, in transmitting a proposed pardon to the White House, Mr. Rodgers misrepresented the views of both the United States attorney who made the recommendation and the judge who seconded it. The prisoner was denied a pardon.'b'One simple and immediate way for the president to reinvigorate the pardons process is to choose a person of stature and energy \xe2\x80\x94 say, a federal judge \xe2\x80\x94 to steward his administration\xe2\x80\x99s pardon duties. At the same time, he can end the department\xe2\x80\x99s conflict of interest by replacing the pardons office with a new 'b'bipartisan commission'b' under the White House\xe2\x80\x99s aegis, giving it ample resources and real independence.'b'There is much good to be done, for the sake of justice as well as mercy. Many federal inmates are serving egregiously long prison terms under mandatory minimum sentencing schemes. Mr. Obama could use the pardon power to grant clemency to some long-term prisoners, until Congress reforms those laws. He could also use that power to spare some federal offenders who have completed their prison terms from the legal restrictions that have kept them from getting jobs, places to live, business licenses and the chance to vote.'b'And he could address the unfortunate consequences of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s unfair drug sentencing laws. As of November 2011, there were at least 5,000 federal prisoners serving sentences for crack cocaine who deserved consideration for reduced sentences after a major reform of federal drug laws in 2010. Those prisoners were sentenced when the penalty for crimes involving crack was far more severe than for crimes involving powder cocaine; in 2010, Congress reduced that difference, but the older sentences remained unchanged.'b'In 2003, Justice Anthony Kennedy 'b'observed'b' that the pardon power had been \xe2\x80\x9cdrained of its moral force.\xe2\x80\x9d The Constitution grants the president alone the power to grant 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cpardons for offenses against the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d'b' It is time for Mr. Obama to vigorously exercise this august and singular responsibility.'b'The Fourth Amendment prohibits the police from searching individuals without a warrant, but the Supreme Court allows exceptions to that rule for 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cexigent circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d'b' \xe2\x80\x94 when the police believe that the delay involved in getting a warrant would lead to destruction of evidence.'b'In 'b'Missouri v. McNeely'b', scheduled for argument at the court on Wednesday, the police forced a driver to take a blood test at a hospital without a warrant, after he refused to take a breath test with a portable machine when he was stopped for erratic driving. The blood test showed that his blood alcohol content was 0.154 percent, or almost twice the state\xe2\x80\x99s legal limit.'b'The Missouri Supreme Court wisely 'b'ruled'b' that the warrantless blood test was an unreasonable search because there was no emergency that prevented the police from getting a search warrant in a timely manner before the alcohol in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s blood dissipated.'b'Missouri is now asking the United States Supreme Court to overturn the state court ruling and to radically revise Fourth Amendment law so that police \xe2\x80\x94 without a warrant \xe2\x80\x94 can draw blood from every person arrested on suspicion of drunken driving, regardless of the circumstances. The United States government, siding with Missouri, 'b'argues'b' that warrantless blood draws are needed \xe2\x80\x9cto prevent the imminent destruction of evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But in 21 states, including Missouri, the police have successfully obtained thousands of warrants to get blood alcohol evidence.'b'If the Supreme Court applies the blanket rule Missouri seeks, it will diminish constitutional rights without increasing public safety in any meaningful way. 'b''b''b'The Illinois Legislature begins a new session on Wednesday with a chance to make up for a narrowly missed opportunity to legalize gay marriage. Supporters had been confident that a bill would pass in the final days of the lame-duck session, making Illinois the 10th marriage-equality state, but the bill stalled in the Senate late last week and the clock ran out. The bill\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor, Senator Heather Steans, a Chicago Democrat, said that she had the 30 votes for passage, but a vote on Thursday was called off because some Democrats were absent, the legislative equivalent of seniors cutting class in finals week.'b'But the delay is likely to be short. The momentum toward gay marriage, in Illinois as elsewhere, has been astonishingly swift, and the bill has prominent supporters in Gov. Pat Quinn, Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago and President Obama, who said through a spokesman that he would vote for it if he were still in the Legislature. Even the State Republican chairman, Pat Brady, endorsed the bill, making the conservative case that gay marriage means stronger families.'b'Resistance has been led by Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s Roman Catholic cardinal, Francis George, who calls gay marriage an affront to natural law. But the views of the opponents will soon be less relevant: the incoming Legislature will have a supermajority of Democrats \xe2\x80\x94 holding 71 of 118 House seats and 40 of 59 Senate seats \xe2\x80\x94 strengthening the chances that gay marriage will arrive in Illinois, sooner rather than later.'b'\xc2\xa0'b'The shooting deaths of 20 elementary-school children and seven adults in Newtown will dominate the agenda of the Connecticut General Assembly as lawmakers open their five-month session Wednesday in Hartford. Gov. Dannel Malloy has appointed a 15-member advisory committee to study and recommend needed changes in public safety, mental health services and the control of gun violence. But lawmakers are already offering a raft of separate proposals, including an outright ban of the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle and 30-round magazine used in the massacre last month.'b'The General Assembly rejected a proposed ban on such large-capacity magazines in 2011 after the National Rifle Association mounted a heavy lobbying campaign and flooded lawmakers with tens of thousands of protest e-mails. One of the key questions is how much effect, if any, the slayings at Sandy Hook Elementary will have on the push for tighter gun controls in Hartford and in Washington as well.'b'In 'b'announcing the advisory committee'b' of community leaders and experts, Governor Malloy noted that if Congress had not allowed a federal law banning 30-round magazines to lapse in 2004, Adam Lanza, the shooter in the school massacre, might have done less damage. Forensics showed that each of the schoolchildren was struck by 3 to 11 bullets from the rapid-fire rifle.'b'Other Hartford proposals would increase mental health intervention and even seek to force the mentally ill to take their medications, a controversial step rejected in the past as impractical. Legislative leaders said they also would look into requiring more extensive use of metal detectors at schools, among other measures. So far, there\xe2\x80\x99s been no move to install police guards or arm teachers in every school, as the N.R.A. recommended.

KEENAN'b'\nAtlanta, Dec. 28, 2012'b''b'CATHOLIC parochial education is in crisis. More than a third of parochial schools in the United States closed between 1965 and 1990, and enrollment fell by more than half. After stabilizing in the 1990s, enrollment has plunged despite strong demand from students and families.'b'Closings of elementary and middle schools have become a yearly ritual in the Northeast and Midwest, home to two-thirds of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s Catholic schools. Last year, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia closed one-fifth of its elementary schools. Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the archbishop of New York, is expected to decide soon whether to shut 26 elementary schools and one high school, less than three years after the latest closings. Catholic high schools have held on, but their long-term future is in question.'b'This isn\xe2\x80\x99t for want of students. Almost 30 percent of Catholic schools have waiting lists, even after sharp tuition increases over the past decade. The American Catholic population has grown by 45 percent since 1965. Hispanics, who are often underserved by public schools, account for about 45 percent of American Catholics and an even higher proportion of Catholic children, but many cannot afford rising fees.'b'Since the early 19th century, parochial schools have given free or affordable educations to needy and affluent students alike. Inner-city Catholic schools, which began by serving poor European immigrants, severed the connection between poverty and low academic performance for generations of low-income (and often non-Catholic) minority kids.'b'Until the 1960s, religious orders were united in responding to Christ\xe2\x80\x99s mandate to \xe2\x80\x9cgo teach.\xe2\x80\x9d But religious vocations have become less attractive, and parochial schools have faced increasing competition from charter schools. Without a turnaround, many dioceses will soon have only scatterings of elite Catholic academies for middle-class and affluent families and a token number of inner-city schools, propped up by wealthy donors.'b'As in other areas, the church has lost its way, by failing to prioritize parochial education. Despite the sex-abuse scandals and two recessions, church revenue \xe2\x80\x94 which flows from parishes via Sunday donations, bequests and so on \xe2\x80\x94 grew to $11.9 billion in 2010, an inflation-adjusted increase of $2.2 billion from a decade earlier. Yet educational subsidies have fallen; the church now pays at least 12.6 percent of parochial elementary school costs, down from 63 percent in 1965.'b'Much of the money has gone to paying for a growing staff: about 170,000 laypeople, priests and members of religious orders, including some unpaid volunteers, responsible for more than 17,000 parishes. Since 2000, there has been more than a 25 percent increase in lay ecclesial ministers, who serve alongside priests and deacons in ministering to colleges, hospitals and prisons and caring for bereaved or homebound parishioners.'b'The church should shift its spending and also hold ambitious fund-raising drives. Instead of approaching donors with the least effective pitch \xe2\x80\x94 filling deficits \xe2\x80\x94 educators, pastors and prelates should propose new initiatives (with help from Web sites like 'b'DonorsChoose.org'b' and Kickstarter) and new schools.'b'Bishops preach social justice but fail to practice it within the church. Thirty percent of American parishes report operating deficits, but there is no systemic means for wealthier dioceses and parishes to help poorer ones \xe2\x80\x94 and to stave off self-defeating tuition increases.'b'After finances, personnel is the biggest challenge. Once upon a time, a pastor and two assistant priests took care of religious duties, while nuns ran the parish schools. Now, typically, there is just a beleaguered pastor (increasingly born and trained in Asia, Africa or Latin America) without any experience in running the business side of a parish and a school. Priests\xe2\x80\x99 collars and nuns\xe2\x80\x99 habits have become rare sights in parochial schools.'b'One solution is at hand. In the late 1960s, the Vatican allowed men to be ordained as deacons, who are clergy with many but not all the powers of a priest. Today there are almost 17,000 in the United States, about the same number as active diocesan priests. Over the next decade, the diaconate will continue to grow, while the number of ordained priests is projected to decline to 12,500 by 2035.'b'Many deacons have valuable professional, managerial and entrepreneurial expertise that could revitalize parochial education. If they were given additional powers to perform sacraments and run parishes, a married priesthood would become a fait accompli. Celibacy should be a sacrifice offered freely, not an excuse for institutional suicide.'b'Without an overhaul of money and personnel, the future of Catholic education is grim. Since 1990, the church has closed almost 1,500 parishes. Most were small, but just as big-city parochial schools are being closed, thriving urban parishes may be next on the chopping block.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe school is more necessary than the church,\xe2\x80\x9d said John J. Hughes, the first archbishop of New York. Unless the Vatican and the American bishops heed those words, the decline in parochial education may forewarn the fate of the church itself.'b'Athens'b'DEMOCRACY is like a bicycle: if you don\xe2\x80\x99t keep pedaling, you fall. Unfortunately, the bicycle of Greek democracy has long been broken. After the military junta collapsed in 1974, 'b'Greece'b' created only a hybrid, diluted form of democracy. You can vote, belong to a party and protest. In essence, however, a small clique exercises all meaningful political power.'b'For all that has been said about the Greek crisis, much has been left unsaid. The crisis has become a battleground of interests and ideologies. At stake is the role of the public sector and the welfare state. Yes, in Greece we have a dysfunctional public sector; for the past 40 years the ruling parties handed out government jobs to their supporters, regardless of their qualifications.'b'But the real problem with the public sector is the tiny elite of business people who live off the Greek state while passing themselves off as \xe2\x80\x9centrepreneurs.\xe2\x80\x9d They bribe politicians to get fat government contracts, usually at inflated prices. They also own many of the country\xe2\x80\x99s media outlets, and thus manage to ensure that their actions are clothed in silence. Sometimes they\xe2\x80\x99ll even buy a soccer team in order to drum up popular support and shield their crimes behind popular protection, as the drug lord Pablo Escobar did in Colombia, and as the paramilitary leader Arkan did in Serbia.'b'In 2011, Evangelos Venizelos, who was then the finance minister and is now the leader of the socialist party, Pasok, instituted a new property-tax law. But for properties larger than 2,000 square meters \xe2\x80\x94 about 21,000 square feet \xe2\x80\x94 the tax was reduced by 60 percent. Mr. Venizelos thus carved out a big exemption for the only people who could afford to pay the tax: the rich. (Mr. Venizelos is also the man responsible for a law granting broad immunity to government ministers.)'b'Such shenanigans have gone on for decades. The public is deprived of real information, as television stations, newspapers and online news sites are controlled by the economic and political elite.'b'Another scandal involves the so-called Lagarde List. In 2010, 'b'Christine Lagarde'b', then the French finance minister (and now the head of the International Monetary Fund), gave the Greek government a list of roughly 2,000 Greek citizens with Swiss bank accounts, to help uncover tax fraud. Greek officials did virtually nothing with the list; two former finance ministers, George Papaconstantinou and his successor, Mr. Venizelos, reportedly even told Parliament they did not know where it was. Meanwhile, several media outlets falsely accused some politicians and business figures of being on the list in order to conceal the ugly reality: rich people were evading taxes while their desperate fellow citizens were searching the trash for food.'b'When Hot Doc, the monthly magazine I edit and publish, made the list public in October, 'b'I was arrested'b' and charged with violating personal privacy, but was acquitted. The result didn\xe2\x80\x99t please those in power. So I am being brought back for a second trial (a date has yet to be set) on similarly vague allegations. Throughout the entire process \xe2\x80\x94 the publication of the list, my arrest, my acquittal \xe2\x80\x94 the Greek media were absent. The case was a top story in the international press, but not in the country where it took place.'b'The reason is simple. The Lagarde list implicates a corrupt group that answers to the name of democracy even as it casually nullifies it: officials with offshore companies, friends and relatives of government ministers, bankers, publishers and those involved in the black market.'b'After my magazine released the list, the Greek government made not a single statement about the case.'b'When Mr. Venizelos left the Finance Ministry last March, he failed to turn the CD with the list over to his successor. He took it with him. Only when his successor, Yannis Stournaras, told The Financial Times in October that he had never received the list did Mr. Venizelos turn it over to the prime minister\xe2\x80\x99s office. He was never asked about the delay, and leaders of the three parties in the coalition government have not referred his conduct to Parliament\xe2\x80\x99s investigatory committee.'b'Meanwhile, a newly released version of the list made clear that someone had removed the names of three relatives of Mr. Papaconstantinou, who was the finance minister from 2009 to 2011, before Mr. Venizelos. Last month, Mr. Papaconstantinou was 'b'expelled'b' from Pasok. He now 'b'faces'b' a Parliamentary investigation, the potential lifting of his immunity from prosecution as a former minister, and charges of tampering with the data. It appears that he may become a new Iphigenia, a scapegoat sacrificed so that the corrupt political system can survive.'b'This is all unfolding at a time when Greece is walking a tightrope above the abyss of bankruptcy, while the coalition government is instituting new taxes on the lower classes. Half of young Greeks are unemployed. The economy is shrinking at an annual rate of 6.9 percent. People are scrounging for food. And a neo-Nazi party, Golden Dawn, is on the rise, exploiting the resentment and rage toward the ruling class.'b'The Greek people must remount their bicycle of democracy by demanding an end to deception and corruption. Journalists need to resist manipulation and rediscover their journalistic duties. And the government should revive Greece\xe2\x80\x99s ancient democratic heritage \xe2\x80\x94 instead of killing the messenger.'b'London'b'THERE are few economies and societies on earth more complementary than 'b'China'b'\xe2\x80\x99s and 'b'Japan'b'\xe2\x80\x99s. The Chinese are relatively young, poor and restless and fiercely committed to economic growth. The Japanese are relatively old and sated, but technologically advanced and devoted to guarding their high standard of living. Proximity would seem to make the two nations ideally suited to benefit from each other.'b'But Japan is afraid of China\xe2\x80\x99s rise, because the Chinese economy is so much more dynamic than Japan\xe2\x80\x99s. And China is troubled by Japan, because the island nation seems to act as an unsinkable American aircraft carrier just off its coast.'b'Over the last year, nationalists in both countries have fought a war of words over the disputed islands that Japan calls Senkaku and China calls Diaoyu. Japan\xe2\x80\x99s new right-wing prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has alarmed Chinese leaders with his calls for revisiting its commitment to pacifism, enshrined in the American-imposed postwar constitution, and for making the school curriculum more patriotic.'b'The long shadow of history continues to haunt relations between the two countries. In Asia, 'b'World War II'b' started in 1937 as a Sino-Japanese war; millions of Chinese were killed as a result of Japan\xe2\x80\x99s expansionism. But that does not explain why young people in China and Japan today are more inimical in their views of one another than their forebears \xe2\x80\x94 even immediately after the war \xe2\x80\x94 were.'b'The real explanation lies further back. Japan\xe2\x80\x99s rise in the late 19th century was seen as an affront by China, which had always felt entitled to the mantle of regional leadership. Mao Zedong and other founders of the Chinese Communist Party adopted these views and bequeathed them to their successors.'b'Most Chinese today therefore regard Japan\xe2\x80\x99s wealth, and its position as America\xe2\x80\x99s main ally in Asia, as results of ill-gotten gains. Even when the Chinese state was at its weakest, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, its elites felt that the Confucianism China had exported to its key neighbors \xe2\x80\x94 Korea, Japan and Vietnam \xe2\x80\x94 was the root of a common culture. Other countries in the \xe2\x80\x9cConfucian zone\xe2\x80\x9d were supposed to simply accept China\xe2\x80\x99s natural leadership.'b'Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s policies in the South China Sea today resemble those of the Qing empire, China\xe2\x80\x99s last ruling dynasty, in the late 18th century. The emperor then, Qianlong, liked to speak to the \xe2\x80\x9cmyriad nations\xe2\x80\x9d to the south as a father would address his children. Current Chinese leaders, who are exerting their influence in countries like Vietnam and Laos, echo his paternalism.'b'It is unlikely that China\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors will appreciate this now any more than they did then. Qianlong got involved in a war in Vietnam in the 1780s that severely weakened his empire. Since then, the countries in the region have had their own waves of nationalism, often in response to Western colonialism. Indonesia, a country of 248 million, does not regard itself as \xe2\x80\x9csmall,\xe2\x80\x9d even compared with a giant like China. It is bound to seek to counter China\xe2\x80\x99s power unless Chinese attitudes and policies change.'b'For its part, Japan veers between accommodating China and competing with it. Even though Japan\xe2\x80\x99s imperialism is a thing of the past, some of the attitudes that gave rise to it persist. Mr. Abe, the grandson of a former prime minister regarded by many Chinese as a war criminal, seems to embody such views.'b'Although most Japanese recognize the importance of trade with and investments in China, national security at the moment seems more important.'b'Japan\xe2\x80\x99s sins of omission in dealing fully with its past hinder its present foreign policy, but they pale in comparison with China\xe2\x80\x99s historical sense of entitlement to regional hegemony and its virulent new form of state-sanctioned anti-Japanese nationalism. Sadly, these chauvinist attitudes are unlikely to change under the new Communist leadership installed in November.'b'Even China\xe2\x80\x99s diplomatic language emphasizes toeing the party\xe2\x80\x99s line on history rather than discerning present-day interests, and it assumes that only one position in international affairs \xe2\x80\x94 usually China\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 can be correct.'b'China today has much more to gain from cooperation with Japan than from conflict. Harping about past sins and inflaming the dispute over the islands do little good. If China is to become the predominant power in the region, it can only do so with Japan, not against it.'b'As France and Germany have demonstrated, perceptions can change when national interest demands it. But shifting Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s thinking from hierarchy to cooperation will require strong leadership and a nuanced understanding of national interests. China\xe2\x80\x99s recent leaders haven\xe2\x80\x99t inspired much hope of either.'b'San Diego'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s that time again: the annual meeting of the American Economic Association and affiliates, a sort of medieval fair that serves as a marketplace for bodies (newly minted Ph.D.\xe2\x80\x99s in search of jobs), books and ideas. And this year, as in past meetings, there is one theme dominating discussion: the ongoing economic crisis.'b'This isn\xe2\x80\x99t how things were supposed to be. If you had polled the economists attending this meeting three years ago, most of them would surely have predicted that by now we\xe2\x80\x99d be talking about how the great slump ended, not why it still continues.'b'So what went wrong? The answer, mainly, is the triumph of bad ideas.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s tempting to argue that the economic failures of recent years prove that economists don\xe2\x80\x99t have the answers. But the truth is actually worse: in reality, standard economics offered good answers, but political leaders \xe2\x80\x94 and all too many economists \xe2\x80\x94 chose to forget or ignore what they should have known.'b'The story, at this point, is fairly straightforward. The financial crisis led, through several channels, to a sharp fall in private spending: residential investment plunged as the housing bubble burst; consumers began saving more as the illusory wealth created by the bubble vanished, while the mortgage debt remained. And this fall in private spending led, inevitably, to a global recession.'b'For an economy is not like a household. A family can decide to spend less and try to earn more. But in the economy as a whole, spending and earning go together: my spending is your income; your spending is my income. If everyone tries to slash spending at the same time, incomes will fall \xe2\x80\x94 and unemployment will soar.'b'So what can be done? A smaller financial shock, like the dot-com bust at the end of the 1990s, can be met by cutting interest rates. But the crisis of 2008 was far bigger, and even cutting rates all the way to zero wasn\xe2\x80\x99t nearly enough.'b'At that point governments needed to step in, spending to support their economies while the private sector regained its balance. And to some extent that did happen: revenue dropped sharply in the slump, but spending actually rose as programs like unemployment insurance expanded and temporary economic stimulus went into effect. Budget deficits rose, but this was actually a good thing, probably the most important reason we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a full replay of the Great Depression.'b'But it all went wrong in 2010. The crisis in Greece was taken, wrongly, as a sign that all governments had better slash spending and deficits right away. Austerity became the order of the day, and supposed experts who should have known better cheered the process on, while the warnings of 'b'some (but not enough) economists'b' that austerity would derail recovery were ignored. For example, the president of the European Central Bank confidently asserted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe idea that austerity measures could trigger stagnation is incorrect.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Well, someone was incorrect, all right.'b'Of the papers presented at this meeting, probably the biggest flash came from one by Olivier Blanchard and Daniel Leigh of the International Monetary Fund. Formally, the paper represents the views only of the authors; but Mr. Blanchard, the I.M.F.\xe2\x80\x99s chief economist, isn\xe2\x80\x99t an ordinary researcher, and the paper has been widely taken as a sign that the fund has had a major rethinking of economic policy.'b'For what the paper concludes is not just that austerity has a depressing effect on weak economies, but that the adverse effect is much stronger than previously believed. The premature turn to austerity, it turns out, was a terrible mistake.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some reporting describing the paper as an admission from the I.M.F. that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what it\xe2\x80\x99s doing. That misses the point; the fund was actually less enthusiastic about austerity than other major players. To the extent that it says it was wrong, it\xe2\x80\x99s also saying that everyone else (except those skeptical economists) was even more wrong. And it deserves credit for being willing to rethink its position in the light of evidence.'b'The really bad news is how few other players are doing the same. European leaders, having created Depression-level suffering in debtor countries without restoring financial confidence, still insist that the answer is even more pain. The current British government, which killed a promising recovery by turning to austerity, completely refuses to consider the possibility that it made a mistake.'b'And here in America, Republicans insist that they\xe2\x80\x99ll use a confrontation over the debt ceiling \xe2\x80\x94 a deeply illegitimate action in itself \xe2\x80\x94 to demand spending cuts that would drive us back into recession.'b'The truth is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve just experienced a colossal failure of economic policy \xe2\x80\x94 and far too many of those responsible for that failure both retain power and refuse to learn from experience.'b'The temperature was zero one recent morning, and when I went out to feed the horses just before dawn, the moon was frozen against the sky. The rim of light against the dark hills in the east looked exactly like the rim of light that forms at dusk against the dark hills in the west. The snow is dry, and there are deer tracks all across the farm, pointed hoof prints hidden deep in the snow.'b'Daylight is longer by only a few minutes than it was at the solstice, two weeks ago. But I keep adding to the sum in my mind. I expect the day to be longer, and so it seems. A bright day follows a dense, cloudy day, and it feels as though we have leaped ahead a month in time \xe2\x80\x94 until the next day, when the clouds hover only hemlock-high and snow sifts out of them almost invisibly. That\xe2\x80\x99s how the week goes: Forward into February! Back to December!'b'On bitter, clear nights, the stars look like minute ice crystals lighted by some source that requires no heat. Even when the moon is down, it is never really dark. The snow catches every particle of light there is, and a dull phosphorescence seems to spread across the pasture and into the woods. The horses stand side by side in a small cloud of their own breath, solid, opaque beasts.'b'It is too cold to stay outside for long in the dark. Ceilidh, the Border terrier, makes the rounds with me. The light in the chicken house has just gone off. All the gates are latched. Ceilidh tows me back toward the lights of the house, leaping the crests of plowed snow.'b'When we go out, we carry some warmth into the night, and when we come in, we carry some cold into the house, a vanishingly small exchange of energy in a universe of such extremes.'b'President Obama will soon make critical choices on Afghanistan, including 'b'how fast to withdraw 66,000 American troops'b' and whether to keep a small residual force there once the NATO combat mission concludes at the end of 2014. His talks with the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, this week will be an important marker in that process.'b'A lot has happened since 'b'the two men met in Kabul last May'b' and signed a strategic partnership agreement. Some developments, like signs of an incipient peace process between the Taliban and the Afghan government, are promising. But many are not. The Afghan Army and police forces have taken responsibility for securing larger and larger swaths of the country, but the Pentagon has admitted that only 1 of 23 NATO-trained brigades 'b'can operate without American assistance'b'. The recent alarming rise in fatal attacks by Afghan forces on their American military mentors has crushed whatever was left of America\xe2\x80\x99s appetite for the costly conflict.'b'Ideally, the 66,000 American troops would already be leaving, and all of them would be out as soon as safely possible; by our estimate, that would be the end of this year. The war that started after Sept. 11, 2001, would be over and securing the country would be up to Afghanistan\xe2\x80\x99s 350,000-member security force, including the army and police, which the United States has spent $39 billion to train and equip over a decade.'b'But there is a conflict between the ideal and the political reality. Mr. Obama has yet to decide how fast he will withdraw the remaining troops, and the longer he delays, the more he enables military commanders who inevitably want to keep the maximum number of troops in Afghanistan for the maximum amount of time.'b'Another matter of concern is that Mr. Obama is seriously considering keeping a residual military force for an indefinite period after 2014. He needs to think carefully about what its mission would be and make his case to the public. Gen. John Allen, the commander in Afghanistan, had provided the White House with options for an enduring presence that went as high as 20,000 troops. That was an alarmingly big number, but fortunately now seems to be a nonstarter. American officials on Saturday said the administration is considering a much smaller force of 3,000 to 9,000.'b'If Mr. Obama cannot find a way to go to zero troops, he should approve only the minimum number needed, of mostly Special Operations commandos, to hunt down insurgents and serve as a deterrent against the Taliban retaking Kabul and Al Qaeda re-establishing a safe haven in Afghanistan. Mr. Obama will want to discuss all these issues with Mr. Karzai. The United States cannot go forward if Afghanistan opposes a residual force or puts undue restrictions on those troops.'b'Mr. Karzai, a deeply flawed leader who is expected to leave office next year, has his own agenda, which includes requests for updated American aircraft, surveillance equipment and longer-range artillery to modernize his army. Those requests cannot be taken seriously when Afghan security forces are increasingly murdering Americans and the Afghan government remains so profoundly corrupt.'b'Twenty-three states, most led by Republican officials, have declared that they will not set up their own health insurance exchanges to help individuals and small businesses find affordable coverage. Instead, they want to offload that task to the federal government.'b'In the short run it will not matter much who runs the exchanges. Consumers will be able to buy essentially the same policies and receive the same consumer protections either way. But in the long run, it would be best if states took on the job because they have the knowledge needed to mesh state and federal programs and encourage participation by local insurers and health care providers.'b'Under the Affordable Care Act, health insurance exchanges will serve as online marketplaces that will allow people to choose among insurance plans whose costs and benefits are easy to compare. The federal government will provide tax-credit subsidies to help pay premiums for people with incomes just above the levels allowed by Medicaid programs. The exchanges are supposed to be ready to enroll people by Oct. 1 for coverage that will start on Jan. 1, 2014.'b'Federal health officials 'b'announced last Thursday'b' that 17 states and the District of Columbia are moving to set up their own exchanges. Seven other states have said they want to collaborate with the federal government to set up exchanges (states have until Feb. 15 to sign up for such partnership arrangements). A federal exchange will be available for all states that refuse to take any action.'b'The Affordable Care Act gives the Department of Health and Human Services responsibility for determining what \xe2\x80\x9cessential health benefits\xe2\x80\x9d must be provided by insurers and for designing Web sites for comparing plans, among other duties. The act also provides basic consumer protections, like the right to buy insurance without regard to health status, that apply both on and off the exchanges. Residents of states where political leaders seem bent on frustrating or sabotaging the health care reforms might well be better off with a federally run exchange.'b'When the White House announced the deal on the fiscal cliff last week, it was quick \xe2\x80\x94 and correct \xe2\x80\x94 to note that much was left undone. There was still \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d room, 'b'the administration said,'b' to raise taxes on high-income Americans, to reform corporate taxes and to reform entitlements, with the aim of \xe2\x80\x9cbalanced\xe2\x80\x9d deficit reduction.'b'The White House seems to think the deal has established a firm foundation for building a new fiscal house. In fact, the deal could make tax reform less likely. And without reform to raise new revenue, deficit reduction would have to rely heavily on spending cuts, an outcome that can be averted only by persuasive and sustained leadership from President Obama.'b'One way the deal could undermine tax reform is that contrary to Republican complaints, its basic framework of low tax rates and lots of loopholes is bound to prove acceptable, even popular. The deal retains the Bush-era tax cuts and almost all existing deductions and tax breaks, except for a few changes affecting a sliver of high-income Americans, generally defined as those with taxable income above $450,000, and even they did not fare badly (their new top rate of 39.6 percent is still 'b'among the lowest'b' top rates in the 100-year history of the income tax).'b'The deal removes impetus for reform by permanently \xe2\x80\x9cpatching\xe2\x80\x9d the alternative minimum tax. The change ensures that the A.M.T. will no longer routinely threaten to ensnare tens of millions of taxpayers for whom it was never intended. This is a step in the direction of better tax policy, but it also means the loss of the A.M.T. as a potent reminder of just how in need of reform the tax code is.'b'The deal will also play into the wrongheaded, but widespread, idea that corporations should not have to pay higher taxes. Congressional Republicans have made it clear that they will fight all further tax increases, while some Democrats have voiced support for corporate tax reform that would streamline the code but not raise more revenue. Put those two views together, and you have the makings of a bipartisan agreement to reform corporate taxes without raising revenue. That would be indefensible at a time when 'b'corporate tax'b' 'b'avoidance'b' has already driven corporate tax revenues close to all-time lows as a share of both federal revenues and the economy.'b'Mr. Obama has pledged to demand significant tax increases as deficit reduction talks go forward. The fiscal cliff deal could leave him with less room to maneuver. But caps on deductions, higher taxes on investment income and a financial transaction tax are worth fighting for, as are broader tax reforms, like a carbon tax and a value-added tax, that could take effect as the economy recovers.'b''b' 'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Blessings of Atheism'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Sunday Review, Jan. 6):'b'On Sunday while I was driving, my 9-year-old daughter and I were discussing religion and God.

However, the writers imply that there have been catastrophic consequences of the Chernobyl and Fukushima accidents.'b'That is not the case. Let\xe2\x80\x99s focus on adverse health consequences. There were 31 immediate deaths of emergency personnel and reactor workers at Chernobyl and none at Fukushima. Many experts predict relatively few radiation-related health consequences from Chernobyl (aside from about 7,000 cases of nonfatal thyroid cancer in children, which were mostly preventable if they had avoided contaminated milk), and even fewer from Fukushima.'b'We do not wish to trivialize these health effects, but, for example, the 80-year projected death rate from Chernobyl will likely be far less than the annual death rate from motor vehicle accidents in the United States. What is more important is the tremendous social, psychological and economic impact of these accidents.'b'This is hard to measure in the former Soviet Union, but Japan incurred its first trade deficit in 20 years after the Fukushima accident.

Three years later, outraged at the silence and misconceptions around rape, I wrote a fiery 'b'essay under my own name describing my experience'b' for an Indian women\xe2\x80\x99s magazine. It created a stir in the women\xe2\x80\x99s movement \xe2\x80\x94 and in my family \xe2\x80\x94 and then it quietly disappeared. Then, last week, I looked at my e-mail and there it was. As part of the outpouring of 'b'public rage'b' after a young woman\xe2\x80\x99s rape and death in Delhi, somebody posted the article online and it went viral. Since then, I have received a deluge of messages from people expressing their support.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly pleasant to be a symbol of rape. I\xe2\x80\x99m not an expert, nor do I represent all victims of rape. All I can offer is that \xe2\x80\x94 unlike the young woman who died in December two weeks after being brutally gang raped, and so many others \xe2\x80\x94 my story didn\xe2\x80\x99t end, and I can continue to tell it.'b'When I fought to live that night, I hardly knew what I was fighting for. A male friend and I had gone for a walk up a mountain near my home. Four armed men caught us and made us climb to a secluded spot, where they raped me for several hours, and beat both of us. They argued among themselves about whether or not to kill us, and finally let us go.'b'At 17, I was just a child. Life rewarded me richly for surviving. I stumbled home, wounded and traumatized, to a fabulous family. With them on my side, so much came my way. I found true love. I wrote books. I saw a kangaroo in the wild. I caught buses and missed trains. I had a shining child. The century changed. My first gray hair appeared.'b'Too many others will never experience that. They will not see that it gets better, that the day comes when one incident is no longer the central focus of your life. One day you find you are no longer looking behind you, expecting every group of men to attack. One day you wind a scarf around your throat without having a flashback to being choked. One day you are not frightened anymore.'b'Rape is horrible. But it is not horrible for all the reasons that have been drilled into the heads of Indian women. It is horrible because you are violated, you are scared, someone else takes control of your body and hurts you in the most intimate way. It is not horrible because you lose your \xe2\x80\x9cvirtue.\xe2\x80\x9d It is not horrible because your father and your brother are dishonored. I reject the notion that my virtue is located in my vagina, just as I reject the notion that men\xe2\x80\x99s brains are in their genitals.'b'If we take honor out of the equation, rape will still be horrible, but it will be a personal, and not a societal, horror. We will be able to give women who have been assaulted what they truly need: not a load of rubbish about how they should feel guilty or ashamed, but empathy for going through a terrible trauma.'b'The week after I was attacked, I heard the story of a woman who was raped in a nearby suburb. She came home, went into the kitchen, set herself on fire and died. The person who told me the story was full of admiration for her selflessness in preserving her husband\xe2\x80\x99s honor. Thanks to my parents, I never did understand this.'b'The law has to provide real penalties for rapists and protection for victims, but only families and communities can provide this empathy and support. How will a teenager participate in the prosecution of her rapist if her family isn\xe2\x80\x99t behind her? How will a wife charge her assailant if her husband thinks the attack was more of an affront to him than a violation of her?'b'At 17, I thought the scariest thing that could happen in my life was being hurt and humiliated in such a painful way. At 49, I know I was wrong: the scariest thing is imagining my 11-year-old child being hurt and humiliated. Not because of my family\xe2\x80\x99s honor, but because she trusts the world and it is infinitely painful to think of her losing that trust. When I look back, it is not the 17-year-old me I want to comfort, but my parents. They had the job of picking up the pieces.'b'This is where our work lies, with those of us who are raising the next generation. It lies in teaching our sons and daughters to become liberated, respectful adults who know that men who hurt women are making a choice, and will be punished.'b'When I was 17, I could not have imagined thousands of people marching against rape in India, as we have seen these past few weeks. And yet there is still work to be done. We have spent generations constructing elaborate systems of patriarchy, caste and social and sexual inequality that allow abuse to flourish. But rape is not inevitable, like the weather. We need to shelve all the gibberish about honor and virtue and did-she-lead-him-on and could-he-help-himself. We need to put responsibility where it lies: on men who violate women, and on all of us who let them get away with it while we point accusing fingers at their victims.'b'Young undocumented immigrants who are allowed to work legally in the United States should be allowed to drive legally, too. It makes perfect sense, if only for public-safety reasons: people need to drive to work, and they should follow the law and be demonstrably competent, registered and insured. But with the politics of immigration, nothing is ever that simple.'b'The issue of driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses for the undocumented became urgent when the Obama administration decided 'b'last summer'b' to defer deportations and grant work authorization for certain immigrants who were brought here illegally as children but had clean records and met other qualifications.'b'The program, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, was designed for young people who would have been legalized under the Dream Act, a worthwhile bill that has long been blocked in Congress. The administration\xe2\x80\x99s aim was to allow so-called \xe2\x80\x9cDreamers\xe2\x80\x9d to get on with their lives.'b'But doing so often requires a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license, and the states, not the federal government, decide who gets those. In Arizona, where government hostility to the undocumented runs hot, Gov. Jan Brewer swiftly issued an executive order denying licenses to recipients of deferred action. It was a spiteful act of discrimination, since the work-authorization papers those immigrants receive \xe2\x80\x94 not to mention their Social Security numbers, which they can also get under the program \xe2\x80\x94 would ordinarily have been enough to meet the ID requirements of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s motor-vehicle laws. Nebraska and Michigan similarly deny licenses to these young immigrants.'b'Many other states, however, have reached the obvious conclusion and announced that recipients of deferred action would be allowed to seek driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses, too. The issue is moot in New Mexico and Washington, which already grant licenses to all qualified drivers regardless of immigration status; Utah issues driver permits to people who cannot prove they are here legally.'b'Those states have taken the broader, wiser course \xe2\x80\x94 extending responsibility and accountability over a shadow population. The Illinois Legislature is considering a bill to allow the undocumented to receive temporary driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses, a move that Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago has endorsed. Granting driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses to the undocumented has been a radioactive issue politically. Here\xe2\x80\x99s hoping that the administration\xe2\x80\x99s program calms things down, and that more states see the wisdom of making the roads as safe and regulated as possible.'b'Instructed by President Obama to find ways to curb gun violence after the Connecticut school massacre, a working group led by Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. appears ready to recommend a package of proposals that go beyond reinstating the expired ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.'b'Mr. Obama has already expressed support for a bill being prepared by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, that would provide a more effective ban on military-style assault weapons than the law that lapsed in 2004. The Biden task force, according to a 'b'report in The Washington Post'b', is considering a broader range of other measures backed by key law enforcement leaders and by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the group started by Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York.'b'These measures include making background checks universal for all gun buyers, creating a national database to track the movement and sale of firearms, expanding mental health checks, and increasing penalties for carrying guns near schools or giving guns to minors.'b'Even this sensible list could be enlarged and improved. Notably missing is a concerted crackdown on illegal gun trafficking. The task force\xe2\x80\x99s final recommendations, which are due to be released by the end of the month, should include a measure to stem the illegal gun trade and make it easier for law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute gun traffickers and the straw buyers and rogue dealers who enable them.'b'A strong starting point is a measure first proposed four years ago by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, which she is about to reintroduce in the new Congress.'b'The 'b'Gun Trafficking Prevention Act'b' would create, for the first time, a separate criminal offense for gun trafficking. It would also toughen penalties at every point in the trafficking chain \xe2\x80\x94 from straw buyers who purchase a gun for someone else to evade required record-keeping and background checks, to corrupt gun dealers who supply illegal weapons to the kingpins running the trafficking rings. Study after study has shown that a tiny minority of bad gun dealers are responsible for selling a huge number of the guns traced to crimes.'b'The measure would give the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives new authority to impose civil penalties and special restrictions, like increased inspections and inventory checks, on \xe2\x80\x9chigh-risk\xe2\x80\x9d gun dealers suspected of assisting traffickers. Finally, it would authorize the addition of hundreds of new agents and other personnel for the underfinanced bureau to allow for more frequent inspections of all gun stores.'b'In nominating Chuck Hagel to be defense secretary and John Brennan to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency, President Obama 'b'has selected'b' two trusted advisers who could help him set a new tone, and conceivably a new direction, on issues of war and peace in his second term. But both candidates must provide answers to serious questions before they can expect confirmation by the Senate.'b'It is a puzzle that Mr. Obama has nominated as defense secretary a person whose views on gay rights are in question at this sensitive time in the Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s evolution. The military\xe2\x80\x99s odious \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d rule was finally legislated out of existence in 2011, under the administration\xe2\x80\x99s leadership. But there is a long way to go to ensure that equal rights are institutionalized.'b'While a member of the Senate from Nebraska in 1998, Mr. Hagel criticized the nomination of James Hormel to be ambassador to Luxembourg because he was \xe2\x80\x9copenly, aggressively gay.\xe2\x80\x9d That was a repugnant reason to oppose anyone for public office. 'b'Last month'b', Mr. Hagel issued a statement in which he described his comments 14 years ago as \xe2\x80\x9cinsensitive,\xe2\x80\x9d apologized to Mr. Hormel and insisted he was \xe2\x80\x9cfully supportive of \xe2\x80\x98open service\xe2\x80\x99 and committed to L.G.B.T. military families.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some leading foreign policy professionals who are gay, including Mr. Hormel, have since said they could support Mr. Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy. Still, it will be important to hear Mr. Hagel explain at his confirmation hearing how his views have changed and how he plans to make sure that all service members are treated equally and receive the same benefits regardless of sexual orientation. It would also help if he acknowledged that his past comments were not just insensitive but abhorrent.'b'On national security policy, there is much to like about Mr. Hagel, one of a fading breed of sensible moderate Republicans. Mr. Obama hailed him as \xe2\x80\x9cthe leader that our troops deserve.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s experience as a decorated veteran of the Vietnam War should give him a special rapport with the troops as well as make him an authoritative voice on the measured use of force. Like Mr. Obama, Mr. Hagel has been deeply critical of the war in Iraq and is believed to favor a more rapid drawdown of troops from Afghanistan. He has also wisely advocated paring the bloated defense budget.'b'Mr. Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s independence and willingness to challenge Republican orthodoxy on Iraq, sanctions on Iran and other issues \xe2\x80\x94 both in the Senate and later as an administration adviser \xe2\x80\x94 have so alarmed neocons, hard-line pro-Israel interest groups and some Republican senators that they unleashed a dishonest campaign to pre-emptively bury the nomination. It failed, but the confirmation process could be bruising. The opponents are worried that Mr. Hagel will not be sufficiently in lock step with the current Israeli government and cannot be counted on to go to war against Iran over its nuclear program if it comes to that.'b'We are encouraged by what we hear about Mr. Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s preference for a negotiated solution with Iran, his reluctance to go to war, and his support for Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security, for a two-state solution and for reductions in nuclear weapons. If confirmed, he would have to tackle the hard job of cutting the defense budget and balancing the competing needs of the different services.'b'Mr. Brennan has worked closely with Mr. Obama over four years as the counterterrorism adviser. He was at the president\xe2\x80\x99s side during the raid on Osama bin Laden, and pushed an expanded strategy of using drones to kill terrorism suspects. Mr. Brennan withdrew from consideration for the C.I.A. post four years ago after human rights advocates said that he had failed to stop President George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s use of torture in interrogating prisoners. He denied those charges at the time, but the Senate Intelligence Committee should revisit the issue at his confirmation hearing. He also should be deeply questioned about how the White House decides on the targets of drone strikes, and whether the American public will ever know if there are explicit rules for these killings.'b'In his second term, President Obama has an opportunity to put his stamp more firmly on America\xe2\x80\x99s relations with the world. He needs his own team to do that, and the Senate should move as quickly as possible to a vote. Ultimately though, Mr. Obama will need some new approaches to achieve new goals, not just new people.'b'In the new movie \xe2\x80\x9cThis is 40,\xe2\x80\x9d the writer and director Judd Apatow casts the arrival of life\xe2\x80\x99s four-decade mark as a uniquely brutal crossroads, flagged by sputtering libido, suffocating commitments and curdled dreams.'b'Judd, buddy, add another eight years, then talk to me. Your body will be even wobblier, your obligations weightier, and time running out more ruthlessly on the gaudiest of your plans. This is 48: in the mail last week, I got a solicitation from AARP. It included a membership card, ready to be activated just as soon as I send in dues, which won\xe2\x80\x99t be anytime soon. And while that premature come-on reflects the group\xe2\x80\x99s relentlessness more than anything else, it\xe2\x80\x99s an accurate reminder that I\xe2\x80\x99m closer to when I\xe2\x80\x99ll quit working than to when I started, my hopes and my hair so fluffy and intact.'b'That was in my 20s, a period with travails all its own, depicted in another project that Apatow is involved in, as an executive producer. I speak of \xe2\x80\x9cGirls,\xe2\x80\x9d whose post-college, pre-mortgage heroines flail professionally, fumble romantically and make deeply puzzling 'b'wardrobe choices'b', their outfits emblems of their befuddlement.'b'The half-hour comedy-drama will begin its second season this coming weekend, and HBO made the first few episodes available to us media types, who have proved that we simply can\xe2\x80\x99t stop gnawing on it. \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d is to cultural arbiters what rawhides are to cocker spaniels.'b'The new episodes immediately reintroduce Lena Dunham\xe2\x80\x99s naked body, which was 'b'introduced aplenty'b' in the old episodes. At this fleshy point I could draw it, I could paint it, I could probably reproduce it in clay. Dunham\xe2\x80\x99s character, Hannah, has a new roommate, gay, and a new playmate, Republican. There\xe2\x80\x99s considerable friction, out of bed as well as in.'b'And there\xe2\x80\x99s a portrait of the period between 20 and 30 as one of peerlessly keen neediness and doubt. You yearn to believe that you\xe2\x80\x99ve figured out the dating game, not yet realizing that it\xe2\x80\x99s eternally unfathomable. You ache for an assurance that you\xe2\x80\x99re pointed in a purposeful direction, but suspect that you\xe2\x80\x99re going nowhere fast. Your desire to project confidence is inversely proportional to your store of it, and you have some really, really bad furniture. I recall, from my mid-20s, a lacquered black table with fake gold accents that cost me next to nothing except, for many years afterward, an undying, unspeakable shame.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re a self-absorbed species, and one wrinkle of our self-absorption is our tendency, reflected in our art and entertainment, to believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s no passage of human existence as fraught with perils and as peculiarly significant as the one we just so happen to be going through. Dunham is 26, and \xe2\x80\x9cGirls,\xe2\x80\x9d which she created, is predicated on the notion that the 20s herald an inimitable sequence of humiliations and unrivaled state of ambivalence. 'b'Apatow'b' is 45, and his 'b'new movie'b' maintains that to enter your 40s is to encounter an especially messy set of questions about the road taken and the unsmooth pavement ahead. Could any other age compare?'b'Well, the 30s are no picnic, as we learned in the television drama 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cthirtysomething,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' whose four-season run began in 1987, when its sires, Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick, turned 35. The characters they hatched were roughly their age peers, and turned soul searching into an exercise so vigorous it practically burned calories. Angst overwhelmed them as surely as hormones capsize teenagers.'b'Speaking of teens, they support whole submarkets of publishing and series of movies dedicated to reassuring them that their pimply predicament is by far the worst: cliques, virginity, trigonometry. But I\xe2\x80\x99m clinging to the conviction that the late 40s are tougher \xe2\x80\x94 just try to find a 17-year-old whose left shoulder creaks like mine, and who suddenly has to pitch in thousands toward his apartment building\xe2\x80\x99s new elevators \xe2\x80\x94 so that I can congratulate myself for every day I successfully muddle through, every smile I courageously summon.'b'Then again, this passage isn\xe2\x80\x99t 'b'really'b' so insufferable. By 48 you\xe2\x80\x99ve come to know, and quite possibly accept, the well-intentioned wretch that you are, and you most likely have the furniture situation worked out.'b'The 20s, too, have their perks. You get the freedom of full-fledged adulthood but can make big mistakes without paying huge prices, because there are still so many opportunities ahead for amends.'b'Dunham isn\xe2\x80\x99t blind to this. In \xe2\x80\x9cGirls\xe2\x80\x9d she finds the exhilaration amid the mortification. And Apatow\xe2\x80\x99s new movie ultimately understands that being weighed down is just a pessimist\xe2\x80\x99s way of looking at \xe2\x80\x94 and talking about \xe2\x80\x94 being grounded, which so many of us struggle to achieve. What feel like tethers one day feel like roots the next.'b'This is 25 and 35 and 40 and, I\xe2\x80\x99ll wager, 50: a matchless kind of awful, a particular stripe of wonderful and just another phase in a struggle that, like our narcissism, is ageless.'b'Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t particularly like government, but they do want government to subsidize their health care. They believe that health care spending improves their lives more than any other public good. In a Quinnipiac poll, typical of many others, Americans opposed any cuts to Medicare by a margin of 70 percent to 25 percent.'b'In a democracy, voters get what they want, so the line tracing federal health care spending looks like the slope of a jet taking off from LaGuardia. Medicare spending is set to nearly double over the next decade. This is the crucial element driving all federal spending over the next few decades and pushing federal debt to about 250 percent of G.D.P. in 30 years.'b'There are no conceivable tax increases that can keep up with this spending rise. The Democrats had their best chance in a generation to raise revenue just now, and all they got was a measly $600 billion over 10 years. This is barely a wiggle on the revenue line and does nothing to change the overall fiscal picture.'b'As a result, health care spending, which people really appreciate, is squeezing out all other spending, which they value far less. Spending on domestic programs \xe2\x80\x94 for education, science, infrastructure and poverty relief \xe2\x80\x94 has already faced the squeeze and will take a huge hit in the years ahead. President Obama excoriated Paul Ryan for offering a budget that would cut spending on domestic programs from its historical norm of 3 or 4 percent of G.D.P. all the way back to 1.8 percent. But the Obama budget is the Ryan budget. According to the Office of Management and Budget, Obama will cut domestic discretionary spending back to 1.8 percent of G.D.P. in six years.'b'Advocates for children, education and the poor don\xe2\x80\x99t even try to defend their programs by lobbying for cutbacks in Medicare. They know that given the choice, voters and politicians care more about middle-class seniors than about poor children.'b'So far, defense budgets have not been squeezed by the Medicare vise. But that is about to change. Oswald Spengler didn\xe2\x80\x99t get much right, but he was certainly correct when he told European leaders that they could either be global military powers or pay for their welfare states, but they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do both.'b'Europeans, who are ahead of us in confronting that decision, have chosen welfare over global power. European nations can no longer perform many elemental tasks of moving troops and fighting. As late as the 1990s, Europeans were still spending 2.5 percent of G.D.P. on defense. Now that spending is closer to 1.5 percent, and, amid European malaise, it is bound to sink further.'b'The United States will undergo a similar process. The current budget calls for a steep but possibly appropriate decline in defense spending, from 4.3 percent of G.D.P. to 3 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office.'b'But defense planners are notoriously bad at estimating how fast postwar military cuts actually come. After Vietnam, the cold war and the 1991 gulf war, they vastly underestimated the size of the cuts that eventually materialized. And those cuts weren\xe2\x80\x99t forced by the Medicare vise. The coming cuts are.'b'As the federal government becomes a health care state, there will have to be a generation of defense cuts that overwhelm anything in recent history. Keep in mind how brutal the budget pressure is going to be. According to the Government Accountability Office, if we act on entitlements today, we will still have to cut federal spending by 32 percent and raise taxes by 46 percent over the next 75 years to meet current obligations. If we postpone action for another decade, then we have to cut all non-interest federal spending by 37 percent and raise all taxes by 54 percent.'b'As this sort of crunch gradually tightens, Medicare will be the last to go. Spending on things like Head Start, scientific research and defense will go quicker. These spending cuts will transform America\xe2\x80\x99s stature in the world, making us look a lot more like Europe today. This is why Adm. Mike Mullen called the national debt the country\xe2\x80\x99s biggest security threat.'b'Chuck Hagel has been nominated to supervise the beginning of this generation-long process of defense cutbacks. If a Democratic president is going to slash defense, he probably wants a Republican at the Pentagon to give him political cover, and he probably wants a decorated war hero to boot.'b'All the charges about Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s views on Israel or Iran are secondary. The real question is, how will he begin this long cutting process? How will he balance modernizing the military and paying current personnel? How will he recalibrate American defense strategy with, say, 455,000 fewer service members?'b'How, in short, will Hagel supervise the beginning of America\xe2\x80\x99s military decline? If members of Congress don\xe2\x80\x99t want America to decline militarily, well, they have no one to blame but the voters and themselves.'b'TO: Michael Bloomberg'b'FROM: Joe Nocera'b'RE: Your Next Act'b'Dear Mayor Bloomberg,'b'This time next year, as you\xe2\x80\x99re keenly aware, you will no longer be the mayor of New York. We all know how much you love the job, and how much you\xe2\x80\x99ll miss it. No question about it: though you have had your critics (including, at times, me), you\xe2\x80\x99ve been a very good mayor.'b'They say that you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking a lot these days about what to do next. When you step down you\xe2\x80\x99ll be 71, and plenty vital enough to do something significant. And of course, with a net worth of 'b'$20 billion or so'b', you certainly have the financial wherewithal to affect the issues that are important to you. You showed it in the last election, ginning up a super PAC and 'b'spending around $10 million'b' on a handful of elections across the country where you thought your money could make a difference. Even though you got into the game late, you won more than you lost.'b'I know you have lots of interests, but after listening to you these past few weeks \xe2\x80\x94 ever since the horrible massacre in Newtown, Conn. \xe2\x80\x94 I am hoping you will direct your postmayoral energies to one issue: gun control. There is, quite simply, no one else in America who has a better chance of moving the country toward a saner gun policy than you. It is an effort worthy of your talents, and your money.'b'First, there is your obvious passion for the issue. They say it was your experience as mayor that sensitized you to the issue \xe2\x80\x94 and how could it not, with the funerals you\xe2\x80\x99ve had to attend, and the mothers of murdered children you\xe2\x80\x99ve had to console? Since the Newtown tragedy, no other high-profile politician has been as forceful in condemning gun violence and demanding \xe2\x80\x9cimmediate action\xe2\x80\x9d in Congress. Millions of Americans \xe2\x80\x94 indeed, 'b'a majority of them'b' \xe2\x80\x94 agree with you. They are looking for somebody to lead the charge against the National Rifle Association.'b'Second, though your message has been blunt, your tactics have been politically shrewd. In 2006, you started a new organization to fight gun violence: 'b'Mayors Against Illegal Guns'b'. You thought that mayors had the credibility to reframe the issue as one of crime control, rather than gun control. Mayors Against Illegal Guns now has more than 800 mayors, and nearly one million \xe2\x80\x9cactive supporters.\xe2\x80\x9d It has lobbyists in Washington and elsewhere, and has had success resisting recent N.R.A. legislative initiatives. Its short-term agenda \xe2\x80\x94 ban assault weapons, require background checks for all gun sales, make gun trafficking a federal crime, and so on \xe2\x80\x94 is a good, sensible place to start regulating guns.'b'Third \xe2\x80\x94 and let\xe2\x80\x99s not be coy here \xe2\x80\x94 you\xe2\x80\x99re rich. The N.R.A. has an annual budget that is 'b'reported to be $300 million'b'. In 2011, the combined budgets of all the groups trying to prevent gun violence came to around $16 million. The best-known of those groups, 'b'the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence'b', has seen its support and its funding dwindle in recent years. Meanwhile, the N.R.A. and its allies have done a brilliant job at pushing through laws that make it nearly impossible to prevent gun violence. There are more than 200 members of Congress who regularly get a perfect score from the N.R.A. It is going to take money to change that because money is what Congress responds to.'b'To be honest, Mr. Mayor, I wish you could start tomorrow. With each passing day, the urgency that accompanied the Newtown shooting slips further away. President Obama, who seems absolutely terrified to take on the gun lobby, didn\xe2\x80\x99t even mention guns when asked about his second-term priorities. Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, has said that the first months of the new Congressional session will be devoted to the issue of federal spending. Guns, he said, will just have to wait.'b'In recent years, even in states that experienced horrific mass killings, gun laws have only become looser. In Virginia, the State Legislature repealed a law that barred people from buying more than one handgun a month, and passed a law \xe2\x80\x9cto allow permit holders to carry concealed and loaded weapons into bars and restaurants,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'according to ProPublica'b'. That same article reported that in Texas, two years after the Fort Hood shooting, legislators \xe2\x80\x9cgave gun carriers greater freedom to take their weapons to more places.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The only two gun bills President Obama has signed 'b'were laws that expanded gun rights'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cThe country needs his leadership,\xe2\x80\x9d you said of Obama after he announced that Vice President Joe Biden was going to lead a panel making a new effort to reduce gun violence.'b'With all due respect, sir, what the country needs is your leadership on this issue. The sooner the better.'b'President Obama 'b'has nominated John O. Brennan'b' as the new director of the Central Intelligence Agency.'b''b' 'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'The founding fathers intended that voters should have personal knowledge of the people they sent to govern in Washington. Few of today\xe2\x80\x99s voters really know the candidates; this makes misrepresentation easy and effective, and creates the need for large sums of money for political campaigns, leaving the candidates beholden to those moneyed interests. So, what happened?'b'House districts were supposed to be small. The final act of the Constitutional Convention was to reduce the minimum size of a House district from 40,000 to 30,000. Today the average Congressional district includes 710,000 people, so only a small percentage of the voters have any idea what the candidates are like as people.'b'The founders believed that for a republican form of government to succeed, it should be populated with men of virtue. They also recognized that government quite naturally attracts the power-hungry. So they sought to build safeguards against scoundrels into the system. Over the years we\xe2\x80\x99ve allowed these safety mechanisms to be overridden.'b'The safeguard most easily restored is a return to small House districts. It can be achieved without a constitutional amendment by the simple passage of a bill to reduce the size of Congressional districts to, say, 100,000 people. House membership would increase from 435 \xe2\x80\x94 set by a 1911 law \xe2\x80\x94 to about 3,100.'b'This move has the added benefit of introducing a flow of new faces into Washington. These men and women would owe their seats more to the reputation they enjoyed within their community and less to the half-truths and misinformation put out by slick mass media campaigns paid for by the big-money interests. Surely among them would be the men and women of virtue so necessary to the proper functioning of our republican form of government. And so lacking today.'b'GAIL L.

We plan to publish responses and Ms. Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s rejoinder in the Sunday Review. E-mail: 'b'letters@nytimes.com'b'\n'b''b'Cambridge, Mass.'b'IN the last week, the American public has been reminded of the Central Intelligence Agency\xe2\x80\x99s contradictory attitude toward secrecy. In a 'b'critique'b' of \xe2\x80\x9cZero Dark Thirty,\xe2\x80\x9d published last Thursday in The Washington Post, a former deputy director of the C.I.A., Jose A. Rodriguez Jr., defended the use of waterboarding and said that operatives used small plastic bottles, not buckets as depicted in the film, to carry out this interrogation method on three notable terrorists. On Sunday, The New York Times reported on the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s case against a former C.I.A. officer, 'b'John C. Kiriakou'b', a critic of waterboarding who faces 30 months in prison for sharing the name of a covert operative with a reporter, who never used the name in print.'b'The contrast points to the real threat to secrecy, which comes not from the likes of Mr. Kiriakou but from the agency itself. The C.I.A. invokes secrecy to serve its interests but abandons it to burnish its image and discredit critics.'b'Over the years, I have interviewed many active and retired C.I.A. personnel who were not authorized to speak with me; they included heads of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s clandestine service, analysts and well over 100 case officers, including station chiefs. Five former directors of central intelligence have spoken to me, mostly \xe2\x80\x9con background.\xe2\x80\x9d Not one of these interviewees, to my knowledge, was taken to the woodshed, though our discussions invariably touched on classified territory.'b'Somewhere along the way, the agency that clung to \xe2\x80\x9cneither confirm nor deny\xe2\x80\x9d had morphed into one that selectively enforces its edicts on secrecy, using different standards depending on rank, message, internal politics and whim.'b'I am no fan of excessive secrecy, or of prosecuting whistle-blowers or leakers whose actions cannot be shown to have damaged American security. The C.I.A. needs secrecy, as do those who place their lives in the agency\xe2\x80\x99s hands, but the agency cannot have it both ways.'b'What message did it send when George J. Tenet, its former director, refused to explain the intelligence debacle involving nonexistent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq but later got a seven-figure book contract and became a highly paid speaker? How is it that Milton Bearden, a former covert operative, got agency permission to write a book (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Main Enemy\xe2\x80\x9d) with a New York Times reporter? What of the many memoirs written by ex-spooks like Robert Baer (\xe2\x80\x9cSee No Evil,\xe2\x80\x9d and, with his wife, another former C.I.A. operative, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Company We Keep\xe2\x80\x9d), Tony Mendez (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Master of Disguise\xe2\x80\x9d), Lindsay Moran (\xe2\x80\x9cBlowing My Cover\xe2\x80\x9d), Melissa Boyle Mahle (\xe2\x80\x9cDenial and Deception\xe2\x80\x9d) and Floyd L. Paseman (\xe2\x80\x9cA Spy\xe2\x80\x99s Journey\xe2\x80\x9d)?'b'These works help us understand the shadowy business of intelligence gathering, but collectively they may be undermining the credo of espionage: it is not a spectator sport. And how do we explain the profusion of former C.I.A. operatives who are now on-air pundits?'b'There was a time at the C.I.A., not so long ago, when the notion of cashing in on one\xe2\x80\x99s access to secrets was considered contemptible. How, then, does one explain how Chase Brandon, a former C.I.A. covert operative, became the agency\xe2\x80\x99s liaison with Hollywood (\xe2\x80\x9cMission Impossible III\xe2\x80\x9d)? And what of the International Spy Museum, a for-profit entity in Washington headed by a former covert C.I.A. officer, Peter Earnest? (The museum gift shop\xe2\x80\x99s most popular T-shirt says \xe2\x80\x9cDeny Everything.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'The agency can be quite creative in evading its own strictures on secrecy. When I was researching a book on covert operatives killed in the line of duty \xe2\x80\x94 a book the C.I.A. tried to persuade me not to write \xe2\x80\x94 a senior agency employee called me. He gave me the ISBN number and part of the title of an obscure book, and advised me to find a copy. When I did, I saw what he had left out of the title: the name of a deceased covert operative. Why? So he could pass a polygraph test if asked if he had ever given a reporter the name of an operative. All that training in tradecraft, and it was used to evade the very secrecy it was designed to protect.'b'Now consider Mr. Rodriguez. As recently as 2005, national security reporters were told that they could not use his full name \xe2\x80\x94 unusual for someone at such a senior position \xe2\x80\x94 though he was no longer in the field and was overseeing covert operations from Washington. Under the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982, even reporters can be prosecuted for unmasking operatives. So journalists complied and referred to Mr. Rodriguez simply as \xe2\x80\x9cJose.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Rodriguez oversaw \xe2\x80\x94 and then ordered the destruction of videotapes that documented \xe2\x80\x94 the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques like waterboarding. He is now a published author and public speaker. The agency has no apparent problem with that; after all, he is defending not only his own handiwork but also the agency\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'The confidentiality of clandestine work is and must be a core value at the C.I.A. But the agency\xe2\x80\x99s arbitrary and selective application of secrecy rules threatens its already fragile credibility. If confirmed, John O. Brennan, whom President Obama has nominated to lead the C.I.A., should demand more consistent and less self-serving application of those rules.'b'Washington'b'IT was a Frank Capra story with a Vietnam War twist. In 1968, a 21-year-old squad leader was riding shotgun on an armored personnel carrier when the Vietcong detonated a land mine. The soldier was on fire, his face a bubbling mass, his eardrums shattered and bleeding. Yet he instinctively reached for the unconscious 19-year-old turret gunner caught in the burning steel cage.'b'Frantically, he pulled out his comrade, who lay comatose, blood pouring out of his ears. The squad leader tugged at the dead weight and managed to throw him off, jumping down to shield him before the vehicle blew up. Later, at the field hospital, the squad leader asked about the soldier he had brought in, who only months before had saved him when he was felled by flying shrapnel.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYour brother is alive,\xe2\x80\x9d the medic said, \xe2\x80\x9con the bunk next to you.\xe2\x80\x9d In an amazing fluke, Chuck Hagel and his brother Tom fought side by side in a unit of 12. At times, because of casualties, the squad was reduced to just the two brothers and four other men. Now Mr. Hagel, a Republican former senator from Nebraska whom President Obama has nominated to be secretary of defense, faces another battle \xe2\x80\x94 as a maverick who was once a foot soldier in the conservative Congressional ranks. Attacks have come from hawkish former colleagues, pro-Israel advocates angered that Mr. Hagel once referred to them as \xe2\x80\x9cthe Jewish lobby,\xe2\x80\x9d and gays offended by a 1998 reference to an ambassadorial nominee as \xe2\x80\x9copenly, aggressively gay,\xe2\x80\x9d a comment for which Mr. Hagel recently apologized.'b'When the brothers returned from Vietnam, Chuck with two purple hearts and Tom with three purple hearts and a bronze star, they came to blows over the war. Their arguments dramatized the divisions that tore America apart. Tom, who became a liberal Democrat and 'b'law professor'b', called it a rotten, immoral war, while Chuck countered that it was a noble cause gone wrong. Tom once told me, \xe2\x80\x9cTill the day I die I will be ashamed I fought in that war.\xe2\x80\x9d Chuck said that as he lay near death, remembering the squad mates who had been ripped in half by land mines, he vowed \xe2\x80\x9cin my whole life, if there is anything I do, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be to try to stop wars.\xe2\x80\x9d At Memorial Day and Veterans Day ceremonies, Chuck was often the lone man who dared to say, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no glory in war.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The brothers finally came together, after Senator Hagel criticized President George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s post-9/11 Patriot Act, warrantless wiretaps and the Iraq war. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s been a sea change,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom said, happily, as his brother voted with Democrats in 2007 to link war financing with a timetable for bringing the troops home. \xe2\x80\x9cI felt after four years it had gotten worse in every measure,\xe2\x80\x9d Chuck explained. \xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot stay as an occupying force in the Middle East, which is essentially what we are.\xe2\x80\x9d Which, of course, is one reason the far right is gunning for him, along with the Israel lobby. In 2007, Senator Hagel made light of being called a \xe2\x80\x9cdefector\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdefeatist.\xe2\x80\x9d As a war survivor, he has seen far worse skirmishes than the ones on Capitol Hill, but has privately expressed astonishment at the vicious attempt at character assassination this time around.'b'Mr. Hagel would be the first enlisted combat veteran to be defense secretary, a grunt who has seen war from the trenches. Others who have plunged America into war \xe2\x80\x94 like the former defense secretaries Robert S. McNamara and Donald H. Rumsfeld, both former officers \xe2\x80\x94 had never fought in combat.'b'As I discovered in researching a book, Chuck Hagel had dreams of glory from the start. As an adolescent, he signed a letter he wrote to a relative, \xe2\x80\x9cSenator Hagel.\xe2\x80\x9d His father, also named Charles, a World War II tail gunner in the Pacific, was a hit in V.F.W. and American Legion halls, but took his family down a drunken road that led to a shrinking income, in smaller and smaller towns. Chuck started working at age 7, delivering papers, and at age 11 had to drive the car when his mother went to collect his father at the bars, propping him up on the passenger seat as they rode home.'b'Chuck protected his younger siblings from their father\xe2\x80\x99s drunken rages. He was 16 when their dad hit Tom for racing through the house on Christmas Eve and bumping into the holiday tree. Later, when his father came into Chuck\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom, Chuck says, he told his father \xe2\x80\x9che had ruined Christmas and told him to leave. That was the last thing I said to him.\xe2\x80\x9d Their father died that night, of heart failure. The next day his mother told Chuck, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to be the man of the house now.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Hagel learned to get along as an easy charmer and prodigious but affable self-promoter. He is well-liked by journalists. Colleagues think him an all-around good guy who sees all sides, speaks his mind and is not afraid to make enemies, as he has of Mitch McConnell, now the Republican Senate minority leader. In 1998, as a freshman, Mr. Hagel unsuccessfully challenged Mr. McConnell, of Kentucky, for leadership of a Republican senatorial campaign committee.'b'Mr. Hagel does hilarious impersonations but is humble about his past. When he began in the cellphone business, where he made a fortune, the field was so new that at parties, friends would stare blankly when he described his work. He would take off a shoe and hold it to his ear and say, \xe2\x80\x9cIn 10 years everyone is going to be going around with phones stuck to their ears.\xe2\x80\x9d At a party after he was elected to the Senate, he gave a mock prayer: \xe2\x80\x9cGive me wings to get straight to the point.\xe2\x80\x9d Everyone who had ever heard his long-winded diatribes groaned in recognition.'b'No doubt some armchair militarists on the Hill \xe2\x80\x94 many of whom ducked Vietnam \xe2\x80\x94 will question whether combat experience has much to do with running the Pentagon. It would be a travesty if they defeated Mr. Hagel. His experience has taught him the physical and mental toll of combat. He would surely think twice before sending young men and women into unnecessary, stupid or unwinnable conflicts. This is a strength, not a weakness. One thing I know: Chuck Hagel will stand up to whatever is thrown at him.'b'In the face of widespread evidence of illegal foreclosure practices, federal regulators in 2011 'b'told'b' the big banks to investigate themselves.'b'The banks had to hire consultants to review foreclosures in 2009 and 2010. If violations were found, they were supposed to reimburse wronged borrowers \xe2\x80\x9cas appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d Regulators pledged to ensure that the reviews would be comprehensive and reliable. In practice, it was left up to banks to decide what constituted wrongful foreclosure and appropriate redress.'b'Not surprisingly, after spending an estimated $1.5 billion on consultants, the banks 'b'have found'b' little wrongdoing and provided no meaningful relief. Equally unsurprising, regulators will let the banks off with a wrist slap for their failure to execute credible and effective reviews.'b'This week, the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 'b'reached a deal'b' with 10 banks under which the regulators will end the reviews and the banks will instead provide $8.5 billion in aid to borrowers. Of that, $3.3 billion is earmarked for cash payments to borrowers who lost their homes and $5.2 billion is for loan modifications and other help for borrowers currently at risk of foreclosure.'b'Regulators have said that the goal in ending the reviews is to provide relief to borrowers \xe2\x80\x9cin a more timely manner.\xe2\x80\x9d If it\xe2\x80\x99s timely relief they wanted, they would not have instituted the deeply flawed review process in the first place, nor would they have let the sham reviews drag on for more than a year. Worse, the settlement amount is inadequate.'b'Since there are no reliable analyses to identify wronged borrowers \xe2\x80\x94 which was the ostensible purpose of the self-reviews \xe2\x80\x94 there is also no clear way to apportion the $3.3 billion among 3.8 million borrowers covered by the settlement. Some borrowers may get big sums while others get nothing, or millions could receive token payments. But given the extent of foreclosure abuses and the amount of money available, the individual reimbursements will be paltry compared with the harm of losing one\xe2\x80\x99s home in an abusive process. If, say, half of the potentially eligible borrowers received a payment, each would get roughly $1,700 on average.'b'The $5.2 billion in antiforeclosure aid is potentially even more problematic. Details are not yet available, but, presumably, a bank will receive credit toward its obligation for various forms of assistance \xe2\x80\x94 say, a dollar\xe2\x80\x99s worth of credit for every dollar by which it reduces the balance on an underwater loan or a lesser amount for every dollar of payment it postpones for unemployed borrowers. A similar formula, currently being used to enforce a separate mortgage settlement struck between banks and government officials in 2012, has yielded 'b'troubling preliminary results'b'. It appears, for instance, that much of the aid is going to higher-income borrowers, even though the housing bust disproportionately hurt low-income communities.'b'For the new settlement to have any credibility, regulators must appoint an independent monitor with full authority to oversee, analyze and publicly report on the deal\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement.'b'In the meantime, 'b'the only hope'b' for lasting change rests with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is expected to issue new rules shortly to rein in the risky and abusive mortgage practices of banks.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s needed are rules to ensure that lenders face legal consequences if they structure and promote loans that fail because of lax underwriting. Rules are also needed to ensure that all eligible borrowers facing foreclosure can receive modifications according to specific, publicly available criteria. If foreclosure is unavoidable, a bank must provide borrowers with proof of its legal right to foreclose before the process gets under way.'b'The bureau cannot undo the past, but strong rules could at least help to ensure that the past is not repeated.'b''b'To the Editor: 'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Taboo of Menstruation'b',\xe2\x80\x9d by Rose George (Op-Ed, Dec. 29), sheds a welcome light on the unfortunate effects of menstrual superstitions and ignorance in parts of India.

Reputable studies have shown that there is no independent link between abortion and negative psychological outcomes.'b'This is just one example of the many inaccurate, scientifically baseless statements these centers use to misinform women. How you can you be acting in good faith when your entire premise is predicated on lies?'b'Education, counseling and support are clearly not the goal. Rather they seek to increase the shame and guilt of vulnerable women to further their own agenda. And that is anything but compassionate.'b'ANGELA JANIS'b'\nMadison, Wis., Jan. 5, 2013'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'To Save Wildlife, and Tourism, Kenyans Take Up Arms'b'\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Coveting Horns, Ruthless Smugglers\xe2\x80\x99 Rings Put Rhinos in the Cross Hairs'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Price of Ivory\xe2\x80\x9d series, news articles, Dec. 30 and Jan. 1) give readers a front-line view of how poaching is devastating elephant and rhino populations in Africa.

Clearly, justice must be served, but there are disturbing aspects to the way the case is being handled.'b'The victim died 'b'last month'b', two weeks after the brutal attack in which she was beaten, assaulted with an iron rod on a moving bus and then thrown bleeding onto the street. She had taken the bus after seeing a movie with a male friend, who was also beaten. 'b'Thousands of Indians have demonstrated'b' and called for justice.'b'The case has brought to light 'b'India\xe2\x80\x99s growing problem with violence against women'b'. It has underscored serious weaknesses in the judicial system, which encourages women not to bring charges against rapists and rarely brings to justice those who are accused. Incompetent police are also part of the problem. The victim\xe2\x80\x99s male companion said later that police were slow to respond and then wasted more time wrangling over who had jurisdiction over the crime.'b'Stunned by the popular response, authorities set up a 'b'fast-track process'b' to hear the case. But while efforts to try the case expeditiously are to be commended, some legal experts are understandably concerned that a rush to judgment could mean that any verdicts will be overturned on appeal. The government should not be so eager to appease popular rage that it takes imprudent shortcuts.'b'Also disturbing is the fact that most lawyers have refused to represent the defendants. Their outrage at the reprehensible attack is understandable, but for the sake of all Indians, and for the country\xe2\x80\x99s judicial system, there needs to be a fair trial, which requires that the accused have counsel so they can prepare a defense. Two lawyers have agreed to represent three of the five accused men. A sixth defendant, a teenager, is to be tried separately in juvenile court.'b'The judge overseeing the trial has contributed to the sense of unease about the fairness of the proceedings. 'b'On Monday'b', he closed the trial to reporters and invoked a law that makes it \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful for any person to print or publish any matter in relation to any such proceedings, except with the previous permission of the court.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Transparency is needed to give Indians confidence that the judiciary is serving the common good and delivering credible justice. India allowed journalists to cover the trial of those accused of the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks and should do so in this case as well.'b'The New Delhi attack has focused much-needed attention on India\xe2\x80\x99s sexual assault laws, which are now being reviewed by a special panel of judges. Its report, 'b'expected in January'b', and New Delhi\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to it (some proposed new laws have already been introduced in Parliament) will reveal a lot about whether the government is serious about doing more to protect women. This case is too important to allow it to be tarnished by cutting legal corners.'b'The board of the American International Group will meet on Wednesday 'b'to consider'b' joining a misguided lawsuit against the government, which spent $182 billion to save the insurance giant from near certain failure.'b'As part of its fiduciary duty, the board is required to consider the suit, but it would be well advised to vote against joining the case, which was initiated by the company\xe2\x80\x99s former top executive, Maurice Greenberg. Mr. Greenberg argues that the government put onerous terms on its bailout, hurting the interests of shareholders of the company, including him.'b'It is unclear exactly what Mr. Greenberg, who left A.I.G. in 2005 but remained a big shareholder in the company, thinks he will achieve with the $25 billion lawsuit. He and his lawyers 'b'have argued'b' that the government\xe2\x80\x99s terms violated the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition against taking of private property for \xe2\x80\x9cpublic use, without just compensation.\xe2\x80\x9d They assert the 14 percent interest rate the Federal Reserve Bank of New York charged on its loans to A.I.G. were punitive and that the government unfairly diluted the holdings of shareholders like Mr. Greenberg, who along with affiliated investors owned about 12 percent of the company before the bailout.'b'The case has been filed in courts in Washington and New York. In Washington, it is being heard in United States Court of Federal Claims. The Federal District Court in New York 'b'dismissed the case in November'b', a ruling that is now before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.'b'The allegations ignore the fact that in September 2008 when the government stepped in to help A.I.G., no private investors were willing to finance the company, which many feared had been made insolvent by its enormous bets on mortgage-related investments. In fact, just four months before the bailout, Mr. Greenberg 'b'himself described'b' the situation at the company as a \xe2\x80\x9ccrisis.\xe2\x80\x9d Had the Treasury and Federal Reserve not stepped in, A.I.G. would have filed for bankruptcy protection, wiping out its shareholders and institutions that it did business with.'b'If Mr. Greenberg and A.I.G. are truly interested in holding someone to account for the losses that the company\xe2\x80\x99s shareholders have suffered, they should look within. Why not sue the executives who pushed the company into making toxic investments or the board members who did a poor job supervising management? They are far more responsible for the losses the shareholders suffered than the government, which cleaned up the mess at a substantial risk to taxpayers.'b'The Treasury recently\xc2\xa0'b'sold its remaining stake'b'\xc2\xa0in the company for more than it invested, but it could very well have suffered huge losses had the Obama administration and Congress not taken steps to stabilize\xc2\xa0the economy and the housing market.'b'A.I.G. should be praising, not suing, the government. And, in fact, the company has been running 'b'TV ads'b' thanking the country for coming to its rescue . A.I.G.\xe2\x80\x99s directors should keep those ads and the history of the bailout in mind when they meet on Wednesday.'b'Whenever I hear the word \xe2\x80\x9ccliff,\xe2\x80\x9d I am reminded of something that President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s science adviser, John Holdren, used to say about how we need to respond to climate change because no one can predict when it might take a disruptive, nonlinear turn. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are driving toward a cliff in a fog,\xe2\x80\x9d said Holdren about the climate, and that\xe2\x80\x99s always a good time \xe2\x80\x9cto start tapping on the brakes.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed, when you think about how much financial debt we\xe2\x80\x99ve built up in the market and how much carbon debt we\xe2\x80\x99ve built up in the atmosphere, the wisest thing we could do as a country today is to start tapping on the brakes by both emitting less carbon to bend the emissions curve down and racking up less debt to bend our debt-to-G.D.P. curve down. Unfortunately, we are still doing neither.'b'Indeed, we are actually taunting the two most powerful and merciless forces on the planet, the market and Mother Nature, 'b'at the same time'b'. We\xe2\x80\x99re essentially saying to both of them: \xe2\x80\x9cHey, what\xe2\x80\x99ve you got, baby? No interest rate rises? A little bitty temperature increase? That\xe2\x80\x99s all you\xe2\x80\x99ve got?\xe2\x80\x9d I just hope we get our act together before the market and Mother Nature each show us what they\xe2\x80\x99ve got.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at the huge carbon and financial deficits we\xe2\x80\x99re amassing. For thousands of years up to the dawn of the industrial age 200 years ago, the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere contained 280 parts per million of the heat-trapping greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Today, that number is nearly 400 p.p.m., with 450 p.p.m. routinely cited as the tipping point where we create the conditions for out-of-control acceleration. Melting the permafrost in Alaska, Canada and Siberia, for example, would release massive amounts of carbon that would further increase global warming. Permafrost is packed with CO2 and frozen methane, which is 25 times more potent a greenhouse gas than CO2. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the tundra continues melting,\xe2\x80\x9d says Hal Harvey, the chief executive of Energy Innovation, \xe2\x80\x9cwe could basically release the equivalent of all the carbon that all humanity has emitted from the start of history to now.\xe2\x80\x9d That would really send temperatures soaring, ice melting and sea levels rising.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re on a similar trajectory with our debt. Mounting deficits have driven America\xe2\x80\x99s debt-to-G.D.P. ratio from 36.2 percent in 2007 to 72.8 percent today. In their widely hailed book on credit crises, \xe2\x80\x9cThis Time Is Different,\xe2\x80\x9d the economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff argue that countries that allow their debt-to-G.D.P. ratios to exceed 90 percent experience slower growth and greater instability \xe2\x80\x94 much like hitting a climate tipping point. Indeed, they note, those who would point to low interest rates today as some kind of \xe2\x80\x9call-clear\xe2\x80\x9d for more debt \xe2\x80\x9cshould remember that market interest rates can change like the weather.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There is another striking parallel. At some point, when we allow so much carbon to build up in the atmosphere, our mightiest efforts to cut emissions through energy efficiency, conservation and new technologies will only enable us to stay in place. They won\xe2\x80\x99t be able bend the curve downward anymore. And 450 p.p.m. is not a place we want to get stuck. And, at some point, the debt will get so large that big tax increases and spending cuts will simply go to pay interest. We also won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to bend that curve anymore, and spending on infrastructure, education and the poor will vanish.'b'I am struck by how many liberals insist on reducing carbon emissions immediately, but, on the deficit, say there is no urgency because no interest rates rises are in sight. And I am struck by how many conservatives insist we must reduce the deficit immediately, but, on climate, say there is no urgency because, so far, temperature rise has been slight. (Although 2012 was the hottest year on record in the continental U.S.) One reason interest rates are so low is that they are being suppressed by the Federal Reserve\xe2\x80\x99s quantitative easing. That won\xe2\x80\x99t last. As for the climate, well, \xe2\x80\x9cMother Nature doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do quantitative easing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harvey. Beware of nonlinear moves in both.'b'We can\xe2\x80\x99t go off coal overnight, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t go into recession by cutting spending overnight, but we need to start tapping on the brakes in both realms by agreeing on spending cuts, tax increases and new investments that would be phased in as the economy improves, as well as higher efficiency standards for power plants, buildings, vehicles and appliances that would be phased in, too.'b'A carbon tax would reinforce and make both strategies easier. According to a September 2012 study by the Congressional Research Service, a small carbon tax of $20 per ton \xe2\x80\x94 escalating by 5.6 percent annually \xe2\x80\x94 could cut the projected 10-year deficit by roughly 50 percent (from $2.3 trillion down to $1.1 trillion).'b'What would you rather do to help solve our fiscal problem: Give up your home mortgage deduction and wait two more years for Social Security and Medicare, or pay a little extra for gasoline and electricity? These will be our choices. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather pay the little carbon tax, especially since it would clean up the air for our kids, drive innovation and make us less dependent on the most unstable region in the world: the Middle East.'b'How could a carbon tax not be on the table today?'b'WASHINGTON'b'Everyone told me not to fall in love so quickly, that I\xe2\x80\x99d get my heart broken.'b'But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it. Robert Griffin III and Alfred Morris, the stellar Redskins rookies, were such appealing palliatives to our ugly, nihilistic politics and our cascade of lurid sports scandals.'b'Watching the magnetic newcomers last summer after I returned from covering Jerry Sandusky\xe2\x80\x99s maleficent trial in Bellefonte, Pa., made sports seem fresh again and gave Washington some rare forward momentum. The rookies put their hearts into every single play.'b'But then, on Sunday, the spell snapped when the knee snapped. Coach Mike Shanahan committed malpractice, letting a hobbled young quarterback lurch around \xe2\x80\x9clike a pirate with a peg leg,\xe2\x80\x9d as The Washington Post\xe2\x80\x99s Sally Jenkins wrote. The autocratic, crusty 60-year-old, who makes $7 million a year, risked the kid\xe2\x80\x99s career and the team\xe2\x80\x99s future trying to win a wild-card playoff game \xe2\x80\x94 the opposite of what the Nationals did with Stephen Strasburg.'b'At that moment, the Redskins became like the rest of Washington, and the rest of our self-centered, grasshopper attention-span culture \xe2\x80\x94 going for short-term gain and avoiding long-term pain.'b'Everything they do on Capitol Hill is about getting through the next few months, or next few minutes, or next confrontation. John Boehner, after making a mess of the negotiations with the president, is now talking about raising the debt limit in monthly increments. What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with weekly, or how about hourly?'b'Like Congress patching gaping fiscal wounds, the Redskins didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to fathom that they were damaging the franchise long term. \xe2\x80\x9cTrying to win that game, they risked 120 victories over the next 10 years,\xe2\x80\x9d the writer David Israel told me. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Shanahan had not been protecting his fearless phenom well all season and had let him start playing again too soon after RGIII sprained a ligament against Baltimore four weeks ago, reinjuring a right knee that had required surgery at Baylor. (Not to mention the concussion he suffered two months prior.)'b'Dr. James Andrews, the sideline doctor and renowned orthopedic surgeon who was at the game in a goofy hat with pompoms, told USA Today before Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s kickoff that \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a nervous wreck letting him come back as quick as he has.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He also said RGIII ran back into the Baltimore game without letting the doctors look at him or talk to him and that \xe2\x80\x9cscared the hell out of me.\xe2\x80\x9d Shanahan told reporters that Dr. Andrews had given an O.K. for RGIII to go back in, but that turned out to be just a vague \xe2\x80\x9chigh sign\xe2\x80\x9d from the surgeon as Griffin ran past. In a sport that has learned the horrific long-term impact of concussions, is that the best that can be done to protect headstrong young sports heroes?'b'The team handed over three first-round draft picks, a second-round pick and $21 million to get RGIII. Shanahan should have known that you don\xe2\x80\x99t leave a life-altering decision to a gung-ho 22-year-old who thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s invincible \xe2\x80\x94 a kid who\xe2\x80\x99d never been in the playoffs, amped up on adrenaline and conditioned from childhood to keep playing and to avoid the scorn that comes from fellow players if you opt out without severe enough injuries.'b'Even though RGIII threw two touchdowns in the first quarter, it was clear that his knee was not stable. When he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t plant his foot properly to throw a pass, he ran for the yardage; his knee buckled and he fell when nobody had even hit him. He tore off his helmet in a sign of distress.'b'It was dumb football not to switch to the talented backup quarterback, Kirk Cousins, so the other players would have a chance to move forward and RGIII would not end up in the fourth quarter writhing on the ground, his leg bizarrely twisted, helpless to reach for a low snap at the 5-yard line.'b'Shanahan said after the game that RGIII \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0who had surgery Wednesday morning in Pensacola, Fla. \xe2\x80\x94 told him he could play because he was \xe2\x80\x9churt\xe2\x80\x9d but not \xe2\x80\x9cinjured,\xe2\x80\x9d so \xe2\x80\x9cthat was enough for me.\xe2\x80\x9d Such Clintonian parsing makes you wonder if Shanahan was worried about the short life expectancy for losing coaches of Redskins owner Dan Snyder.'b'In his book \xe2\x80\x9cThink Like a Champion,\xe2\x80\x9d Shanahan cites an Arabic saying he likes: \xe2\x80\x9cHe who knows not, and knows not that he knows not, is a fool. Shun him.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The negligent coach \xe2\x80\x94 and, I\xe2\x80\x99m sad to say, bullheaded quarterback \xe2\x80\x94 hurt their team and jeopardized their future.'b'The once humble RGIII was sounding disturbingly like the legend he has yet to become, saying he had to stay in because he was \xe2\x80\x9cthe best option for this team\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cyou have to step up and be a man.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As David Israel notes, \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve created a cult of personality around this kid. He might be the most personable quarterback in the world, but if he can\xe2\x80\x99t play, no one\xe2\x80\x99s going to want to follow him. In a Boy Scout troop, maybe, but not a football team.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If I want to see self-serving behavior, warped decision-making, dangerous rationalizations and chuckleheads mortgaging the future, I can go back to watching Congress.'b'Gov. Andrew Cuomo vowed 'b'on Wednesday'b' that New York would soon enact the \xe2\x80\x9ctoughest gun assault weapon ban in the nation. Period.\xe2\x80\x9d New Yorkers should hold him to that promise. He made stronger gun laws an urgent priority in his annual 'b'State of the State address'b', but he will need to present the specifics quickly to a divided Legislature and push lawmakers to act. The 'b'supporting documents for his speech'b' suggest that he plans to tighten the ban on large magazines and require all gun owners to reapply for a permit every few years, replacing the lifetime permits allowed in some counties. He also wants mental health professionals to be able to report if someone is dangerous, allowing law enforcement to confiscate the individual\xe2\x80\x99s firearms. And he would make the process of licensing guns more efficient while increasing penalties for use of guns illegally.'b'The gun measures are part of a long list of proposals and goals for the legislative session, addressing everything from hunger to housing shortages to women\xe2\x80\x99s equality. Responding to Hurricane Sandy, he offered aid to those who wanted to move out of flood-prone zones as well as those who wished to rebuild in ways that could better respond to future surges. He also proposed longer-term measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change, a root cause of extreme weather events.'b'Several other big items stood out. He said he would push for a minimum-wage increase to $8.75 per hour from the current $7.25 an hour \xe2\x80\x94 a long overdue increase that deserves the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s full support. He wants school districts to be able to extend the school day and perhaps even the school year. He promised a bill to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana in public view, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not fair. It\xe2\x80\x99s not right. It must end, and it must end now.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Once again, Mr. Cuomo said he would achieve the much-needed and much-delayed reform of the state\xe2\x80\x99s scandalous political fund-raising laws. Most important, he vowed to start public financing for campaigns so that more candidates can compete against wealthy competitors. He promised to allow early voting in the state and to clean up New York\xe2\x80\x99s notoriously cluttered ballot. Now he needs to sell these reforms to stubborn state politicians who revel in the status quo.'b'It is a long, ambitious list. If Mr. Cuomo is looking for a place to start, it should be real gun control, a minimum-wage increase and campaign finance reform.'b'LOS ANGELES'b'THE fiscal cliff may have been avoided, but an even higher-stakes political standoff \xe2\x80\x94 this time, over the 'b'federal debt ceiling'b' \xe2\x80\x94 is just around the bend.'b'Congressional Republicans have said they will demand immense cuts to popular government programs in exchange for agreeing to raise the nation\xe2\x80\x99s authorized borrowing limit of 'b'$16.4 trillion'b'. The Treasury Department briefly nudged against that ceiling on Dec. 31, but used \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary\xe2\x80\x9d financial measures to buy more time. If nothing is done, the government will soon be unable to pay all of its bills in a timely manner. This unprecedented event would profoundly damage the government\xe2\x80\x99s credit rating and send the financial system into a tailspin.'b'So far, President Obama isn\xe2\x80\x99t giving in. As he rightly said last week, he \xe2\x80\x9cwill not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they\xe2\x80\x99ve already racked up through the laws that they passed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But for the president\xe2\x80\x99s tough talk to be credible, Congress and the country need to know before we reach the breach point \xe2\x80\x94 an event that could come as early as February \xe2\x80\x94 that he has a plausible plan to work around the debt ceiling.'b'There are no great options. Most of the ideas floated so far would either severely disrupt the public markets for Treasury debt or rely on a constitutional claim of executive authority so far-reaching that we would very likely spend the next two years locked in an impeachment fight.'b'Some have suggested, for instance, that the president could ignore the debt ceiling and direct the Treasury to issue more bonds to cover its obligations. But the Constitution is clear, and Mr. Obama agrees, that Congress alone has 'b'the power to authorize new borrowing'b'.'b'Other supposed solutions \xe2\x80\x94 like the notion that the Treasury Department could create a 'b'$1 trillion dollar platinum coin'b' and deposit it in its own account at the Federal Reserve \xe2\x80\x94 are even more fantastical.'b'However, there is a plausible course of action, one that the president should publicly adopt in the coming weeks as his contingency plan should debt-ceiling negotiations falter. He should threaten to issue scrip \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cregistered warrants\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 to existing claims holders (other than those who own actual government debt) in lieu of money. Recipients of these I.O.U.\xe2\x80\x99s could include federal employees, defense contractors, Medicare service providers, Social Security recipients and others.'b'The 'b'scrip would not violate'b' the debt ceiling because it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t constitute a new borrowing of money backed by the credit of the United States. It would merely be a formal acknowledgment of a pre-existing monetary claim against the United States that the Treasury was not currently able to pay. The president could therefore establish a scrip program by executive order without piling a constitutional crisis on top of a fiscal one.'b'To avoid any confusion with actual Treasury debt, and to be consistent with the law governing claims against the United States more generally, the scrip would not pay interest in most cases. And unlike debt, it would have no fixed maturity date but rather would become redeemable in cash only when the secretary of the Treasury was able to certify that there\xe2\x80\x99s enough money available in the Treasury\xe2\x80\x99s general fund to cover it.'b'Finally, the scrip would be transferable, allowing financial institutions to buy it at a high percentage of its face value, knowing that the political crisis would almost certainly be resolved before long.'b'The federal 'b'Anti-Assignment Act'b' generally prohibits the transfer of claims against the United States from one private actor to another, but the government could waive the act\xe2\x80\x99s application, which is what the president would do here.'b'The strategy may sound far-fetched, but it has been used before: in fact, California relied on it as recently as 2009.'b'Beginning in July of that year, California addressed its budget crisis by 'b'issuing 450,000 registered warrants'b', totaling $2.6 billion, to individual and business claimants, including recipients of aid programs, recipients of tax refunds and government contractors. Those holders who needed immediate cash were usually able to sell their registered warrants to banks at face value, though some institutions limited such purchases.'b'Whether as a result of public shaming, pressure from banks or a newfound sense of responsibility, the Legislature quickly worked out a budget deal and the scrip was then redeemed for cash.'b'Throughout the ordeal, California continued to pay its public debt service in cash and on schedule and never lost an investment-grade credit rating.'b'A federal scrip program, importantly, would not explicitly challenge any constitutional allocation of powers. Nor would there be confusion in the marketplace between valid Treasury bonds and this new paper, which would have a different name, financial terms and legal status. And because the scrip would be transferable, claimants forced to accept it would be able to turn it into immediate cash in private markets, for as long as the Treasury was unable to issue new debt.'b'Would a federal scrip program be a painless way of resolving a debt ceiling crisis? Hardly. But it would be the least awful way to defang the most extortionate demands of Congressional hard-liners \xe2\x80\x94 and one that would not permanently damage America\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal standing in the world.'b'RETURNING home from a visit to Russia in 1774, the 'b'philosophe'b' Denis Diderot wrote that in France, he could not \xe2\x80\x9chelp but think that I\xe2\x80\x99ve the soul of a slave in a country where men\xc2\xa0are called free,\xe2\x80\x9d whereas in Russia he \xe2\x80\x9chad the soul of a free man in a country where men are called slaves.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Has G\xc3\xa9rard Depardieu had similar thoughts of late?'b'On Sunday, President Vladimir V. Putin 'b'welcomed'b' the French actor to Russia with a newly issued Russian passport. Mr. Depardieu, outraged by the French Socialist government\xe2\x80\x99s proposed 75 percent wealth tax, had walked out on his country. A fan of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s low taxes, he also praised its \xe2\x80\x9cgreat democracy\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cI love your country, Russia \xe2\x80\x94 its people, its history, its writers. I love your culture, your intelligence.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s increasing authoritarianism went unmentioned.'b'In the centuries since French celebrities began washing up on its shores, Russia has used them to affirm itself as a center of European culture, as well as to poke its finger in the eye of Western nations. Russia has always needed its Depardieus, just as much as they needed Russia.'b'Diderot\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for visiting were not terribly different from Mr. Depardieu\xe2\x80\x99s. Catherine the Great had repeatedly expressed her desire to meet the celebrated 'b'philosophe'b'. In an age of enlightened despotism, when kings made a show of seeking the guidance of philosophers on how best to rule, such an invitation was hard to ignore. This was certainly the case for Diderot, editor of the Encyclop\xc3\xa9die, whose entry on government affirmed that the laws of nature and reason must guide rulers in bettering the lot of the people, for whom the greatest good is liberty. (That famous line attributed to Diderot \xe2\x80\x94 about the last king being strangled by the entrails of the last priest \xe2\x80\x94 did not make the great work.)'b'The more pressing motivation, however, was financial: Diderot was broke. Catherine thus took the extraordinary step of buying Diderot\xe2\x80\x99s personal library, leaving it in his possession until his death and paying him a salary as librarian. In return, in 1773, Diderot went to St. Petersburg, where he enjoyed long t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaates with Catherine, whom he described as embodying the charms of Cleopatra and the soul of Caesar.'b'Catherine was thrilled to boast of Diderot\xe2\x80\x99s friendship, and their conversations left some lasting marks \xe2\x80\x94 the bruises on Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s legs, for example, when the excited 'b'philosophe'b' grasped them tightly to make a point \xe2\x80\x94 but the empress had little patience with his idealism. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had followed his advice,\xe2\x80\x9d she said of her visiting Frenchman, \xe2\x80\x9ceverything would have been turned upside down in my kingdom.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'La mission civilisatrice \xe2\x80\x94 France\xe2\x80\x99s civilizing mission \xe2\x80\x94 was nevertheless started in Russia, and furthered by a wave of French celebrity \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s fleeing the very event for which thinkers like Diderot were held responsible: the revolution. Few countries seemed safer for French aristocrats than reactionary Russia.'b'Small wonder, then, that Joseph de Maistre, the dark genius of counterrevolutionary thought from Savoy, ended up taking a diplomatic posting in St. Petersburg. The city became the setting for his \xe2\x80\x9cSt. Petersburg Dialogues,\xe2\x80\x9d which, in voluptuous French, offered a profoundly grim view of human nature. Man was violent and domineering; society needed a strong hand. Near the beginning, Maistre, gazing on a statue of Peter the Great, rhapsodized: \xe2\x80\x9cHis terrible arm is still extended\xe2\x80\x9d over Russia. \xe2\x80\x9cLooking at him, one does not know whether this bronze hand protects or threatens.\xe2\x80\x9d The answer for Maistre, of course, was both, and he helped provide an intellectual justification for the dim brutality of the czarist state.'b'A new generation of French intellectuals and artists arrived after 1917, the revolution that grew out of 1789. The Surrealist Louis Aragon, who toured Russia in the 1930s, was just one who was dazzled by what he wanted to see. He praised the science of the re-education of man unfolding in Stalin\xe2\x80\x99s gulag, while in his notorious poem \xe2\x80\x9cRed Front\xe2\x80\x9d he urged, in Lenin\xe2\x80\x99s name, the massacre of France\xe2\x80\x99s bourgeois political leaders.'b'Set alongside these remarks, Mr. Depardieu\xe2\x80\x99s sallies on Russian democracy are mostly silly. But they also have a history. From enlightened despotism through absolute autocracy to Soviet communism, Russia has been a screen against which France has projected its ideological or merely idiosyncratic dreams. That these dreams have proved nightmares for those who really lived them is, of course, beside the point for Russia\xe2\x80\x99s leaders.'b'One of Mr. Depardieu\xe2\x80\x99s best-known roles is as Georges Danton, the revolutionary leader consumed by the events he helped incite. As he is led to the guillotine, Danton tells his executioners, \xe2\x80\x9cShow my head to the people \xe2\x80\x94 it is worth seeing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Considering the many photographs of Mr. Depardieu embracing the Russian leader this week, we can well imagine this is a sentiment Mr. Putin happily shares.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s Long Road'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 2):'b'I agree that much more needs to be done for Haiti to rebuild, but I also regret the overall lack of attention to the extraordinary work of dozens of local Haitian grass-roots organizations.

HARRINGTON'b'\nWallingford, Conn., Jan. 5, 2013'b''b'Matthew Descamps was 'b'convicted'b' in 2008 of being a felon in possession of a handgun and ammunition under federal law, which usually leads to a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. But a federal trial judge in Washington State more than doubled that sentence to 21 years and 10 months under the Armed Career Criminal Act.'b'That federal statute imposes a minimum sentence of 15 years and a maximum of life for a felon who commits a crime with a gun after three prior convictions for violent felonies. The judge concluded that Mr. Descamps\xe2\x80\x99s previous conviction for burglary under California law should count as one of the three felonies.'b'Mr. Descamps appealed the sentence, arguing that the burglary should not be counted against him because the state law does not involve illegal entry into a building (a person could be convicted of burglary even if he legally entered the premises) and the Supreme Court has 'b'said'b' that a burglary conviction under the Armed Career Criminal Act has to involve \xe2\x80\x9cbasic elements,\xe2\x80\x9d including an illegal entry. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed his sentence.'b'In 'b'Descamps v. United States'b', which the Supreme Court heard this week, Mr. Descamps makes a persuasive argument that the trial judge should not have disregarded the California\xe2\x80\x99s definition of burglary to fit the Armed Career Criminal Act. Trial judges can 'b'look'b' at certain documents, like a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s plea agreement, to figure out whether a state crime involved the basic elements required under the federal statute. But they cannot fish for facts to match such elements if they aren\xe2\x80\x99t included in the state\xe2\x80\x99s definition of the crime, as the judge did in this case.'b'During the 'b'oral argument'b', the justices sometimes sounded frustrated by this approach. Justice Elena Kagan pointed out that it means that any conviction under California\xe2\x80\x99s burglary law would not qualify as a prior crime. But given what is at stake, it\xe2\x80\x99s only right that state convictions be carefully considered if they are used under the federal statute to lengthen criminal sentences.'b'A committee of central bankers and regulators from more than two dozen countries, including the United States, has disappointingly given in to lobbying by big banks and 'b'watered down important rules'b' meant to strengthen the global financial system. 'b'The change'b' will let banks include risky financial instruments like corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities as part of their liquid asset reserves, which are meant to cover up to 30 days of cash outflows during crises. And the banks have until 2019, not 2015, to comply fully with the easier standards. Each nation will decide when and how to implement the rules.'b'The committee unanimously rolled back the so-called Basel III rules that were adopted in 2010 to make them \xe2\x80\x9cmore realistic,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England. The banks argued that requiring them to hold most of their liquid reserves as cash and government securities would restrict their ability to lend to small businesses and consumers because they would have less money to lend.'b'The problem is that the new assets defined as liquid are precisely those that banks found difficult to value and trade in 2008. Relying on them to provide liquidity during a crisis is a recipe for disaster, said Anat Admati, a professor of finance and economics at Stanford University.'b'But the banks want to be allowed to hold more such assets because they are more profitable than cash or government bonds, like 10-year Treasury notes, which were yielding just 1.86 percent a year on Wednesday. Big banks also know that in a crisis they would likely receive emergency loans and capital from central banks and their governments, so why tie up their reserves with assets that provide only modest returns?'b'Coming four years after the failure of Lehman Brothers, the dilution of liquidity standards suggests that banks are again dictating policy in ways that will put the world at greater risk of another crisis. Policy makers in Washington and other capitals need to ask banking regulators to hold the line on the very limited progress made so far.'b'The only reason that income taxes on 99 percent of Americans did not go up 'b'this month'b' was that Speaker John Boehner briefly broke with an iron rule of Republican control over the House. He allowed the fiscal-cliff deal to be put to a full vote of the House even though a strong majority of Republicans opposed it.'b'That informal rule, which bars a vote on legislation unless it has the support of a majority of Republicans, has been one of the biggest stumbling blocks to progress and consensus in Congress, and, in its own way, is even more pernicious than the filibuster abuse that often ties up the Senate. Under the 60-vote requirement to break a filibuster, at least, coalitions can occasionally be formed between the Democratic majority and enough Republicans to reach the three-fifths threshold.'b'But under the majority-of-the-majority rule in the House, Democrats are completely cut out of the governing process, not even given a chance to vote unless Republicans have decided to pass something. Since 2010, there have been enough extremist Republicans in the caucus to block consideration of most of the bills requested by the White House or sent over from the Senate. If President Obama is for something, it\xe2\x80\x99s a safe bet that most House Republicans are against it, and thus won\xe2\x80\x99t bring it up.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why the House never took a vote on the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s latest five-year farm bill. Or the Violence Against Women Act. Or a full six-year transportation bill. Republican opposition prevented consideration in the last term 'b'of the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s $60 billion'b' in providing relief from Hurricane Sandy; so far, 'b'the House has been willing to approve'b' only a measly $9.7 billion after members claimed the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s bill was full of (nonexistent) pork.'b'The House has always been a sprawling, unruly chamber, and its leaders have long used some form of control to choose which bills reach the floor and to push their party\xe2\x80\x99s policies. The majority-of-the-majority requirement, however, is relatively new and entirely a Republican creation. Newt Gingrich occasionally used it when he was speaker, but it was 'b'institutionalized in 2004'b' by Speaker Dennis Hastert (and Tom DeLay, the power behind the throne).'b'This anti-democratic tactic, now known as the \xe2\x80\x9cHastert rule,\xe2\x80\x9d helped turn the chamber into a one-party institution that utterly silenced the minority. A post-9/11 intelligence reform bill, urgently sought by President George W. Bush, was bottled up by Mr. Hastert and his allies, who knew it would pass if Democrats were allowed to vote.'b'This was not a rule used by Democrats. Speaker Tom Foley allowed the North American Free Trade Agreement to pass in 1993 on mostly Republican votes, and when Nancy Pelosi took the job in 2007, 'b'she repudiated the Hastert rule'b', allowing both parties to vote together on legislation. For example, she allowed a bill to pass paying for the Iraq war over the objections of most Democrats.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the speaker of the House,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at the time. \xe2\x80\x9cI have to take into consideration something broader than the majority of the majority in the Democratic caucus.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s an attitude rarely expressed by Mr. Boehner. But if the country is to move forward on issues with widespread support \xe2\x80\x94 getting past the debt limit, immigration reform, gun control, and investments in education and infrastructure \xe2\x80\x94 he will have to let the two parties vote together on a solution.'b'Forty years ago this month, the Supreme Court handed down the great abortion rights decision Roe v. Wade. To be honest, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be seeing a whole lot of cake and Champagne. Time magazine recognized the occasion with a downbeat cover story. (\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve Been Losing Ever Since.\xe2\x80\x9d) Gallup polls suggest support for abortion rights is fading, particularly among young Americans, and that more people now regard themselves as \xe2\x80\x9cpro-life\xe2\x80\x9d than \xe2\x80\x9cpro-choice.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'On the other hand \xe2\x80\x94 I know you had faith that eventually we\xe2\x80\x99d get to the other hand \xe2\x80\x94 the polls depend on the question. According to the Quinnipiac poll, if you ask Americans whether they agree with the Roe decision, nearly two-thirds say yes.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s always been this way. Americans are permanently uncomfortable with the abortion issue, and they respond most positively to questions that suggest it isn\xe2\x80\x99t up to them to decide anything. \xe2\x80\x9cShould be a matter between a woman and her doctor\xe2\x80\x9d is usually a popular option.'b'Whatever recent changes there are in public opinion may be less about abortion than about the term \xe2\x80\x9cpro-choice.\xe2\x80\x9d This week, Planned Parenthood unveiled a pile of new research, some of which suggests that younger women don\xe2\x80\x99t like labels. Or at least not that one. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been discussing changing our name for the past year or so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kelsey Warrick, a Georgetown University student who\xe2\x80\x99s president of Hoyas for Choice.'b'Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s like feminism, a word with a glorious history that\xe2\x80\x99s rejected by many young people who are staunchly in favor of women\xe2\x80\x99s rights. Maybe, as Dawn Laguens, the executive vice president of Planned Parenthood, suggested at a press conference this week, it\xe2\x80\x99s just that young women feel as though they\xe2\x80\x99re up to their ears in choices already.'b'We may never know, although if pro-choice activists want to rebrand themselves the Movement for Leaving Women Alone, it\xe2\x80\x99s likely nobody under the age of 50 would object.'b'One way or another, the abortion rights cause needs all the help it can get. Abortion clinics around the country are reeling under crazy new rules that make it impossible for them to operate. In Virginia, the state board of health is demanding that clinics follow the same architectural standards as hospitals, including 5-foot-wide hallways. In Texas, the Legislature is considering a law that would require that all abortions be performed in ambulatory surgical centers. When the state passed that requirement for pregnancies beyond 16 weeks in 2004, every single clinic doing that procedure was forced to shut down. Only a handful managed to reopen \xe2\x80\x94 in a state that encompasses more than 261,000 square miles.'b'In Mississippi, the state\xe2\x80\x99s one and only abortion clinic, the Jackson Women\xe2\x80\x99s Health Organization, is in danger of closing because of a new law requiring that any doctor who does abortions have admitting privileges at a local hospital. This would be less of a problem if the local hospitals were not all terrified of giving privileges to anybody who performs abortions. When the clinic tried to advertise for a doctor who already had the requisite affiliation, the state medical journal refused to take the ad.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re just doing business as usual. Trying to be there for the women of Mississippi,\xe2\x80\x9d said Betty Thompson, the former director who stayed on after she retired and is now working as a counselor.'b'Over the last 40 years, women seeking abortions have been put through a lot of unnecessary trauma. Trips of hundreds of miles to the nearest clinic. Requirements that they have ultrasounds, or have ultrasounds and listen to the physician describe the ultrasound, or have ultrasounds and then wait 24 hours before the procedure. (In Texas, the doctor who does the abortion also has to conduct the ultrasound, creating a scheduling nightmare.)'b'They\xe2\x80\x99re caught in the middle of a political fight over a deeply personal issue that leaves most Americans feeling uneasy. If you want to rack up a real positive response on a poll, ask people whether the women or the politicians should make decisions about their pregnancies. One of the surveys commissioned by Planned Parenthood showed 83 percent of likely voters picked the women, including 64 percent of those who called themselves pro-life.'b'If there\xe2\x80\x99s been any permanent message in this long battle, that\xe2\x80\x99s been it. No matter how conservative the state, sooner or later you will hit the point where the people object to politicians messing with a woman\xe2\x80\x99s private business. Mississippi voters rejected a statewide referendum to give any fetus the right of \xe2\x80\x9cpersonhood.\xe2\x80\x9d Voters in South Dakota, another state with a single, struggling, abortion clinic, have twice rejected total abortion bans.'b'Every time the anti-abortion movement pushes too far, it reminds people that its cause, no matter how filled with moral fervor, is basically about imposing one particular theology on the rest of the country. Over the long run, the nervous, ambivalent, uncomfortable public won\xe2\x80\x99t let that happen.'b'This time things are different.'b'This time, nearly a month after the horrible mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., the public attention hasn\xe2\x80\x99t ricocheted to the next story.

They prey on public fears \xe2\x80\x94 of the \xe2\x80\x9cbad guys with guns,\xe2\x80\x9d of a Second Amendment rollback, of an ever imminent apocalypse \xe2\x80\x94 while helping gun makers line their pockets.'b'('b'Sturm, Ruger &amp; Company\xe2\x80\x99s stock'b' has gone up more than 500 percent since President Obama was first elected, and 'b'Smith &amp; Wesson\xe2\x80\x99s stock'b' is up more than 200 percent.)'b'And the gun makers return the favor. According to a 'b'2011 report by the Violence Policy Center'b', a group advocating stronger gun regulations:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSince 2005, corporations \xe2\x80\x94 gun related and other \xe2\x80\x94 have contributed between $19.8 million and $52.6 million to the NRA as detailed in its Ring of Freedom corporate giving program.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The report continued:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe vast majority of funds \xe2\x80\x94 74 percent \xe2\x80\x94 contributed to the NRA from \xe2\x80\x98corporate partners\xe2\x80\x99 are members of the firearms industry: companies involved in the manufacture or sale of firearms or shooting-related products. Contributions to the NRA from the firearms industry since 2005 total between $14.7 million and $38.9 million.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Groups like the N.R.A. aren\xe2\x80\x99t as much about rights as wrongs. The money being churned is soaked in blood and marked by madness.'b'Second, more reasonable people of good conscience and good faith, including responsible gun owners, need to talk openly, honestly and forcefully about the need for additional, reasonable regulations.'b'There is power in speaking up. We know the face of unfettered gun proliferation. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s time to see more faces of regulation and restraint.'b'Retired 'b'Gen. Stanley McChrystal'b' joined those ranks on Tuesday when he said on MSNBC:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI spent a career carrying typically either an M16, and later an M4 carbine. And an M4 carbine fires a .223 caliber round, which is 5.56 millimeters, at about 3,000 feet per second. When it hits a human body, the effects are devastating. It\xe2\x80\x99s designed to do that. And that\xe2\x80\x99s what our soldiers ought to carry. I personally don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any need for that kind of weaponry on the street and particularly around the schools in America. I believe that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to take a serious look. I understand everybody\xe2\x80\x99s desire to have whatever they want, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to protect our children, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to protect our police, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to protect our population. And I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to take a very mature look at that.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A \xe2\x80\x9cmature look\xe2\x80\x9d indeed. And that comes from a real soldier, not just someone who wants to feel like one.'b'Third, we must be clear that we are not talking about prohibition and confiscation but about de-escalation \xe2\x80\x94 in both the volume and lethal efficiency \xe2\x80\x94 and accountability.'b'No one is talking about forbidding law-abiding, mentally sound citizens to purchase nonmilitary-style weapons that don\xe2\x80\x99t hold more bullets than we have digits.'b'The point is to ensure that we don\xe2\x80\x99t sell military weapons with extended clips to the public and that the guns we do sell are purchased only by responsible people. And, once the guns are purchased, we need to ensure that they all remain in responsible hands. One place to start is to require background checks of all purchases and to track the guns, not just for the life of the purchaser, but for the life of the gun.'b'Last, we must understand that whatever we do now is not necessarily the whole of the solution but a step in the right direction on a long walk back from a precipice. Our search for solutions must be dynamic because the gun industry is wily and our quandary is epic.'b'We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to pass the point where society is so saturated with the most dangerous kinds of weaponry that people feel compelled to arm themselves or be left vulnerable, if indeed we haven\xe2\x80\x99t already passed that point.'b'According to The Associated Press, a small Utah town is making 'b'a \xe2\x80\x9cgun in every home a priority.\xe2\x80\x9d'b' The A.P. reported:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSpring City Councilman Neil Sorensen first proposed an ordinance requiring a gun in every household in the town of 1,000. The rest of the council scoffed at making it a requirement, but they unanimously agreed to move forward with an ordinance \xe2\x80\x98recommending\xe2\x80\x99 the idea. The council also approved funding to offer concealed firearms training Friday to the 20 teachers and administrators at the local elementary school.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That is not where we want to be as a country.'b'Critics are pounding 'b'President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s choice for defense secretary'b', Chuck Hagel, as soft on Iran, anti-military and even anti-Semitic. This is a grotesque caricature of a man who would make a terrific defense secretary.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s true that Hagel harbors a healthy skepticism about deploying American troops. That\xe2\x80\x99s because he also harbors shrapnel in his chest from Vietnam and appreciates the human costs when Pentagon officials move pins on maps.'b'In Vietnam, Hagel rescued his unconscious brother (who served in the same unit) from a troop carrier that had hit a mine. The incident left Hagel with blown eardrums, bad burns and an important take-away.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a pacifist. I believe in using force, but only after a very careful decision-making process,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'Hagel later told Vietnam magazine'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cThe night Tom and I were medevaced out of that village in April 1968, I told myself: If I ever get out of this and I\xe2\x80\x99m ever in a position to influence policy, I will do everything I can to avoid needless, senseless war.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'How refreshing to imagine decisions about war made by brave doves rather than by chicken hawks.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cToo often in Washington, the issue of intervention becomes an abstraction, a policy debate,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'noted Richard Haass'b', the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a former senior State Department official. \xe2\x80\x9cI like the idea that somebody at the table sees it in terms of people.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Brent Scowcroft'b', the former national security adviser and doyen of serious Republican thinkers on foreign policy, told me: \xe2\x80\x9cI think he would be an outstanding secretary of defense.\xe2\x80\x9d Scowcroft noted that top officials are sometimes tempted to turn to military force \xe2\x80\x9cas a way of cleaning up problems quickly\xe2\x80\x9d without appreciating the complexities, while Hagel would be a counterweight who understands the messiness of combat.'b'That would be useful because America\xe2\x80\x99s biggest foreign policy mistake in this new century has been overdeploying troops. President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s own biggest blunder was tripling the number of American forces in Afghanistan. We have, so far, sunk 'b'$640 billion into Afghanistan'b' and 'b'more than $800 billion into Iraq'b' \xe2\x80\x94 all told, according to my calculation, more than $12,000 per American household.'b'Imagine if those sums had been spent on, say, early childhood education in America. Or on getting more kids through college. Or on global education: About 1 percent of the total sunk in Iraq and Afghanistan, if instead spent annually on schooling around the world, would allow every child worldwide to complete primary school, ending global illiteracy.'b'The nastiest and most shameful innuendo about Hagel is that he is anti-Semitic. A Wall Street Journal column suggested as much, and Elliott Abrams, a former George W. Bush administration official, 'b'asserted that'b' Hagel \xe2\x80\x9cappears to be ... an anti-Semite.\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99m standing up for Hagel right now partly because I find this so offensive.'b'The \xe2\x80\x9cevidence\xe2\x80\x9d is that Hagel once referred to the term \xe2\x80\x9cJewish lobby\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cIsrael lobby,\xe2\x80\x9d and that he has generally been more willing to criticize Israeli policies than many of America\xe2\x80\x99s feckless politicians.'b'For starters, \xe2\x80\x9cJewish lobby\xe2\x80\x9d is a term that has been widely used: A search of \xe2\x80\x9cJewish lobby\xe2\x80\x9d on 'b'the Web site of Haaretz'b', the Israeli newspaper, has 27 pages of citations. And Haaretz has criticized Israeli policies much more harshly than Hagel.'b'Leaders of Jewish organizations themselves have used the term \xe2\x80\x9cJewish lobby.\xe2\x80\x9d Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, used the term a couple weeks ago.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s bullying and name-calling to denounce people as anti-Semitic because they won\xe2\x80\x99t embrace the policies of a far-right Israeli government that regularly shoots itself in the foot. In a world in which anti-Semitism actually does persist, this is devaluing the term so that it becomes simply a glib right-wing insult. Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s why Jewish Voice for Peace, a liberal American Jewish organization, has announced that its supporters have sent 10,000 e-mails to President Obama in support of Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s nomination.'b'As for Iran, Hagel will need to sound more hawkish in public to mesh with the administration, and it is useful for Iran to worry about a military strike. But I hope that Hagel, in private, continues to be cautious. Obama has been painting himself in a corner so that if a nuclear deal with Tehran isn\xe2\x80\x99t reached, he would have to order bombings sometime in 2013 or 2014. A skeptic at the Pentagon would be a useful addition to that debate.'b'As a journalist who spends a good deal of time in the field, I am often alarmed that Washington policy-making can become an echo chamber reinforcing the prejudices of whoever is in charge without giving weight to inconvenient complexities on the ground. With his combat experience, Chuck Hagel would offer not an echo but a thoughtful and independent voice.'b'Venzuela\xe2\x80\x99s presidential inauguration is missing a president.'b'Regarding \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Greece\xe2\x80\x99s rotten oligarchy'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Views, Jan. 7): In citing the mendacity, corruption and avarice overrunning Athens, Kostas Vaxevanis describes a country whose political establishment has betrayed its citizenry.

The cuts made under Presidents Richard M. Nixon (and later Gerald R. Ford) reflected the reductions associated with the arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union, the opening to China and the Nixon doctrine of no more land wars in Asia, and never went below the level of the last prewar budget.'b'Similarly, the cuts that occurred from 1993 to 1998 were less than the 25 percent cuts proposed by Gen. Colin L. Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs.'b'Additionally, even if the whole $500 billion in defense reductions called for by the Simpson-Bowles plan and numerous other bipartisan debt-reduction plans were carried out, military spending in real terms would return only to its fiscal year 2007 level and will still be 40 percent higher than it was on 9/11.'b'LAWRENCE KORB'b'\nAlexandria, Va., Jan. 9, 2013'b''b''b'The writer, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, was an assistant secretary of defense in the Reagan administration.'b''b'EVERY four years the cabinet briefly becomes the focus of national attention in December and January \xe2\x80\x94 only to fade from view again after Inauguration Day. True, individual cabinet secretaries will be in the news from time to time, but the cabinet as an institution will be all but forgotten. Yet the United States could benefit greatly by strengthening its scope and role.'b'Although the cabinet is not established in the Constitution, presidents since George Washington have convened a collective body of the heads of the executive departments. Washington used these meetings to tap into the wisdom of Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton. Abraham Lincoln assembled a strong \xe2\x80\x9cteam of rivals\xe2\x80\x9d in his cabinet to gird the nation at its time of greatest peril. Franklin D. Roosevelt convened his cabinet the day after the Pearl Harbor attacks, while John F. Kennedy relied on a subset of his cabinet during the Cuban missile crisis.'b'Over the past half-century, however, the expansion of the White House staff has centralized deliberation and decision making increasingly within the confines of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW. This reliance on professional staffers, political advisers and media spinmeisters within a constrictive White House \xe2\x80\x9csecurity bubble\xe2\x80\x9d deprives presidents not only of the deep substantive policy expertise of top civil servants but also of the political judgment of cabinet members who are often successful politicians.'b'A strengthened cabinet could promote frank and creative deliberation, help coordinate policy across government and make sure all members are delivering the same political message. All of this could go far in staving off the inertia and drift so common in presidential second terms.'b'Cabinet secretaries given a more prominent role would also enjoy a higher profile, enhancing their effectiveness in Washington and beyond, and enabling them to serve as more effective proxies for the president. Here are four ideas to maximize the reach and impact of the next cabinet:'b'\xc2\x95 Employ the cabinet as a deliberative body: Cabinet meetings have become little more than occasional photo ops. Under Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, for example, cabinet meetings were held monthly; the Obama team has met less than one-third as often. By contrast, the British, German and many other parliamentary cabinets meet weekly to assure that the entire team shares a common and coordinated vision. More regular and meaningful cabinet meetings could strengthen links across departments and with the White House staff, bolstering cooperation and reducing overlap and miscommunication.'b'\xc2\x95 Strengthen links between cabinet members and Congress: The Congressional committee structure is already designed to roughly parallel the cabinet departments, with each linked to one or more committees in each house. Without violating separation of powers, cabinet secretaries could be given nonvoting ex officio status as members of committees. This would empower them and their designees to work more closely with lawmakers in devising legislation and participating in hearings and other legislative work. They also would be eligible to address committees or even Congress as a whole.'b'\xc2\x95 Deploy cabinet members as presidential proxies: Countless ceremonial duties and foreign trips tax the time and energy of presidents. While cabinet members do fill in for the president at times, they could do much more by meeting with foreign dignitaries, presiding at ceremonial events and presenting honors and awards. This would elevate their stature and make them more effective policy messengers.'b'\xc2\x95 Cultivate the next generation of leadership: Almost uniquely among established democracies, a cabinet post in the United States can be more of a political grave than a cradle for leaders. No cabinet official has gone on to become president in nearly 85 years, and few have run. Yet the experience gained running an executive department and learning the ways of Washington offers great expertise for future presidential candidates. It may be Hillary Rodham Clinton who breaks this trend in 2016, drawing in no small part on her experience as secretary of state.'b'There is a risk, of course, that a stronger cabinet could undermine the president. But cabinet secretaries would continue to serve \xe2\x80\x9cat the pleasure of the president.\xe2\x80\x9d And while presidents could benefit from the collective wisdom of their cabinet, they would not be bound by it. When members of Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s cabinet once unanimously outvoted him, Lincoln closed the meeting by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cSeven nays and one aye, the ayes have it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'An enhanced cabinet would not have its own independent mandate, but it could share more fully in the president\xe2\x80\x99s, and thus advance that mandate more effectively.'b'WASHINGTON'b'IN 2010, I was branded a member of the \xe2\x80\x9cAl Qaeda 7\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a notorious label attached to Department of Justice lawyers who were 'b'mocked by critics'b' claiming they had \xe2\x80\x9cflocked to 'b'Guant\xc3\xa1namo'b' to take up the cause of the terrorists.\xe2\x80\x9d My crime: I advocated for the closure of the detention facility \xe2\x80\x94 a position that has also been taken up by the likes of former President George W. Bush, former Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates and former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell \xe2\x80\x94 and for more humane living conditions for those imprisoned there.'b'At the time, I reacted defensively. I was indignant. I insisted on the legitimacy of my convictions. But even then the writing was on the wall. For a core group of detainees, closing Guant\xc3\xa1namo would not mean release or prosecution, as most human rights and civil liberties groups have long advocated. Rather, it would mean relocation to the United States, or elsewhere, for continued detention.'b'Now, almost four years later, I have changed my mind. Despite recognizing the many policy imperatives in favor of closure, despite the bipartisan support for this position, and despite the fact that 'b'166 men'b' still languish there, I now believe that Guant\xc3\xa1namo should stay open \xe2\x80\x94 at least for the short term.'b'While I have been slow to come to this realization, the signs have been evident for some time. Three years ago, Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s administration conducted a comprehensive review of the Guant\xc3\xa1namo detainees and concluded that about four dozen prisoners couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be prosecuted, but were too dangerous to be transferred or released. They are still being held under rules of war that allow detention without charge for the duration of hostilities.'b'Others happened to hail from Yemen. Although many of them were cleared for transfer, the transfers were put on indefinite hold because of instability in Yemen, the fear that some might join Al Qaeda forces, and Yemen\xe2\x80\x99s inability to put adequate security measures in place.'b'While the specific numbers have most likely shifted over time, the basic categories persist. These are men whom the current administration will not transfer, release or prosecute, so long as the legal authority to detain, pursuant to the law of war, endures.'b'President Obama raised the hopes of the human rights community when during his re-election campaign he once again said the detention center should be closed. But it was not clear whether he had a viable plan, and any such plan would almost certainly involve moving many of the detainees into continued detention in the United States, where their living conditions would almost certainly deteriorate.'b'Guant\xc3\xa1namo in 2013 is a far cry from Guant\xc3\xa1namo in 2002. Thanks to the spotlight placed on the facility by human rights groups, international observers and detainees\xe2\x80\x99 lawyers, there has been a significant, if not uniform, improvement in conditions.'b'The majority of Guant\xc3\xa1namo detainees now live in communal facilities where they can eat, pray and exercise together. If moved to the United States, these same men would most likely be held in military detention in conditions akin to supermax prisons \xe2\x80\x94 confined to their cells 22 hours a day and prohibited from engaging in group activities, including communal prayer. The hard-won improvements in conditions would be ratcheted back half a decade to their previous level of harshness.'b'And Guant\xc3\xa1namo would no longer be that failed experiment on an island many miles away. The Obama administration would be affirmatively creating a new system of detention without charge for terrorism suspects on American soil, setting a precedent and creating a facility readily available to future presidents wanting to rid themselves of a range of potentially dangerous actors.'b'The political reality is that closure of Guant\xc3\xa1namo is unlikely to happen anytime soon, and if it did, it would do more harm than good. We should instead focus on finding places to transfer those cleared to leave the facility and, more important, on defining the end to the war.'b'In a recent speech, Jeh Johnson, then the Department of Defense general counsel, 'b'discussed'b' a future \xe2\x80\x9ctipping point\xe2\x80\x9d at which Al Qaeda would be so decimated that the armed conflict would be deemed over. Statements from high level officials suggest that this point may be near. And as the United States pulls out of Afghanistan, there is an increasingly strong argument that the war against Al Qaeda is coming to a close. With the end of the conflict, the legal justification for the detentions will finally disappear.'b'At that point, the remaining men in Guant\xc3\xa1namo can no longer be held without charge, at least not without running afoul of basic constitutional and international law prohibitions. Only then is there a realistic hope for meaningful closure, not by recreating a prison in the United States but through the arduous process of transferring, releasing or prosecuting the detainees left there.'b'In the meantime, we should keep Guant\xc3\xa1namo open.'b'If you want to deter crime, it seems that you\xe2\x80\x99d want to lengthen prison sentences so that criminals would face steeper costs for breaking the law. In fact, a mountain of research shows that increases in prison terms have done nothing to deter crime. Criminals, like the rest of us, aren\xe2\x80\x99t much influenced by things they might have to experience far in the future.'b'If a police officer witnesses the death of his partner, it seems that you\xe2\x80\x99d want to quickly send in a grief counselor. In fact, this sort of immediate counseling freezes and fortifies memories of the trauma, making the aftershocks more damaging.'b'If you want to get people to vote more, it seems you\xe2\x80\x99d want to tell them what a problem low turnout is. In fact, if you want people to vote, tell them everybody else is already voting and they should join the club. Voting is mostly about social membership and personal expression.'b'These are three examples of policies and practices that are based on bad psychology. The list of examples could go on and fill this page. That\xe2\x80\x99s because we spend trillions of dollars putting policies and practices into place, but most of these efforts are based on the crudest possible psychological guesswork.'b'Fortunately, people in the behavioral sciences are putting policies to the test. I know of groups at Duke and Penn that are applying behavioral research findings to policy issues. Eldar Shafir of Princeton has edited a weighty new book, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Behavioral Foundations of Public Policy,\xe2\x80\x9d which is a master compendium of what we know.'b'One of the things we know is that seemingly trivial changes can have big effects. People who are presented with a wide variety of choices of, say, yogurt, will eat more than people who are presented with a small array of choices or no choice. People who were randomly given a short, wide 22-ounce glass, poured 88 percent more juice or soda into it than people who were offered a tall, narrow 22-ounce glass, but they believed they only poured in half as much as they actually did.'b'Sometimes the behavioral research leads us to completely change how we think about an issue. For example, many of our anti-discrimination policies focus on finding the bad apples who are explicitly prejudiced. In fact, the serious discrimination is implicit, subtle and nearly universal. Both blacks and whites subtly try to get a white partner when asked to team up to do an intellectually difficult task. In computer shooting simulations, both black and white participants were more likely to think black figures were armed. In emergency rooms, whites are pervasively given stronger painkillers than blacks or Hispanics. Clearly, we should spend more effort rigging situations to reduce universal, unconscious racism.'b'The research is also leading to new policy approaches. The most famous involve default settings. Roughly 98 percent of people take part in organ donor programs in European countries where you have to check a box to opt out. Only 10 percent or 20 percent take part in neighboring countries where you have to check a box to opt in.'b'In one clever program, dieters were told to phone in their weight to a nurse daily. Every day they called, they got an encouraging text and a lottery ticket, with a chance of winning a small amount. These dieters lost three times more weight than people who didn\xe2\x80\x99t get tickets. Another ingenious program automatically diverts some money into your savings account every time you buy a state lottery ticket.'b'Prime Minister David Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s government in Britain has gone furthest in implementing these sorts of programs. Personalized text messages were found to be six times more effective in getting people to pay fines than warning letters. If you tell people what percentage of their neighbors has already paid their taxes, you are more likely to get late filers to actually pay than if you nag them another way.'b'My problem with these efforts is that they are still so modest. What about the big problems? How do we get people to restrain government commitments now so that debt down the road won\xe2\x80\x99t be so ruinous? How do we calculate the multiplier effects of tax cuts or spending increases among different subgroups of the population, or under different emotional conditions? How do we rig the context of budget negotiations so participants can actually come to a deal? How are people in different cultures likely to react to drone strikes? How do we structure sanctions against Iran to cause the greatest psychic humiliation?'b'These are the big questions, and most of our policies rely on crude folk psychology from a few politicians. But there\xe2\x80\x99s hope. As Brian Wansink notes in Eldar Shafir\xe2\x80\x99s volume, the 20th century saw great gains in sanitation and public health. The 21st century could be a great period for behavior change.'b'So, have you heard the one about the trillion-dollar coin? It may sound like a joke. But if we aren\xe2\x80\x99t ready to mint that coin or take some equivalent action, the joke will be on us \xe2\x80\x94 and a very sick joke it will be, too.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk for a minute about the vile absurdity of the debt-ceiling confrontation.'b'Under the Constitution, fiscal decisions rest with Congress, which passes laws specifying tax rates and establishing spending programs. If the revenue brought in by those legally established tax rates falls short of the costs of those legally established programs, the Treasury Department normally borrows the difference.'b'Lately, revenue has fallen far short of spending, mainly because of the depressed state of the economy. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t like this, there\xe2\x80\x99s a simple remedy: demand that Congress raise taxes or cut back on spending. And if you\xe2\x80\x99re frustrated by Congress\xe2\x80\x99s failure to act, well, democracy means that you can\xe2\x80\x99t always get what you want.'b'Where does the debt ceiling fit into all this? Actually, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. Since Congress already determines revenue and spending, and hence the amount the Treasury needs to borrow, we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t need another vote empowering that borrowing. But for historical reasons any increase in federal debt must be approved by yet another vote. And now Republicans in the House are threatening to deny that approval unless President Obama makes major policy concessions.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s crucial to understand three things about this situation. First, raising the debt ceiling wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t grant the president any new powers; every dollar he spent would still have to be approved by Congress. Second, if the debt ceiling isn\xe2\x80\x99t raised, the president will be forced to break the law, one way or another; either he borrows funds in defiance of Congress, or he fails to spend money Congress has told him to spend.'b'Finally, just consider the vileness of that G.O.P. threat. If we were to hit the debt ceiling, the U.S. government would end up defaulting on many of its obligations. This would have disastrous effects on financial markets, the economy, and our standing in the world. Yet Republicans are threatening to trigger this disaster unless they get spending cuts that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to enact through normal, Constitutional means.'b'Republicans go wild at this analogy, but it\xe2\x80\x99s unavoidable. This is exactly like someone walking into a crowded room, announcing that he has a bomb strapped to his chest, and threatening to set that bomb off unless his demands are met.'b'Which brings us to the coin.'b'As it happens, 'b'an obscure legal clause grants'b' the secretary of the Treasury the right to mint and issue platinum coins in any quantity or denomination he chooses. Such coins were, of course, intended to be collectors\xe2\x80\x99 items, struck to commemorate special occasions. But the law is the law \xe2\x80\x94 and it offers a simple if strange way out of the crisis.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s how it would work: The Treasury would mint a platinum coin with a face value of $1 trillion (or many coins with smaller values; it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter). This coin would immediately be deposited at the Federal Reserve, which would credit the sum to the government\xe2\x80\x99s account. And the government could then write checks against that account, continuing normal operations without issuing new debt.'b'In case you\xe2\x80\x99re wondering, no, this wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be an inflationary exercise in printing money. Aside from the fact that 'b'printing money isn\xe2\x80\x99t inflationary'b' under current conditions, the Fed could and would offset the Treasury\xe2\x80\x99s cash withdrawals by selling other assets or borrowing more from banks, so that in reality the U.S. government as a whole (which includes the Fed) would continue to engage in normal borrowing. Basically, this would just be an accounting trick, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing. The debt ceiling is a case of accounting nonsense gone malignant; using an accounting trick to negate it is entirely appropriate.'b'But wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the coin trick be undignified? Yes, it would \xe2\x80\x94 but better to look slightly silly than to let a financial and Constitutional crisis explode.'b'Now, the platinum coin may not be the only option. Maybe the president can simply declare that as he understands the Constitution, his duty to carry out Congressional mandates on taxes and spending takes priority over the debt ceiling. Or he might be able to finance government operations 'b'by issuing coupons'b' that look like debt and act like debt but that, he insists, aren\xe2\x80\x99t debt and, therefore, don\xe2\x80\x99t count against the ceiling.'b'Or, best of all, there might be enough sane Republicans that the party will blink and stop making destructive threats.'b'Unless this last possibility materializes, however, it\xe2\x80\x99s the president\xe2\x80\x99s duty to do whatever it takes, no matter how offbeat or silly it may sound, to defuse this hostage situation. Mint that coin!'b'It is no secret that the United States spends a lot more on health care than any other country yet ranks far behind other advanced nations in keeping its citizens healthy. This has been well documented in studies of older people and of newborn infants. It is now shockingly clear that poor health is a much broader and deeper problem than past studies have suggested.'b'An authoritative 'b'report issued by the Institute of Medicine this week'b' found that, on average, Americans experience higher rates of disease and injury and die sooner than people in other high-income countries. That is true at all ages between birth and 75 and for even well-off Americans who mistakenly think that top-tier medical care ensures that they will remain in good health. The study found that even upper-income Americans with health insurance and college educations appear to be sicker than their peers in other rich nations.'b'The study was commissioned by the National Institutes of Health, the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s top medical research agency, and was carried out by experts appointed by the National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine, two units of the prestigious National Academy of Sciences. It is the first analysis to compare the burden of multiple diseases and injuries in the United States and 16 other affluent democracies, including Western European countries, Australia, Canada and Japan.'b'American men ranked last in life expectancy among the 17 countries and American women ranked next to last. The United States also ranked at or near the bottom in nine areas, including heart disease, chronic lung disease, obesity and diabetes, injuries and homicides, and sexually transmitted diseases. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were struck by the gravity of these findings,\xe2\x80\x9d said the panel chairman, 'b'Dr. Steven Woolf'b', a professor of family medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat concerns our panel is why, for decades, we have been slipping behind.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Likely explanations include a large uninsured population and more limited access to primary care, two problems that should be mitigated by the health care reforms that will kick in next year; higher levels of poverty and income inequality in this country; weaker safety net programs; sedentary lifestyles and obesity; higher rates of drug abuse and traffic accidents that involve alcohol; and greater use of firearms in acts of violence.'b'The panel suggested a campaign to raise public awareness of the American health disadvantage and a study of what other countries are doing that might be useful here.'b'The Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the West Bank not under Israeli control, 'b'is in financial crisis'b'. Its leaders are finding it increasingly difficult to pay 180,000 government employees, including security forces as well as other civil servants.'b'This is not a problem that can be swept under the rug. Whatever the criticisms of the Palestinian Authority, and there are many, Israel has increasingly depended on it to manage and keep the peace in a strategically critical swath of territory. If there is ever to be a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, there has to be a competent government to run a Palestinian state and leaders with whom to make a deal.'b'The authority, established under the 1993 Oslo Accords that were to lead to a permanent peace agreement, was supposed to be that vehicle. But it is in danger of being so weakened that it would be unable to carry out those responsibilities. 'b'Its financial woes'b' are not new. 'b'A World Bank report in September'b' said a \xe2\x80\x9cpersistent shortfall in donor funding has exacerbated the P.A.\xe2\x80\x99s increasingly difficult fiscal situation, leaving a financing gap of almost $400 million.\xe2\x80\x9d And, in an interview with The Associated Press 'b'on Sunday'b', the Palestinian prime minister, Salam Fayyad, the official in charge of the government bureaucracy, said the problems are worsening and the authority is on the \xe2\x80\x9cverge of being completely incapacitated.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There are many causes. After Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, won an upgrade for the status of Palestine as a nonmember observer state at the United Nations General Assembly 'b'last fall'b', Israel retaliated by withholding the $100 million in monthly tax revenues it collects on behalf of the Palestinians. Congress, meanwhile, has been withholding more than $450 million in American aid. Last year, Mr. Fayyad said he hoped to improve the authority\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition by cutting spending and raising taxes on wealthier Palestinians. The tax plan ran into strong protest and the West Bank\xe2\x80\x99s modest economic growth has slowed.'b'In the recent interview Mr. Fayyad put most of the blame for the authority\xe2\x80\x99s financial distress on Arab donors who are \xe2\x80\x9cnot fulfilling their pledge of support\xe2\x80\x9d made in Arab League resolutions to make up the money Israel is withholding. This should come as little surprise. Arab leaders have often promised political and economic support for the Palestinians and failed to deliver. Arab foreign ministers are expected to meet Sunday in Cairo to discuss Palestinian issues, including the promised aid. They should affirm their commitment to assist the Palestinian Authority and get the funds flowing.'b'There are many threats to a two-state solution, including an Israeli government that could become even more hard-line after the Jan. 22 election. But, as the World Bank has said, Mr. Fayyad has made progress in building a functioning government. Israel, the Palestinians, Arab states and the international community all have a stake in making sure that is preserved and strengthened.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Ezekiel J.

But the rules, which were 'b'announced on Thursday'b' and go into effect next year, include some features that could hurt lower-income borrowers.'b'Predatory lending was a leading cause of the housing bubble, the spike in foreclosures and the failure of large financial institutions. It saddled borrowers with too much debt and left investors with big losses. Congress created the consumer bureau in large part to make sure all that never happened again.'b'The rules the bureau enacted, which will be supplemented by regulations by the Federal Reserve and other agencies, 'b'create a new category'b' of loans called \xe2\x80\x9cqualified mortgages\xe2\x80\x9d that cannot include certain dangerous features like interest-only payments or negative amortization, which means that the amount owed increases over time. The rules also limit fees and penalties. Lenders would also have to thoroughly vet the finances of borrowers and make sure they spend no more than 43 percent of their pretax income on loan payments.'b'But some rules, including the 43 percent limit, are not sufficiently protective. While a family that earns $100,000 could deal with payments at that level, a family earning $50,000 probably could not. The bureau could have used a percentage range that varied depending on families\xe2\x80\x99 disposable incomes. Another rule gives lenders a \xe2\x80\x9csafe harbor,\xe2\x80\x9d or immunity, from certain lawsuits for certain qualified mortgages. It would have been more sound to give borrowers a right to sue if they proved that the lender did not properly take into account their ability to repay the loan.'b'Officials say these new rules should help invigorate the mortgage market by assuring investors that the loans they buy from banks are sound. Right now, most investors are only willing to buy mortgages guaranteed by the government. It is too early to say whether the rules will have that effect. What is clear, however, is that other regulators can build on the progress the bureau has made while adding protections for borrowers.'b'Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens 'b'were not voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame on Wednesday'b'.

Mr. Bruni offers cogent advice to his niece Leslie, and I would like to humbly add a few thoughts.'b'Have Leslie list her personal values and investigate which schools openly align with hers; college \xe2\x80\x9cfit\xe2\x80\x9d is the surest guarantee of a student\xe2\x80\x99s success.'b'She should visit her top choices unannounced to get an unvarnished sense of the schools. \xe2\x80\x9cSecret shopper\xe2\x80\x9d visits are the best way to evaluate a prospective school without a professional to steer the student.'b'Prospective students should ask about average class sizes, who teaches the core curriculum and what percentage of students graduate in five years or less. Mr. Bruni\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on seeking \xe2\x80\x9cdiversity\xe2\x80\x9d is commendable, and we would add \xe2\x80\x9cdiversity of thought.\xe2\x80\x9d How many conservative \xe2\x80\x94 perish the thought! \xe2\x80\x94 voices are represented in the faculty ranks?

MYERS'b'\nPresident'b'\nCampaign for Tobacco-Free Kids'b'\nWashington, Jan. 8, 2013'b''b''b''b'MORE than one million people in the Chinese city of Handan awoke last week to the alarming news that an essential source of their drinking water, the Zhouzhang River, had been dangerously contaminated by a 39-ton chemical spill in the nearby city of Changzhi. What made the news even more shocking was that the leak, from a factory pipe, had started at least 'b'five days earlier'b' but had been kept secret by government officials, who allowed millions of their neighbors to keep drinking.'b'The people of Handan reacted to these disclosures the same way almost anyone else would. First, they panicked, mobbing stores for bottled water. Then, they were furious, demanding to know why no one had told them they were drinking water laced with a probable carcinogen. If history is any guide, they will never get a satisfactory answer.'b'For me, reading about Handan prompted a sick feeling of d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu. For the last five years I have been writing a history of the chemical industry\xe2\x80\x99s egregious 60-year involvement in the New Jersey shore town of Toms River, which gained unwanted notoriety in the late 1990s thanks to a remarkably well-documented cluster of childhood cancer cases and a long history of often hidden industrial pollution.'b'When news of the cancer cluster leaked in 1996, there was the predictable townwide panic, including a run on bottled water supplies. After a wrenching 'b'five-year investigation'b', state and federal health officials concluded that the sick children were more likely to have lived in parts of town where exposure to industrial chemicals \xe2\x80\x94 via drinking water and polluted air \xe2\x80\x94 were highest.'b'It was, by definition, an association, not a causal relationship, and it was statistically significant only for girls with leukemia. But in the murky world of neighborhood cancer cluster studies, that\xe2\x80\x99s as close to a definitive finding as you\xe2\x80\x99re ever likely to see. That same year, 2001, the families of 69 children with cancer won a multimillion-dollar legal settlement against two chemical companies and the water utility.'b'As in Toms River, so many things about last week\xe2\x80\x99s debacle in Handan were infuriating, starting with the chemical involved: aniline. That was the compound that launched the synthetic chemical industry in 1856, when a precocious 18-year-old named William Henry Perkin, experimenting in his parents\xe2\x80\x99 London attic, inadvertently discovered that aniline, dissolved in sulfuric acid and mixed with potassium dichromate, made a superb purple dye.'b'Soon London, Basel, Switzerland, and the Ruhr Valley in Germany were littered with aniline factories, many of which would morph into familiar corporate giants like CIBA, Geigy, Agfa and the German behemoth BASF, the industry leader. In Basel and London, it was said, you could tell which dyes were being made by the color of the nearby canals and rivers, where the factories dumped their waste. Factory bosses would send workers on clandestine midnight runs to the Middle Bridge in Basel to dump barrels of waste into the fast-moving Rhine.'b'Basel is a border city and the Rhine flows north, so the waste was Germany\xe2\x80\x99s problem \xe2\x80\x94 just as last week\xe2\x80\x99s spill was Handan\xe2\x80\x99s problem, not Changzhi\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'In 1895, a Frankfurt surgeon named Ludwig Wilhelm Carl Rehn began noticing unusual numbers of bladder cancers \xe2\x80\x94 he called them \xe2\x80\x9caniline tumors\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 among workers in dye plants. Whether aniline was the specific cause was hard to determine, since by then, chemical manufacturers had expanded well beyond aniline and were using dozens of compounds derived from coal and oil to make dyes and many other products. What was obvious was that these synthetic hydrocarbons were leaving a trail of tumors wherever they were manufactured.'b'The legacy of cancer followed the industry as it spread to America. In the 1950s, at Cincinnati Chemical Works, almost half of the long-term workers who handled a dye compound called 'b'benzidine'b' got bladder cancer. Soon after, the Cincinnati factories closed and their Swiss owners transferred manufacturing to a huge new facility in a small town where there would be less scrutiny: Toms River.'b'Today, there is little left of the vast complex the Swiss operated in Toms River for more than 40 years. Manufacturing ended there in 1996, just as the cluster controversy was heating up. Now, after so many years of painful publicity about cancer and pollution, many residents of Toms River are happy to have moved on, and who can blame them. They are much more likely to be worried about the damage Hurricane Sandy recently inflicted on hundreds of local homes than about any lingering effects from decades-old water and air pollution.'b'The reality of 21st-century globalism, however, is that none of us can pretend that by pushing the chemical industry out of our communities we have stopped enabling its dangerous practices. The industry jobs that started in Basel, and then migrated to Cincinnati and Toms River, are now in Shanxi Province and other coal-rich areas of China. BASF alone now owns or invests in 45 Chinese ventures. Meanwhile, hundreds of smaller companies like the Tianji Coal Chemical Industry Group, whose Changzhi factory was the source of last week\xe2\x80\x99s leak, are busy turning coal into aniline and a host of other chemical products.'b'Business is booming. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe me, head over to the Ocean County Mall in Toms River, where you can get a pair of 'b'jeans'b' dyed just the right shade of faded blue, thanks to aniline-based indigo dye. They\xe2\x80\x99re made in China, and they\xe2\x80\x99re cheap \xe2\x80\x94 if you don\xe2\x80\x99t count the long-term cost.'b'LEXINGTON, Ky.'b'It was the middle of the workday \xe2\x80\x94 a bright, chilly Wednesday afternoon in Lexington, Ky. \xe2\x80\x94 but Bud\xe2\x80\x99s Gun Shop was crowded. Why was I surprised? The combination of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s re-election and the Newtown massacre has caused gun proponents to stock up, fearing, against all available evidence, that the federal government was about to crack down on gun ownership. As I opened the door, I felt like a teenager about to buy a condom.'b'My plan was to shoot a gun, something I had never done before. I thought it would help me understand why gun owners are so passionate about their deadly possessions.'b'The daughter of a local friend, 'b'Don McNay'b', offered to accompany me. Gena Bigler is the chief financial officer of her father\xe2\x80\x99s financial firm, 'b'a personal finance columnist'b' and the mother of two. Gena, Don said, is \xe2\x80\x9cvery liberal in all her politics, except pro-gun.\xe2\x80\x9d Just like his wife, his ex-wife and many other women in Kentucky, he added.'b'Bud\xe2\x80\x99s Gun Shop was cavernous, with scarcely a square inch of wall space that didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a gun on it. As we headed for the shooting range, I asked Gena why she liked guns. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the Old West,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe gun was the great equalizer. I think for women that is still the case.\xe2\x80\x9d The first time she shot a gun, she told me, she was 8.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s start easy,\xe2\x80\x9d Gena said as we approached the shooting range. At the counter, Dave, a retired policeman who served as the \xe2\x80\x9crange officer,\xe2\x80\x9d brought out 'b'a Ruger Mark .22 semiautomatic handgun'b'. It was a gun that a newbie like me could handle, he gently suggested. A box of bullets in hand, we headed out to the shooting range.'b'The target was a bright green human silhouette. Gena and I took turns shooting. It took awhile, but once I got the hang of it, I stopped worrying about the shape of the target and focused on hitting it. The .22 made small bullet holes. Gena told me that when she used to shoot in the woods, you could see the enormous damage guns could do to a tree. \xe2\x80\x9cI think children need to be better educated about guns,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cso they\xe2\x80\x99ll understand better what a gun can do.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We next moved to a .45 semiautomatic handgun. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want one that shoots really well, or do you want one you can hide?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Dave. He gave us 'b'a Kimber'b'. Its manufacturer describes Kimbers as \xe2\x80\x9cno compromise, purpose-built pistols.\xe2\x80\x9d Certainly from my point of view, it was more difficult to ignore its purpose than with the .22. The bullets made much bigger holes, fire often came out of the barrel, and it had a big kick. It was meant to kill people.'b'The gallery was filling up. I saw two women shooting handguns, three young men sharing an assault weapon and a man who needed crutches taking target practice. The only noise you could hear was the pop, pop, pop of guns being fired.'b'Finally, Gena and I rented 'b'a Kriss Vector'b', a shiny black assault weapon. The man who handed it to us called it a \xe2\x80\x9cP.D.W.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 or personal defense weapon. \xe2\x80\x9cThis gun is made for something like the Secret Service,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. Dave looked at the gun and smiled wryly. \xe2\x80\x9cBlast away,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. The gun had a 30-bullet magazine, which I emptied as quickly as my trigger finger would allow. It took, literally, seconds.'b'Using the assault weapon was a frightening experience. Even Gena thought so. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why anybody would need a gun like that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. But when I asked her whether such guns should be outlawed, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the beginning of the slippery slope.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Did I discover on Wednesday afternoon why shooting a gun appeals to so many people? Not really. But I did get a glimpse of why it will be so difficult to change America\xe2\x80\x99s gun culture. You can say until you\xe2\x80\x99re blue in the face that a gun owner or his family is far more likely to be hurt or killed by that gun than an intruder. But people like Gena \xe2\x80\x94 decent, honorable citizens who grew up around guns \xe2\x80\x94 will never believe it. They will always think of guns as the great equalizer. 'b'According to The Cincinnati Enquirer'b', Kentucky, which has some of the least restrictive gun laws on the books, has no intention of tightening its laws after Newtown.'b'A few days later, I called Bud\xe2\x80\x99s Gun Shop to ask Dave what he thought about the renewed effort to regulate guns. In his calm, unflustered way, he said he thought the problem was mental health care, not guns. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople have rights,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'In the background, I could hear the pop, pop, pop of guns going off in the shooting range.'b'Everybody is talking about the flu. Never have I seen so many people trying to open doorknobs with their elbows. \xe2\x80\x9cEpidemic spurs rush to hospitals,\xe2\x80\x9d announced The New York Post under a \xe2\x80\x9cFlu York\xe2\x80\x9d front-page headline. A financial Web site offered a list of undervalued stocks in the funeral service industry. The mayor of Boston declared a public health emergency. Google Flu Trends painted a map of the country in deep red and inspired a raft of terrifying predictions. (\xe2\x80\x9cOutbreak could be the worst on record.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to tell the extent of a flu outbreak because most of the victims just snivel away unhappily in the privacy of their own homes. The Google site solves this problem by tracking the number of times people search for flu-related terms online. Does this make sense to you, people? If we could determine what was going on in the world by the most popular searches, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the universe be run by mischievous kittens and Kate Middleton?'b'O.K., that is not a sophisticated thought \xe2\x80\x94 Google has an 'b'algorithm'b'. But I still wonder if the number of recent searches on the subject of flu isn\xe2\x80\x99t related to the number of recent press conferences about flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls Google Flu Trends \xe2\x80\x9ca useful tool\xe2\x80\x9d that may be \xe2\x80\x9csubject to the perturbations of media attention.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard for the media, or the elected officials who are currently terrifying their constituents with dire flu warnings, to know where to draw the line between encouraging preparedness and scaring the public out of its wits. The flu is incredibly debilitating, especially this year because it\xe2\x80\x99s showing up at the same time as a stomach virus that features diarrhea and projectile vomiting. Truly, you only need to mention \xe2\x80\x9cprojectile vomiting\xe2\x80\x9d once to get our attention. And flu can be dangerous for some people, like the frail elderly.'b'But we do go through this every winter.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the worst flu season we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen since 2009,\xe2\x80\x9d said Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, the guy who declared the public health emergency.'b'Stop there. While 2009 was a very bad year for flu, worst-in-four-years doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound quite as dire as worst-on-record.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe have an epidemic of flu every year,\xe2\x80\x9d said the New York City health commissioner, Thomas Farley. If there are alarming headlines, he added, it\xe2\x80\x99s because public officials are \xe2\x80\x9ctrying to get out the message to get your vaccine.\xe2\x80\x9d In a phone interview, Farley explained that the city declares an epidemic when more than 5 percent of the people going to emergency rooms are complaining of flu symptoms, which is unusual only in the sense that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen in warm weather. He also managed to work \xe2\x80\x9cget your vaccine\xe2\x80\x9d into virtually every sentence.'b'Yes! Get a flu shot, like Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, who received one on Thursday, along with a lollipop. This was to set a good example. Although honestly, that was sort of late in the game, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think? You\xe2\x80\x99d like to believe the governor of one of the most populous states in the nation would have thought about flu protection in November.'b'The C.D.C., which measures epidemics in a different way, also agrees we\xe2\x80\x99re in one. But officials there don\xe2\x80\x99t seem all that worried, beyond the fact that when you\xe2\x80\x99re the Centers for Disease Control, you\xe2\x80\x99re always worried. \xe2\x80\x9cThe bottom line: It\xe2\x80\x99s flu season,\xe2\x80\x9d said director Tom Frieden.'b'Maybe the national \xc3\xbcber-angst is because the last two years were really light ones for flu, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten what a bad one feels like. Also, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about it more because there isn\xe2\x80\x99t all that much going on. In other Januaries, we might have been anticipating the actions of the new Congress. This year, we know in advance that there won\xe2\x80\x99t be any.'b'This brings me to my theory about how to calm the flu panic. We can pin everything on John Boehner, the speaker of the House.'b'Think about it. One of the worst side-effects of illness is the feeling of a lack of control. Your symptoms seem to descend out of nowhere. Picking somebody to hold responsible gives a little more sense of order to the universe.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNothing will make you feel better like finding somebody to blame,\xe2\x80\x9d says a new Facebook app called \xe2\x80\x9cHelp, My Friend Gave Me the Flu.\xe2\x80\x9d That app, which is sponsored by a pharmaceutical company, lets you prowl through the social network looking for which of your acquaintances got symptoms before you did.'b'This sounds like a terrible idea \xe2\x80\x94 you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to ruin friendships over a transient ailment. John Boehner, on the other hand, is somebody you have never met. And the average case of the flu, no matter how unpleasant, is not as bad as two or three more fiscal cliffs.'b'Plus, so many people are angry at John Boehner already that he would never notice a few million more.'b'During a tight re-election campaign in 2010, when the vote of gun owners was crucial, Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader of the Senate, not only showed his prowess with a 12-gauge shotgun \xe2\x80\x94 hitting two clay pigeons from the air \xe2\x80\x94 but also invited Wayne LaPierre, chief executive officer of the National Rifle Association, as his guest for the 'b'opening'b' of a new shooting range in Searchlight, Nev. Mr. Reid, a former policeman, eagerly displayed his sportsman\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiasm to the voters.'b'It turned out his solidarity with the N.R.A. extended to quietly inserting an amendment that year into President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s health care reform law that restricted the ability of physicians to gather data about their patients\xe2\x80\x99 use of firearms.'b'The provision, 'b'reported last month'b' in The Washington Post, reflected the N.R.A.\xe2\x80\x99s long-running obsession with preventing gun-related deaths and injuries from being studied as a major public health problem that should be controlled the way government monitors risks connected to automobiles, airplanes and consumer products. For decades, lawmakers have let the gun lobby block financing for and limit gun research by the National Institutes of Health and other agencies.'b'Mr. Reid\xe2\x80\x99s office insisted the amendment was intended to head off N.R.A. opposition to health care reform. In any case, mass shootings as a public health threat should be a major part of the debate over gun reform taking shape after the massacre of schoolchildren and teachers in Newtown, Conn. An adviser to Mr. Reid, who will be at the center of any Senate action, 'b'told CNN'b' that the senator is now \xe2\x80\x9cin a different place\xe2\x80\x9d on the gun control issue.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope so. After the shooting deaths of 12 moviegoers and the wounding of 58 others in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., last July, Senator Reid said there was too little time on the Senate calendar to take up the issue of gun restrictions. But after the Newtown shootings he grieved for the dead and conceded, \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to accept the reality that we are not doing enough to protect our citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d Congress must examine how to prevent more gun tragedies, he said, stressing that \xe2\x80\x9cevery idea should be on the table.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Reid must be held to nothing less as his friends in the N.R.A. mount their ferocious campaign against effective reform. A significant part of the gun lobby\xe2\x80\x99s supporters on Capitol Hill are Democrats. As their leader, Harry Reid will be crucial in making genuine change happen, and he will share the blame if it does not.'b'When the United States Supreme Court issued its flawed 2010 decision in the Citizens United case, unleashing millions of dollars in corporate spending on political campaigns, there seemed to be one small prescription for relief. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, noted that prompt disclosure of political expenditures would allow stockholders and citizens to hold corporations accountable. Shareholders, he said, could determine whether the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s financing of campaigns \xe2\x80\x9cadvances the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s interest in making profits.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'New York State\xe2\x80\x99s comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, is attempting to do just that. As sole guardian of investments for New York\xe2\x80\x99s $150 billion pension fund, he wants to use his considerable financial clout to get a major company to open its books to shareholders, including New York State.'b''b'Last week'b', Mr. DiNapoli sued Qualcomm, a computer chip business, demanding to see the company\xe2\x80\x99s internal records on political spending. The suit, filed in Delaware, where the company is incorporated, argues that the records are necessary to help Mr. DiNapoli determine whether the state\xe2\x80\x99s pension funds are protected. \xe2\x80\x9cWithout disclosure, there is no way to know whether corporate funds are being used in ways that go against shareholder interests,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'he said'b'.'b'The pension fund owns almost $380 million in Qualcomm stock, and Mr. DiNapoli contends that this should give him a voice in the company\xe2\x80\x99s business. Delaware law gives shareholders the right to inspect books and records of a corporation for \xe2\x80\x9ca proper purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d Determining whether political spending is a wise use of corporate money, Mr. DiNapoli argues, meets that test. If the courts agree, governments and stockholders will have acquired a valuable new tool for holding corporations accountable for political spending.'b'Mr. DiNapoli\xe2\x80\x99s suit is one of many efforts nationwide by pension funds and other institutional investors to force corporations to disclose or limit their political contributions. The New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, is also seeking greater transparency on political spending from many nonprofit groups.'b'It is bad enough that the flow of political money into American campaigns grows bigger by the year \xe2\x80\x94 the 2012 elections were the costliest ever. It\xe2\x80\x99s even worse when the public is to be kept in the dark about who\xe2\x80\x99s doing the spending. Big stockholders like New York\xe2\x80\x99s pension funds can bring much-needed openness to a murky process.'b'Two points about the giant squid, Architeuthis dux, recently caught on 'b'video'b' by Japanese scientists and now writhing all over the Internet. It is not a colossal squid, Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni, which is even larger. And this is not the first deep-water image of a giant squid. In 2004, Japanese scientists photographed one taking their bait nearly 3,000 feet underwater in roughly the same location, some 600 miles south of Japan.'b'We might add that as giant squid go, this squid \xe2\x80\x94 about 10 feet long \xe2\x80\x94 is 8 feet shorter than the tentacle retrieved from the 2004 squid. What matters, though, is how vivid this squid is. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a glimpse. It\xe2\x80\x99s a full-length portrait. Positioned vertically against the blackness of the deep, this squid glimmers, as tall and slender as a painting by John Singer Sargent. It phosphoresces, it irridesces.'b'The most human eye in the sea belongs to the cephalopods, and the eye in this video is no exception. It envelops the viewer. Tsunemi Kubodera, the zoologist who led the scientific team, has said that the squid looked rather lonely. Whether a squid can be lonely is an interesting question. But it\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that this squid was photographed at home, unattracted by bait, unentangled by fishing line, free to nautilize where and as it likes.'b'Scientists once supposed that giant squid and the colossal squid were relatively passive creatures, zeppelins of the deep. That is changing. They are regarded now as hunters, a view completely consonant with the tattoos their tentacles have left on the thick skin of sperm whales. Most of what we have known about these creatures came from their mortal remains, which said something about size and anatomy. But this video is the first unequivocal evidence of their living beauty.'b'Listen closely.'b'That sound you hear is the sound of a cultural paranoia by people who have lost their grip on the reins of power, and on reality, and who fear the worst is coming.'b'And they are preparing for it, whatever it may be \xe2\x80\x94 a war, a revolution, an apocalypse.'b'These extremists make sensible, reasonable gun control hard to discuss, let alone achieve in this country, because they skew the conversations away from common-sense solutions on which both rational gun owners and non-gun owners can agree.'b'These people, a vocal minority, have extreme fears \xe2\x80\x94 gun confiscation, widespread civil instability, a tyrannical government \xe2\x80\x94 from which they are preparing to defend themselves with arsenals of weapons and stockpiles of ammunition.'b'If you pay attention to the right-wing\xe2\x80\x99s rhetoric, you can hear a string of code words that feed the fears of these people and paralyze progress.'b'A collection of conservative groups have declared Jan. 19, during the weekend celebrating President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s inauguration and Martin Luther King\xe2\x80\x99s Birthday, as Gun Appreciation Day.'b'In a press release, the event chairman, Larry Ward, said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Obama administration has shown that it is more than willing to trample the Constitution to impose its dictates upon the American people.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Using the word \xe2\x80\x9cdictates\xe2\x80\x9d is a subtle, but intentional, effort to frame the president as dangerous.'b'Andrew P. Napolitano, a Fox News analyst, said in a 'b'video'b' posted Thursday on the network\xe2\x80\x99s GretaWire blog: \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the dirty little secret about the Second Amendment, the Second Amendment was not written in order to protect your right to shoot deer, it was written to protect your right to shoot tyrants if they take over the government. How about chewing on that one.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He went even further in a 'b'piece'b' in The Washington Times, saying that the Second Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cprotects the right to shoot tyrants, and it protects the right to shoot at them effectively, with the same instruments they would use upon us.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Who are Napolitano\xe2\x80\x99s tyrants here? Is this government takeover theoretical, imminent, in progress or a fait accompli?'b'Ward went so far as to 'b'say on CNN'b': \xe2\x80\x9cI believe that Gun Appreciation Day honors the legacy of Dr. King.\xe2\x80\x9d He continued: \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is, I think Martin Luther King would agree with me if he were alive today that if African-Americans had been given the right to keep and bear arms from Day 1 of the country\xe2\x80\x99s founding, perhaps slavery might not have been a chapter in our history. And I believe wholeheartedly that it\xe2\x80\x99s essential to liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Set aside, if you can, what would most likely be King\xe2\x80\x99s horror at the association, and look at that language. Pay particular attention to the suggestion that guns are an essential guard against slavery\xe2\x80\x99s resurgence in this country. And who would be the slaves and who the enslavers?'b'As the Southern Poverty Law Center said in a Spring 2012 'b'report'b', the number of so-called patriot groups surged after Barack Obama was first elected president.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe swelling of the Patriot movement since that time has been astounding,\xe2\x80\x9d the report said. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom 149 groups in 2008, the number of Patriot organizations skyrocketed to 512 in 2009, shot up again in 2010 to 824, and then,'b' last year, jumped to 1,274'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'(According to the center, \xe2\x80\x9cGenerally, Patriot groups 'b'define themselves'b' as opposed to the \xe2\x80\x98New World Order,\xe2\x80\x99 engage in groundless conspiracy theorizing, or advocate or adhere to extreme antigovernment doctrines.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'The center also 'b'points out'b': \xe2\x80\x9cFears of impending gun control or weapons confiscations, either by the government or international agencies, also run rampant in antigovernment circles. As a result, many antigovernment activists believe that being well armed is a must. The militia movement engages in paramilitary training aimed at protecting citizens from this feared impending government crackdown.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why it is both shocking and predictable that James Yeager, the C.E.O. of a Tennessee company that trains civilians in weapons and tactical skills, posted a video online Wednesday (since removed but still viewable at 'b'rawstory.com'b') saying he was going to start killing people if gun control efforts moved forward. He said, and I quote:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m telling you that if that happens, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to spark a civil war, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad to fire the first shot. I\xe2\x80\x99m not putting up with it. You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put up with it. And I need all you patriots to start thinking about what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do, load your damn mags, make sure your rifle\xe2\x80\x99s clean, pack a backpack with some food in it and get ready to fight.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Again, calling the \xe2\x80\x9cpatriots\xe2\x80\x9d to arms is, I think, no accident.'b'Chew on that.'b'IT should come as no surprise that violence in 'b'mental health'b' facilities causes psychological and often physical harm to health care workers and patients. What\xe2\x80\x99s shocking is how prevalent it is.'b'Globally, a third of all patients admitted for psychiatric care are involved in violent incidents, according to a 'b'2011 analysis'b' by researchers at King\xe2\x80\x99s College in London. In Sweden, where I teach, it\xe2\x80\x99s estimated that more than half of psychiatric care staff members are exposed to physical violence each year, an experience mirrored in many other countries.'b'Efforts to reduce violence in psychiatric hospitals have focused on identifying potentially aggressive patients through clinical histories and improving staff training and care procedures. But these approaches, while worthy, are clearly not enough. While definitive numbers are hard to come by, the incidence of violence in care facilities appears to be going up.'b'Research suggests, however, that there\xe2\x80\x99s an effective solution that has largely been overlooked: designing hospital spaces that can reduce human aggression \xe2\x80\x94 to calm emotionally troubled patients through architecture.'b'Currently, questions about design at psychiatric care facilities are viewed through the prism of security. How many guard and isolation rooms are needed? Where should we put locked doors and alarms? But architecture can \xe2\x80\x94 and should \xe2\x80\x94 play a much larger role in patient safety and care.'b'One prominent goal of facility design, for example, should be to reduce stress, which often leads to aggression.'b'For patients, the stress of mental illness itself can be intensified by the trauma of being confined for weeks in a locked ward. A care facility that\xe2\x80\x99s also noisy, lacks privacy and hinders communication between staff and patients is sure to increase that trauma. Likewise, architectural designs that minimize noise and crowding, enhance patients\xe2\x80\x99 coping and sense of control, and offer calming distractions can reduce trauma.'b'Thanks to decades of study on the design of apartments, prisons, cardiac intensive care units and offices, environmental psychologists now have a clear understanding of the architectural features that can achieve the latter \xe2\x80\x94 and few of these elements, if incorporated into a hospital design from the outset, significantly raise the cost of construction.'b'Providing day rooms and other shared spaces with 'b'movable seating'b', for example, gives patients the ability to control their personal space and interactions with others. Sound-absorbing surfaces reduce noise (and stress), as do designs that offer more natural light.'b'Some features, like single-patient bedrooms with private toilets, do increase the building cost \xe2\x80\x94 but that is arguably offset by the reduced trauma for patients and hospital workers. Violence, after all, isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a danger to well-being, its effects \xe2\x80\x94 from medical care to lawsuits \xe2\x80\x94 are frequently expensive, too.'b'Colleagues from Chalmers University of Technology and Sahlgrenska University Hospital and I recently performed a study using a psychiatric hospital, Ostra Hospital in Gothenburg, that opened in 2006. Of the 10 architectural features researchers have identified that are likely to diminish stress and aggression, Ostra has nine.'b'Data on aggressive incidents were compiled for the hospital and compared with those from two other psychiatric facilities. One was an older facility replaced by Ostra, which had only one of the stress-reducing features. A third institution located in the same region also had just one of these architectural elements. Despite the wide differences in design, though, the three hospitals were similar with respect to the number of beds, types of patients, treatment protocols and staffing levels.'b'The drop in the use of patient restraints \xe2\x80\x94 a proxy for incidents of aggression \xe2\x80\x94 was striking. The number of patient sedations at Ostra was 21 percent lower than at the hospital it replaced, and the use of physical restraints fell by more than twice that (44 percent). At the third facility \xe2\x80\x94 which operated during the years of both the old and new hospitals in Gothenburg and therefore served as an experimental control \xe2\x80\x94 the use of both forms of restraint continued to rise, suggesting that the difference was probably not because of a general improvement in care procedures over the period examined.'b'Comparison studies like this one have limitations, certainly. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know for sure that there weren\xe2\x80\x99t major differences in patient care and training between the old facility in Gothenburg and the new. But evidence from myriad studies and design research strongly supports the notion that architectural design can reduce violence.'b'The principles, moreover, have implications for the wider health care system. Aggressive behavior and violence in health care are by no means limited to psychiatric wards; they are also common in emergency rooms and other hospital departments. If you have the misfortune of needing to visit the E.R., expect to feel even more stress if you find yourself in a crowded waiting room with fixed rows of seats and a blaring television whose channel cannot be changed.'b'Environments like these increase the chance that one patient or family member may accost another person in the waiting room, or speak or gesture angrily to a nurse or doctor.'b'To reduce the odds of such aggression, it\xe2\x80\x99s time we put our growing understanding about stress-reducing design into architectural practice. At a time when health care payment policies are changing to reward better quality, reducing emotional trauma in care facilities should not only improve the lives of patients and health care workers, but perhaps even 'b'lower the cost'b' of care as well.'b'ON a hot July day in 1977, one of New York\xe2\x80\x99s ugliest summers, my 23-year-old cousin, Ellen Hover, left her Third Avenue apartment. She had an appointment with a young photographer who had asked to take pictures of her. His name, he\xe2\x80\x99d told her, was John Berger.'b'She never returned. Posters of Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s face went up all over Midtown Manhattan. Private detectives were hired. I was racked with guilt: because of a family argument, I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen my cousin in years. Now I never would. Eleven months later, her bones were found on the grounds of the Rockefeller estate in Westchester County.'b'It was around this time that the police knew for sure that John Berger\xe2\x80\x99s real name was Rodney Alcala. By then, a confluence of factors \xe2\x80\x94 lack of communication between law enforcement agencies, the lowly budgets and low-tech forensics of the \xe2\x80\x9970s, and the killer\xe2\x80\x99s aggressive wiliness \xe2\x80\x94 had combined to make him elusive. It was not until July of 1979 that he was arrested in California on charges of murdering a 12-year-old girl named Robin Samsoe. He was tried, convicted, sentenced to death and remanded to death row in San Quentin State Prison in California the following year.'b'We didn\xe2\x80\x99t know then that he had killed another New York woman \xe2\x80\x94 Cornelia Crilley, a beautiful flight attendant \xe2\x80\x94 six years before he killed Ellen. Before that, he had been in prison in California for molesting and beating an 8-year-old girl, but he\xe2\x80\x99d been released on good behavior after just 34 months. Within two years of Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s death, he murdered four other young women in California, in heinous and brutal ways including biting, strangulation and rape.'b'When DNA science caught up with him, he was eventually charged with those four other killings. But there was little usable DNA evidence from Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s murder, and besides, the last thing California wanted was for its cases to be muddied by investigators from another state having access to its prisoner. So while the California cases went forward, Ellen and Cornelia Crilley would have to wait. We understood that. What we didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand was how long.'b'Over the years Rodney Alcala\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers managed to twice overturn, on technicalities, his conviction for the murder of Robin Samsoe. He aggressively fought the use of DNA evidence against him, but ultimately lost. Finally, in February 2010, a jury re-re-convicted him of the murder of Robin Samsoe, along with the other four California women. He has not stopped fighting his execution sentence and suing the state for things like failing to provide him with a low-fat diet.'b'Since Ellen was killed, both of her parents have died; her brother has died; her aunt, my mother, has died. In all those years, Rodney Alcala was never charged with her murder. Many of Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s friends and family members felt a measure of justice when he was convicted in California in 2010 \xe2\x80\x94 at least we felt it was the best we could ask for. We acted as if those acknowledged victims included Ellen: we wrote one another e-mails with exclamation points and thanked the Orange County prosecutor, Matt Murphy. But there was no trial for Ellen, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone ever expected there would be. I certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'Shortly after that, though, a detective let me see some of the New York Police Department\xe2\x80\x99s files on Rodney Alcala. In a dank office in Brooklyn, I listened to a tape of investigators questioning the killer\xe2\x80\x99s long-ago girlfriend; I saw detectives\xe2\x80\x99 notes on ancient tollbooth receipts. I realized there were people in the N.Y.P.D. and the district attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office \xe2\x80\x94 people who\xe2\x80\x99d amassed that yellowed, flyspecked file \xe2\x80\x94 who had always wanted to open Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s case. Cyrus Vance Jr., who had recently been sworn in as Manhattan district attorney, ending the 35-year term of Robert Morgenthau, had made the opening of cold cases a priority. Suddenly it seemed Ellen had not been forgotten.'b'But it is not easy to open a case from the \xe2\x80\x9970s. Evidence lockers had been cleaned out; documents were moldering; investigators and prosecutors spent weeks and months tracking down witnesses, only to find out they were dead, whereupon they\xe2\x80\x99d politely ask spouses and grown-up children if they could dig up old files. \xe2\x80\x9cLooking for something from 1971,\xe2\x80\x9d Melissa Mourges, the chief of the Cold Case Unit, told me about Cornelia Crilley\xe2\x80\x99s case, \xe2\x80\x9cwe might as well have been looking at something from 1871.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For two years investigators worked to turn Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s cold case warm. Despite the fact that her killer was already sentenced to death and would never be released, despite the time and the resources and the terrible memories involved, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t give up. Eventually, their painstakingly obtained evidence built a timeline of Rodney Alcala\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts, his route before and after murdering Ellen. It seemed to me like a devotional act.'b'Every victim deserves her own day in court, no matter what else the culprit has been arrested for, no matter how long ago the crime: this is the pure integrity of opening a cold case. There are hundreds of thousands of cold cases in the United States. Approximately 14 percent of all unsolved homicide cases and 18 percent of unsolved sexual assault cases contain forensic evidence that has not been sent to a crime lab for analysis.'b'One way to close more cold cases would be to enable more states to enter into national databases the DNA information of everyone they arrest, at least for violent crimes. Next month the Supreme Court will hear a case, Maryland v. King, that could open the door to this, by deeming such entries constitutional. Currently, in part because of concerns about civil liberties, about half the states, including New York, enter into national databases only the DNA of people convicted of certain crimes \xe2\x80\x94 a much smaller pool of potential matches. On the bright side, New York at least does appear to be investigating and solving more cold cases than ever before.'b'LAST year, when I heard that Rodney Alcala was actually going to be extradited to New York to face a grand jury on Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s case, I remembered something a clergyman had said at the first service after 9/11: it was too overwhelming, and unfair to the victims, to think of 3,000 people dead. The best way to honor them was to think that \xe2\x80\x9cone person died,\xe2\x80\x9d three thousand times. When justice is broken down to individual victims, humanity is restored.'b'In a Manhattan courtroom last month, Rodney Alcala, now 69, pleaded guilty to Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s and Cornelia Crilley\xe2\x80\x99s murders. After 35 and 41 years \xe2\x80\x94 much longer than the young women lived \xe2\x80\x94 he pleaded out, just like that. It was the first time in his long criminal history that he had ever confessed to a killing. The collapse of his resistance seemed taunting to all of us: Sure I killed them. What took you guys so long?'b'On Monday I attended his sentencing. At one point, the judge broke down, saying she had never had before her a case with such brutality and hoped she would never again. The sentence for the two murders was, of course, symbolic \xe2\x80\x94 a concurrent 25 years to life. The important punishment will take place in San Quentin when Rodney Alcala is finally executed \xe2\x80\x94 if he ever is.'b'During the hearing he never once turned to face us, the family members. He simply clutched his orange Department of Corrections jacket, protection against the cold on the short trip from court to van and from van to Rikers. All I could think was: a coward to the end.'b'Meanwhile, police in Washington State and New Hampshire have been calling the N.Y.P.D. \xe2\x80\x94 there seem to be two other murders. That would make nine dead women, as far as we know, and their cases are probably just as cold as Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s was. I want to tell these women\xe2\x80\x99s friends and families: push for the cases to be reopened. Get your loved ones\xe2\x80\x99 names in the paper to prod \xe2\x80\x94 even shame \xe2\x80\x94 the authorities. No matter how many times a serial murderer has murdered, every victim deserves her singular justice, as late as it may be in coming, as much a formality as may be the punishment, and as hard as investigators must work to bring it to pass.'b'The environmental conservation officer stood in front of my hunter-education class and said he had never seen one so big, so early in the year. Normally in January he would be speaking to about a dozen people, maybe 20, most of them Boy Scouts. Our group numbered at least 70, most of them solitary men, from young to grizzled, but also a family with children and a handful of fathers with young daughters.'b'He wondered why that was; it was kind of baffling. Our instructors, Bill and Eddie, agreed: they said class size usually does not swell until October, just before deer season.'b'We were in a basement archery shop behind a strip mall in Patchogue, on Long Island, for the first of two days of safety lectures. New York, like most states, requires this of first-time hunters before they can buy a license. We had each been told to bring a folding chair and a pen; there would be a test.'b'I was there because I needed to be licensed for a planned pig-hunting trip in February, but I was also curious about the people who buy and use guns for recreation. These are the folks who live on the sane and law-abiding end of the shooter spectrum, and I \xe2\x80\x94 all my life a weaponless outdoorsman, unless you count fish hooks \xe2\x80\x94 wanted to get acquainted with them.'b'After the officer\xe2\x80\x99s presentation, the instructors took over: two veteran hunters, volunteers with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Eddie was a rangy guy with glasses and a mustache. Bill had a white military-style brush cut and a linebacker build, as if someone had squeezed the bulk of him up from his combat boots and legs into his mighty chest. Eddie wore jeans, Bill wore camo.'b'Bill did most of the talking. Most of it was about how to avoid shooting people, getting shot or falling out of a tree.'b'Never point a gun at anything you don\xe2\x80\x99t intend to shoot.'b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t wear red, white or blue in the woods; those are turkey colors.'b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t sit in a tree stand if you\xe2\x80\x99re sleepy. And wear the right harness, so when you fall you don\xe2\x80\x99t dangle helplessly and die.'b'Bill spent a lot of time showing us his personal arsenal \xe2\x80\x94 rifles, shotguns, revolvers, muzzleloading antiques \xe2\x80\x94 each of which was met with the silence that deadly weaponry commands. Besides a fleeting reference to how the media have \xe2\x80\x9cmisconstrued\xe2\x80\x9d assault weapons, he and Eddie steered clear of politics and the gun debate. They said they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t force you to do the ethical thing, but they could show you what that was. I learned a lot of practical know-how and trivia I am never going to use, like how to clean a muzzleloader and where to find the safety on a crossbow. I came away admiring Eddie and Bill, who work hard at doing what they love. I also got my hunter-ed card.'b'But what I did not get, in all honesty, was a better understanding of or closer affinity with hunters. I felt I had wandered into the wrong church. The sense of disconnect was great. I understand killing things. I go fishing, which is pulling a creature out of the water by its mouth and watching it writhe on the beach. I justify that by eating what I catch and catching only what I eat; the infrequent times that I land a legal-size striped bass, I go home immediately to introduce it to scallions and ginger.'b'I thought I also understood what hunting was: going to where something is likely to be and looking around for it, stealthily if necessary. When you find it, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s wild mushrooms, a parking space or the TV remote, the object gained is a reward for diligent effort.'b'But a lot of what we learned in class made hunting sound more like ambushing or sniping.'b'In New York, hunting with bait \xe2\x80\x94 things deer can eat \xe2\x80\x94 is illegal. But using \xe2\x80\x9cattractants\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 things they smell \xe2\x80\x94 is not. This can cause confusion. What about licking? And what is illegal to use may still be legal to sell. The archery shop, in fact, seemed like a hunters\xe2\x80\x99 head shop, selling jugs and bottles of substances with names like C\xe2\x80\x99Mere Deer and Mrs. Doe Pee and Primetime Pure (\xe2\x80\x9cpremium doe estrus \xe2\x80\x94 great for peak rut\xe2\x80\x9d).'b'The instructors were adamant about not using bait, but nobody seemed to question the sportsmanship of attractants. You wait in a tree for an estrus-addled buck to follow his nose into your line of fire, and then blast away. It\xe2\x80\x99s wildlife extraction with an emphasis on ease and chemical efficiency.'b'Why this is necessary or sportsmanlike \xe2\x80\x94 especially in a suburban country with more white-tailed deer than ever, whose gardens are salad bars and highways road-kill zones \xe2\x80\x94 eludes me.'b'But maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m out of step with millions of American hunters. A recent national 'b'survey'b' by the Fish and Wildlife Service found that the number of hunters is up significantly across the country. New York State officials say there were double-digit increases in hunter-education students from 2010 to 2011, and the trend seems to have continued last year, too. Recent panic over gun control might have something to do with it, but the numbers have been trending up for a while.\xc2\xa0'b'Despite the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s best efforts, the lack of affordable housing remains one of America\xe2\x80\x99s most vexing problems.'b'A $1.5 billion transfusion in the 2009 stimulus bill managed to hold the overall homeless population about even over the last four years, and the number of people in two especially vulnerable groups \xe2\x80\x94 the chronically homeless and homeless veterans \xe2\x80\x94 has actually dropped.'b'But with nearly 3.3 million families with children living in \xe2\x80\x9cworst case\xe2\x80\x9d situations \xe2\x80\x94 spending more than half their incomes on housing or living in hazardous buildings \xe2\x80\x94 more must be done to create affordable housing, through rehabilitation or new construction.'b'For starters, that means finally putting money into the 'b'National Housing Trust Fund'b', which was created by Congress in 2008 but was never financed because of the recession. This should be an early order of business for the new Congress. The fund, modeled on successful state programs, would provide subsidies and incentives to preserve, rehabilitate and build housing, primarily for extremely low-income families that earn about 30 percent of the average median incomes in their areas, typically spend more than half their incomes on rent and are disproportionately at risk of slipping into homelessness.'b'One of the problems with affordable housing projects generally is that they often segregate the poor. The trust fund would encourage healthy, mixed-income communities. For instance, a development of mainly market-rate apartments that set aside, say, 10 percent of the units for low-income families would receive a subsidy proportionate to that investment. In addition to creating housing for the poor within sound communities, the fund would stimulate construction of multifamily rental buildings at a time when they are greatly needed.'b'When Congress set up the trust fund, the initial financing was supposed to come from contributions by the federally backed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That plan was suspended when the companies crashed. But with the two back on their feet, housing advocates are rightly pressing the Obama administration to reinstate that arrangement.'b'Other ideas for underwriting the fund are circulating in Washington. A bill 'b'introduced'b' by Representative Keith Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, would turn the mortgage interest tax deduction into a tax credit aimed primarily at low- and middle-income homeowners. It would also lower the cap on mortgages that receive a tax break to $500,000 from $1.1 million. Some of the savings would be redirected to the trust fund.'b'The administration embraced the goal of funding the trust fund as part of its 2010 homelessness program. But it has yet to spend serious political capital extracting the money from Congress. It is should do so this time around, lest this creative idea never come to fruition.'b'IN India, a 23-year-old student takes a bus home from a movie and is gang-raped and 'b'assaulted so viciously'b' that she dies two weeks later.'b'In Liberia, in West Africa, an aid group called More Than Me rescues a 10-year-old orphan who has been trading oral sex for clean water to survive.'b'In Steubenville, Ohio, 'b'high school football players are accused'b' of repeatedly raping an unconscious 16-year-old girl who was either drunk or rendered helpless by a date-rape drug and was apparently lugged like a sack of potatoes from party to party.'b'And in Washington, our members of Congress show their concern for sexual violence by failing to renew the Violence Against Women Act, a landmark law first passed in 1994 that has now expired.'b'Gender violence is one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most common human rights abuses. Women worldwide ages 15 through 44 are more likely to die or be maimed because of male violence than because of cancer, malaria, war and traffic accidents combined. The World Health Organization has found that domestic and sexual violence affects 30 to 60 percent of women in most countries.'b'In some places, rape is endemic: in South Africa, a 'b'survey found that 37 percent'b' of men reported that they had raped a woman. In others, rape is institutionalized as sex trafficking. Everywhere, rape often puts the victim on trial: in one poll, 'b'68 percent of Indian judges'b' said that \xe2\x80\x9cprovocative attire\xe2\x80\x9d amounts to \xe2\x80\x9can invitation to rape.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Americans watched the events after the Delhi gang rape with a whiff of condescension at the barbarity there, but domestic violence and sex trafficking remain a vast problem across the United States.'b'One obstacle is that violence against women tends to be invisible and thus not a priority. In Delhi, of 'b'635 rape cases'b' reported in the first 11 months of last year, only one ended in conviction. That creates an incentive for rapists to continue to rape, but in any case that reported number of rapes is delusional. They don\xe2\x80\x99t include the systematized rape of sex trafficking. India has, by my reckoning, more women and girls trafficked into modern slavery than any country in the world. (China has more prostitutes, but they are more likely to sell sex by choice.)'b'On 'b'my last trip to India'b', I tagged along on a raid on a brothel in Kolkata, organized by the International Justice Mission. In my column at the time, I focused on a 15-year-old and a 10-year-old imprisoned in the brothel, and mentioned a 17-year-old only in passing because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know her story.'b'My assistant at The Times, Natalie Kitroeff, recently visited India and tracked down that young woman. It turns out that she 'b'had been trafficked as well'b' \xe2\x80\x94 she was apparently drugged at a teahouse and woke up in the brothel. She said she was then forced to have sex with customers and beaten when she protested. She was never allowed outside and was never paid. What do you call what happened to those girls but slavery?'b'Yet prosecutors and the police often shrug \xe2\x80\x94 or worse. Dr. Shershah Syed, a former president of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Pakistan, once told me: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I treat a rape victim, I always advise her not to go to the police. Because if she does, the police might just rape her again.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the United States, the case in Steubenville has become controversial partly because of the brutishness that the young men have been accused of, but also because of concerns that the authorities protected the football team. Some people in both Delhi and Steubenville rushed to blame the victim, suggesting that she was at fault for taking a bus or going to a party. They need to think: 'b'What if that were me?'b''b'The United States could help change the way the world confronts these issues. On a remote crossing of the Nepal-India border, I once met an Indian police officer who said, a bit forlornly, that he was stationed there to look for terrorists and pirated movies. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t finding any, but India posted him there to show that it was serious about American concerns regarding terrorism and intellectual property. Meanwhile, that officer ignored the steady flow of teenage Nepali girls crossing in front of him on their way to Indian brothels, because modern slavery was not perceived as an American priority.'b'Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has done a superb job trying to put these issues on the global agenda, and I hope President Obama and Senator John Kerry will continue her efforts. But Congress has been pathetic. Not only did it fail to renew the Violence Against Women Act, but it has also stalled on the global version, the International Violence Against Women Act, which would name and shame foreign countries that tolerate gender violence.'b'Congress even failed to renew the landmark legislation against human trafficking, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. The obstacles were different in each case, but involved political polarization and paralysis. Can members of Congress not muster a stand on modern slavery?'b'(Hmm. I now understand better the results of 'b'a new survey'b' from Public Policy Polling showing that Congress, with 9 percent approval, is less popular than cockroaches, traffic jams, lice or Genghis Khan.)'b'Skeptics fret that sexual violence is ingrained into us, making the problem hopeless. But just look at modern American history, for the rising status of women has led to substantial drops in rates of reported rape and domestic violence. Few people realize it, but Justice Department statistics suggest that the incidence of rape has fallen by three-quarters over the last four decades.'b'Likewise, the rate at which American women are assaulted by their domestic partners has fallen by more than half in the last two decades. That reflects a revolution in attitudes. 'b'Steven Pinker, in his book'b' \xe2\x80\x9cThe Better Angels of Our Nature,\xe2\x80\x9d notes that only half of Americans polled in 1987 said that it was always wrong for a man to beat his wife with a belt or a stick; a decade later, 86 percent said it was always wrong.'b'But the progress worldwide is far too slow. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope that India makes such violence a national priority. And maybe the rest of the world, especially our backward Congress, will appreciate that the problem isn\xe2\x80\x99t just India\xe2\x80\x99s but also our own.'b'After months of speculation, the nominations have finally been announced for 'b'the Teachies'b', the biggest, glitziest, most media-crazed pedagogical awards ceremony of the year, judged by the renowned 'b'American Federation of Teachers'b' and presented in the legendary 'b'Student Drama Theater'b'.

We hope everyone recognizes that movies should receive the funding they deserve for playing a vital role in our youth\xe2\x80\x99s future.'b'A COUPLE of evolutionary psychologists recently published a book about human sexual behavior in prehistory called \xe2\x80\x9cSex at Dawn.\xe2\x80\x9d Upon hearing of the project, one colleague, dubious that a modern scholar could hope to know anything about that period, asked them, \xe2\x80\x9cSo what do you do, close your eyes and dream?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Actually, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little more involved. Evolutionary psychologists who study mating behavior often begin with a hypothesis about how modern humans mate: say, that men think about sex more than women do. Then they gather evidence \xe2\x80\x94 from studies, statistics and surveys \xe2\x80\x94 to support that assumption. Finally, and here\xe2\x80\x99s where the leap occurs, they construct an evolutionary theory to explain why men think about sex more than women, where that gender difference came from, what adaptive purpose it served in antiquity, and why we\xe2\x80\x99re stuck with the consequences today.'b'Lately, however, a new cohort of scientists have been challenging the very existence of the gender differences in sexual behavior that Darwinians have spent the past 40 years trying to explain and justify on evolutionary grounds.'b'Of course, no fossilized record can really tell us how people behaved or thought back then, much less 'b'why'b' they behaved or thought as they did. Nonetheless, something funny happens when social scientists claim that a behavior is rooted in our evolutionary past. Assumptions about that behavior take on the immutability of a physical trait \xe2\x80\x94 they come to seem as biologically rooted as opposable thumbs or ejaculation.'b'Using evolutionary psychology to back up these assumptions about men and women is nothing new. In \xe2\x80\x9cThe Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex,\xe2\x80\x9d Charles Darwin gathered evidence for the notion that, through competition for mates and sustenance, natural selection had encouraged man\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmore inventive genius\xe2\x80\x9d while nurturing woman\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgreater tenderness.\xe2\x80\x9d In this way, he suggested that the gender differences he saw around him \xe2\x80\x94 men sought power and made money; women stayed at home \xe2\x80\x94 weren\xe2\x80\x99t simply the way things were in Victorian England. They were the way things had always been.'b'A century later, a new batch of scientists began applying Darwinian doctrine to the conduct of mating, and specifically to three assumptions that endure to this day: men are less selective about whom they\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep with; men like casual sex more than women; and men have more sexual partners over a lifetime.'b'In 1972, Robert L. Trivers, a graduate student at Harvard, addressed that first assumption in one of evolutionary psychology\xe2\x80\x99s landmark studies, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Parental Investment and Sexual Selection'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d He argued that women are more selective about whom they mate with because they\xe2\x80\x99re biologically obliged to invest more in offspring. Given the relative paucity of ova and plenitude of sperm, as well as the unequal feeding duties that fall to women, men invest less in children. Therefore, men should be expected to be less discriminating and more aggressive in competing for females.'b'It was an elegant, powerful application of evolutionary theory to the mating game. The evolutionary psychologists of the 1980s and \xe2\x80\x9990s built on Mr. Trivers\xe2\x80\x99s theory to explain a wide array of stereotypical gender differences in mating.'b'In 1993, David M. Buss and David P. Schmitt used parental investment theory to explain why men should be expected to \xe2\x80\x9cdevote a larger proportion of their total mating effort to short-term mating.\xe2\x80\x9d Because men invested less time and effort in their offspring, they evolved toward promiscuity, while women evolved away from it. Promiscuity, the researchers hypothesized, would have been more damaging to the female reputation than to the male reputation. If a man mated with a promiscuous woman, he would never be able to ensure his paternity. Men, on the other hand, could potentially enhance their status by pursuing a short-term mating strategy. (Think Kennedy, Clinton, Spitzer, Letterman and so forth. My space is limited.)'b'One of the earliest critics of this kind of thinking was Stephen Jay Gould. He wrote in 1997 that parental investment theory \xe2\x80\x9cwill not explain the full panoply of supposed sexual differences so dear to pop psychology.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Gould felt that the field had become overrun with \xe2\x80\x9cultra-Darwinians,\xe2\x80\x9d and that evolutionary psychology would be a more fruitful science if it didn\xe2\x80\x99t limit itself \xe2\x80\x9cto the blinkered view\xe2\x80\x9d that evolutionary explanations accounted for every difference.'b'BUT if evolution didn\xe2\x80\x99t determine human behavior, what did? The most common explanation is the effect of cultural norms. That, for instance, society tends to view promiscuous men as normal and promiscuous women as troubled outliers, or that our \xe2\x80\x9csocial script\xe2\x80\x9d requires men to approach women while the pickier women do the selecting. Over the past decade, sociocultural explanations have gained steam.'b'Take the question of promiscuity. Everyone has always assumed \xe2\x80\x94 and early research had shown \xe2\x80\x94 that women desired fewer sexual partners over a lifetime than men. But in 2003, two behavioral psychologists, Michele G. Alexander and Terri D. Fisher, published the results of a study that used a \xe2\x80\x9cbogus pipeline\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a fake lie detector. When asked about actual sexual partners, rather than just theoretical desires, the participants who were not attached to the fake lie detector displayed typical gender differences. Men reported having had more sexual partners than women. But when participants believed that lies about their sexual history would be revealed by the fake lie detector, gender differences in reported sexual partners vanished. In fact, women reported slightly more sexual partners (a mean of 4.4) than did men (a mean of 4.0).'b'In 2009, another long-assumed gender difference in mating \xe2\x80\x94 that women are choosier than men \xe2\x80\x94 also came under siege. In speed dating, as in life, the social norm instructs women to sit in one place, waiting to be approached, while the men rotate tables. But in one study of speed-dating behavior, the evolutionary psychologists Eli J. Finkel and Paul W. Eastwick switched the \xe2\x80\x9crotator\xe2\x80\x9d role. The men remained seated and the women rotated. By manipulating this component of the gender script, the researchers discovered that women became less selective \xe2\x80\x94 they behaved more like stereotypical men \xe2\x80\x94 while men were more selective and behaved more like stereotypical women. The mere act of physically approaching a potential romantic partner, they argued, engendered more favorable assessments of that person.'b'Recently, a third pillar appeared to fall. To back up the assumption that an enormous gap exists between men\xe2\x80\x99s and women\xe2\x80\x99s attitudes toward casual sex, evolutionary psychologists typically cite a classic study published in 1989. Men and women on a college campus were approached in public and propositioned with offers of casual sex by \xe2\x80\x9cconfederates\xe2\x80\x9d who worked for the study. The confederate would say: \xe2\x80\x9cI have been noticing you around campus and I find you to be very attractive.\xe2\x80\x9d The confederate would then ask one of three questions: (1) \xe2\x80\x9cWould you go out with me tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d (2) \xe2\x80\x9cWould you come over to my apartment tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d or (3) \xe2\x80\x9cWould you go to bed with me tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Roughly equal numbers of men and women agreed to the date. But women were much less likely to agree to go to the confederate\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. As for going to bed with the confederate, zero women said yes, while about 70 percent of males agreed.'b'Those results seemed definitive \xe2\x80\x94 until a few years ago, when Terri D. Conley, a psychologist at the University of Michigan, set out to re-examine what she calls \xe2\x80\x9cone of the largest documented sexuality gender differences,\xe2\x80\x9d that men have a greater interest in casual sex than women.'b'Ms. Conley found the methodology of the 1989 paper to be less than ideal. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one really comes up to you in the middle of the quad and asks, \xe2\x80\x98Will you have sex with me?\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d she told me recently. \xe2\x80\x9cSo there needs to be a context for it. If you ask people what they would do in a specific situation, that\xe2\x80\x99s a far more accurate way of getting responses.\xe2\x80\x9d In her study, when men and women considered offers of casual sex from famous people, or offers from close friends whom they were told were good in bed, the gender differences in acceptance of casual-sex proposals evaporated nearly to zero.'b'IN light of this new research, will Darwinians consider revising their theories to reflect the possibility that our mating behavior is less hard-wired than they had believed?'b'Probably not. In an article responding to the new studies last year, Mr. Schmitt, a leading voice among hard-line Darwinians, ceded no ground. Addressing Ms. Conley\xe2\x80\x99s finding that women were more likely to agree to casual sex with a celebrity, Mr. Schmitt argued that this resulted from \xe2\x80\x9cwomen\xe2\x80\x99s (but not men\xe2\x80\x99s) short-term mating psychology being specially designed to obtain good genes from physically attractive short-term partners.\xe2\x80\x9d He continued: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen women\xe2\x80\x99s short-term-mating aim is activated (perhaps, temporarily, because of, e.g., high-fertility ovulatory status or desire for an extramarital affair, or more chronically, because of , e.g., a female-biased local sex ratio or a history of insecure parent-child attachment), they appear to express relatively focused desires for genetic traits in \xe2\x80\x98sexy men\xe2\x80\x99 that would biologically benefit women when short-term mating.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In other words: Nothing new here, it\xe2\x80\x99s all evolution.'b'Steven Pinker, the Harvard psychologist and popular author, also backs the Darwinians, whom he says still have the weight of evidence on their side. \xe2\x80\x9cA study which shows you can push some phenomenon around a bit at the margins,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote to me in an e-mail, \xe2\x80\x9cis of dubious relevance to whether the phenomenon exists.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But the fact that some gender differences can be manipulated, if not eliminated, by controlling for cultural norms suggests that the explanatory power of evolution can\xe2\x80\x99t sustain itself when applied to mating behavior. This wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the first time we\xe2\x80\x99ve pushed these theories too far. How many stereotypical racial and ethnic differences, once declared evolutionarily determined under the banner of science, have been revealed instead as vestiges of power dynamics from earlier societies?'b'Citing the speed-dating study, Mr. Pinker added, \xe2\x80\x9cThe only reason this flawed paper was published was that it challenged an evolutionary hypothesis ... in particular a sex difference \xe2\x80\x94 as the Larry Summers incident shows, claims about sex differences are still politically inflammatory in the academy.\xe2\x80\x9d Here, he was referring to the much criticized 2005 comments Mr. Summers made when he was Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s president suggesting that women\xe2\x80\x99s underrepresentation in science and engineering was attributable not to socialization but to \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent availability of aptitude at the high end.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Perhaps these phenomena exist. Perhaps men do, over all, pursue more short-term mating. But given new research, continued rigid reliance on evolution as an explanation seems to risk elevating a limited guide to teleological status \xe2\x80\x94 a way of thinking that scientists should abhor.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSome sexual features are deeply rooted in evolutionary heritage, such as the sex response and how quickly it takes men and women to become aroused,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul Eastwick, a co-author of the speed-dating study. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at features such as how men and women regulate themselves in society to achieve specific goals, I believe those features are unlikely to have evolved sex differences. I consider myself an evolutionary psychologist. But many evolutionary psychologists don\xe2\x80\x99t think this way. They think these features are getting shaped and honed by natural selection all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d How far does Darwin go in explaining human behavior?'b'WASHINGTON'b'PRESIDENT OBAMA ran promoting women\xe2\x80\x99s issues.'b'But how about promoting some women?'b'With the old white boys\xe2\x80\x99 club rearing its hoary head in the White House of the first black president, the historian Michael Beschloss recalled the days when the distaff was deemed biologically unsuited for the manly discourse of politics. He tweeted: \xe2\x80\x9c1/12/1915, U.S. House refused women voting rights. One Congressman: \xe2\x80\x98Their ankles are beautiful ... but they are not interested in the state.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Now comes a parade of women to plead the case for the value of female perspective in high office: Women reach across the aisle, seek consensus, verbalize and empathize more, manage and listen better.

It\xe2\x80\x99s the second definition \xe2\x80\x94 collaboration is an act of treason \xe2\x80\x94 'b'something you do when you cross over and vote with the other party'b'. In Silicon Valley, great \xe2\x80\x9ccollaborators\xe2\x80\x9d are prized; in Washington, they are hanged. Said Cohen, who was vice president at Nicira, a networking start-up that recently sold for $1.26 billion: \xe2\x80\x9cIn Washington, when they say \xe2\x80\x98collaborator\xe2\x80\x99 they mean \xe2\x80\x98traitor\xe2\x80\x99; here they mean \xe2\x80\x98colleague.\xe2\x80\x99'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not the only reason, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a big reason that Silicon Valley is thriving more than ever, finding more ways to solve bigger and bigger problems faster, and that Washington is only capable of producing 11th-hour, patched-together, Rube Goldberg compromises, with no due diligence, that produce only suboptimal outcomes to our biggest problems. In Washington today collaboration happens only to avert crises or to give out pork, not to build anything great. That is why if Congress were a start-up, the early-stage investors would have long ago been wiped out and the firm shuttered. Cause of death: an inability of the partners to collaborate. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople in Washington,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cohen, \xe2\x80\x9cforgot that they are developers: \xe2\x80\x98I am on this committee. I have to fix this problem and write some software to do it,\xe2\x80\x99 and that requires collaboration. They have forgotten their job and the customer.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong, Silicon Valley is not some knitting circle where everyone happily shares their best ideas. It is the most competitive, dog-eat-dog, I-will-sue-you-if-you-even-think-about-infringing-my-patents innovation hub in the world. In that sense, it is, as politics is and should always be, a clash of ideas. What Silicon Valley is not, though, is 'b'only'b' a clash of ideas.'b'Despite the heated competition, lots of collaboration still happens here for one main reason: to serve the customer the best product or service. One way is through new open-source innovation platforms like GitHub \xe2\x80\x94 a kind of \xe2\x80\x9cWikipedia for programmers\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 where hobbyists, start-ups and big firms share ideas in order to enlist more people (either within a firm in restricted ways or from the outside in a wide open manner) to help improve their software or Web sites.'b'Another way is through \xe2\x80\x9cco-opetition.\xe2\x80\x9d There are many examples here of companies trying to kill each other in one market but working together in another \xe2\x80\x94 to better serve customers. Microsoft Windows runs on Apple Macs because customers wanted it. When Apple Maps failed, Apple asked its users to download Google Maps. Finally, within firms, it is understood that to thrive in today\xe2\x80\x99s market, solve the biggest problems and serve customers, you need to assemble the best minds from anywhere in the world.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you obsess about the customer, you end up defeating your competition as a byproduct,\xe2\x80\x9d said K.R. Sridhar, the founder of Bloom Energy, a fuel-cell company. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you are just obsessed about the competition, you end up killing yourself\xe2\x80\x9d as a byproduct \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cbecause you are not focused on the customer.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The far-right lurch of the G.O.P.\xe2\x80\x99s base has made this problem worse. When President Obama built his health care plan on Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s operating system in Massachusetts, Romney was so focused on coddling his base to beat Obama \xe2\x80\x94 rather than trying to improve Obama\xe2\x80\x99s iteration of Romney\xe2\x80\x99s own design to best serve all the customers \xe2\x80\x94 that Romney disowned his own software. What company would do that?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSure competition here is sharp-elbowed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn. \xe2\x80\x9cBut no one can succeed by themselves. Apple today is totally focused on how it can better work with its [applications] developer community.\xe2\x80\x9d It cannot thrive without them. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only way you can achieve something magnificent is by working with other people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hoffman. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is lots of co-opetition.\xe2\x80\x9d LinkedIn competes with headhunters and is used by headhunters.'b'With collaboration, one plus one can often turn out to be four, says Jeff Weiner, the C.E.O. of LinkedIn, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cI will always work with you \xe2\x80\x94 if I know we\xe2\x80\x99ll get to four. You can\xe2\x80\x99t build great products alone. And if everyone understood that you can\xe2\x80\x99t build great government alone our country would be in a different place.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Supreme Court this week will consider whether to reverse a troubling 2002 decision that allowed judges greater sentencing power in certain circumstances. For the sake of fairness and consistency, it should overturn that 10-year-old ruling.'b'The question raised in the case to be argued Monday, 'b'Alleyne v. United States'b', is whether a trial judge can increase a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prison term beyond a mandatory minimum sentence if the facts allowing for the longer sentence were not proved beyond a reasonable doubt.'b'This has been a murky area of sentencing law, made confusing by the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s contradictory rulings. The justices 'b'ruled'b' in 2000 that any factual determination that allows a sentence to be increased beyond the statutory 'b'maximum'b' must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. But in the 2002 case, 'b'Harris v. United States'b', the court said that this principle did not apply if the increase was added to a mandatory 'b'minimum'b'. In that situation, the justices said, a judge could do what a statute directed, \xe2\x80\x9cgive specific weight to certain facts when choosing the sentence,\xe2\x80\x9d without a finding by a jury.'b'In the new case, Allen Alleyne was convicted of robbery and of using or carrying a firearm during the robbery. But the jury acquitted him of brandishing the gun during the robbery. Nevertheless, a judge found \xe2\x80\x94 by a preponderance of the evidence, a lower standard of proof \xe2\x80\x94 that Mr. Alleyne reasonably foresaw that his accomplice would brandish a gun. In addition to a 46-month sentence on the robbery count, the judge increased his sentence by seven years instead of by the minimum sentence of five years for carrying a gun.'b'Because the increased term means a greater deprivation of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s liberty, the constitutional rights to due process and trial by jury require that a jury determine the facts on which the increase depends.'b'Those rights have been eroded by two major reforms by Congress beginning in the 1980s: the federal sentencing guidelines, which called for specific sentences for specific crimes; and mandatory minimum sentences, which give enormous power to prosecutors to determine sentences through the charges they bring.'b'But since 2005, the Supreme Court has 'b'ruled'b' that the guidelines can only be advisory, because requiring judges to follow them violates a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment right to have a jury find the facts as a basis for sentences.'b'By reversing Harris, the court would be bolstering Sixth Amendment rights and restoring a role that the Constitution gives the jury.'b'At the end of last year, just shy of the 11th hour in the fiscal cliff negotiations, President Obama made an offer that included a Republican-backed idea to cut spending by lowering the cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security benefits. The move shocked Congressional Democrats and dismayed Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s liberal base.'b'The offer, however, was rejected by House Republicans who could not stomach the tax increases and other concessions that Mr. Obama demanded as part of the deal. The talks moved on, and when all was said and done, Republicans did not get the lower cost-of-living adjustments (known as COLAs) and Mr. Obama did not get the concessions he had sought.'b'But that is not the end of the story. As the next round of deficit reduction talks gets under way, the administration seems determined to include the COLA cut in any new package of spending reductions. Rather than using the issue as a bargaining ploy, the administration appears to have embraced it as a worthy end in itself.'b'Is it? In a word, no.'b'That is not to say that Social Security should be off the table. There are reforms that are eminently sensible, if only the political will could be found to enact them. But reducing the COLA is not a sound idea now and may never be.'b'At issue is the way inflation is calculated. The administration\xe2\x80\x99s offer in the fiscal cliff talks \xe2\x80\x94 and the approach long advocated by Republicans \xe2\x80\x94 calls for using a new measure of inflation, called the \xe2\x80\x9cchained\xe2\x80\x9d Consumer Price Index, to calculate the COLA.'b'Unlike the gauge of inflation currently in use, the chained index captures the ability of consumers to adjust their spending across categories as relative prices change \xe2\x80\x94 for instance, spending less on fuel as gas prices go up and more on groceries as food prices go down. Such substitution causes the chained C.P.I. to rise more slowly than the current measure, which would result in a lower annual COLA and huge budget savings. The move to a chained C.P.I. would reduce benefits by some $135 billion over 10 years, and far more in later decades because of compounding.'b'The administration and other proponents of switching to a chained C.P.I. contend that it is a technical fix in the interest of greater accuracy, not a benefit cut per se.'b'But that claim does not stand up to scrutiny. The chained index is in many ways a better method of tracking price changes for the broad working population, but there is no compelling evidence that it is better for computing the Social Security COLA.'b'What is known is that elderly households tend to have lower incomes and lower expenditures than younger households, and that more of their purchases are for needs that cannot be met by switching to products and services in unrelated categories. That indicates that they do not have the same flexibility as younger households to respond to price changes while still maintaining their standards of living. And because of the way it is calculated, the chained C.P.I. would also result in delayed upward adjustments in the COLA in times of accelerating inflation. Such delays would translate into real benefit cuts, leaving retirees worse off.'b'If, as the administration says, the aim is to set the COLA in the most accurate way possible, then the obvious approach is to have the Bureau of Labor Statistics develop a statistically rigorous index to track inflation as experienced by retirees. A more informal index from the bureau that looks at the effects of inflation on the elderly shows that the COLA is too low, not too high, in part because of medical costs. But the number of households sampled is too small to be sure.'b'A rigorous index would settle the issue of whether the current COLA adjustments are high, low or about right. The fact that some policy makers are willing, even eager, to move ahead with changing the COLA without having developed a more reliable gauge only feeds the impression that they are trying to get away with an unjustified benefit cut.'b'In the meantime, there are other, well-researched reforms to Social Security that the administration and other policy makers could pursue. For instance, it is well understood that upper-income people live longer than the less affluent. The formula for determining Social Security benefits could be gradually and modestly adjusted to reflect those longer lives, while making the system more progressive and cutting spending. Another sensible reform would be to raise the level of wages currently subject to the Social Security payroll tax, so that it better reflects the income gains of top earners over the past several decades.'b'But prematurely forcing through a COLA cut would be unnecessary and unwise.'b'FOR the textbook definition of not knowing enough to quit while you\xe2\x80\x99re ahead, please turn your attention to Harry Reid, he of the scabrous tongue and rotten temper, a boxer in his youth and a pugilist to this day, throwing mud along with punches and invariably soiling himself.'b'Reid, the Democratic majority leader in the Senate, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just stand back and relish the recent spectacle of House Republicans making callous fools of themselves by stalling aid to communities walloped by Hurricane Sandy. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t satisfied that these Republicans were vilified not only in the news media but also by some members of their own tribe, like Peter King and Chris Christie. No, he had to get into the ring himself, and his genius strategy once there was to pit one storm\xe2\x80\x99s victims against another\xe2\x80\x99s, to stage a bout between Atlantic City\xe2\x80\x99s splintered boardwalks and Louisiana\xe2\x80\x99s failed levees. What a titan of meteorological tact.'b'Noting that Congress had provided help after Hurricane Katrina more quickly and generously than after Sandy, Reid said: \xe2\x80\x9cThe people of New Orleans and that area, they were hurt, but nothing in comparison to what happened to the people in New York and New Jersey. Almost one million people have lost their homes. One million people lost their homes. That is homes, that is not people in those homes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s put aside, for the moment, his fleeting difficulty distinguishing a biped with a weak spot for reality TV from a wood, brick or maybe stucco structure in which several bipeds watch TV. Let\xe2\x80\x99s focus instead on his math. The one million figure is easily more than twice the combined tally of domiciles not only destroyed but also damaged in New York, New Jersey 'b'and'b' Connecticut. It\xe2\x80\x99s an invention. And if comparisons are to be made, consider this one: as a result of Katrina, 'b'1,833 people died'b' \xe2\x80\x94 more than nine times as many as died in connection with Sandy. Using the word \xe2\x80\x9cnothing\xe2\x80\x9d anywhere in the vicinity of Katrina defies both belief and decency, and Reid was indeed forced last week to apologize, his effort to shame his Republican foes having brought a full measure of shame to his own doorstep, yet again.'b'Why did he make the effort in the first place? Democrats came out of the 2012 elections looking good, and the country\xe2\x80\x99s changing demographics suggest that they could come out of 2016 and beyond looking even better, especially if Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t accomplish a pretty thorough image overhaul. And that overhaul isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly proceeding at a breakneck pace. The perseverance of far-right obstructionists in the House stands in the way, leaving the party in grave trouble. If its foes were smart and humble, they\xe2\x80\x99d do what a sports team with a big lead does. They\xe2\x80\x99d play error-free ball.'b'Not Reid. And not President Obama, whose recent actions have been careless at best and cavalier at worst. There was the gratuitously provocative nomination of Chuck Hagel for defense secretary, followed by the gratuitously insulting invitation of 'b'Louie Giglio'b', a Georgia pastor, to give the inaugural benediction. That plan was abandoned after the revelation of Giglio\xe2\x80\x99s past remarks that homosexuality offends God, that homosexuals yearn to take over society and that a conversion to heterosexuality is the only answer for them. Giglio would have been the second florid homophobe in a row to stand with Obama and a Bible in front of the Capitol \xe2\x80\x94 Rick Warren, in January 2009, was the first \xe2\x80\x94 and while it appears that this double bigotry whammy wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the administration\xe2\x80\x99s intent, it\xe2\x80\x99s an example of vetting so epically sloppy that it gives an observer serious pause about the delicacy with which Obama and his allies, no longer worried about his re-election, are operating.'b'The pick of Hagel underscores that indelicacy. There\xe2\x80\x99s a potent case to be made for his installation as secretary of defense, but there are potent cases for others, and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe that Obama couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have found someone who shared his values and would further his agenda but 'b'wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t'b' be such a guaranteed lightning rod for his Jewish, LGBT and female supporters, all of whom played crucial roles in his November victory.'b'Regarding women, Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s record on reproductive freedom is as conservative as his record on gay rights, and it included his support for a ban on abortions in military hospitals, even for servicewomen prepared to pay for the procedures themselves. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, Obama rolled Hagel out in a cluster of other high-profile nominees (John Brennan, Jack Lew, John Kerry) sure to be noted for their gender uniformity and to rekindle questions about the predominantly 'b'male club of advisers'b' and golf and basketball partners who have the president\xe2\x80\x99s ear. The upset was predictable and avoidable.'b'It has been noted, rightly, that the president put two additional women on the Supreme Court and that his percentage of female appointees is as good as President Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s was. But given the march of time since then, and given the questions raised during his first term about how valued women in the administration felt, and given his drumbeat that he was a champion for women in a way Mitt Romney could never be, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he be surpassing Clinton? Going out of his way? There\xe2\x80\x99s a perverse streak of defiance in him, and as donors and even Democratic lawmakers have long complained, gratitude isn\xe2\x80\x99t his strong suit.'b'While Hagel lurched toward his confirmation hearings and Giglio skittered away, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced that it was sending each of the 35 Republican freshmen in the House a \xe2\x80\x9ctea party membership card,\xe2\x80\x9d which spelled out their rights to put \xe2\x80\x9cideology over solutions,\xe2\x80\x9d to be horrid to women, to coddle Big Oil and \xe2\x80\x9cto create and/or ignore any national crisis.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus did the Dems turn legitimate gripes into schoolyard taunts that were more likely to inflame G.O.P. freshmen than to bully them into bipartisanship. What, beyond the theater of the gesture, was the point of it?'b'Granted, Republicans had done their own adolescent taunting, calling Democrats lap dogs in the Nancy Pelosi obedience school. But Democrats pride and market themselves as the reasonable adults in the equation, and that\xe2\x80\x99s part of their currency with many voters. Why fritter it away?'b'And why abide the overwrought antics of Reid? He once compared opponents of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s health care reform to enemies of emancipation. He took valid questions about Romney\xe2\x80\x99s low tax bill and spun them into the 'b'unsubstantiated claim'b' that Romney hadn\xe2\x80\x99t paid any taxes for an entire 10-year period. Then he said the burden was on Romney to prove the charge untrue. Good thing our criminal courts don\xe2\x80\x99t work that way.'b'Just before and after the 2012 election, it looked as if Republicans might be successfully burying themselves. All Democrats had to do was hammer the nail in the coffin. But the way they\xe2\x80\x99re behaving, they\xe2\x80\x99ll raise the dead.'b'JUST after Christmas, Poly Prep Country Day School, the venerable Brooklyn institution, settled a lawsuit alleging a more than 40-year cover-up of the predatory pedophilia of its legendary football coach, Philip Foglietta. The terms of the settlement have not been disclosed, but the lawsuit charged that school administrators were repeatedly informed from the 1960s until his forced retirement in 1991 that Mr. Foglietta was sexually abusing boys \xe2\x80\x94 on campus, in his apartment and during trips. Mr. Foglietta, who died in 1998, fondled and raped dozens, if not hundreds, of children.'b'I played, without distinction, on some of the great Poly teams of the 1970s; at least one of my teammates was a plaintiff in the case (there might well be others \xe2\x80\x94 not all plaintiffs were identified by name). The case raises difficult questions for a generation of Poly boys: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did we know about Coach Phil?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWho else must have known?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat should we have done?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can we learn to protect our own kids?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What did we know about Coach Phil? It is difficult to separate what we felt as teenagers from what we have discovered since. We feared and loved him. He was a squat, grizzled bear of a man. Despite having only 300 boys, mainly of marginal talent, Poly beat New York City public high schools many times its size. We used to joke that there were guys on our team who would, if told to do so by Coach, try to tackle the B70 bus, which ran alongside our field. We were small and slow, but relentless.'b'Coach was often a bully. He would hit a player with his own helmet or instruct an offensive lineman who missed a block to hold the ball like a quarterback while the entire defensive line slammed into him. Water breaks in the August miasma of two-a-day practices had to be earned through performance. Kids who had quit the team, he would suggest, deserved to be beaten up. He would talk about the \xe2\x80\x9cfruits\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chomos\xe2\x80\x9d on the male faculty. He would bark curse words in a strange argot of Italianized English.'b'But when he stopped yelling and his eyes twinkled and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cNice hit,\xe2\x80\x9d you would smile ear to ear. He brought alumni to practice, as well as big-time college and pro players, who appeared to revere him. He coached every summer at Joe Namath (Joe Namath!) football camp. I was desperate to go; my mother wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me. I recall returning to Poly years later and Coach\xe2\x80\x99s asking me to come to practice so he could tell the team how I stuck with football despite a lack of skill (I was no longer merely soft), and how my discipline and persistence should be an example to all. It was a peak moment for me, up there with my improbable interception against Horace Mann. Most of us would have said that Phil Foglietta taught us what it meant to be a man, circa 1975 in south Brooklyn.'b'But many of us also knew that Coach Phil showered with the fifth graders. We knew that he hung around the locker room and checked that each of us had thoroughly rinsed off. Most of us knew he invited kids for car rides to Coney Island in his green Chevy Impala and for overnight stays at the apartment he shared with his mother. Most of those kids were young and small, often boys who had lost their fathers. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother kids whose fathers were in local politics (my dad was in the State Senate) or allegedly high up in the mob (a couple of Gambino grandsons went to our school). Those boys were never offered a ride in the green Impala.'b'One of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit was the younger brother of a classmate. The brothers\xe2\x80\x99 dad died suddenly in 1970, when my classmate and I were in seventh grade. Both brothers were slight; only the younger one played football. My classmate, Scott Smith, went to Cornell, made a fortune in finance, and is now Poly\xe2\x80\x99s chairman of the board. His younger brother, Philip, never went to college and slid into multiple addictions. According to the lawsuit, he was sexually assaulted hundreds of times.'b'We knew something was going on. We joked with one another about the showers and the car rides. One of my teammates wrote on a Web site created for Coach\xe2\x80\x99s victims, \xe2\x80\x9cHow is it that as a 14-year-old Poly freshman, I just knew that something was very wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d Another former student wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cI am heartbroken that I lacked the wits and guts to comprehend what was happening to classmates, friends, and the guys that followed me.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I am not sure whether we would have known what raping boys entailed. We avoided knowing too much; the urge to repress and avert was overwhelming, not only for the victims but also for the bystanders, who understood that for whatever reason they had been left alone. As far as I know, none of the boys who were abused talked about it to other members of the team. The Poly board chairman has said he learned about the abuse of his brother only last year. Back then, we were uncomfortable and embarrassed, unwilling or unable to make sense of what was highly threatening to teenage boys in the homophobic hothouse of a Brooklyn boys\xe2\x80\x99 school. (Poly Prep went coed in 1977, two years after I graduated.)'b'But there is little doubt that senior administrators were told about the abuse on multiple occasions. The lawsuit recounts specific meetings between boys, their parents, the headmaster and the athletic director. That athletic director, who went on to become dean of students and assistant headmaster, reportedly witnessed abuse in the showers and walked away. In 1991, the headmaster allegedly told one of the victims that Coach was a bitter, sick old man who should be left alone. Coach Phil was powerful, intimidating, successful, not to be trifled with. And so for a quarter-century, he freely abused vulnerable boys, virtually in plain sight.'b'WHAT should we have done? We should have told our parents and teachers and other school officials that Coach was hanging out by the showers and it made us feel weird. Maybe we should have reached out to the boys who were riding off in the Impala and warned them away. We were just kids, of course, but in retrospect our lack of curiosity, our lack of action and our lack of courage were inexcusable.'b'Pedophilia remains endemic, a powerful, difficult-to-treat compulsion. Prosecutions are rare, and victims who come forward years later are often barred from court by inflexible rules. Statutes limiting lawsuits should be altered to recognize that these crimes emerge slowly. Every school should have an investigative protocol available to parents online. There should also be at least one experienced person in every institution to whom incidents can easily be reported on a confidential basis.'b'Sexual abuse of children presents itself in confusing, ambiguous ways, so pedophilia education should be a mandatory part of the curriculum, repeated in elementary, middle and high school, at age-appropriate levels of detail. Abused children need to understand that they have done nothing wrong, that it is safe to come forward.'b'Shame ruined lives at Poly Prep; our great successes of youth have turned to ashes. I am angry at the school for failing to protect so many boys. But I am also ashamed of myself, that I was so intimidated, so desperate for Coach\xe2\x80\x99s approval, so eager to be a boy winning football games, that I failed to be the man I know I should have been.'b'AS both his critics and admirers argue, the nomination of Chuck Hagel as secretary of defense last week tells us something important about Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s approach to foreign policy. But so does the man who was nominated alongside Hagel, to far less controversy and attention: John Brennan, now head of the White House\xe2\x80\x99s counterterrorism efforts, and soon to be the director of the C.I.A.'b'Both men were intimately involved in foreign policy debates during George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s administration, but had very different public profiles. As a C.I.A. official, Brennan publicly defended some of Bush\xe2\x80\x99s most controversial counterterrorism policies, including the 'b'\xe2\x80\x9crendition\xe2\x80\x9d of terror suspects'b' for interrogation in foreign countries. As a senator, Hagel was one of the few prominent Republicans to (eventually) turn against the war in Iraq. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s fitting that Obama has nominated them together, because his foreign policy has basically synthesized their respective Bush-era perspectives.'b'Like the once-hawkish Hagel, Obama has largely rejected Bush\xe2\x80\x99s strategic vision of America as the agent of a sweeping transformation of the Middle East, and retreated from the military commitments that this revolutionary vision required. And with this retreat has come a willingness to make substantial cuts in the Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s budget \xe2\x80\x94 cuts that Hagel will be expected to oversee.'b'But the Brennan nomination crystallizes the ways in which Obama has also cemented and expanded the Bush approach to counterterrorism. Yes, waterboarding is no longer with us, but in its place we have a far-flung 'b'drone campaign'b' \xe2\x80\x94 overseen and defended by Brennan \xe2\x80\x94 that deals death, even to American citizens, on the say-so of the president and a secret administration \xe2\x80\x9cnominations\xe2\x80\x9d process.'b'Meanwhile, the imprimatur of a liberal president means that other controversial Bush-era counterterror policies are more secure than ever. Just last month, for instance, while Congress was embroiled in furious partisan arguments over the fiscal cliff, the practice of warrantless wiretapping was reaffirmed with broad bipartisan support.'b'To the extent that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to define an \xe2\x80\x9cObama Doctrine,\xe2\x80\x9d then, it\xe2\x80\x99s basically the Hagel-Brennan two-step. Fewer boots on the ground, but lots of drones in the air. Assassination, yes; nation-building, no. An imperial presidency with a less-imperial global footprint.'b'This is a popular combination in a country that\xe2\x80\x99s tired of war but still remembers 9/11 vividly. Indeed, Obama\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy has been an immense political success: he\xe2\x80\x99s co-opted foreign policy realists, neutralized antiwar Democrats and isolated Republican hawks.'b'This success, in turn, has given him a freer hand to choose appointees who embody his worldview. The left objected, successfully, when Brennan was floated as a possibility for C.I.A. director after Obama\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 victory, but the opposition is likely to be weaker this time around. Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s hawkish opponents have a slightly better chance, mostly because his views on Iran and Israel are more dovish than the White House\xe2\x80\x99s own stated positions. But the campaign against his nomination has often been more desperate than effective, offering tissue-thin charges of anti-Semitism and embarrassingly opportunistic criticisms of Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s record on gay rights.'b'If Hagel does get through, it will be the clearest sign yet that Obama enjoys more trust \xe2\x80\x94 and with it, more latitude \xe2\x80\x94 on foreign policy than any Democrat since Harry Truman. And in many ways he\xe2\x80\x99s earned it: his mix of caution and aggression has thus far avoided major military disasters (an underrated virtue in presidents), prevented major terror attacks and put an end to America\xe2\x80\x99s most infamous foe.'b'But that\xe2\x80\x99s a provisional judgment, contingent on events to come. The Obama way of statecraft has offered a plausible course correction after the debacles of the Bush era, but the ripples from many of his biggest choices \xe2\x80\x94 to leave Iraq outright, to surge and then withdraw in Afghanistan, to intervene more forcefully in Libya than in Syria \xe2\x80\x94 'b'are still spreading'b', and the ultimate success of those policies is still very much in doubt. Likewise with his looming defense cuts, whose wisdom depends entirely on what actually is trimmed.'b'Foreign policy is always a balancing act, in which no ideological system can guarantee success, and no effective action is without cost. The recent careers of the two nominees illustrate this point. Hagel was absolutely right to decide that the Iraq war was a blunder, but he was dead wrong (as was Obama) to then assume that the 2007 surge \xe2\x80\x94 a salvage job, but a brave and necessary one \xe2\x80\x94 would only make the situation worse. The drone campaign that Brennan has overseen has undoubtedly weakened Al Qaeda. But it\xe2\x80\x99s also killed innocents, fed anti-American sentiment and eroded the constraints on executive power in troubling ways.'b'These are not reasons to deny them the chance to serve this president in his second term. But they are reasons to ask them hard questions, and to look carefully for places where Obama\xe2\x80\x99s post-Bush course correction may need to be corrected in its turn.'b'Readers debate how to make Congress less dysfunctional.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'The founding fathers intended that voters should have personal knowledge of the people they sent to govern in Washington. Few of today\xe2\x80\x99s voters really know the candidates; this makes misrepresentation easy and effective, and creates the need for large sums of money for political campaigns, leaving the candidates beholden to those moneyed interests. So, what happened?'b'House districts were supposed to be small. The final act of the Constitutional Convention was to reduce the minimum size of a House district from 40,000 to 30,000. Today the average Congressional district includes 710,000 people, so only a small percentage of the voters have any idea what the candidates are like as people.'b'The founders believed that for a republican form of government to succeed, it should be populated with men of virtue. They also recognized that government quite naturally attracts the power-hungry. So they sought to build safeguards against scoundrels into the system. Over the years we\xe2\x80\x99ve allowed these safety mechanisms to be overridden.'b'The safeguard most easily restored is a return to small House districts. It can be achieved without a constitutional amendment by the simple passage of a bill to reduce the size of Congressional districts to, say, 100,000 people. House membership would increase from 435 \xe2\x80\x94 set by a 1911 law \xe2\x80\x94 to about 3,100.'b'This move has the added benefit of introducing a flow of new faces into Washington. These men and women would owe their seats more to the reputation they enjoyed within their community and less to the half-truths and misinformation put out by slick mass media campaigns paid for by the big-money interests. Surely among them would be the men and women of virtue so necessary to the proper functioning of our republican form of government. And so lacking today.'b'GAIL L.

Better to disband the House than to increase its size.'b'If we have learned anything from the past two years, it is that the House is a senseless waste of taxpayer money. It costs hundreds of millions in its present size and accomplishes almost nothing. Congress reached a new low of a 10 percent favorability rating last year, and Ms. Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s solution is to make the House seven times larger?'b'The dysfunction of the House is based in large measure on the provincial nature of the interests of its members. Increase that number sevenfold and what do you get? I suspect reams of legislation that abandon core issues and are laden with pork.'b'If the government of the United States were run like a successful business, the board of directors would have decided long ago to eliminate the most obvious impediment to progress. That impediment is the House of Representatives.'b'MICHAEL G. THOMAS'b' Sawyer, Mich., Jan. 9, 2013'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'Like many commentators, Ms. Johnson oversimplifies how the founders of the American republic thought about representation. The anti-Federalist opponents of the Constitution wanted representatives who would show \xe2\x80\x9csympathy\xe2\x80\x9d for the interests of their constituents. Increasing the size of the House of Representatives, up to a point, would be compatible with their views.'b'But the Federalist supporters of the Constitution had a different view. Read James Madison\xe2\x80\x99s or Alexander Hamilton\xe2\x80\x99s writings on representation, for example, and you will find that they emphasize knowledge and deliberation. Madison thought that the House could hold a couple of hundred members. Beyond that, he worried that a continuing increase in size would destroy the possibility of deliberation.'b'Granted, Congress no longer operates in the grand debate manner of the late 18th and 19th centuries. But it still does a great deal of deliberation. How would a House composed of 3,100 members deliberate?'b'Ms. Johnson wants to solve a problem that may not really exist. Most members of the House, even from the safest seats, spend large amounts of time soliciting the views of voters in their districts. Nor has anyone faulted Congress for failing to provide constituent services.'b'The real problem, as virtually every observer notes, has been the measurable increase in the polarization of the parties and, arguably, the obstructionist ethos prevailing among Republicans.'b'Increasing the size of the House would only compound this problem. A much better answer would involve using the redistricting process to make Congressional races more competitive.'b'JACK RAKOVE'b' Stanford, Calif., Jan. 9, 2013'b''b''b'The writer is a professor of history and political science at Stanford University and the author of \xe2\x80\x9cOriginal Meanings,\xe2\x80\x9d which won the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for history.'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'Doing something about the currently dysfunctional House of Representatives is an excellent idea. But 3,100 representatives would make for a terribly unwieldy body. Getting any legislation passed would be an even greater challenge than it is today. Another downside would be that state legislatures would be able to gerrymander districts even more precisely than they do now.'b'Why not go in the opposite direction by doubling the size of districts to an even 1.5 million? It would harder to gerrymander such districts, and it could reverse the trend toward \xe2\x80\x9csafe seats\xe2\x80\x9d since the enlarged districts would include far more diverse populations. Also, a smaller house would probably function more efficiently.'b'EDWIN SAFFORD'b' Wading River, N.Y., Jan. 9, 2013'b''b''b'The writer is a former Congressional correspondent for the Newhouse News Service.'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'Vastly increasing the number of House seats as suggested would shift power and political influence to the more densely populated areas.'b'The answer to populating the House with people of virtue and eliminating the power-hungry \xe2\x80\x94 and their waste, corruption and self-interest \xe2\x80\x94 is term limits, so that re-election and maintaining power aren\xe2\x80\x99t our representatives\xe2\x80\x99 main concerns.'b'ERIC WILSON'b' Naples, Fla., Jan. 9, 2013'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'Ms. Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s idea for reforming the House is grounded in at least two dubious assumptions. First, that gridlock in Washington is rooted in a lack of familiarity between citizens and their representatives. Second, that the United States was better governed earlier in our history when House districts were smaller.'b'The first assumption is questionable because of recent gerrymandering, which has made many districts more homogeneous. Indeed, many representatives, particularly Republicans, are so afraid of primary challenges that they dare not go against the orthodoxy their districts demand. If anything there is often too much affinity between constituents and the actions of representatives, restraining members of Congress from taking the risks that legislative leadership demands.'b'The second assumption is faulty because it enshrines the early Republic as the ideal that we should be striving to achieve in the present. Certainly early American leaders talked a great deal about virtue, but in terms of governing they had far less on their plate. The federal government was not nearly as large, legislative sessions were shorter and, most important, most legislators had to concern themselves only with the opinions of white male property owners, instead of balancing the demands of numerous groups.'b'In conclusion, a larger House may help solve Washington\xe2\x80\x99s problems, but more cooks in the kitchen alone will not do.'b'JAMES THAJUDEEN'b' Brooklyn, Jan. 9, 2013'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s require our elected officials to be in the district or state they represent and reasonably available to their voters at least 10 consecutive working days a month.

Congress and the president can make it happen. The states already have mechanisms to deal with the resulting reapportionment.'b'The alternatives offered by Mr. Thomas and Mr. Wilson \xe2\x80\x94 disbanding the House and term limits \xe2\x80\x94 require a constitutional amendment. Mr. Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s plan would return us to a confederation of states. If Congressional districts were set to 1.5 million people as Mr. Safford suggests, the 11 states with fewer than 1.5 million would be overrepresented in the House, just as they already are in the Senate.'b'The idea of 3,100 representatives becomes less outrageous when one considers that the House already employs 10,000 staff members.'b'With regard to Professor Rakove\xe2\x80\x99s comments, in the Federalist James Madison wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cAt the expiration of twenty-five years, according to the computed rate of increase, the number of representatives will amount to two hundred; and of fifty years, to four hundred.\xe2\x80\x9d And, \xe2\x80\x9cThe remaining charge against the House of Representatives, which I am to examine, is grounded on a supposition that the number of members will not be augmented from time to time, as the progress of population may demand. It has been admitted that this objection, if well supported, would have great weight.\xe2\x80\x9d It is not too great a stretch to believe that Madison would be disturbed that after 225 years the House has only 435 members to speak for 310 million people.'b'Professor Rakove identifies the need for more competitive elections, as do Mr. Lowenstein, Mr. Safford and Mr. Thajudeen with their gerrymandering comments. By reducing the cost of campaigns, small districts will enable more healthy competition for House seats.'b'A marketing campaign targeting 100,000 people quickly hits diminishing returns. A higher percentage of voters will know the candidates and be less likely to be swayed by advertising. Face time with constituents becomes more productive than hours of fund-raising.

I take great care of myself. I have a personal trainer who has me up to 50 push-ups a month, and combined with my knee bends and situps, I can now press the 100-pound barbell over my head with only minimal tearing of my stomach wall. I never smoke and I watch what I eat, carefully avoiding any foods that give pleasure.

Incidentally, this relentless preoccupation with health has made me quite the amateur medical expert. Not that I don\xe2\x80\x99t make an occasional mistake \xe2\x80\x94 but what doctor doesn\xe2\x80\x99t? For example, I once convinced a woman who experienced a mild ringing in her ears that she had the flesh-eating bacteria, and another time I pronounced a man dead who had simply dozed off in a chair.'b'But what\xe2\x80\x99s this obsession with personal vulnerability? When I panic over symptoms that require no more than an aspirin or a little calamine lotion, what is it I\xe2\x80\x99m really frightened of? My best guess is dying. I have always had an animal fear of death, a fate I rank second only to having to sit through a rock concert. My wife tries to be consoling about mortality and assures me that death is a natural part of life, and that we all die sooner or later. Oddly this news, whispered into my ear at 3 a.m., causes me to leap screaming from the bed, snap on every light in the house and play my recording of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Stars and Stripes Forever\xe2\x80\x9d at top volume till the sun comes up.'b'I sometimes imagine that death might be more tolerable if I passed away in my sleep, although the reality is, no form of dying is acceptable to me with the possible exception of being kicked to death by a pair of scantily clad cocktail waitresses.'b'Perhaps if I were a religious person, which I am not, although I sometimes do have the intimation that we all may be part of something larger \xe2\x80\x94 like a Ponzi scheme. A great Spanish philosopher wrote that all humans long for \xe2\x80\x9cthe eternal persistence of consciousness.\xe2\x80\x9d Not an easy state to maintain, especially when you\xe2\x80\x99re dining with people who keep talking about their children.'b'And yet, there are worse things than death. Many of them playing at a theater near you. For instance, I would not like to survive a stroke and for the rest of my life talk out of the side of my mouth like a racetrack tout. I would also not like to go into a coma, to lie in a hospital bed where I\xe2\x80\x99m not dead but can\xe2\x80\x99t even blink my eyes and signal the nurse to switch the channel from Fox News. And incidentally, who\xe2\x80\x99s to say the nurse isn\xe2\x80\x99t one of those angel of death crazies who hates to see people suffer and fills my intravenous glucose bag with Exxon regular.'b'Worse than death, too, is to be on life support listening to my loved ones in a heated debate over whether to terminate me and hear my wife say, \xe2\x80\x9cI think we can pull the plug, it\xe2\x80\x99s been 15 minutes and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be late for our dinner reservation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What worries me most is winding up a vegetable \xe2\x80\x94 any vegetable, and that includes corn, which under happier circumstances I rather like. And yet is it really so great to live forever? Sometimes in the news I see features about certain tall people who reside in snow-capped regions where a whole village population lives to 140 or so. Of course all they ever eat is yogurt, and when they finally do die they are not embalmed but pasteurized. And don\xe2\x80\x99t forget these healthy people walk everyplace because try getting a cab in the Himalayas. I mean do I really want to pass my days in some remote place where the main entertainment is seeing which guy in town can lift the ox highest with his bare hands?'b'Summing up, there are two distinct groups, hypochondriacs and alarmists. Both suffer in their own ways, and traits of one group may overlap the other, but whether you\xe2\x80\x99re a hypochondriac or an alarmist, at this point in time, either is probably better than being a Republican.'b'THE odds are good that you haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet given up on your New Year\xe2\x80\x99s resolutions and that one of them is to swear off those expensive cappuccinos and save money for your old age. That\xe2\x80\x99s a typical suggestion from finance gurus, who say we can add thousands of dollars annually to our nest eggs by eliminating such wasteful spending.'b'But deciding to take your lunch to work or to cancel your cable television won\xe2\x80\x99t help nearly as much as you\xe2\x80\x99d think. For all the attention we pay to overspending, we struggle with our personal finances not because we spend too much money on small luxuries but because salaries have stagnated at the same time as the costs of nonluxuries have gone up.'b'Even as the average household net worth plunged 'b'by almost 40 percent'b' between 2007 and 2010, the cost of everything from health care to housing has risen for decades at rates well beyond that of inflation. 'b'Almost half of us'b' are living paycheck to paycheck, barely able to save a penny.'b'In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s long been known that the majority of bankruptcies result from health issues, job losses and fractured families, something no amount of cutting back can protect against.'b'One of the main reasons we need to borrow money is college loans. Our collective student loan debt is more than $1 trillion, a sum greater than both our credit card debt and our auto loans.'b'The student loan debt problem is basic: college tuitions have increased at more than quadruple the rate of inflation since the 1980s. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a parent, good luck saving for that expense. It\xe2\x80\x99s a primary reason students who borrow money (some two-thirds of all undergraduates) now graduate with 'b'an average of $26,600 of debt'b'. That, in turn, will make it harder for the next generation to save.'b'Those who do manage to save still cannot save as much as they need. According to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, the average baby boomer had 'b'$42,000 in his retirement account'b' in 2010. That won\xe2\x80\x99t go far toward meeting an average couple\xe2\x80\x99s future health care costs: $240,000.'b'And while financial planners often advise older people to work longer, how can they when many leave their jobs because of health problems, or are laid off and, as a consequence of their advanced age, are unable to find new employment?'b'We seem to want to believe we can budget-cut our way to financial success, maybe because we view monetary setbacks as shameful, nobody\xe2\x80\x99s fault but our own. The personal finance establishment endorses our self-blaming tendencies. David Bach became famous promulgating the idea that by cutting out the daily Starbucks run, people could retire as millionaires. Dave Ramsey has lauded men and women who \xe2\x80\x9crefused to participate in the recession,\xe2\x80\x9d as if a bad economy is a problem of attitude. Suze Orman told investors who lost money in Bernie Madoff\xe2\x80\x99s infamous scheme that they had \xe2\x80\x9cwalked right into that financial concentration camp,\xe2\x80\x9d suggesting they should have heeded complaints the Securities and Exchange Commission all but ignored.'b'So let me suggest another financial resolution, one that will do more for our future financial outlook than simply forgoing a few consumer goods: talk about money. It\xe2\x80\x99s not shameful. Pick a cause, and resolve to fight for change.'b'TRENTON'b'FIVE years ago, four titans of American foreign policy \xe2\x80\x94 the former secretaries of state George P. Shultz and Henry A. Kissinger, the former defense secretary William J. Perry and the former senator Sam Nunn \xe2\x80\x94 'b'called for'b' \xe2\x80\x9ca world free of 'b'nuclear weapons'b',\xe2\x80\x9d giving new momentum to an idea that had moved from the sidelines of pacifist idealism to the center of foreign policy debate.'b'America\xe2\x80\x99s 76 million baby boomers grew up during the cold war, when a deep fear of nuclear weapons permeated American life, from duck-and-cover school drills to backyard fallout shelters. Then, in the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, combined with immense anti-nuclear demonstrations, led to negotiations with the Soviet Union that drastically reduced the size of the two superpowers\xe2\x80\x99 nuclear arsenals.'b'Sadly, the abolition movement seems stalled. Part of the reason is fear of nuclear weapons in the hands of others: President George W. Bush exploited anxieties over nuclear weapons to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq; most Republican presidential candidates last year said they would fight a war with Iran rather than allow it to get the bomb.'b'There is also a small group of people who still believe fervently in nuclear weapons. President Obama had to buy passage of the New START treaty with Russia, in 2010, with a promise to spend $185 billion to modernize warheads and delivery systems over 10 years \xe2\x80\x94 revealing that while support for nuclear weapons may not be broad, it runs deep. That support endures because of five widely held myths.'b'The first is the myth that nuclear weapons altered the course of 'b'World War II'b'. Leaving aside the morality of America\xe2\x80\x99s decision to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, new research by the historian Tsuyoshi Hasegawa and other scholars shows that Japan surrendered not because of the atom bomb but because the Soviets renounced neutrality and joined the war. Sixty-six Japanese cities had already been destroyed by conventional weapons \xe2\x80\x94 two more did not make the difference. Attributing surrender to the bomb was also convenient for Japan\xe2\x80\x99s leaders, allowing them to blame defeat on a \xe2\x80\x9cmiracle\xe2\x80\x9d weapon.'b'Second is the myth of \xe2\x80\x9cdecisive destruction.\xe2\x80\x9d Mass destruction doesn\xe2\x80\x99t win wars; killing soldiers does. No war has ever been won simply by killing civilians. The 1941-44 siege of Leningrad didn\xe2\x80\x99t deter Soviet leaders from pressing the fight against Hitler. Nor did the 1945 firebombing of Dresden force Germany to submit. As long as an army has a fighting chance at victory, wars continue. Building ever more destructive weapons simply increases the horror of war, not the certainty of ending it.'b'Third is the myth of reliable nuclear deterrence. Numerous leaders have taken risks and acted aggressively during nuclear crises. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy and his advisers knew that blockading Cuba risked nuclear war; they mentioned the possibility 60 times while debating their options. Yet they went ahead. Nuclear proponents might argue that no cold war crisis ever erupted into nuclear war, so deterrence must work. But they\xe2\x80\x99re moving the goal posts.'b'Originally it was claimed that nuclear weapons would assure success in negotiations, prevent any sort of attack \xe2\x80\x94 conventional or nuclear \xe2\x80\x94 and allow countries to protect their friends with a nuclear umbrella. When the Russians weren\xe2\x80\x99t intimidated during talks after World War II, the claim about negotiations was dropped. When the Yom Kippur War and the Falkland Islands War showed that fighting against nuclear-armed countries was possible, the prevention of conventional war claim was dropped. The nuclear umbrella claim ought to have been dropped at the same time, but there was too much American foreign policy riding on it for anyone to make this argument. After all, if Britain couldn\xe2\x80\x99t deter an attack on its own far-flung islands, how could deterrence prevent attacks on other countries?'b'Fourth is the myth of the long peace: the argument that the absence of nuclear war since 1945 means nuclear weapons have \xe2\x80\x9ckept the peace.\xe2\x80\x9d But we don\xe2\x80\x99t accept proof by absence in any circumstance where there is real risk. We wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t fly an airline that claimed to have invented a device that prevented metal fatigue, proved it by equipping 100 planes with the devices for one year without a single crash, and then suddenly ceased all metal-fatigue inspections and repairs, and decided instead to rely solely on these new devices.'b'The last and most stubborn myth is that of irreversibility. Whenever idealists say that they want to abolish nuclear weapons, so-called realists shake their heads and say, in tones of patient condescension, \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t stuff the nuclear genie back in the bottle.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is a specious argument. It\xe2\x80\x99s true that no technology is ever disinvented, but technology does fall out of use all the time. (If you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe me, try to get tech support on any electronic device more than three years old.) Devices disappear either because they are displaced by better technology or because they simply weren\xe2\x80\x99t good. The question isn\xe2\x80\x99t whether nuclear weapons can be disinvented, but whether they are useful. And their usefulness is questionable, given that no one has found an occasion to use them in over 67 years.'b'NOT everyone wants nuclear weapons. What most people don\xe2\x80\x99t realize is that 12 countries have either abandoned nuclear programs, dismantled existing weapons, as South Africa did in the early 1990s, or handed them over, as Kazakhstan did after the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union. By contrast, only nine have nukes today (the United States, Russia, Britain, France, China, India, Israel, Pakistan and North Korea).'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s often assumed that Israel would be the last nation to give up nuclear weapons, given its history and a deep sense of responsibility to protect the Jewish people after the horrors of the Holocaust. But Israel has a powerful conventional military, is allied with the strongest country in the world and its leaders have a keen appreciation of military realities. They understand that nukes pose a greater danger to small countries than large ones. Twenty nuclear weapons used on Israel would do far more overlapping damage than 20 used on Iran.'b'Small nations have always been vulnerable. In a world without nuclear weapons they would preserve themselves as they always have: by forming alliances with the powerful and avoiding antagonizing neighbors.'b'France, not Israel, would most likely be the last country to give up nuclear weapons, which help preserve its image as a world power. In a nuclear-free world, France would just be another middle-size power with great cuisine. The real value of nuclear bombs is as status symbols, not as practical weapons.'b'America and other nuclear powers must pursue the gradual abolition of nuclear weapons, but it will not be easy. Many leaders have little interest in giving up power, real or perceived. Any agreement would have to include stringent inspections and extensive safeguards. It would have to include all current nuclear-armed states in a complicated diplomatic process. But bans on other dangerous but clumsy armaments, like chemical and biological weapons, have been negotiated in the past. These bans \xe2\x80\x94 like laws \xe2\x80\x94 are sometimes broken. But the world is far safer with the bans than it would be without them.'b'As Reagan knew, nuclear weapons make the world more dangerous, not less. Imagine arming a bank guard with dynamite and a lighter and you get a good idea of nuclear weapons\xe2\x80\x99 utility: powerful, but too clumsy to use.'b'Nuclear weapons were born out of fear, nurtured in fear and sustained by fear. They are dinosaurs \xe2\x80\x94 an evolutionary dead end. The trend in warfare today is toward smaller, smarter, more effective precision-guided weapons. Nuclear weapons \xe2\x80\x94 extremely dangerous and not very useful \xe2\x80\x94 are the wave of the past.'b'YOU are the editor of a local newspaper. A reporter on your staff comes to you having obtained (by legal means) one of the following:'b'\xc2\x95 Police records of arrests for drunken driving;'b'\xc2\x95 The personal details of all the employees of local clinics that perform abortions;'b'\xc2\x95 The subscriber list of a survivalist magazine with pronounced racist overtones;'b'\xc2\x95 The names and addresses of food stamp recipients in your community;'b'\xc2\x95 The donors to a group that promotes L.G.B.T. rights;'b'\xc2\x95 The names of husbands accused of infidelity in divorce suits, along with the identities of the alleged lovers;'b'\xc2\x95 Addresses of homes where pit bulls are kept.'b'The reporter proposes to publish the names and home addresses and map them on a large graphic, all part of an article on \xe2\x80\x9cThe [drunks/abortionists/racists/poor/gays/cheats/scary dogs] next door.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some of these lists might strike you as fair game. (Many community newspapers publish D.U.I. arrests, presumably to shame the accused into driving sober.) Others probably make you uncomfortable or indignant. You might find that the tricky part is articulating why: what is the boundary between a public service and an invasion of privacy?'b'My hypothetical editor\xe2\x80\x99s choice is inspired, of course, by an unhypothetical event: the decision by The Journal News in White Plains to map the names and addresses of 33,614 handgun permit holders in two surrounding counties, for a project called \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The gun owner next door'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99ll return to that decision, but the striking thing was the volume and venom of the reader backlash: thousands of comments \xe2\x80\x94 and not only from gun owners \xe2\x80\x94 overwhelmingly outraged, some of them suggesting that Journal News journalists deserved to have their identities stolen, their homes burgled, their children taunted or, predictably, to be shot.'b'When it comes to privacy, we are all hypocrites. We howl when a newspaper publishes public records about personal behavior. At the same time, we are acquiescing in a much more sweeping erosion of our privacy \xe2\x80\x94 government surveillance, corporate data-mining, political microtargeting, hacker invasions \xe2\x80\x94 with no comparable outpouring of protest. As a society we have no coherent view of what information is worth defending and how to defend it.'b'When our privacy is invaded in the name of national security, we \xe2\x80\x94 and our elected representatives, afraid to be thought soft \xe2\x80\x94 generally go along quietly. Our complacency is reinforced by a popular culture that has forsaken Orwell\xe2\x80\x99s nightmares for a benign view of authority. In many of my own guilty-pleasure television favorites \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wire,\xe2\x80\x9d the British thriller series \xe2\x80\x9cMI-5,\xe2\x80\x9d the Danish original of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Killing,\xe2\x80\x9d the addictive \xe2\x80\x9cHomeland\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 surveillance is what the good guys do, and it saves the day.'b'Meanwhile, as Al Qaeda wanes, our surveillance state continues to grow more intrusive, with woefully little oversight or accountability.'b'Last month Julia Angwin of The Wall Street Journal disclosed that Attorney General Eric Holder had authorized the National Counterterrorism Center to copy and examine pretty much any information the government has collected about you. In the past, the agency couldn\xe2\x80\x99t store information about ordinary Americans unless they were suspects in or party to a specific investigation. Under the new orders, flight records, lists of Americans hosting foreign-exchange students, financial records of people seeking federally backed mortgages, health records of patients at veterans\xe2\x80\x99 hospitals \xe2\x80\x94 pick a database, and this obscure agency has permission to study it for patterns that ostensibly predict terrorist behavior, and to share it with foreign governments, whether or not you are suspected of any wrongdoing. The new rules were subjected to robust official debate \xe2\x80\x94 all behind closed doors.'b'Likewise, while we were all distracted by the dance on the fiscal cliff, the 112th Congress in its final days whisked through a renewal of the law that governs eavesdropping by American intelligence agencies on Americans\xe2\x80\x99 phone calls and e-mail traffic. A couple of senators made modest attempts to hold the eavesdroppers more accountable by, for example, disclosing the number of law-abiding citizens whose communications have been intercepted. Their efforts were voted down.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s position on privacy is basically \xe2\x80\x98Trust us, we\xe2\x80\x99re good guys,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d said Daniel Solove of George Washington University, whose book \xe2\x80\x9cNothing to Hide\xe2\x80\x9d challenges the myth that law-abiding citizens have nothing to fear from government snooping. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what Bush said. And it\xe2\x80\x99s also the same thing that any despot says. We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to trust.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Rigorous, independent oversight, he added, not only protects against abuses but also helps assure that what we do in the name of security actually works. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen if we don\xe2\x80\x99t demand it.'b'The government, of course, is not the only \xe2\x80\x94 not even the most aggressive \xe2\x80\x94 invader. You can take your pick of the ways Facebook and Google are monetizing you by serving up your personal profile and browsing habits to advertisers for profit. Some of this feels harmless, or even useful \xe2\x80\x94 why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t my mobile device serve me ads tailored to my interests? But some of it is flat-out creepy. One of the more obnoxious trends is the custom-targeting of that irresistibly vulnerable market, our children.'b'When our personal information is exploited this way, we may grumble, or we may seek the largely false comfort of tweaking our privacy settings, but we feel helpless before the mystifying rush of technology.'b'You would think the one sort of invasion just about everyone deplores was hacking. But even there we are ambivalent. When Rupert Murdoch\xe2\x80\x99s tabloids were caught pillaging the voice mail of celebrities, the public response was muted; when it turned out that they had hacked the phone of a 13-year-old murder victim, the pitchforks and torches came out.'b'Or take the 'b'Steubenville case'b'. In Steubenville, Ohio, authorities charged two members of the high school football team with the repeated rape of a passed-out-drunk 16-year-old, but did not charge the many others who allegedly cheered them on and made videos. So the online activists of Anonymous took it upon themselves to hack into private accounts, recover deleted and incriminating videos, and make them public.'b' Amanda Marcotte 'b'wrestled with the moral dilemma on Slate: \xe2\x80\x9cBy stepping in and holding people accountable, Anonymous stands a very good chance of taking action that actually does something to stop rape. But: This type of online vigilante justice is potentially invading the privacy of or defaming innocent Steubenville residents, and even if everything published is true, there are very serious legal limits to the Anonymous strategy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As a journalist, I\xe2\x80\x99m more often on the side of the invaders than the invaded. I cherish the freedom to publish. But the freedom to publish includes the freedom 'b'not'b' to publish when the cost outweighs the benefit.'b'Which brings me back to The Journal News and its gun project. I sympathize with the paper\xe2\x80\x99s effort to dramatize the commonplace reality of gun ownership at a time when the subject is so sadly on our minds. I don\xe2\x80\x99t buy the gun owners\xe2\x80\x99 assertion that the disclosure is an invitation to burglars in search of firearms; on the contrary, the publicity sends criminals the same message as those front-door notices of your home alarm system: Try next door. It\xe2\x80\x99s also conceivable that the attention will prompt some owners to lock up unsecured weapons.'b'But when you are going to make a sizable population of law-abiding citizens feel violated, you have to ask yourself, what is the offsetting gain? In this case, I think, not much. The information The Journal News provided its readers is so far from complete as to be misleading. The public records identify only legal handguns. They tell you nothing about the neighbor who has an equally legal and equally lethal rifle or shotgun, let alone an illegal weapon. The publication has not spurred a healthy debate; it has merely escalated a shouting match, and given the N.R.A. a new rallying cry. The outcry may even provoke state legislatures to withdraw gun databases from public records, so they will not be available when they might really be useful. It\xe2\x80\x99s a close call, but I\xe2\x80\x99d have found a different way to make the point.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'The truly incredible two-decade legacy of flawed autopsies and pro-prosecution testimony by Dr. Steven T.

When a burst stock and real estate bubble pushed Japan into recession, the policy response was too little, too late and too inconsistent.'b'To be sure, there was a lot of spending on public works, but the government, worried about debt, always pulled back before a solid recovery could get established, and by the late 1990s persistent deflation was already entrenched. In the early 2000s the Bank of Japan, the counterpart of the Federal Reserve, tried to fight deflation by printing a lot of money. But it, too, pulled back at the first hint of improvement, and the deflation never went away.'b'That said, Japan never had the kind of employment and human disaster we\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced since 2008. Indeed, our policy response has been so inadequate that I\xe2\x80\x99ve suggested that American economists who used to be very harsh in their condemnations of Japanese policy, a group that includes Ben Bernanke and, well, me, visit Tokyo to apologize to the emperor. We have, after all, done even worse.'b'And there\xe2\x80\x99s another lesson in Japan\xe2\x80\x99s experience: While getting out of a prolonged slump turns out to be very difficult, that\xe2\x80\x99s mainly because it\xe2\x80\x99s hard getting policy makers to accept the need for bold action. That is, the problem is mainly political and intellectual, rather than strictly economic. For the risks of action are much smaller than the Very Serious People want you to believe.'b'Consider, in particular, the alleged dangers of debt and deficits. Here in America, we are constantly warned that we must slash spending now now now or we\xe2\x80\x99ll turn into Greece, Greece I tell you. But Greece, a country without a currency, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look much like the United States; surely Japan offers a more relevant model. And while doomsayers keep predicting a fiscal crisis in Japan, hyping each uptick in interest rates as a sign of the imminent apocalypse, it keeps not happening: Japan\xe2\x80\x99s government can still borrow long term at a rate of less than 1 percent.'b'Enter Mr. Abe, who has been pressuring the Bank of Japan into seeking higher inflation \xe2\x80\x94 in effect, helping to inflate away part of the government\xe2\x80\x99s debt \xe2\x80\x94 and has also just announced a large new program of fiscal stimulus. How have the market gods responded?'b'The answer is, it\xe2\x80\x99s all good. Market measures of 'b'expected inflation'b', which were negative not long ago \xe2\x80\x94 the market was expecting deflation to continue \xe2\x80\x94 have now moved well into positive territory. But government borrowing costs have hardly changed at all; given the prospect of moderate inflation, this means that Japan\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal outlook has actually improved sharply. True, the foreign-exchange value of the yen has fallen considerably \xe2\x80\x94 but that\xe2\x80\x99s actually very good news, and Japanese exporters are cheering.'b'In short, Mr. Abe has thumbed his nose at orthodoxy, with excellent results.'b'Now, people who know something about Japanese politics warn me not to think of Mr. Abe as a good guy. His foreign policy, they tell me, is very bad, and his support for stimulus may have more to do with old-fashioned pork-barrel (tofu barrel?) politics than with a sophisticated rejection of conventional wisdom.'b'But none of that may matter. Whatever his motives, Mr. Abe is breaking with a bad orthodoxy. And if he succeeds, something remarkable may be about to happen: Japan, which pioneered the economics of stagnation, may also end up showing the rest of us the way out.'b'Until now, the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, has not seen a single member of his caucus dare to buck his fierce opposition to a law requiring fuller disclosure of campaign contributions. But 'b'last month'b', Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, broke through the partisan wall to propose a badly needed mandate for transparency by the growing army of unrestricted, unidentified donors who underwrite attack ads and other stealth tactics that have so disfigured American politics.'b'The measure, co-sponsored by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, would require any campaign organization spending $500 or more on federal political activity to disclose who its donors are, and to do so in \xe2\x80\x9creal time\xe2\x80\x9d at every point, from \xe2\x80\x9ccandidacy to advocacy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ms. Murkowski learned about the power of unscrupulous money the hard way in 2010 when she lost her party\xe2\x80\x99s nomination for re-election because of a last-minute flood of primary ads from the Tea Party and other activists that distorted her record. She responded by waging a difficult write-in campaign that led to 'b'her being re-elected'b' with a fresh sense of independence that has been put to good use in her campaign-disclosure proposal.'b'The measure would also require \xe2\x80\x9cjoint regulations and guidance\xe2\x80\x9d from the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission to close the legal loopholes that enable dark-money campaign operations. This is a needed prod, since the commission is stultified by the inaction of its Republican members and the I.R.S. is too slow to challenge political front groups. A prime example is the $70 million spent by Karl Rove\xe2\x80\x99s transparently political Crossroads GPS organization, which ludicrously claimed tax-exempt status under the Internal Revenue Code as a \xe2\x80\x9csocial welfare\xe2\x80\x9d activity.'b'Ms. Murkowski\xe2\x80\x99s move should be welcomed by Democrats like Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, sponsor of a worthy donor-disclosure measure that was blocked last July by blanket Republican opposition. A companion bill was just reintroduced in the House by Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, because last year\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cunprecedented secret spending\xe2\x80\x9d can only grow worse in future elections.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Catholic Education, in Need of Salvation'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Jan. 7):'b'Patrick J.

Mr. Abe\xe2\x80\x99s predecessors in the center-left Democratic Party unwisely followed a course of fiscal austerity, and paid the price for it 'b'last month'b' at the polls.'b'Mr. Abe\xe2\x80\x99s package of public-works spending (much of it to rebuild the earthquake-shattered Fukushima region), investment tax credits and more spending on education and health care could help jump start the moribund Japanese economy. Stimulus alone, however, will not be enough for long-term revival. Structural reforms will be needed \xe2\x80\x94 though it won\xe2\x80\x99t be easy for Mr. Abe\xe2\x80\x99s conservative Liberal Democratic Party to challenge established interests like rural voters and government-dependent banks. But Japan has no other choice after two decades of anemic growth, sapping the buying power of consumers and the competitiveness of its leading companies.'b'Japan\xe2\x80\x99s population is aging and shrinking. Debt-laden \xe2\x80\x9czombie\xe2\x80\x9d companies are kept alive by infusions of government credit. Too many workers are stuck in obsolete manufacturing industries and too few are available for potential growth areas like energy and health technologies. And with public debt equal to 220 percent of national output, Japan is already the world\xe2\x80\x99s most indebted major economy. The new stimulus package will provide no more than a short-term economic boost at the cost of still more government debt. Mr. Abe may well hope that a temporary boost from these measures will create enough new jobs fast enough to give his coalition the majority in the Parliament\xe2\x80\x99s upper house in elections this July. But if he wants to achieve sustainable growth as well, he needs to follow up with a package of structural reforms.'b'These should include provisions for letting zombie companies go bankrupt, phasing out costly agricultural subsidies and raising Japan\xe2\x80\x99s low rates of legal immigration to expand the working-age population. Some forward-looking steps, like expanded health care spending, are already in the stimulus package. But not enough. In 2009, reform-minded voters hoped that the center-left Democrats would carry out overdue changes. But squabbling and incompetence in that party brought only more political disappointment and economic decline. The renewed popularity of Mr. Abe\xe2\x80\x99s party could be equally short-lived unless it follows the stimulus package with lasting reforms.'b'Thanks to the fiscal cliff deal, the alternative minimum tax will not ensnare tens of millions of middle-class Americans for whom it was never intended. The deal raised the income thresholds before the A.M.T. kicks in and indexes them for inflation going forward. As a practical matter, this means that 28 million filers who would have had to pay the tax on their 2012 returns have been spared and are much less likely to have to pay the tax in the future.'b'Yet the fixes are incomplete. The purpose of the A.M.T. is to ensure that wealthy taxpayers cannot make excessive use of deductions, shelters and other tax breaks. It was supposed to hit multimillionaires and billionaires whose tax shelters reduce their tax bills to a pittance relative to their incomes. In the absence of comprehensive reform, the A.M.T. will continue, for the most part, to allow the highest-end taxpayers to escape, while still afflicting many taxpayers below those lofty levels.'b'In 2011, for instance, more than half of taxpayers in the $200,000 to $500,000 income range paid the A.M.T, compared with only one-third of taxpayers who made more than $1 million, 'b'according to'b' the Tax Policy Center. The situation will be much the same for 2012 and beyond unless Congress acts to rectify it.'b'The main problem lies in what counts as an excessive tax break. Common write-offs for dependents and for state and local taxes are counted as shelters subject to taxation under the A.M.T. Most A.M.T. payers are couples with children in the high-tax states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and California.'b'Tax breaks for dividends and capital gains, however, are not counted as shelters subject to the A.M.T. As a result, the wealthiest Americans \xe2\x80\x94 who reap the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of such investment income while enjoying the low tax rates that go with them \xe2\x80\x94 are less likely than not-so-wealthy filers to fall into the A.M.T. Income-tax rates on capital gains and dividends top out at 20 percent, compared with a top rate of 39.6 percent on salary and wages. The saving to investors is roughly 'b'$90 billion a year'b'. The upshot is that a professional couple with three children in New York City earning $250,000 is more likely to pay the A.M.T. than someone with no dependents in Florida who makes millions a year from a tax-favored stock portfolio.'b'It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t always that way. For many years after the inception of the A.M.T. in 1969, tax breaks for capital gains were included in the A.M.T. and, accordingly, most A.M.T. payers were filers who had large capital gains. But starting in the 1990s, Congress no longer required investors to report such tax breaks under the A.M.T. The omission was not an oversight. It was a deliberate policy to cut taxes for the rich that has endured to this day.'b'The inflation adjustments in the fiscal cliff deal were a fairly easy fix because they shielded a broad swath of taxpayers. A truer test of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s resolve will be its willingness to reduce the impact of everyday deductions, while adding capital gains and dividends to the system \xe2\x80\x94 further helping taxpayers for whom the A.M.T. was not intended while capturing those for whom it was.'b'It has been nearly 50 years since the Supreme Court held that the Constitution guarantees every indigent criminal defendant a right to counsel.'b'On Monday, the court will hear arguments in a Louisiana case whose outcome could determine whether that right remains robust or a state can dilute it by refusing to pay for a lawyer in a timely fashion.'b'In 'b'Boyer v. Louisiana'b', the defendant, Jonathan Boyer, spent more than seven years in the Calcasieu Parish jail, waiting to be tried for armed robbery and murder. He arrived there in 2002 and was held without bond because he was indicted on charges for which he could be sentenced to death. He stayed in that jail until 2009, when he was moved to the Louisiana State Penitentiary after being convicted of second-degree murder and armed robbery and given a life sentence.'b'During Mr. Boyer\xe2\x80\x99s first five years in jail, the case against him languished because of a \xe2\x80\x9cfunding crisis,\xe2\x80\x9d when the state provided no money to pay his lawyer or cover defense expenses. The parish had plenty of money to pay for a lawyer. But the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled that the parish could not be ordered to pay because that was the state\xe2\x80\x99s duty.'b'In 2007, the capital charges against Mr. Boyer were dropped, and a lawyer on a public contract for handling noncapital cases was appointed to represent him. By the time of the trial in 2009, seven years had passed since the original indictment, and key witnesses were no longer available. That inexcusable delay was far longer than the one-year delay the United States Supreme Court has said is \xe2\x80\x9cpresumptively prejudicial.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Nonetheless, a midlevel state appeals court ruled that there was no violation of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s speedy-trial requirement under the Sixth Amendment.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe only possible remedy\xe2\x80\x9d for this kind of violation, the Supreme Court has 'b'said'b' in earlier cases, is to set aside the conviction against the defendant and dismiss the case.

The lower probability of surviving to age 50 in the United States compared with other countries is alarming, but we need to pay attention to the good news that life expectancy is relatively high for older Americans.'b'According to the Census Bureau, over 13 percent of the American population is over 65.

Southern Weekend hit the newsstands as usual on Thursday, after protesting staff members backed down from a threatened strike. The authorities, for their part, made tacit concessions, ending pre-publication censorship by the Communist Party\xe2\x80\x99s propaganda arm in Guangdong Province and permitting greater editorial independence.'b'The episode drew worldwide attention to the problem of press freedom in China and threatened to escalate into broader protests across Chinese society. Over the past decade, standards of journalistic professionalism have risen in China, even though most news organizations are controlled, directly or indirectly, by the state. These news outlets do not challenge the basic legitimacy of Communist rule, but have raised their standards for evaluating news according to journalistic significance rather than party interests.'b'But in the last few years, amid rising social unrest, the government has intensified its efforts at \xe2\x80\x9cpreserving stability.\xe2\x80\x9d One consequence has been a dramatic increase in control of the media. As a senior commentator at Southern Weekend for six years, I experienced both the flourishing of journalistic professionalism and its decline. Although I sometimes sharply criticized the government, my standpoint was impartial and balanced rather than antagonistic, and I did my best to maintain a position of independent neutrality. Most of my colleagues at Southern Weekend took the same approach.'b'Even so, at the end of March 2011, I was forced to resign from Southern Weekend, without any warning or explanation. This was a time of heightened tensions, when the authorities worried that the democratic revolutions taking place in the Middle East and North Africa might spread to China, and cracked down on individuals seen as potentially encouraging unrest. The pressure on commentators like me followed a similar crackdown on investigative reporting, much of which had been devoted to exposing corruption and had threatened special interest groups that are influential in elite Chinese politics.'b'Investigative reporting and opinion commentary are the two hallmarks of Chinese journalism, and the party has moved to crack down on both. My departure from Southern Weekend came as the editors capitulated to government pressure and quickly constrained the space for open discourse. Former colleagues have told me that since my departure, Southern Weekly\xe2\x80\x99s journalists find themselves walking a tightrope with every sentence they write.'b'This state of affairs came to a climax last May, when Tuo Zhen became head of party propaganda in Guangdong, China\xe2\x80\x99s most populous province. He enforced his power to the extreme and without an iota of flexibility, and micromanaged every aspect of media operations. Major topics of news coverage had to be approved by him, as did important articles, especially opinion essays. He even ordered changes in punctuation.'b'He was in fact a tyrant who cracked down on the press as zealously as Wang Lijun, the former police chief in the city of Chongqing, had cracked down on criminals without due process. Under Mr. Tuo, the press in Guangdong retreated into its darkest period since the start of Deng Xiaoping\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creform and opening up\xe2\x80\x9d policies in the late 1970s. Southern Weekend, a symbol of news professionalism because of its relative independence, bore the brunt of Mr. Tuo\xe2\x80\x99s attacks.'b'The run-up to the 18th 'b'Communist Party Congress'b' in November was accompanied by the most oppressive social atmosphere of the past decade. The flare-up at Southern Weekend, over an editorial that had called for greater respect for constitutional rights until it was changed by censors, was the culmination of rancor that had been building for a long time.'b'The crisis has subsided, but there is little room for future optimism, because the deep-seated question has not been resolved: Is there, in fact, room for professional journalism to survive and develop within the system? It is on this question that not only journalists but Chinese in every sector of society have expressed doubt and exasperation. The repression of journalistic professionalism is not merely a journalistic issue, but also signifies the government\xe2\x80\x99s assault on society in general, and has exceeded the limits of public tolerance.'b'The fate of journalistic independence in China will depend on whether the authorities implement or backtrack on their tacit concessions. Public vigilance is essential if progress is to occur.'b'Does the political system have the flexibility to tolerate the professionalism pursued by journalists, and the press freedom demanded by society at large? How much will the new party leadership make good on its commitment to governance reforms and adherence to the Constitution? The Southern Weekend episode does not provide a clear answer.'b'Any sign of progress is worth encouraging, but rather than shedding tears of gratitude for promises that may prove empty, the Chinese people need to keep their shoulders to the plow and continue their own efforts to create the society they wish to live in.'b'SANTA FE, N.M.'b'FRENCH airstrikes that began on Friday have stopped, for now, a network of terrorists, criminals and religious extremists from taking over Mali. Until the French stepped in, the near-collapse of the military had threatened to turn Mali, a landlocked, desperately poor country, into a desert stronghold for jihadists.'b'America, which has spent more than $500 million over the last four years to keep Islamist militants at bay in West Africa, has its hands full in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Egypt and Libya, among other places, but it is in our national interest to support the French. North African countries, in particular Algeria, must also help save Mali from catastrophe.'b'This conflict is not like other African wars that had only marginal effects on the West. The Islamists in Mali have linked up with Boko Haram, the Nigerian militant group that 'b'blew up United Nations offices in Abuja'b' in 2011, and with Ansar al-Shariah, which is thought to be responsible for the murders last September of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans in Benghazi, Libya.'b'The French aerial attacks have stopped the Islamists \xe2\x80\x94 including Al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb, its offshoot the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa, and Ansar Dine, a group of Tuareg rebels from the north \xe2\x80\x94 from seizing an airport and river port, and marching on the capital, Bamako. But the militants are reconstituting and rearming in their northern desert stronghold.'b'The United States need not put combat troops on the ground. Instead, we should provide intelligence, equipment, financing and training for a West African intervention force that the United Nations Security Council approved in December (but did not finance). The French will not be able to depart quickly \xe2\x80\x94 even if the West African force is assembled, France will have to mentor and coordinate troops from its former colonies like Mauritania, Niger and Chad.'b'International cooperation has been effective against Al-Shabab, a Qaeda affiliate in Somalia, and it can succeed in Mali. In Somalia, American troops and contractors trained and equipped African Union troops, including soldiers from Uganda and Burundi. Together with a new Somali army, they pushed Shabab terrorists out of Mogadishu and much of southern Somalia last year.'b'North Africa, not West Africa, is the key to saving Mali. One proposal, to have Nigeria lead a coalition of West African forces in Mali, has little chance of success; Nigeria lacks the capacity to fight a guerrilla war or an urban war. It has English-speaking Christian troops who might exacerbate Mali\xe2\x80\x99s ethnic and religious tensions, and its heavy-handed attempts to counter its own Boko Haram extremists have so far failed.'b'Algeria is the only country on the continent with the military capacity, seasoned officers, counterterrorism experience and geographic proximity to take over from France in bringing peace to Mali. Algeria\xe2\x80\x99s military leaders know the extremists\xe2\x80\x99 tactics and their leaders. It defeated them in a civil war that lasted from 1991 to 2002 and resulted in extremists\xe2\x80\x99 setting up terrorist operations in northern Mali. Algeria has a moral responsibility to act, but if it continues to stay on the sidelines, then Morocco or another North African country should take the lead \xe2\x80\x94 with support from Niger, Mauritania, Mali and Chad, which, like Algeria, have been fighting Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb for the past eight years.'b'Algeria is also essential to ending the rebellion of the nomadic Tuareg, who are culturally, ethnically and linguistically North African and resist the rule of the sub-Saharan ethnic groups that run Mali. Their rebellion began in late 2011, when Tuareg fighters who had fought in Libya alongside its deposed ruler, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, returned home. They joined with Islamist militants who had moved in to northern Mali from Algeria, but the Islamists then turned on many of the Tuaregs and consolidated power.'b'Algeria has negotiated the peace during past Tuareg rebellions in northern Mali and can do so again. The key to peace in Mali is to first defeat the Islamist insurgents and then for Bamako to negotiate autonomy for the northern nomads \xe2\x80\x94 who, in concert with the African peacekeepers, will be responsible for their defense. The arrangement might look something like that of Somaliland, a region of northern Somalia that has held democratic elections, maintained peace and become a de facto sovereign state.'b'Mali\xe2\x80\x99s army has never effectively controlled the region north of the Niger River; its troops fear the warlike nomads. A tribal chief in northern Mali once told me, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to control the Sahara, you will have to work with us. We have been masters of the desert for thousands of years and we will continue to rule here.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Years of training by United States Special Forces did not stop the Malian military from fleeing when the Islamist insurgency started last January. In fact, the military exacerbated the chaos by overthrowing Mali\xe2\x80\x99s democratically elected government last March.'b'Reconstituting Mali\xe2\x80\x99s broken government and discredited military will take years, but making sure that Mali doesn\xe2\x80\x99t become a launchpad for terrorism is an even greater priority. France has begun to exercise leadership; the United States must not dither in doing its share.'b'IN 2005, after the world failed to prevent mass atrocities in Rwanda, the Balkans and Darfur, the 'b'United Nations'b' declared that nations had a responsibility to protect populations everywhere from 'b'genocide'b', war crimes and crimes against humanity.'b'It is a fine idea, but not easy to implement, especially in Africa. There, frail democracies too often fall victim to corruption, social division, greed and dictatorship. So there, especially, the world needs to add another \xe2\x80\x9cresponsibility to protect\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a duty of democratic nations to safeguard popular rule in neighboring lands. Too often, a failure of democracy is what starts a country down the road to atrocities.'b'\xc2\xa0The failure this year to protect and 'b'restore democracy in Mali'b' is a perfect case in point. Less than a year after a coup last March, Mali has slid into a devilish civil war and national breakup accompanied by reports of war crimes, atrocities and crimes against humanity. The coup did not cause the current rebellion in the north, but it allowed it to succeed, with hundreds of thousands of people forced to leave their homes. In addition, more than 4.6 million people are at risk of running out of food when the war and drought are both taken into account, the United Nations has said.'b'Last summer, 'b'Human Rights Watch'b' was reporting \xe2\x80\x9cthe use and recruitment of child soldiers, looting and the pillaging of hospitals, schools, aid agencies ... public floggings and amputation ... rape and abduction of girls and women.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'Amnesty International'b' was urging he International Criminal Court to investigate \xe2\x80\x9ckillings, rapes and torture and other possible crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d But the world, and the region, kept dithering until the rebels who had seized the mostly Arab north seemed about to expand their reach into the sub-Saharan south.'b'That finally brought a direct response from France last week, and a sudden new interest by Western nations in implementing, at last, a regional West African military intervention against the rebels. In fact, the 15 countries in the Economic Community of West African States, along with the African Union, had been seeking permission to intervene since early last summer, but a major stumbling block was the coup leaders\xe2\x80\x99 fear that the foreign military forces might undermine their own firm grip on the country; in the face of this, the decision-making process of the United Nations Security Council moved at a crawl. The picture might have been different had Mali\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors intervened more decisively against the coup in the first place. At this time last winter, Mali was widely admired as a successful democracy. But then heavily armed fighters from North Africa\xe2\x80\x99s nomadic Tuareg group, having failed to keep Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in power in Libya, crossed into the Arab northern half of Mali and joined forces with Islamist rebels, some of them from Algeria. It became clear within weeks that they were outperforming Mali\xe2\x80\x99s army.'b'But rather than focus the army\xe2\x80\x99s efforts more effectively against the rebels, and perhaps appeal for outside aid, Capt. Amadou Sanogo and other military officers turned their forces against Mali\xe2\x80\x99s elected president, Amadou Toumani Tour\xc3\xa9, and seized power, blaming the civilian leaders for Mali\xe2\x80\x99s weakness.'b'Mali\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors condemned the coup and suspended aid. But after a month \xe2\x80\x94 which would have been a good moment to restore the constitutional order \xe2\x80\x94 they foolishly agreed to negotiate with Captain Sanogo, rather than insist that he quit power and leave the country until peace and democracy were restored. After that, the Security Council frittered away the summer, saying it needed more information before it would grant African nations a mandate to intervene militarily.'b'The hesitation only emboldened the rebels. While Captain Sanogo agreed under pressure to the appointment of an interim government and started a wave of repression against his political opponents, the rebels conquered the northern half of Mali and declared it independent. Reports of inhuman applications of Shariah law, like amputations as punishment for theft, followed, continuing into the fall and winter.'b'So now, from their failure to protect democracy in Mali, the West African nations, and with them the West, have reaped a heavier responsibility \xe2\x80\x94 the duty, laid out by the United Nations at a global summit meeting in 2005, to protect \xe2\x80\x9cpopulations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.\xe2\x80\x9d The task is far more complicated than it would have been last spring. Under international pressure for change, Mali acquired new civilian leaders, but leaders of the coup were involved in the selection process, and the new government cannot be said to have been elected freely and democratically. And yet, the first task ahead of all of Mali now, and of those from outside who would help it, is not the restoration of democracy but primarily the restoration of Mali itself \xe2\x80\x94 its central state authority and territorial integrity. First the rebels must be driven from control in the north; only then can the country start a truly democratic process, in which all citizens of Mali can choose their next leaders in free, fair and internationally supervised elections.'b'In fact, Mali is not the first African country in which a failure to protect the constitutional order or quickly restore an overthrown democracy opened a path for grave atrocities. In Kenya, a disputed election in 2007 was followed by violence in which more than 1,000 people were reported to have died and 500,000 others were displaced. In Guinea, a coup in 2009 was followed by the killing of more than 150 opponents of the junta. In Ivory Coast, Laurent Gbagbo refused to relinquish the presidency in 2010 after losing an election; mass atrocities followed. It took a civil war to dislodge him the following spring. Finally, late in 2011, he was turned over to the International Criminal Court to be tried for crimes against humanity.'b'So, how can the concept of responsibility to protect democracy be further developed?'b'Where institutions and traditions prove no match for a crisis of democracy, the region or the continent should step in. The African Union\xe2\x80\x99s charter already empowers that organization to intervene to prevent war crimes and genocide, and it condemns \xe2\x80\x9cunconstitutional changes of government.\xe2\x80\x9d Such ideals need to be invoked boldly and quickly; that may be the strongest argument for a new doctrine of a responsibility to protect democracy, with a protocol for military or other forms of firm coercion when diplomacy fails.'b'Member states will not always agree on when to intervene, of course. But having a clear responsibility to do so in extreme cases would make prompt action more likely, by adding a sense of urgency. And it would help the United Nations Security Council play its own important role \xe2\x80\x94 by bringing the five permanent members into unison to avoid blocking or delaying a lifesaving intervention.'b'In addition, the International Criminal Court should announce that it will seek to punish all those responsible for any coup d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9tat that results in war crimes or crimes against humanity. In Mali and across Africa, the evidence shows that a failure of democracy is all too likely to lead quickly to such crimes.'b'DENVER'b'Colorado is going to pot. It\xe2\x80\x99s just having a tough time figuring out how.'b'Although an Election Day referendum legalized marijuana for recreational use, it left questions unanswered. Like: how high can you be behind the wheel of a car? Lawmakers are debating a specific blood level, as with alcohol, above which a motorist is deemed an uneasy rider.'b'In a restaurant or private club, might the dessert choices someday include an upscale riff on the pot brownie and a double entendre of a pot de cr\xc3\xa8me? One lawyer I spoke with lofted this possibility, but who knows. State officials still have many months to draft regulations for recreational pot\xe2\x80\x99s retail sale, which should begin next January. The new law has already made recreational possession O.K.'b'Certainly, there will be a bigger workload for Denver\xe2\x80\x99s Craig Claiborne of cannabis, who began 'b'reviewing Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s medical marijuana dispensaries'b' for the alternative newspaper Westword in 2009. Last month the critic, who writes under the pseudonym William Breathes, added a 'b'weekly advice column'b' called \xe2\x80\x9cAsk a Stoner.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For a while now, Colorado has been deeper in the weed than most other states. It permitted medical marijuana in 2000, and at dispensaries, of which there are now hundreds, a person with physician approval can choose among a dozen or more strains of pot, which vary in strength, hue, fragrance. A dispensary named 'b'Denver Relief'b' stocks Durban Poison, which promises a fruity aroma \xe2\x80\x9cwith undertones of milk chocolate,\xe2\x80\x9d and ChemDawgD, with its \xe2\x80\x9cstrong smell of Pine-Sol and jet fuel.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There are different delivery systems as well. If a patient doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like to smoke, he or she can try 'b'marijuana cola'b', marijuana baklava, 'b'marijuana bath salts'b'.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe baklava is excellent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Breathes, who has a stomach condition for which he got a medical marijuana card. (The card has his real name; his nom de plume protects him from exposure when he presents it.)'b'But the referendum puts Colorado, along with the state of Washington, whose voters also opened the door to bong hits purely for pleasure, on new legal terrain.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis will be a complicated process,\xe2\x80\x9d announced Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper shortly after the referendum passed. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t 'b'break out the Cheetos'b' or Goldfish too quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'These were the words of a man who had inhaled in the past \xe2\x80\x94 he admits as much, though he says it was 15 years ago \xe2\x80\x94 and seems to know something about the munchies. And they pointed to another interesting wrinkle of the Colorado story: the marijuana muddle will be tackled by a politician who rose to local prominence in the 'b'intoxication business'b', as the owner of popular 'b'brewpubs'b'.'b'When I caught up with him here recently, he volunteered that a paleontologist with whom he\xe2\x80\x99s friendly believes that cannabis and hops, which are flowers used to make beer, have a shared horticultural ancestry.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you take hops, and you grind them up in your fingers, they smell just like what I\xe2\x80\x99m told marijuana smells like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hickenlooper, who is 60.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat was a joke,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, meaning the \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m told\xe2\x80\x9d part.'b'He actually opposed Amendment 64, the measure that legalized recreational pot, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t greet its passage with reefer gladness. Although it applies only to adults, he worries that kids will feel emboldened and that frequent marijuana use could hurt them.'b'I shadowed him for a few days, including to Colorado Springs, where he disappeared into a meeting with a local newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s editorial board. More of the questions he was asked touched on marijuana than on gun control, an aide said.'b'The next morning I arrived midway through a Q. and A. that he did with the Colorado Springs Regional Business Alliance, and what do you suppose he was discussing? Pot.'b'The alarm is confusing. For many years in many places, pot has been prevalent and its casual use often overlooked. Enforcement of laws against possession has been uneven, to a point where New York leaders 'b'want to move away'b' from small-scale pot arrests.'b'Presidential candidates have felt free to allude or own up to past marijuana use. So why all the hand wringing over pot\xe2\x80\x99s legalization, when its illegality isn\xe2\x80\x99t always taken seriously? If we have a problem with pot, we sure haven\xe2\x80\x99t behaved that way.'b'Colorado and Washington aren\xe2\x80\x99t being experimental so much as honest. They\xe2\x80\x99re acknowledging reality, and giving people the same chance with pot as with alcohol: to use it responsibly \xe2\x80\x94 or not. They\xe2\x80\x99ll also pick up some tax revenue in the process.'b'And perhaps Breathes will need a co-critic. Patricia Calhoun, the editor of Westword, told me she gets applications. But, she added, they\xe2\x80\x99re responses to the initial announcement she posted more than three years ago.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of potheads don\xe2\x80\x99t move very fast,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'The next few weeks represent a once-in-a-generation opportunity to harden the nation\xe2\x80\x99s gun laws and reduce the threat of rapid-fire violence in America. A month after 'b'the slaughter of 20 children'b' and seven adults in Newtown, Conn., Vice President Joseph Biden Jr.\xe2\x80\x99s commission 'b'is about to present a series of recommendations for new laws'b', and it is vital that his panel gets it right and that Congress immediately takes action on its report.'b'Federal laws on guns have been kept so lax, for so long, that the Biden panel could suggest scores of ways to improve public safety. But there are a few policies that clearly have to be in any serious legislative package, the first two of which were endorsed on Monday by President Obama: requiring criminal and mental-health background checks on every gun buyer, including sales from individuals; a ban on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines; a strong statute prohibiting gun trafficking; and an end to the hobbling of the federal agency that enforces gun laws.'b'The need for background checks on every gun buyer has never been greater, now that the Internet has made it easy for private individuals to buy and sell guns without screening. The reason that both the 'b'Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence'b' and 'b'Mayors Against Illegal Guns'b' have made universal background checks their top priority is that 40 percent of gun sales now take place privately, including most guns that are later used in crimes.'b'Requiring background checks at gun shows, parking-lot sales and Web sites would reduce the cash-and-carry anonymity of millions of gun transactions, putting buyers on notice that their sale is being recorded and can be traced. It is largely supported by legitimate gun dealers, who already have to conduct the checks and have long grumbled about competition from those who do not. And it would have no effect on law-abiding buyers who want a hunting rifle or a handgun to keep at home.'b'Such a law should be supplemented by a presidential order requiring federal and state agencies to contribute to the background check system with criminal and mental health information. Federal prosecutors, who have a dismal record of pursuing charges against those who lie on a gun application, need to enforce the system vigorously.'b'The assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 should be renewed and tightened, with a special emphasis on prohibiting magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. The millions who already own such weapons \xe2\x80\x94 unnecessary for hunting or protection \xe2\x80\x94 should be required to register them and submit to a background check to reduce the mass killing that produced this agonized debate.'b'A new law is needed to crack down on the trafficking of guns that an individual has reason to know will be used in a crime, increasing penalties and making it easier to track corrupt gun dealers. The 'b'Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives'b' needs to have a permanent director, more financing and expanded authority to inspect dealers, and an end to restrictions that keep it from tracking all gun sales and retaining background-check data. Some lawmakers are already talking about focusing on the background checks and bowing to gun lobby\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to an assault weapons ban. That shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop the administration and its allies from demanding that all these provisions be passed immediately. With the deaths of Newtown\xe2\x80\x99s children still so fresh, the public will be repulsed by lawmakers who stand aside and do nothing.'b'As Americans scramble to find dwindling supplies of flu vaccine, there are signs that this flu season, the worst in recent years, 'b'may be starting to wane'b', according to federal health officials.'b'In a typical flu season, hundreds of thousands go to the hospital and thousands die from flu-related complications. Although 47 states have reported that influenza cases are widespread, there are some indications that the situation is improving. The outbreaks started in the South and Southeast and may have passed their peak in those states. The number of states reporting high proportions of outpatient visits for flulike illness has dropped over the past week, though California and other Western states are bracing for more cases as the virus moves westward.'b'New York City health officials said last week that flu-related illnesses had reached epidemic levels, and 'b'Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state public health emergency'b' to cope with \xe2\x80\x9cthe worst flu season since at least 2009.\xe2\x80\x9d He said that some 19,000 cases had been reported so far. Last year 4,400 cases were confirmed by laboratory tests.'b'The vaccines available for the strains of flu this year are deemed moderately effective; 'b'they can prevent flu cases'b' severe enough to require a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s visit about 62 percent of the time, roughly the same as in previous years. The vaccines provide no protection against other viruses that are circulating simultaneously, such as a new form of norovirus and a severe outbreak of whooping cough.'b'Some shortages of vaccine have been reported around the country, but diligent searchers may be able to find some because the number of people seeking vaccines may be smaller than the remaining supplies. The lesson for future years is to get your shot early.'b'Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey 'b'made an impassioned pitch on Monday'b' to his fellow Republicans in the House of Representatives 'b'to vote on Tuesday'b' for almost $50 billion in Hurricane Sandy disaster relief. \xe2\x80\x9cNew Jersey does not expect anything more than what was done for Louisiana and Alabama and Mississippi in Katrina, and what was done in Joplin, Mo., what was done in the floods in Iowa. We don\xe2\x80\x99t expect anything more than that, but we will not accept anything less,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Christie said.'b'It is now more than 11 weeks after the hurricane severely damaged a huge swath of New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, yet these states are still waiting for enough federal aid to repair and rebuild housing, businesses and transportation systems that were destroyed by the storm.'b'After 'b'the Senate approved more than $60.4 billion'b' in aid for the battered region in December, Speaker John Boehner and his Republicans in the House balked. 'b'They approved only $9.7 billion'b', mostly for flood insurance. On Tuesday, the House is expected to approve a smaller package of $17 billion that barely covers basic needs like temporary housing. A second vote on the remainder of the aid \xe2\x80\x94 a $33.7 billion package drafted by Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, a New Jersey Republican, that would address major issues like rebuilding transportation systems and repairing flood control facilities \xe2\x80\x94 is also expected late Tuesday.'b'Northeast Republicans were told on Monday that there might be as many as 15 amendments to reach the House floor, which would mean at least 15 chances to cut the financing or make the package unacceptable to the Senate. For Republicans refusing to help Sandy victims, it is worth remembering that disasters are not confined to one region of the country. Those who vote against aid now may well find their constituents desperate for assistance sometime soon.'b'France\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'initial airstrikes'b' have, so far, failed to halt the southward advance of Islamist rebels in Mali. Containing these militias, which are sheltering international terrorist groups, and the threat they pose to West Africa and the wider world is essential. But President Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande should resist beginning a ground assault, which would almost certainly turn into a protracted counterinsurgency campaign that France should not take on and cannot afford.'b'The challenge of dislodging the rebels from the northern zone must remain with Mali\xe2\x80\x99s Army and its West African allies. France, 'b'along with the United States'b' and others, should intensify efforts to prepare them for this fight, as authorized by a United Nations Security Council resolution last month. The resolution set a timetable for an African ground force to be deployed by this fall, but, given the current fighting, that may need to be accelerated.'b'Until the Malian forces are able to retake the north, bloodthirsty militias like Ansar Dine and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb will continue terrorizing the people of that region with punishments like amputation and stoning. They seized power in the vast desert region the size of France last June after Mali\xe2\x80\x99s American-trained Army overthrew the democratically elected government and threw the country into chaos.'b'Yet it is this same Malian Army, with military help from West African neighbors like Nigeria, Niger and Mauritania, and training, weapons and logistical support from France, the United States and others, that will have to assume responsibility for reintegrating the north.'b'American military training programs have had an unhappy history in Mali, 'b'as reported in The Times'b' on Monday. Years of effort, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, turned to disaster when American-trained units defected with their weapons and joined an ethnic Tuareg rebellion that preceded the Islamist takeover. One American-trained Malian officer who did not defect led the coup that overthrew President Amadou Toumani Tour\xc3\xa9 last March, further weakening the country\xe2\x80\x99s defenses. Mali\xe2\x80\x99s Army has also been cited by human rights groups for torturing detainees.'b'The Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s top commander for Africa, Gen. Carter Ham, acknowledges that the actions of Mali\xe2\x80\x99s Army last spring were \xe2\x80\x9cwholly unacceptable.\xe2\x80\x9d The lessons of this debacle must be absorbed and perhaps applied elsewhere as well.'b'Still, this is no time to walk away from Mali. American training programs there should be strengthened, with greater emphasis on human rights and civilian supremacy. In the meantime, France\xe2\x80\x99s airstrikes, responding to urgent pleas from Mali\xe2\x80\x99s government, make sense. But they are no substitute for what Mali must now do for itself.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s been five days since 'b'Jessica Silver-Greenberg\xe2\x80\x99s article'b' on the latest bank settlement was posted on The New York Times\xe2\x80\x99s Web site. I\xe2\x80\x99m still shaking my head. Her \xe2\x80\x9cstory behind the story\xe2\x80\x9d of the $8.5 billion settlement between federal bank regulators and 10 banks over their foreclosure misdeeds illustrates just about everything that is wrong with the way the government has handled the Great Foreclosure Crisis.'b'Shall we count the ways?'b'1. 'b'It is more about public relations than problem-solving.'b' Pick a program \xe2\x80\x94 any program \xe2\x80\x94 that the Obama administration unveiled to help troubled homeowners over the past four years. Not one has amounted to a hill of beans.'b'This settlement is no different. The country\xe2\x80\x99s primary bank regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency \xe2\x80\x94 which, along with the Federal Reserve, engineered the settlement \xe2\x80\x94 is trying to make it look like a victory. Of the $8.5 billion, $3.3 billion will go directly to foreclosed-upon borrowers, making it \xe2\x80\x9cthe largest cash payout to date,\xe2\x80\x9d according to Bryan Hubbard, the O.C.C.\xe2\x80\x99s chief spinmeister. (The rest of the money will consist of reduced interest payments and loan modifications.)'b'In truth, the O.C.C. needed to save face after a foreclosure review process it had mandated had become an expensive fiasco. As amply demonstrated by Silver-Greenberg and 'b'American Banker'b', the government insisted that the banks hire expensive consultants to do a review of every foreclosure that took place in 2009 and 2010. The consultants racked up more than $1 billion in fees, while proceeding at such a molasseslike pace that the feds and the banks finally threw up their hands. The settlement made the whole thing go away.'b'2. 'b'Accountability? What\xe2\x80\x99s that?'b' We have known for a long time that overwhelmed bank servicers took shortcuts, like robo-signing, that violated many state laws. They also put people through hell who were trying to get a modified mortgage. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen marriages break up because of what banks put families through,\xe2\x80\x9d says Elizabeth Lynch of MFY Legal Services. All this settlement does is push those misdeeds under an $8.5 billion rug.'b'3. 'b'It won\xe2\x80\x99t actually help anybody.'b' The settlement will cover some 3.8 million foreclosures. The government is going to distribute $3.3 billion dollars. It comes to around $868 per lost home.'b'Of course, the O.C.C. says that is the wrong way to look at it: Some people \xe2\x80\x94 military personnel, for instance \xe2\x80\x94 could get as much as $125,000 while others won\xe2\x80\x99t get much at all. People denied a modification will be eligible for up to $40,000 or $50,000, said Hubbard. I have no doubt that money will be welcome. But for those who lost their homes because of bank misconduct, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come close to making them whole.'b'4. 'b'The money is being distributed with no regard to whether a borrower suffered harm.'b' In some ways, this is the sorriest part of the whole episode. The foreclosure review never answered the key question: which borrowers had legitimate claims against their bank and which didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Thus, the settlement doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make that distinction. If you lost your house in 2009 and 2010, you are going to get money \xe2\x80\x94 whether the bank was culpable or not. \xe2\x80\x9cThe notion of error is not involved in this settlement,\xe2\x80\x9d conceded Hubbard.'b'As a result, those who really were truly harmed by bank behavior will be shortchanged. As Karen Petrou, the well-known banking consultant, puts it, the government has \xe2\x80\x9ccome up with something that gives every borrower \xe2\x80\x94 maybe \xe2\x80\x94 a pittance and leaves the truly hurt \xe2\x80\x94 and there were many \xe2\x80\x94 as much in the lurch as before.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is hardly the only time in recent months that a settlement that is publicized as righting a wrong instead hands money to people who were never victimized. Think back to 'b'the $4.3 billion fund'b' established by Congress to compensate people who became sick because of their exposure to toxic dust created by the 9/11 attacks. Even though 'b'there is no scientific evidence'b' that the dust caused cancer, the government added cancer to the list of diseases that would be compensated. The result will be less money for those who truly did become sick because of their exposure to the 9/11 aftermath.'b'Or take Toyota, which 'b'recently paid $1 billion to settle a lawsuit'b' claiming that an electrical flaw caused some accelerators to stick \xe2\x80\x94 even though there turned out to be no evidence to support that claim.'b'People who do these kinds of settlements regularly say that the world has become so complicated that, more often than not, it is simply too expensive to figure out who was harmed and who was not. So best just to throw a little money at everybody and make the problem go away.'b'That is what the federal government did last week in its settlement with the banks. It\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be proud of.'b'In China\xe2\x80\x99s capital, a thick smog caused by air pollution is alarming citizens.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'The United States lags behind most of the world\xe2\x80\x99s developed nations in rankings of the best places for mothers, especially working mothers. One reason is that the careers of many Americans demand schedules incompatible with the requirements of parenthood. Having no available middle ground, some primary caregivers (mostly mothers) leave their careers. If they do later return, they nearly always do so at salaries and positions well behind peers who did not interrupt their careers.'b'This problem can\xe2\x80\x99t be remedied simply by extending maternity and paternity leaves. Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and France have shown us a solution. By law, employers there cannot unreasonably refuse an employee\xe2\x80\x99s request for a part-time or nonstandard schedule. Employers in Britain must \xe2\x80\x9cseriously consider\xe2\x80\x9d such requests, and not discriminate against those who ask. As their needs change, employees can also seek to return to full time.'b'Legislation modeled after the modest British law and introduced six years ago by Representative Carolyn Maloney, with co-sponsorship by Senators Barack Obama, Edward M. Kennedy and Hillary Rodham Clinton, is stalled in Congress. By increasing access to part-time schedules, the 'b'Working Families Flexibility Act'b' would end or diminish the practice of assigning less important work to part-time workers and lessen their career stigma. Full-time workers taking reduced schedules might create jobs for those unemployed.'b'Workplace flexibility is not just for the benefit of parents. Significant numbers of men and women would gladly reduce their hours and pay to have more time for other pursuits. (Improving the circumstances of unskilled workers involuntarily on unpredictable part-time schedules is an important but different concern.)'b'More than a century ago, the labor movement introduced the then radical 40-hour workweek and the vacation to improve Americans\xe2\x80\x99 lives. Passage of the Working Families Flexibility Act by Congress would be another important step.'b'ROBERT WARING'b'\nRedwood City, Calif., Jan. 14, 2013'b''b''b'The writer is the author of \xe2\x80\x9cUpside Down: The Paradoxes of Gender in the Twenty-First Century.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b''b'\n'b'Editors\xe2\x80\x99 Note: 'b''b''b'We invite readers to respond by Thursday for the Sunday Dialogue. We plan to publish responses and Mr. Waring\xe2\x80\x99s rejoinder in the Sunday Review. E-mail: 'b'letters@nytimes.com'b''b''b'FRESNO, Calif.'b'FOR many people, the most interesting thing about last weekend\xe2\x80\x99s winner of the Miss America Pageant, 'b'Mallory Hagan'b', is that she lives in Brooklyn. It seemed so incongruous: a beauty queen from the epicenter of all things ironic and progressive. Newspapers have hailed her as the city\xe2\x80\x99s first winner since Bess Myerson took the crown in 1945.'b'But, in fact, Ms. Hagan, who won the state crown in June, is not the New Yorker reporters have made her out to be. Born in Tennessee and raised in Alabama, she 'b'moved to the borough'b' only a few years ago, to attend school.'b'And that, for me at least, is the more interesting part \xe2\x80\x94 and not only because I am the daughter of the 1961 Soil Conservation Queen of Marion and Cass Counties, Tex. Next to winning college football titles, beauty contests seem to be something young Southerners do particularly well. \xe2\x80\x9cThe modern Southern belle,\xe2\x80\x9d the sportswriter Frank Deford once said, has \xe2\x80\x9clong been the Pageant ideal.\xe2\x80\x9d But why?'b'From 1921, when the contest began in Atlantic City, through World War II, only one woman representing a former Confederate state won the competition. Then, beginning in 1947, when a woman from Memphis earned the top honor, the fortunes of Southern contestants rose precipitously. From 1950 to 1963, seven southerners were crowned (each served the following year), including back-to-back wins by Mississippians in 1958 and 1959 \xe2\x80\x94 though southerners made up only one-fifth of the possible winners.'b'These were, of course, the years when black Southerners opened a full-scale campaign against Jim Crow, prompting a bitter backlash by white Southerners. White resistance began in earnest in 1954, when the Supreme Court issued Brown v. Board of Education, its decision to desegregate public schools.'b'This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a coincidence. Images of white Southerners spitting on black students, and news of white lynch mobs killing children like Emmett Till, shocked the world. Other whites, many of them pro-segregation themselves but fearful of the national reaction brought on by anti-civil rights violence, understood that Southern beauty queens could serve as persuasive public relations agents, a genteel veneer to cover up the region\xe2\x80\x99s unsavory behavior.'b'It is impossible to overstate the effect of the positive press both Miss Americas from Mississippi, Mary Ann Mobley and Lynda Mead, garnered for their state. An editor of a small-town Mississippi newspaper came to this conclusion during a 1959 trip to New York City, where an acquaintance told him that the state\xe2\x80\x99s first Miss America was \xe2\x80\x9cworth millions in good value to Mississippi.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At times, this good-will campaign sounded more like outright defiance. On a homecoming tour to Jackson, Miss., Ms. Mead announced that she had never apologized for her state. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have nothing to apologize for.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Southern Miss Americas also symbolized what was at stake in the battle over desegregation: the possibility of interracial sex. Their scantily clad bodies splashed across newspapers nationwide, young white women were the Southerners who would supposedly suffer most if schools were integrated. They would become vulnerable to black men in other public facilities as well, especially 'b'swimming pools'b'. Indeed, precisely because they were \xe2\x80\x9cmore sensitive than schools,\xe2\x80\x9d a judge upheld the segregation of Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s municipal pools in 1954.'b'The Southern Miss Americas of the 1950s and \xe2\x80\x9960s embodied the Southern \xe2\x80\x9cway of life\xe2\x80\x9d and justified its defense, however strident. \xe2\x80\x9cThe winner always carries the ideals of her city and state throughout the world,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss South Carolina, Marian McKnight, announced during the 1956 finals (she won the crown). She added that those of her home state were \xe2\x80\x9cthe finest ideals there are.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It makes sense that white Southerners would celebrate these ideals, but the rest of the nation was also complicit in the South\xe2\x80\x99s Miss America reign. After all, the region\xe2\x80\x99s strong showing at the pageant post-Brown coincided with the contest\xe2\x80\x99s television debut, and during much of this period, the Miss America Pageant annually rated as the first- or second-most-popular show on television. In the national racial tumult of the 1950s and \xe2\x80\x9960s, it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that Americans in California and Illinois were happy to see pretty white faces on their TV screens, too.'b'Southern women\xe2\x80\x99s dominance at the pageant waned once the years of the civil rights movement were over. Still, contestants from Dixie continued to do well, winning a third of the titles in the three decades after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.'b'Of course, the racial overtones, so obvious at the time, have faded. Kimberly Aiken, an African-American from South Carolina, was crowned in 1993. (The first black Miss America was Vanessa Williams of New York, who won 10 years earlier, though she was later stripped of the title.) And there can be no doubt that Ms. Hagan is herself far removed from the divisive politics of decades past. Still, we would do well to remember the troubling historical links between Southern beauty queens and racial politics, even when the winner lives in Brooklyn.'b'TEMPE, Ariz.'b'TO our great peril, the scientific community has had little success in recent years influencing policy on global security. Perhaps this is because the best scientists today are not directly responsible for the very weapons that threaten our safety, and are therefore no longer the high priests of destruction, to be consulted as oracles as they were after World War II.'b'The problems scientists confront today are actually much harder than they were at the dawn of the nuclear age, and their successes more heartily earned. This is why it is so distressing that even Stephen Hawking, perhaps the world\xe2\x80\x99s most famous living scientist, gets more attention for his views on space aliens than his views on nuclear weapons.Scientists\xe2\x80\x99 voices are crucial in the debates over the global challenges of climate change, nuclear proliferation and the potential creation of new and deadly pathogens. But unlike in the past, their voices aren\xe2\x80\x99t being heard.'b'Indeed, it was Albert Einstein\xe2\x80\x99s letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1939, warning of the possibility that Hitler might develop a nuclear weapon, that quickly prompted the start of the Manhattan Project, the largest scientific wartime project in history. Then, in 1945, the same group of physicists who had created the atomic bomb founded the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists to warn of the dangers of nuclear weapons, and to promote international cooperation to avoid nuclear war. As Einstein said in May 1946, \xe2\x80\x9cThe unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking, and thus we drift toward unparalleled catastrophe.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The men who built the bomb had enormous prestige as the greatest physics minds of the time. They included Nobel laureates, past and future, like 'b'Hans A. Bethe'b', 'b'Richard P. Feynman'b', 'b'Enrico Fermi'b', 'b'Ernest O. Lawrence'b' and 'b'Isidor Isaac Rabi'b'.'b'In June 1946, for instance, 'b'J. Robert Oppenheimer'b', who had helped lead the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, N.M., argued that atomic energy should be placed under civilian rather than military control. Within two months President Harry S. Truman signed a law doing so, effective January 1947.'b'Today, nine nuclear states have stockpiled perhaps 20,000 nuclear weapons, many of which dwarf the weapons dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Yet proliferation is as alarming as ever, even though President Obama signed, and Congress ratified, the new strategic arms-reduction treaty in 2010. Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program could lead to conflict. So could the animosity between India and Pakistan, which both have nuclear weapons.'b'The United States is complicit, because whatever our leaders may say, our actions suggest that we have no real intention to disarm. The United Nations adopted the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which would ban countries from testing nuclear weapons, in 1996. But it has not come into force; the Senate rejected ratification in 1999, and while President Obama has promised to obtain ratification, he has not shown enough urgency in doing so.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s striking is that today\xe2\x80\x99s version of the Manhattan Project scientists \xe2\x80\x94 not the weapons researchers at our maximum-security national laboratories, but distinguished scientific minds at our research universities and other national labs \xe2\x80\x94 provide advice that is routinely ignored.'b'Last year, the National Academy of Sciences published a report demonstrating that all the technical preconditions necessary for ratifying the United Nations treaty were in place. But this vital issue did not come up in the presidential campaign and is barely mentioned in Washington. Another study by the academy last year, on flaws in America\xe2\x80\x99s costly ballistic missile defense program, has had little impact even as the Pentagon considers cuts in military spending.'b'I am co-chairman of the board of sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which has supported the call for a world free of nuclear weapons \xe2\x80\x94 a vision backed by major foreign policy figures in both parties. But ideological biases have become so ingrained in Washington that scientific realities are subordinated to political intransigence.'b'Do scientists need to develop new doomsday tools before our views are again heard? Will climate researchers remain voiceless unless they propose untested geoengineering technologies that could have insidious consequences? Will biologists be heard only if their work spawns new biotechnologies that could be weaponized?'b'Because the threat of nuclear proliferation is not being addressed, because missile defense technologies remain flawed and because new threats exposed by scientists have been ignored, the Bulletin\xe2\x80\x99s annual 'b'Doomsday clock'b' \xe2\x80\x94 which was updated on Tuesday \xe2\x80\x94 still sits at five minutes to midnight. The clock is meant to convey the threats we face not only from nuclear weapons, but also from climate change and the potential unintended consequences of genetic engineering, which could be misused by those seeking to create bioweapons.'b'Until science and data become central to informing our public policies, our civilization will be hamstrung in confronting the gravest threats to its survival.'b'Wal-Mart, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest private employer, 'b'says it plans'b' to offer jobs to any recent veterans who want one and hire more than 100,000 of them in the next five years. Other companies should follow Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s lead in this welcome effort to help reduce high unemployment among those who served in recent wars.'b'Government 'b'statistics show'b' that the unemployment rate for veterans was 10.8 percent in December. That is down from 13.1 percent a year earlier, but it is still far higher than the 7.5 percent jobless rate for nonveterans.'b'Michelle Obama and Jill Biden have led 'b'an admirable program called Joining Forces'b' to help connect veterans with jobs and other resources. Congress also allows businesses to claim a tax credit of up to $9,600 per qualified veteran they hire. But much more can be done, which is where initiatives like Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s come in.'b'The company, which employs about 1.4 million people in the United States, says that it already employs about 100,000 veterans and finds that they are \xe2\x80\x9cquick learners\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cteam players.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that a company like Wal-Mart sees veterans as valuable given its need for large numbers of able workers. Some skeptics point out that Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s effort is a 'b'public-relations campaign'b' to draw attention away from a 'b'bribery scandal'b' in its Mexican operation and an active lawsuit by female employees who claim the company 'b'discriminated'b' against them. But a pledge to hire veterans does not reduce the company\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to get to the bottom of the corruption allegations and ensure fairness for its workers.'b'A 'b'Congressional report'b' last year 'b'found that'b' many veterans are jobless because their previous work experience was often in construction and manufacturing, which had big job losses during the recession. Another factor is that nearly one-third of recent veterans work in the public sector, presumably because government agencies are more willing to give them a chance. But government employment has fallen by more than 600,000 jobs in the last four years. That is why it is important that companies in other industries, including retailing, step in to hire veterans who have skills that could be adapted to many kinds of work.'b'National health care spending has been rising at an unusually low rate for three consecutive years. Yet health insurance companies in some states with lax regulations are requesting and winning double-digit premium increases for some customers. That jarring discrepancy suggests that both the federal government and the states need more power to reject premium increases that can\xe2\x80\x99t be justified.'b'The Affordable Care Act requires that proposed premium increases of 10 percent or more for small businesses and for individuals who lack employer coverage must be reviewed by state or federal regulators to determine if they are reasonable. Most states can reject increases found to be unjustifiable. But some states cannot; they simply rely on public disclosure to deter insurers from getting too greedy.'b'For example, in California, which lacks the power to deny excessive rate increases, three major insurers are 'b'proposing premium rate increases'b' for 2013 of as much as 20 percent, 22 percent, and 26 percent for some policyholders. In New York, however, the rate increases for 2013 are far lower than what insurers requested because state law allows state regulators to roll back unjustified increases. For individual policies, the insurers sought an average 9.5 percent increase but were granted only 4.5 percent. For small groups, insurers asked for 15.8 percent but were approved for 9.6 percent.'b'For now, the 'b'slow rate of growth'b' in national health spending \xe2\x80\x94 a modest 3.9 percent annually in 2009, 2010, and 2011, the lowest annual increases in the 52 years the government has been collecting such data \xe2\x80\x94 is good news. But experts don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether this is a temporary, recession-related slowdown or a permanent downward trend. Insurers often claim that high premiums for individual policies are driven by rising medical costs in some states and younger and healthier people forgoing insurance in the slow economy, leaving only sick and costly patients signed up for insurance. That rationale should disappear in 2014 when virtually all Americans will be required to buy insurance or pay a penalty.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'French Strikes in Mali Supplant Caution of U.S.'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 14):'b'France\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cshoving aside months of international hesitation\xe2\x80\x9d was an act of necessity, one executed to protect French citizens living in West Africa, Malians and their neighbors, and its own security interests.

Currently, these positive initiatives have to be tabled, for there can be no restoration of good governance and order in the midst of an invasion spearheaded by Al Qaeda.'b'It is understandable that the United States, the European Union and African nations may have some trepidation about taking on Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and other extremist factions in Mali for fear of what can materialize in their midst, but does taking no action or being cautious forestall terrorist acts?

This common response is completely inadequate for at least two reasons.'b'First, reasonable regulations do not devolve into slippery slopes. Just because the government can set a speed limit of 65 miles per hour doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that it will then set it at 50, then 30, and pretty soon we won\xe2\x80\x99t have cars.

'b'As reported by David Kirkpatrick in The Times'b', Mr. Morsi is shown in a video from 2010 delivering a speech in which he urges Egyptians to \xe2\x80\x9cnurse our children and our grandchildren on hatred\xe2\x80\x9d for Jews and Zionists. In a television interview months later, he described Zionists as \xe2\x80\x9cthese bloodsuckers who attack Palestinians, these warmongers, the descendants of apes and pigs.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That kind of pure bigotry is unacceptable anywhere, anytime.

The remarks were made at a time when anti-Israel sentiment was running high in Egypt and the region after the three-week Gaza conflict in 2009 between Israel and Hamas. The sad truth is that defaming Jews is an all too standard feature of Egyptian, and Arab, discourse; Israelis are not immune to responding in kind either.'b'Teaching children to hate and dehumanizing one\xe2\x80\x99s adversaries is just the kind of twisted mentality that fuels the conflicts that torment the region.'b'Does Mr. Morsi really believe what he said in 2010? Has becoming president made him think differently about the need to respect and work with all people? So far, there has been no official reaction.'b'The White House called for Mr. Morsi to make clear that he respects members of all faiths and said the videotaped remarks run counter to the goal of peace.

Our only real solution \xe2\x80\x94 a strategy to reignite consistent growth so we can narrow our income gaps and lift the middle class \xe2\x80\x94 never got a serious airing. Instead, each side was focused on how to secure a bigger slice of a shrinking pie for its own base. This lousy campaign produced the worst of all outcomes: President Obama won on a platform that had little to do with our core problems and is only a small part of the solution \xe2\x80\x94 raising taxes on the wealthy \xe2\x80\x94 so he has little incentive to rethink his strategy. And the Republicans did not lose badly enough \xe2\x80\x94 they held the House \xe2\x80\x94 to have to fully rethink their strategy. It does not bode well.'b'In his book \xe2\x80\x9cThe Moral Consequences of Economic Growth,\xe2\x80\x9d the Harvard economist Benjamin Friedman argues that periods of economic growth have been essential to American political progress; periods of economic prosperity were periods of greater social, political and religious harmony and tolerance. On Sunday, The Times\xe2\x80\x99s Annie Lowrey wrote a piece quoting Friedman who wondered aloud whether we\xe2\x80\x99re not now entering a reverse cycle, \xe2\x80\x9cin which our absence of growth is delivering political paralysis, and the political paralysis preserves the absence of growth.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I think he\xe2\x80\x99s right and that the only way to break out of this deadly cycle is with extraordinary leadership. Republicans and Democrats would have to govern in just the opposite way they ran their campaigns \xe2\x80\x94 by offering bold plans that not only challenge the other\xe2\x80\x99s base but their own and thereby mobilizes the center, a big majority, behind their agenda, to break the deadlock. If either party does that, not only will it win the day but the country will win as well.'b'What would that look like? If the Republican Party had a brain it would give up on its debt-ceiling gambit and announce instead that it wants to open negotiations immediately with President Obama on the basis of 'b'his own'b' deficit commission, the Simpson-Bowles plan. That would at least make the G.O.P. a serious opposition party again \xe2\x80\x94 with a platform that might actually appeal outside its base and challenge the president in a healthy way. But the G.O.P. would have to embrace the tax reforms and spending cuts in Simpson-Bowles first. Fat chance. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a pity.'b'As for Obama, if he really wants to lead, he will have to finally trust the American people with the truth. I\xe2\x80\x99d love to see him use his Jan. 21 Inaugural Address and his Feb. 12 State of the Union Message as a one-two punch to do just that \xe2\x80\x94 offer a detailed, honest diagnosis and then a detailed, honest prescription.'b'On the diagnosis side, Obama needs to explain to Americans the world in which they\xe2\x80\x99re now living. It\xe2\x80\x99s a world in which the increasing velocity of globalization and the Information Technology revolution are reshaping every job, workplace and industry. As a result, the mantra that if you \xe2\x80\x9cjust work hard and play by the rules\xe2\x80\x9d you should expect a middle-class lifestyle is no longer operable. Today you need to work harder and smarter, learn and re-learn faster and longer to be in the middle class. The high-wage, middle-skilled job is a thing of the past. Today\xe2\x80\x99s high-wage or decent-wage jobs all require higher skills, passion or curiosity. Government\xe2\x80\x99s job is to help provide citizens with as many lifelong learning opportunities as possible to hone such skills.'b'In the State of the Union, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to see Obama lay out a detailed plan for tax reform, spending cuts and investments \xe2\x80\x94 to meet the 'b'real scale'b' of our problem and spur economic growth. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get much more bang for our buck by deciding now what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do in all three areas, and signaling markets that we are putting in place a truly balanced approach, but gradually phasing it in. If you tell investors and savers that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to put our fiscal house in order with a credible plan, but one that is gradually phased in, all the money now sitting on the sidelines paralyzed by uncertainty will get off the sidelines and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a real stimulus.'b'As for investment, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to see the president launch us on an aspirational journey. My choice would be to connect every home and business in America to the Internet at one gigabit per second, or about 200 times faster than our current national household average, in five years. In an age when mining big data will be a huge industry, when online lifelong learning will be a vital necessity, and when we can\xe2\x80\x99t stimulate our way to prosperity but have to invent our way there, no project would be more relevant.'b'I still believe that America\xe2\x80\x99s rich and the middle classes would pay more taxes and trim entitlements if they thought it was for a plan that was fair, would truly address our long-term fiscal imbalances and set America on a journey of renewal that would ensure our kids have a crack at the American dream. Then again, I may be wrong. Maybe my baby-boomer generation really does intend to eat it all and leave our kids a ticking debt bomb. If only we had a second-term president, unencumbered by ever having to run again, who was ready to test what really bold leadership might produce.'b'The broad gun control 'b'bill approved Tuesday'b' by the New York Legislature substantially strengthens the state\xe2\x80\x99s gun control laws and, if vigorously enforced, could make New York one of the toughest places in the country to buy, sell or own dangerous weapons. But the bill also contains troubling provisions involving mental health and public access to important records that should be revisited and reworked.'b''b'The bill'b' was muscled through with disturbing speed after days of secret negotiations and a late-night vote Monday by state senators who had barely read the complicated measure before passing it. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who signed it into law on Tuesday, obviously calculated that it was necessary to move quickly before gun advocates could marshal serious opposition. Even so, Albany\xe2\x80\x99s customarily top-down and largely undemocratic legislative methods were inappropriate for such a complex bill.'b'The law has several strong provisions. It expands the current ban on assault weapons to include any semiautomatic weapon with a detachable magazine and one military-style feature (instead of two). It limits magazine clips to 7 rounds of ammunition instead of the current 10.'b'The law will require gun licenses to be renewed every five years; in some counties, a single license can last a lifetime. Background checks will be required at all gun sales, including most private ones, with an exception for immediate members of a gun-owner\xe2\x80\x99s family. There will be a new electronic database for gun permits, and a new registry for ammunition sales that will allow the authorities to track people who are buying cartridges in unusually high volumes.'b'Some sections of the law, however, were not fully vetted in the rush. One provision asks health care professionals \xe2\x80\x94 physicians, psychologists, registered nurses or licensed clinical social workers \xe2\x80\x94 to report to local health care officials when they have reason to believe that patients could harm themselves or others. Such a report, after wending its way through other bureaucratic layers, and after crosschecking against a database of gun owners, could eventually authorize police to confiscate firearms owned by a dangerous patient.'b'The provision would seem to raise significant legal questions. It is not clear who has the final authority to order the seizure, or at what point in the process the gun owner can appeal. The concept would also threaten established norms about doctor-patient relationships.'b'In addition, 'b'the law unwisely restricts public access to gun license records'b', an overreaction to a suburban newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s recent publication of names and addresses of licensees in Westchester and Rockland Counties. And the law requires safe storage of guns only if the house is being shared with a convicted criminal or someone else not authorized to have a gun license. Safe storage of guns should be a requirement for everyone.'b''b'Mr. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s law'b' is an important and timely step toward sane gun control. But it needs a few fixes before it can become a national model.'b'WASHINGTON'b'THE 'b'assassination'b' of three Kurdish activists in Paris last week has raised fears that the true target was peace talks between 'b'Turkey'b' and the rebel Kurdistan Workers\xe2\x80\x99 Party, or the P.K.K. But the so-called peace process was already in shambles before the killings, which have not been solved.'b'Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s prime minister, 'b'Recep Tayyip Erdogan'b', claims that he wants a deal to end nearly 30 years of war between the state and the P.K.K. rebels. But he has yet to take the decisive action needed for a credible peace process. Until he understands that the Kurdish problem in Turkey is about politics and identity, and not just about getting the guerrillas to withdraw from Turkey and give up their weapons, there will be no hope for peace.'b'The head of Turkish intelligence, Hakan Fidan, has recently been holding talks with the imprisoned P.K.K. leader, 'b'Abdullah Ocalan'b'. Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence services have had discussions with Mr. Ocalan since he was captured in February 1999, but to no avail.'b'The problem is that Mr. Ocalan may not be the right partner to negotiate with. He is held in extreme isolation on an island prison, with all communication vetted by his jailers. He 'b'received a television'b' in his cell for the first time just a few days ago. Visits must be approved, and rarely are. This means that Mr. Ocalan has limited knowledge of developments in the Kurdish region of Turkey. And while he remains the head of the P.K.K., he has no practical control over the rebels\xe2\x80\x99 day-to-day operations.'b'Even if he were in control, the highly authoritarian Mr. Ocalan is not necessarily the man to ensure democracy for Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s Kurds. During the nearly two decades he was based in Syria, Mr. Ocalan consolidated power by killing or isolating challengers.'b'A viable peace deal must answer Kurdish demands for human rights in a manner that protects the views of all Kurds, not just those of Mr. Ocalan and the P.K.K. And the best way to do this is through the Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party, known as the B.D.P., which won seats in Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s parliament in 2011 and can genuinely claim to represent Kurdish aspirations.'b'Mr. Erdogan needs to recognize that the way to peace is through politics. Instead of engaging solely with Mr. Ocalan, as if the P.K.K. rebellion were purely a security problem, he must craft a political process that addresses Kurds\xe2\x80\x99 grievances about cultural rights and autonomy, giving the rebels a reason to lay down their weapons.'b'To end the conflict, which has killed more than 40,000 people and hampered Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s ability to exert its clout in the Middle East, Turkey needs to do three things.'b'First, Mr. Erdogan must unequivocally commit to a negotiated process that includes compromises by both sides. While Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity should not be up for debate, everything else should be. Mr. Erdogan has generally been dismissive of Kurdish grievances. In a recent interview, he said there was no need to instruct Kurdish students in their native tongue, because they can already study the language as an elective. Instead of belittling Kurds\xe2\x80\x99 cultural demands, he should demonstrate good faith by pushing through stalled constitutional and legal reforms, including changes to constitutional provisions that restrict the use of the Kurdish language in schools, punish criticism of the Turkish state and define citizenship through the prism of Turkish identity.'b'Second, Mr. Erdogan needs to understand that disarming the P.K.K. won\xe2\x80\x99t come at the beginning of the peace process, but at the end. He can, and should, ask for a cease-fire agreement, but it cannot be a one-sided call for Kurdish surrender. To silence the P.K.K.\xe2\x80\x99s guns while talks are under way, Turkey will also have to suspend its military operations against rebels in the southeast and in northern Iraq.'b'Third, Turkey shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t limit itself to negotiating with an imprisoned authoritarian figurehead; it should also negotiate with the B.D.P. Unlike the P.K.K., the B.D.P. has legal recognition. But it also has legitimacy among Kurds due to its close ties to the P.K.K.; its members share the P.K.K.\xe2\x80\x99s political goals of Kurdish autonomy and recognize Mr. Ocalan as a leader of the Kurds. This is what makes the B.D.P. a serious negotiating partner; the party can be an effective conduit for P.K.K. demands and help devise a viable democratic reform package in Parliament.'b'Although the B.D.P. is dominated by its pro-P.K.K. members, the party is not an integral part of the rebel force. The B.D.P. has daily experience working in a democracy. It runs almost 100 municipalities; party leaders understand the give-and-take needed to govern effectively in a democracy. And the party contains other voices. They may feel beholden to the P.K.K., but they don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily think the P.K.K. is always right.'b'Mr. Ocalan cannot be entirely excluded, because he is the leader of the most powerful Kurdish group inside Turkey and has the support of millions of Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s Kurds, who make up close to 20 percent of the population. He needs to be consulted and treated with respect, and his approval will be needed to prevent the possibility of a violent splinter group forming to oppose a peace agreement.'b'Unfortunately, instead of engaging the B.D.P., the Turkish government has been harassing many of its members. Over the past four years, around 8,000 Kurdish activists \xe2\x80\x94 among them elected mayors, journalists and lawyers peacefully campaigning for greater cultural and political rights \xe2\x80\x94 have been detained on charges, often trumped up, of working for the P.K.K. About 1,000 of them are facing trial. Turkey cannot demand that Kurds abandon violence and then imprison peaceful activists.'b'Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s government wants security and the preservation of its borders. The Kurds have replaced their demands for independence with the more practical goals of autonomy, native-language instruction in public schools, and an end to repression of Kurdish activism. They also want P.K.K. fighters to be able to return home from their mountain bases in northern Iraq and to freely engage in democratic politics.'b'Negotiating all of these issues is not beyond Mr. Erdogan\xe2\x80\x99s abilities. Having reduced the military\xe2\x80\x99s influence over civilian politics, he has shown that he isn\xe2\x80\x99t afraid of a fight. The same courage could help him steer his country toward a peaceful accommodation with its Kurdish citizens.'b'We usually cringe when politicians drag ordinary people onstage for their events. But the four children who appeared with their parents and President Obama in the White House on Wednesday at his 'b'announcement'b' on gun control proposals drove home the nature of the crisis facing the country. While guns and gun control have been a subject of debate among politicians and lawyers and lobbyists and pollsters and political groups in the center and on the fringes, our children have been living in a free-fire zone for sociopaths with virtually unfettered access to instruments of mass murder.'b'It is past time that elected leaders did something about it without worrying, 'b'as Mr. Obama said'b' on Wednesday, about getting \xe2\x80\x9can A grade from the gun lobby.\xe2\x80\x9d It has been a bipartisan betrayal of the public\xe2\x80\x99s safety, the fault of Democrats and Republicans, and of a string of presidents who have said mournful things after the mass murders at Columbine and Virginia Tech and Aurora and Newtown but did not act.'b'Wednesday was the exception. One month after the Newtown, Conn., murders, Mr. Obama presented a 'b'comprehensive set of initiatives'b' that was, for a change, structured around what needs to be done and not what political tacticians think the president could get a dysfunctional Congress to pass. Mr. Obama can be frustrating at moments like this, and his delivery today was as professorial as ever. But he stepped up to the broader issue before the nation in remembering the tragedy at Newtown.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhile there is no law or set of laws that can prevent every senseless act of violence completely, no piece of legislation that will prevent every tragedy, every act of evil,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cif there is even one thing we can do to reduce this violence, if there\xe2\x80\x99s even one life that can be saved, then we\xe2\x80\x99ve got an obligation to try.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa2'b'Mr. Obama said he believes the Second Amendment bestows an individual right to own guns. We have disagreed with that position, but it is now the law as judged by the Supreme Court, and as Mr. Obama said so passionately, it should be no impediment to gun regulation.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAlong with our freedom to live our lives as we will comes an obligation to allow others to do the same,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama said, noting that 900 people have died in gun violence since Newtown, a vast majority of them on the streets of \xe2\x80\x9cbig cities and small towns.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We have \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to worship freely and safely; that right was denied to Sikhs in Oak Creek, Wis.,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe right to assemble peaceably; that right was denied shoppers in Clackamas, Ore., and moviegoers in Aurora, Colo. That most fundamental set of rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, fundamental rights that were denied to college students at Virginia Tech and high school students at Columbine and elementary school students in Newtown; and kids on street corners in Chicago on too frequent a basis to tolerate.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s announcement was preceded by a blast of propaganda from the far right that his proposals would be confiscatory and tyrannical. Anyone who was paying attention to the news in the last couple of weeks knew that this was nonsense, and the proposals announced on Wednesday were not remotely similar to what the gun lobby wanted Americans to believe they would be. They will not limit any law-abiding American\xe2\x80\x99s right to own guns for hunting, or sport, or collection, or self-protection.'b'The package is a mix of executive orders intended to tighten and heighten enforcement of existing gun laws and sweep away ideologically motivated restrictions on government action against gun violence, and new laws that will have to be passed by Congress.'b'\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa2'b'Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s bills would require universal criminal background checks for all gun sales, doing away with the loopholes for gun shows, private sales and Internet sales that have exempted 40 percent of all gun sales from those checks. He called on Congress to reinstate and toughen the ban on assault weapons that was allowed to expire in 2004. He wants to restore a 10-round limit on ammunition magazines and to ban armor-piercing bullets that are used by criminals to kill police officers. The president asked Congress to pass a $4 billion measure intended to retain 15,000 police officers who are being laid off as states and localities react to the recent recession and to budget cuts from Washington.'b'Mr. Obama also issued executive orders to make the background checks system more comprehensive and strengthen enforcement of existing gun laws. He is ending a freeze on research into gun violence at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was imposed by lawmakers at the behest of a gun lobby that is terrified by the prospect that gun violence could be viewed, as it should be, as a public health issue. He also signed an order making it clear that doctors and other health care providers are not prohibited by any federal law from reporting their patients\xe2\x80\x99 threats of violence and that the health care reform law \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not prevent doctors from talking to patients about gun safety.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. acknowledged that getting any of the president\xe2\x80\x99s proposals through Congress was going to be a herculean task. Mr. Biden said, \xe2\x80\x9cI also have never seen the nation\xe2\x80\x99s conscience so shaken by what happened\xe2\x80\x9d in Newtown. We have hoped, too, that the murders last month would finally inspire action, especially if Americans pressured their representatives in Congress to do something about this crisis.'b'Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden will have to make good on Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s promise to do everything they can to fight for these proposals in Congress \xe2\x80\x94 and that will mean twisting arms and making threats to members of his own party as well as to Republicans.'b'The gun lobby is focused within the Republican Party, but Democratic lawmakers have also been to blame for failing to pass meaningful gun regulations. Already, some Democrats who should be strongest on gun controls are showing familiar signs of weakness.'b'Senator Pat Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, will be needed as a leader in this effort but has been mumbling about the need to hold extensive hearings. And Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, was making ominous, cowardly remarks over the weekend about tailoring whatever the Senate does to what he thinks could get through a House dominated by the far-right fringe of the Republican Party. He has started to wriggle away from the idea of an assault weapons ban, for example.'b'This is not a time for lawmakers to do the politically safe thing or the N.R.A.-approved thing, even if they know it is less than needed. It is time to reach for big ideas and strong laws on gun violence.'b'\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa2'b''b'This is part of a continuing series on the epidemic of gun violence and possible solutions. Other editorials are at 'b'nytimes.com/gunchallenge'b'.'b''b'SYDNEY, Australia'b'IT is for Americans and their elected representatives to determine the right response to President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s proposals on gun control. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t presume to lecture Americans on the subject. I can, however, describe what I, as prime minister of Australia, did to curb gun violence following a horrific massacre 17 years ago in the hope that it will contribute constructively to the debate in the United States.'b'I was elected prime minister in early 1996, leading a center-right coalition. Virtually every nonurban electoral district in the country \xe2\x80\x94 where gun ownership was higher than elsewhere \xe2\x80\x94 sent a member of my coalition to Parliament.'b'Six weeks later, on April 28, 1996, Martin Bryant, a psychologically disturbed man, used a semiautomatic Armalite rifle and a semiautomatic SKS assault weapon to kill 35 people in a murderous rampage in Port Arthur, Tasmania.'b'After this wanton slaughter, I knew that I had to use the authority of my office to curb the possession and use of the type of weapons that killed 35 innocent people. I also knew it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be easy.'b'Our challenges were different from America\xe2\x80\x99s. Australia is an even more intensely urban society, with close to 60 percent of our people living in large cities. Our gun lobby isn\xe2\x80\x99t as powerful or well-financed as the National Rifle Association in the United States. Australia, correctly in my view, does not have a Bill of Rights, so our legislatures have more say than America\xe2\x80\x99s over many issues of individual rights, and our courts have less control. Also, we have no constitutional right to bear arms. (After all, the British granted us nationhood peacefully; the United States had to fight for it.)'b'Because Australia is a federation of states, the national government has no control over gun ownership, sale or use, beyond controlling imports. Given our decentralized system of government, I could reduce the number of dangerous firearms only by persuading the states to enact uniform laws totally prohibiting the ownership, possession and sale of all automatic and semiautomatic weapons while the national government banned the importation of such weapons.'b'To make this plan work, there had to be a federally financed gun buyback scheme. Ultimately, the cost of the buyback was met by a special one-off tax imposed on all Australians. This required new legislation and was widely accepted across the political spectrum. Almost 700,000 guns were bought back and destroyed \xe2\x80\x94 the equivalent of 40 million guns in the United States.'b'City dwellers supported our plan, but there was strong resistance by some in rural Australia. Many farmers resented being told to surrender weapons they had used safely all of their lives. Penalizing decent, law-abiding citizens because of the criminal behavior of others seemed unfair. Many of them had been lifelong supporters of my coalition and felt bewildered and betrayed by these new laws. I understood their misgivings. Yet I felt there was no alternative.'b'The fundamental problem was the ready availability of high-powered weapons, which enabled people to convert their murderous impulses into mass killing. Certainly, shortcomings in treating mental illness and the harmful influence of violent video games and movies may have played a role. But nothing trumps easy access to a gun. It is easier to kill 10 people with a gun than with a knife.'b'Passing gun-control laws was a major challenge for my coalition partner: the rural, conservative National Party. All of its members held seats in nonurban areas. It was also very hard for the state government of Queensland, in Australia\xe2\x80\x99s northeast, where the National Party was dominant, and where the majority of the population was rural.'b'The leaders of the National Party, as well as the premier of Queensland, courageously supported my government\xe2\x80\x99s decision, despite the electoral pain it caused them. Within a year, a new populist and conservative political party, the One Nation Party, emerged and took many votes from our coalition in subsequent state and federal elections; one of its key policies was the reversal of the gun laws.'b'For a time, it seemed that certain states might refuse to enact the ban. But I made clear that my government was willing to hold a nationwide referendum to alter the Australian Constitution and give the federal government constitutional power over guns. Such a referendum would have been expensive and divisive, but it would have passed. And all state governments knew this.'b'In the end, we won the battle to change gun laws because there was majority support across Australia for banning certain weapons. And today, there is a wide consensus that our 1996 reforms not only reduced the gun-related homicide rate, but also the suicide rate. The Australian Institute of Criminology found that gun-related murders and suicides fell sharply after 1996. The American Law and Economics Review found that our gun buyback scheme cut firearm suicides by 74 percent. In the 18 years before the 1996 reforms, Australia suffered 13 gun massacres \xe2\x80\x94 each with more than four victims \xe2\x80\x94 causing a total of 102 deaths. There has not been a single massacre in that category since 1996.'b'Few Australians would deny that their country is safer today as a consequence of gun control.'b'LONDON'b'IF I had known that my nostrils\xe2\x80\x99 poking out of a body bag would be the main feature of my performance in Kathryn Bigelow\xe2\x80\x99s film \xe2\x80\x9cZero Dark Thirty,\xe2\x80\x9d it would have saved me eight weeks of heart palpitations as I prepared for my role as Osama bin Laden.'b'How does one play the global face of evil? I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure at first if I could actually pull it off. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have an agent looking after me or a team around me to help prepare for the part. I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen the script. And I was definitely not \xe2\x80\x9cBin Laden skinny.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'My journey to becoming Bin Laden started in March of last year, when I got a call from a casting director in London, who said she had been trying to get hold of me for a week \xe2\x80\x94 apparently the phone number I had registered on the Spotlight database, an online resource used to contact actors, was an old one. I apologized. She asked if I could come in the next day. I said yes, what for? She said she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me.'b'The next week, I was offered the part of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most notorious terrorist. My first reaction was an expletive that cannot be printed here. I am a 29-year-old native Londoner, a moderate Sikh with a drama degree from Royal Holloway, University of London \xe2\x80\x94 a pretty far cry from a 54-year-old Saudi multimillionaire-turned-terrorist who had been on the lam for nearly a decade after murdering some 3,000 people. I guess I do look a bit like Bin Laden \xe2\x80\x94 I am 6 feet 4 inches tall, about what he was. I have brown skin and a prominent nose, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not as though anyone has ever stopped me in the street and shouted,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cHey, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you Bin Laden?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0(And I think I have a better smile \xe2\x80\x94 not as creepy. At least my girlfriend says so.)'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not that easy to be an actor of Asian ancestry in Britain or America. There are fewer leading roles for us, but then again, there are also probably fewer of us going up for those roles.'b'Of course, the problems of Asian actors can\xe2\x80\x99t be compared with the suffering of both Sikhs and Muslims who have been targeted and killed in hate crimes. I was in London on July 7, 2005, when terrorists detonated bombs on three subways and one bus, killing 52 people and injuring 770. My two sisters take the Tube to work and could easily have been among the victims. If anything, this spurred me to take on more challenging roles, to contribute to the conversation about the joys and challenges of living in a diverse society.'b'I started taking acting seriously when I joined the National Youth Theater at 17 years old. I also toured with a theater company in Valencia, Spain, practicing commedia dell\xe2\x80\x99arte (my favorite form of theater). Before \xe2\x80\x9cZero Dark Thirty,\xe2\x80\x9d I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much experience in film. I did, however, have some prior experience playing faces of terror. In the 2010 British comedy film \xe2\x80\x9cThe Infidel,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0I played Hazeem \xe2\x80\x94 a henchman of a character loosely based on Abu Hamza al-Masri, the hook-handed Islamist preacher who was captured in Britain in 2004 and extradited last year to the United States. (He is now in federal prison in Manhattan awaiting trial.)'b'I guess playing Bin Laden was a natural progression, a graduation through the ranks of terrorists.'b'To prepare myself for the task, my friend Tara, who works for the Institute of Ismaili Studies, gave me a list of books to read about Bin Laden and Al Qaeda. I bought a set of Rosetta Stone CD\xe2\x80\x99s to learn some basic Arabic. (I know a little Punjabi and Hindi, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t help me much.)'b'And then I tackled my weight. In the movies, after all, image is everything, and I was playing a very ill, thin man. Bin Laden reportedly lived on an ascetic diet of dates and yogurt. While on vacation in Jamaica, my friend Henry, a personal trainer, had me running up hills in the morning heat and eating only eggs, lean meat and fish to become a waif of Bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s ilk. I lost 25 pounds from my typically 200-pound frame.'b'Even after all this preparation, I was still nervous when I arrived last May on the \xe2\x80\x9cZero Dark Thirty\xe2\x80\x9d set in Jordan. Playing a dead person was more difficult than I\xe2\x80\x99d imagined. Holding my breath for more than 30 seconds felt like eternity. Through the stillness I could feel my heart making my rib cage vibrate. And being dumped into a body bag was certainly not as fun as having, say, an on-screen snog, but being carried in it was kind of reminiscent of being in a hammock. I got so comfortable in the bag that, by the end of the shoot, I was known as Osama bin Loungin\xe2\x80\x99.'b'Other than what I\xe2\x80\x99d seen in YouTube videos, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much to go on when it came to playing Bin Laden in his last moments. I remembered the advice a director friend gave me: for the most honest portrayal, forget your perception of the politics and focus on the character\xe2\x80\x99s basic motivation in that point in time.'b'In the film, you see only a shadow just before my character is \xe2\x80\x94 spoiler alert \xe2\x80\x94 killed. During the sequence in Bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, as the actors playing Navy SEALs stormed our eerily realistic set, we had shot some options showing him moving around. Because of how enigmatic he was, I had the freedom to play on what I had decided for myself would be his state of mind and body. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cBin Laden wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand up or walk like this,\xe2\x80\x9d because, after so many years of house arrest, who knows how he carried himself?'b'The controversial movie has been a resounding success, nominated for five Oscars. I have returned to my normal life in London. The makeup and fake blood are gone, and my career\xe2\x80\x99s been picking up somewhat. I\xe2\x80\x99m working with a Swedish director, Kristoffer Dios, on a thriller. In the last decade my favorite films have been Swedish or Danish \xe2\x80\x94 I think their storytelling style is perfect.'b'But would I be prepared to play a universally despised emblem of evil again? I guess it would depend on how many lines I had.'b'WASHINGTON'b'PRESIDENT OBAMA has refused to tell Congress or the American people why he believes the Constitution gives, or fails to deny, him the authority to secretly target and kill American citizens who he suspects are involved in terrorist activities overseas. So far he has killed three that we know of.'b'Presidents had never before, to our knowledge, targeted specific Americans for military strikes. There are no court decisions that tell us if he is acting lawfully. Mr. Obama tells us not to worry, though, because his lawyers say it is fine, because experts guide the decisions and because his advisers have set up a careful process to help him decide whom he should kill.'b'He must think we should be relieved.'b'The three Americans known to have been killed, in two drone strikes in Yemen in the fall of 2011, are 'b'Anwar al-Awlaki'b', a radical Muslim cleric who was born in New Mexico; 'b'Samir Khan'b', a naturalized American citizen who had lived in New York and North Carolina, and was killed alongside Mr. Awlaki; and, in a strike two weeks later, Mr. Awlaki\xe2\x80\x99s 16-year-old son, Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, who was born in Colorado.'b'Most of us think these people were probably terrorists anyway. So the president\xe2\x80\x99s reassurances have been enough to keep criticism at an acceptable level for the White House. Democrats in Congress and in the press have only gingerly questioned the claims by a Democratic president that he is right about the law and careful when he orders drone attacks on our citizens. And Republicans, who favor aggressive national security powers for the executive branch, look forward to the day when one of their own can wield them again.'b'But a few of our representatives have spoken up \xe2\x80\x94 sort of. Several months ago, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, began limply requesting the Department of Justice memorandums that justify the targeted killing program. At a committee hearing, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., reminded of the request, demurred and shared a rueful chuckle with the senator. Mr. Leahy did not want to be rude, it seems \xe2\x80\x94 though some of us remember him being harder on former President George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general, Alberto R. Gonzales, in 2005.'b'So, even though Congress has the absolute power under the Constitution to receive these documents, the Democratic-controlled Senate has not fought this president to get them. If the senators did, and the president held fast to his refusal, they could go to court and demand them, and I believe they would win. Perhaps even better, they could skip getting the legal memos and go right to the meat of the matter \xe2\x80\x94 using oversight and perhaps legislating to control the president\xe2\x80\x99s killing powers. That isn\xe2\x80\x99t happening either.'b'Thank goodness we have another branch of government to step into the fray. It is the job of the federal courts to interpret the Constitution and laws, and thus to define the boundaries of the powers of the branches of government, including their own.'b'In reining in the branches, the courts have been toughest on themselves, however. A long line of Supreme Court cases require that judges wait for cases to come to them. They can take cases only from plaintiffs who have a personal stake in the outcome; they cannot decide political questions; they cannot rule on an issue not squarely before them.'b'Because of these and other limitations, no case has made it far enough in federal court for a judge to rule on the merits of the basic constitutional questions at stake here. A pending case filed in July by the families of the three dead Americans does raise Fourth and Fifth Amendment challenges to the president\xe2\x80\x99s killings of their relatives. We will see if the judge agrees to consider the constitutional questions or dismisses the case, citing limitations on his own power.'b'In another case, decided two weeks ago, a federal judge in Manhattan, Colleen McMahon, ruled, grudgingly, that the American Civil Liberties Union and two New York Times reporters could not get access, under the Freedom of Information Act, to classified legal memorandums that were relied on to justify the targeted killing program. In her opinion, she expressed serious reservations about the president\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the constitutional questions. But the merits of the program were not before her, just access to the Justice Department memos, so her opinion was, in effect, nothing but an interesting read.'b'So at the moment, the legislature and the courts are flummoxed by, or don\xe2\x80\x99t care about, how or whether to take on this aggressive program. But Mr. Obama, a former constitutional law professor, should know, of all people, what needs to be done. He was highly critical when Mr. Bush applied new constitutional theories to justify warrantless wiretapping and \xe2\x80\x9cenhanced interrogation.\xe2\x80\x9d In his 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama demanded transparency, and after taking office, he released legal memos that the Bush administration had kept secret. Once the self-serving constitutional analysis that the Bush team had used was revealed, legal scholars from across the spectrum studied and denounced it.'b'While Mr. Obama has criticized his predecessor, he has also worried about his successors. Last fall, when the election\xe2\x80\x99s outcome was still in doubt, Mr. Obama talked about drone strikes in general and said Congress and the courts should in some manner \xe2\x80\x9crein in\xe2\x80\x9d presidents by putting a \xe2\x80\x9clegal architecture in place.\xe2\x80\x9d His comments seemed to reflect concern that future presidents should perhaps not wield alone such awesome and unchecked power over life and death \xe2\x80\x94 of anyone, not just Americans. Oddly, under current law, Congress and the courts are involved when presidents eavesdrop on Americans, detain them or harshly interrogate them \xe2\x80\x94 but not when they kill them.'b'It is not just the most recent president, this one and the next whom we need to worry about when it comes to improper exercise of power. It is every president. Mr. Obama should declassify and release, to Congress, the press and the public, documents that set forth the detailed constitutional and statutory analysis he relies on for targeting and killing American citizens.'b'Perhaps Mr. Obama still believes that, in a democracy, the people have a right to know the legal theories upon which the president executes his great powers. Certainly, we can hope so. After all, his interpretation might be wrong.'b'Right now you\xe2\x80\x99re probably asking yourself: What can the Lance Armstrong scandal teach us as a nation?'b'It had better teach us something or we\xe2\x80\x99ll have wasted one heck of a lot of time talking about this guy. And the lesson should not involve the future of cycling. Now that Lance Armstrong is disgraced, people, how many of you ever plan to think about the sport of cycling again? Can I see a show of hands? I thought so.'b'As the whole universe knows, Armstrong is a superfamous American athlete who developed testicular cancer, went through arduous therapy and then returned to the racing circuit as the head of the United States Postal Service Pro Cycling Team, winning the Tour de France seven straight times.'b'And then the authorities stripped away his medals for serial doping. Which Armstrong denied, virtually on an hourly basis, with a vengeance that made \xe2\x80\x9cI did not have sexual relations with that woman\xe2\x80\x9d sound like a confession.'b'The denial stage is scheduled to come to an end Thursday in an Oprah interview. After which we will discuss whether Armstrong can be forgiven.'b'We can certainly grant him absolution as a human being, but he appears to be in the market for forgiveness as a celebrity. And, really, once you get past the now-demolished race record, there\xe2\x80\x99s not much point to Lance Armstrong, Famous Person. He has no other talents. He isn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly lovable. He was once cited for using 330,000 gallons of water at his Texas home in a month when his neighbors were being asked to conserve by cutting back on their car-washing. He left his wife, got engaged to the singer Sheryl Crow. He said he broke up with Sheryl Crow because of her \xe2\x80\x9cbiological clock.\xe2\x80\x9d The New York Post had him dating one of the Olsen twins.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s always a chance. Armstrong could demonstrate his remorse by dedicating the rest of his life to fighting rural poverty in an extremely remote section of Africa, preferably one where residents are limited to a quart of water a day. His fans would come flocking back, although Armstrong would hardly notice because the critical part of the deal would be staying in Niger or Burkina Faso forever.'b'Meanwhile, his foundation could pick a new spokesperson from the ranks of American cancer survivors who went back to work without violating the cardinal moral principle of their profession.'b'But we still need to wring a useful lesson out of all this. Let\xe2\x80\x99s consider the U.S. Postal Service Pro Cycling Team. Between 1996 and 2004, our American mail system invested an estimated $40 million in this venture, in return for which Armstrong and his teammates rode around with the Postal Service insignia on their shirts.'b'This would be the same Postal Service that lost $16 billion last year, and I believe I speak for every stamp-buyer in the nation when I say: What?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt really is a strong morale-building element,\xe2\x80\x9d the general manager of the team said in 2001, when asked what the mailing public was getting out of all this. There are, the manager added, a lot of people who \xe2\x80\x9cfeel a little bit better about the Postal Service because of its association with Lance.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Then it would follow that the American public feels worse about the Postal Service now that Armstrong is headed for Pariah Junction. But, personally, I\xe2\x80\x99m more focused on that $16 billion.'b'The Armstrong heyday was back in the era when the Postal Service, having been spun off into a quasi-private enterprise, was having delusions of corporate grandeur. The era when it lost $8.3 million in a failed attempt to start a retail operation in the Mall of America. Its leaders liked the idea that \xe2\x80\x9cthey could rub shoulders with other C.E.O.\xe2\x80\x99s who were sponsoring sports activities,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ruth Goldway, the chairwoman of the Postal Regulatory Commission.'b'Goldway was never a big fan of the postal service cycle team, although she felt it was a better marketing tool than some of the other ideas put into play, like \xe2\x80\x9cbuying free tickets for postal employees to go to football games.\xe2\x80\x9d And, she said, she had some sympathy for Armstrong, \xe2\x80\x9cuntil I saw how he treated Sheryl Crow.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There still are sponsorship deals floating all around the federal government. (The Army has one with the National Hot Rod Association.) Nobody seems to keep track of exactly how much they add up to. Maybe this one little area could be a staging ground for bipartisan accord. Republicans and Democrats could join together to ban the use of federal taxpayer dollars for sponsorship of sports events. Then they would be so pleased with their progress that they could move on and pass a genuine budget. The Lance Armstrong debacle would have a point!'b'Although, actually, Representative Betty McCollum of Minnesota proposed banning the use of taxpayer money to sponsor Nascar race teams in 2011, and she was voted down, 281 to 148.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ll look for another moral. Maybe something about Sheryl Crow.'b'This week the president aimed high in the gun debate, and the National Rifle Association aimed low, despicably low.'b'On Wednesday, the president outlined a broad range of measures \xe2\x80\x94 including universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons, a ban on high-capacity magazine clips, as well as improved data collection and sharing about backgrounds of potential gun buyers. It was all intended to increase public safety over all and make an honest effort to prevent mass shootings and lessen the carnage in the event that there are more'b'The N.R.A., for its part, released on Tuesday an ad called \xe2\x80\x9cElitist Hypocrite\xe2\x80\x9d that invoked the Obama children and their Secret Service security as evidence of a president who values his children above those of average Americans.'b'It was an outrageous, unnecessary and ultimately stomach-churning ploy to pit the value of some children against others while completely ignoring the longstanding and very real threats that presidents and their families face.'b'As the Christian Science Monitor reported in November, \xe2\x80\x9cSince 2007, the Secret Service has disrupted several assassination conspiracies \xe2\x80\x94 including some involving white nationalists \xe2\x80\x94 and arrested dozens of people who have made less-than-idle threats against the president.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Most of us don\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry that our children live under the constant threat of harm. Heads of state do. Feigning ignorance of that distinction for political expediency only suggests that you may not be feigning at all.'b'Furthermore, the president hasn\xe2\x80\x99t voiced opposition to more school security. He has, however, said that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that that\xe2\x80\x99s the sole solution. In a recent interview on \xe2\x80\x9cMeet the Press,\xe2\x80\x9d the president said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am skeptical that the only answer is putting more guns in schools.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Lastly, as the White House pointed out in an e-mail to me last month, the administration proposed money for \xe2\x80\x9cSecure Our Schools\xe2\x80\x9d policing grants, which provide funding to improve school safety, \xe2\x80\x9chowever, Congress zeroed out the program in 2012.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In fact, the president\xe2\x80\x99s proposal as presented on Wednesday specifically states:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to enhance the physical security of our schools and our ability to respond to emergencies like mass shootings, and also create safer and more nurturing school climates. Each school is different and should have the flexibility to address its most pressing needs. Some schools will want trained and armed police; others may prefer increased counseling services. Either way, each district should be able to choose what is best to protect its own students.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And one of the president\xe2\x80\x99s executive orders reads: \xe2\x80\x9cprovide incentives for schools to hire school resource officers.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'On virtually every measure, the N.R.A.\xe2\x80\x99s messaging is off.'b'The president\xe2\x80\x99s proposals, on the other hand, are very much in step with public opinion, which has shifted toward more restrictions, according to a number of polls reported Monday.'b'A 'b'poll by Gallup'b' found that dissatisfaction with America\xe2\x80\x99s gun laws has \xe2\x80\x9cspiked\xe2\x80\x9d to 38 percent after the Newtown shooting and the public discussions that followed. As Gallup points out, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is up from 25 percent who held this set of views a year ago, and is the highest since 2001.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s an increase by more than half in one year \xe2\x80\x94 reversing a trend of continuous decline.'b'A 'b'Washington Post-ABC News poll'b' found that \xe2\x80\x9cmost Americans support tough new measures to counter gun violence, including banning assault weapons and posting armed guards at every school\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[m]ore than half of Americans \xe2\x80\x94 52 percent in the poll \xe2\x80\x94 say 'b'the shooting at the elementary school'b' in Newtown, Conn., has made them more supportive of gun control.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And a 'b'Pew Research Center poll'b' found that most Americans now support a federal database to track gun sales, background checks for private sales and sales at gun shows, preventing the mentally ill from purchasing guns, and bans on semiautomatic weapons, assault style weapons, high-capacity ammunition clips and online ammunition sales.'b'But as Pew pointed out, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a wide gap between those who prioritize gun rights and gun control when it comes to political involvement.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The report continued: \xe2\x80\x9cNearly a quarter (23 percent) of those who say gun rights should be the priority have contributed money to an organization that takes a position on gun policy, compared with just 5 percent of those who prioritize gun control. People who favor gun rights are also about twice as likely as gun control supporters to have contacted a public official about gun policy (15 percent vs. 8 percent).\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is where gun control advocates \xe2\x80\x94 those who believe that a society can be safer and more civil with fewer rather than more high-powered, high-capacity killing machines \xe2\x80\x94 must have their mettle tested. This is where they must take a stand, become vocal and active, and demand accountability from elected officials, not just now but also in the future.'b'One of the most profound lessons to emerge from the Newtown tragedy is the power of voice. Americans refused to cede the discussion to the N.R.A. and other gun interests. They refused to buckle to fear or be swayed by propaganda.'b'Yet too many politicians still quake at the mere mention of the N.R.A. They are more interested in protecting their jobs than protecting society.'b'The public must make them quake at the idea of doing nothing on this issue.'b'We must never forget what happened in Connecticut last month and we must never forget what happens in Washington in the coming months.'b'The tragedy of Newtown must herald the dawn of a new America.'b''b' 'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'A Soldier\xe2\x80\x99s Requiem, Never Fading Away'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Hard Road Back\xe2\x80\x9d series, front page, Jan. 13), focusing on the Finken family and their adjustment to the death in Iraq of the husband and father, Lt.

My dad gave me a .22 rifle for my 12th birthday, and I then took an N.R.A. safety course.'b'I understand the heartland\xe2\x80\x99s affection for guns, and I share that sense of familiarity. A farm needs a gun or two to deal with coyotes with a fondness for lamb, and, frankly, it\xe2\x80\x99s also fun to shoot.'b'But all those guns didn\xe2\x80\x99t make us safer. Take the time we gave a goose to a neighbor.'b'That goose would wander off to a different neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s property and jump into the watering trough for his sheep. The sheep owner was furious that the water would be fouled, and one time he was so fed up he threatened to shoot the goose.'b'He was probably just making a point, but, since he had a gun handy, he pulled it out and aimed it in the direction of the goose. Seeing this, the goose-owner (who had come to fetch his bird) saw the need to protect his property and pulled out his own gun. They faced off \xe2\x80\x94 over a goose!'b'Our neighbors were both good, admirable, law-abiding people, but their guns had led to a dangerous confrontation. The N.R.A. might say that guns don\xe2\x80\x99t kill people, geese kill people, but in the absence of firearms they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have menaced each other with axes or hammers.'b'The sheep-owner\xe2\x80\x99s wife eventually persuaded the men to stand down. Good sense prevailed, the goose survived, and so did the neighbors.'b'But I think of that episode because it underscores the role that guns too often play in our society: an instrument not of protection but of escalation.'b'Lovers throw plates at each other and then one indignantly reaches for a gun \xe2\x80\x94 maybe just to scare the other. And then, too often, something goes wrong.'b'One study, reported in Southern Medical Journal in 2010, 'b'found that a gun'b' is 12 times more likely to result in the death of a household member or guest than in the death of an intruder. Another study in 1993 found that gun ownership creates nearly 'b'a threefold risk'b' of a homicide in the owner\xe2\x80\x99s household.'b'Far too many Americans are like Nancy Lanza, who may have thought that her guns would make her safer, and then was killed with them. Something similar happened in Yamhill, where a troubled teenager took a gun that his grandmother owned and shot her dead. The N.R.A. is right that most guns are used safely, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also true that guns are more likely to cause tragedies than to avert them.'b'President Obama said that there have been 900 violent gun deaths since Sandy Hook, but that was a rare error. He perhaps was speaking of gun homicides only, but he should also include gun suicides \xe2\x80\x94 which are even more common and certainly qualify as violent firearms deaths.'b'The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calculates that each year there are 'b'more than 11,000 gun homicides'b' and 'b'nearly 19,000 gun suicides'b'. That\xe2\x80\x99s 30,000 firearms deaths a year in the United States. At that rate, there have already been some 2,500 violent gun deaths since Sandy Hook.'b'David Hemenway, 'b'a public health specialist at Harvard'b', says that having a gun at home increases the risk of suicide in that household by two to four times.'b'To reduce auto deaths, we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken a public health approach that you might call \xe2\x80\x9ccar control\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses, air bags, seat belts, auto registration.

The case, which is being fought in federal court in New York, suggests that policy makers must develop a more systematic way to deal with sovereign defaults.'b'The case deals with Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s decision in 2001 to stop paying debts worth about $80 billion. The country eventually reached deals with most of its investors and banks to forgive most of the amount that they were owed. But some bondholders, including the hedge funds Elliott Management and Aurelius Capital, held out for a better deal and sued Argentina.'b'Until recently, the Argentina case has been a quixotic pursuit because American law makes it hard to collect money from other countries. But late last year, Judge Thomas P. Griesa of Federal District Court ruled that Argentina had to pay the holdouts as long as it was paying the investors who had agreed to the restructuring because the country couldn\xe2\x80\x99t favor some investors over others under the terms of its bonds. Because Argentina has previously refused to pay the holdouts, the judge further ordered the banks and other intermediaries the country uses to make the payments from the money it sent to them. The United States Appeals Court for the Second Circuit will soon hear an appeal of that decision, which has alarmed the Obama administration, banks and other countries because it could affect other cases.'b'The Argentina case, while unusual for being so drawn out, is just one of a rising tide of litigation involving defaults by countries. One 'b'recent study'b' found the likelihood of such cases has more than doubled compared with the 1980s, and there were 61 cases initiated in the last decade. One explanation for the increase is that these debts are increasingly held by hedge funds, rather than banks, which often settle under pressure from policy makers in Washington and London. The threat of litigation dogged the recent renegotiation of Greek debt, which was ultimately resolved out of court after changes to local laws and intervention by European officials.'b'These cases have 'b'reawakened interest'b' in an 'b'old proposal'b' by the International Monetary Fund for a system of resolving the debts of countries that would be similar to corporate bankruptcy. The fund would oversee the process and another agency would make sure countries and their creditors come to terms that apply to all creditors.'b'That proposal has been blocked by the United States and others because they are uncomfortable about amending their laws and creating another international agency. They, and some in the financial industry, argue that many countries have been adding clauses to their bond contracts that all bondholders must accept a restructuring if two-thirds or three-fourths of bondholders vote to do so. These provisions would make it easier to negotiate settlements, but they do not address problems that arise when countries have multiple kinds of debts.'b'Some officials in the European Union 'b'are proposing'b' a formal restructuring system for its member countries. Other nations may need to follow Europe\xe2\x80\x99s lead if these kinds of suits start imposing onerous strains and responsibilities on banks and other players in the financial system.'b'TODAY, leaders of the New York bar, judges and law school faculty members will 'b'gather'b' at New York University to discuss a 'b'proposed rule change'b'. If adopted by the state\xe2\x80\x99s highest court, it could make law school far more accessible to low-income students, help the next generation of law students avoid a 'b'heavy burden of debt'b' and lead to improvements in legal education across the United States.'b'The proposal would amend the rules of the New York State Court of Appeals to allow students to take the state bar exam after two years of law school instead of the three now required. Law schools would no doubt continue to provide a third year of legal instruction \xe2\x80\x94 and most should (more on that in a bit) \xe2\x80\x94 but students would have the option to forgo that third year, save the high cost of tuition and, ideally, find a job right away that puts their legal training to work.'b'Like many industries today, the legal profession is in the midst of a period of 'b'destabilizing change'b'. Myriad services are now being outsourced (often abroad) to nonlawyers, and the number of positions with large firms is 'b'dwindling'b', making it harder for graduating students \xe2\x80\x94 many of whom are saddled with six-figure student-loan debts \xe2\x80\x94 to find work at the outset of their careers that can even begin to pay off their obligations.'b'Such prospects are discouraging many young people from pursuing law degrees, and pushing away lower-income students the most.'b'Part of the problem is that tuition and fees (which 'b'topped $40,000'b' a year, on average, at private schools in 2012) have been soaring, and law schools must do a better job of containing these costs. We also need more financial aid for students. But a straightforward solution \xe2\x80\x94 one that would shave the current law school bill by a third for those who take this option \xe2\x80\x94 is simply to permit law students to sit for the bar exam and begin practicing even if they have not received a law school degree.'b'While this wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t increase the number of available jobs, a two-year option would allow many newly minted lawyers to pursue careers in the public interest or to work at smaller firms that serve lower- or average-income Americans, thereby fulfilling a largely unmet need. As it is now, many young lawyers say they would love to follow this path but cannot afford to because of their onerous debts.'b'The rationale for reforming the three-year rule, however, is not merely financial. As legal scholars, jurists and experienced attorneys have attested for decades, many law students can, with the appropriate course work, learn in the first two years of law school what they need to get started in their legal careers.'b'In the 1970s, when similar proposals were discussed, two distinguished panels of experts \xe2\x80\x94 one led by Paul D. Carrington, then a University of Michigan law professor, and the other, the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education, overseen by a Stanford law professor and a dean \xe2\x80\x94 issued reports supporting a two-year curriculum, as long as certain essential courses were included.'b'What, then, of the third year, those famous semesters in which, as the saying goes, law schools \xe2\x80\x9c'b'bore you to death'b'\xe2\x80\x9d and student attendance drops like a stone? With this reform, law schools would have an obvious financial incentive to design creative curriculums that law students would want to pursue \xe2\x80\x94 a third-year program of advanced training that would allow those who wished it to become more effective litigators, specialize or better prepare for the real-world legal challenges that lie ahead.'b'We are confident that many law schools will be able to meet that challenge.'b'In fact, that evolution is already going on, as many schools (including our own) reimagine their third-year curriculums through externships, public service programs and courses that offer in-depth practical training.'b'If this trend continues \xe2\x80\x94 and the two-year option would only encourage it \xe2\x80\x94 those who graduate from rigorous three-year programs will not only emerge with sharper legal skills, but also be more essential to employers, raising the rate of job placement out of law school.'b'But legal education is not, nor ever truly has been, a \xe2\x80\x9cone size fits all\xe2\x80\x9d system. We have long had varied routes to the profession. Northwestern, for example, offers an 'b'accelerated'b' program that lets students pursue a three-year course of study in two years, allowing them to take the bar and enter the job market a year earlier. And a handful of states, including New York, allow individuals to take the bar after working for a law office for a number of years, in lieu of going to law school, though this approach is seldom used.'b'Some will argue that the two-year option would only create unequal classes of lawyers and glut the marketplace with attorneys who don\xe2\x80\x99t have the skills and training that generations of law school graduates before them have had.'b'We doubt this will occur. And in any case, the risk ought to be balanced with the varied needs of the American people for legal services. A two-year option, in our view, would provide young lawyers with the training they need to get started, lift a heavy financial burden off the backs of many \xe2\x80\x94 and vastly improve third-year curriculums in the process. That would be a big step in the right direction.'b'THE new reality TV series \xe2\x80\x9cBamazon,\xe2\x80\x9d on the History Channel, along with already established shows like \xe2\x80\x9cGold Rush\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cJungle Gold,\xe2\x80\x9d have elevated the global mining bonanza into living-room entertainment. Each focuses on a different group of Americans seeking their fortune in distant, ostensibly dangerous locales: \xe2\x80\x9cBamazon\xe2\x80\x9d in Guyana, \xe2\x80\x9cGold Rush\xe2\x80\x9d in Alaska and Guyana, and \xe2\x80\x9cJungle Gold\xe2\x80\x9d in Ghana. But while these shows claim to depict \xe2\x80\x9creality,\xe2\x80\x9d they gloss over the most awful truths of gold mining, particularly as it is practiced in the tropics.'b'It is estimated that up to a fourth of global gold production now originates not from licensed, regulated and monitored mines, but from often illegal, unregulated artisanal, or informal, mines \xe2\x80\x94 much like those dramatized in these series. In South America, artisanal gold production, which churns out nearly 450,000 pounds of gold a year, involves millions of people \xe2\x80\x94 about four miners and support labor per pound.'b'Artisanal miners succeed where large, centralized operations fail by evading regulations and targeting gold that has eroded over eons into river sediments, known as placer deposits, that are broadly distributed over vast landscapes.'b'But to get even an ounce of that gold, miners have to upend tons of river sediment. They pump a continuous slurry of sediment and river water over mats that trap minute fractions of gold-enriched dust, discharging their tailings back into the river.'b'Periodically, the accumulated gold dust is separated, and the gold isolated by amalgamating it with mercury. Invariably, the mercury is burned off into the atmosphere or, like the tailings, poured into waterways. Over 1,000 tons of mercury is dumped or burned off annually, and several large rivers have been so exhaustively mined that they simply disappear into vast mud pits that make parts of the Amazon look like the Somme.'b'Much of the gold being sought by the stars of these shows \xe2\x80\x94 and by millions of poorer artisanal miners throughout the tropics \xe2\x80\x94 is buried beneath remote and biodiverse pockets of primary rain forest. In some places, like the boomtown of Puerto Maldonado, Peru, regional gold rushes are fueling mass demographic shifts and unchecked urbanization.'b'In myriad other areas, miners are penetrating deep into poorly monitored headwaters, often crossing national boundaries to create intense pockets of pollution far from any town or airstrip. Many of the indigenous people affected live traditionally in remote corners and are especially susceptible to the disease, violence and promiscuity that accompany miners.'b'Mercury naturally concentrates in fish, a main staple in the diet of many indigenous people. Throughout South America, hundreds of remote and previously pristine rivers have been contaminated, and researchers are finding increasing levels of mercury in many indigenous people, which over time could cause cancer and severe birth defects.'b'And the situation is getting worse. Historically low-tech and dependent on manual labor, artisanal mining is rapidly shifting to heavy machinery and is increasingly plugged into the global economy. Satellite images taken over the last decade show that mining\xe2\x80\x99s environmental impacts have surged in direct proportion to international gold prices.'b'It is particularly unfortunate that these shows run on channels like History and Discovery \xe2\x80\x94 outlets that once capitalized on the images and stories of nature\xe2\x80\x99s bounty. Tropical rivers and forests are marvelously diverse and intricate ecosystems, but the default tendency of these channels is to eschew nuanced portrayals in favor of sensationalist accounts of man-eating fish and reptiles. In this respect, it is perhaps consistent that they now exploit these habitats as a backdrop for glorified plunder.'b'In a promotional clip for \xe2\x80\x9cBamazon,\xe2\x80\x9d one cast member and heavy machinery operator, Clate McDaniel \xe2\x80\x94 described as a nature-loving \xe2\x80\x9cCalifornia hippie\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 expresses a mystic\xe2\x80\x99s anticipation of finding \xe2\x80\x9cplants that can heal\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9ccure for cancer\xe2\x80\x9d in the jungles of Guyana. \xe2\x80\x9cYou never know what you can find in the jungle, it\xe2\x80\x99s untouched in so many places,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, and suggests that his mining team might \xe2\x80\x9cdiscover something new.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We agree. Tropical rain forests and rivers hold an incalculable wealth of undiscovered treasures, each incomparable to gold in its aesthetic beauty. Unfortunately, miners\xe2\x80\x99 fingers are not touching but tearing the fabric of the rain forest, and the potential for scientific discovery decreases with every ounce of gold harvested and every river channel annihilated.'b'Long Island, that strange place jutting east from New York City for 100 miles, was once the very symbol of America\xe2\x80\x99s postwar future, of youth and growth, and is now the opposite of that. It is an old suburb that ran out of places to sprawl, was badly hit by recession a decade ago and again in the latest downturn, and is feeling its age.'b'Many of Long Island\xe2\x80\x99s leaders have warned that it is heading steadily down a long, slow road to ruin. It needs more jobs, cheaper housing, better transit, economic engines to replace the ones that sputtered out. It needs its vitality back.'b'These were the heavy bass notes of what was generally an upbeat meeting of influential Long Islanders on Tuesday at Molloy College in Rockville Centre. It was sponsored by the Long Island Index, a nonprofit organization that issues annual reports on ways the Island can better itself. This year\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'report was on mass transit'b', specifically increasing the capacity and usefulness of the Long Island Rail Road, the sprawling passenger network that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t grown significantly in, oh, a century and a half.'b'Walt Whitman, Long Island\xe2\x80\x99s most famous son, was still a nobody in Brooklyn when the L.I.R.R. completed its main line across the Island in 1844. The village at the eastern end, Greenport, was heavily into shipbuilding and whaling. A lot has changed since then, notably the growth of the island\xe2\x80\x99s population to 2.8 million. But one part of the island \xe2\x80\x94 a troublesome, 10-mile section of the L.I.R.R. between Floral Park and Hicksville in Nassau County \xe2\x80\x94 still lives in the 19th century. It has two tracks, and only two, making it a perennial cause of congestion and delays. Five of the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s branch lines \xe2\x80\x94 and 41 percent of its ridership \xe2\x80\x94 converge there. This bottleneck can be a disaster in bad weather; it also keeps the railroad from sending more trains east from Penn Station, against the regular commuter flow, out to where many jobs are, or could be.'b'The L.I.R.R. wants to add a third track along this 10-mile stretch to shorten commutes, reduce car traffic and take a significant step toward a transit-oriented renaissance. It\xe2\x80\x99s an incredibly simple solution, in theory. But in Nassau, the third track is a third rail, stymied by ferocious not-in-my-backyard protesters who have frightened lawmakers into mumbling inaction.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s an old story on Long Island: When an ambitious project seeks to alter the status quo for the greater good, the Nimby beast rises to kill it. At a workshop on Tuesday, various participants \xe2\x80\x94 including a village mayor, a city manager, town planners and academics \xe2\x80\x94 agreed that Long Island has plenty going for it: proximity to the city, world-class research laboratories, an educated work force, great schools and excellent beaches.'b'But they seemed close to despair about defeating the Nimby crowd. Jim Morgo, a former deputy county executive of Suffolk, said advocates could \xe2\x80\x9cinfiltrate\xe2\x80\x9d civic and neighborhood groups, but what the project most needed was \xe2\x80\x9creally strong leadership from the top. You need courage from the executive and the Legislature.\xe2\x80\x9d You need, as one participant \xe2\x80\x94 a mayor himself \xe2\x80\x94 put it, the willingness to lose an election.'b'So far we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any elected leaders go to the mat for the third track. It would be great if Gov. Andrew Cuomo did. One voice I missed Tuesday was that of a former Nassau County executive, Thomas Suozzi, now a lawyer in private practice, and an early and brilliant booster for building higher-density downtown centers near mass-transit lines to create the jobs and tax base to help support the rest of traditional suburbia.'b'Long Island as we knew it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work anymore, Mr. Suozzi used to say, as he called for a \xe2\x80\x9cNew Suburbia.\xe2\x80\x9d What\xe2\x80\x99s sad is that so many people are content with the old one.'b'State lawmakers in Wyoming didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to hear President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s gun-control proposals on Wednesday in order to attack them. A week ago, before the White House had even decided what actions to take, 'b'Republicans introduced a bill in the Wyoming Legislature'b' to block any federal limitation on firearms, such as an assault weapons ban. A federal agent seeking to enforce such a ban would be guilty of a felony and face five years in prison.'b'This ludicrous bill would be laughable if the idea weren\xe2\x80\x99t spreading. A 'b'similar bill filed in Tennessee'b' would also make federal gun enforcement a state crime, though it\xe2\x80\x99s more \xe2\x80\x9cmoderate\xe2\x80\x9d than Wyoming\xe2\x80\x99s: federal agents doing their jobs would be charged only with Class A misdemeanors. Inevitably, a bill like Wyoming\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'has been filed in Texas'b'. And, in Mississippi, 'b'Gov. Phil Bryant announced'b' that the state would block federal gun measures. A proposed law in the state would claim that Washington has no jurisdiction over weapons made in Mississippi.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s no point in telling these fanatics that federal gun restrictions are completely constitutional, even under the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s latest interpretation of the Second Amendment, or that federal law pre-empts state law. They already know these bills will be unenforceable. They are merely legislative fist-shaking, letting pro-gun voters know that lawmakers share their antipathy to the Obama administration, and signaling to the National Rifle Association and other gun-manufacturing lobbies that they are worthy recipients of rich political contributions.'b'Already, states like these have done enormous damage to public safety by acceding to the N.R.A.\xe2\x80\x99s demands for laws that are anything but symbolic. The gun lobby hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been content with the ability of Americans to lawfully possess hundreds of millions of handguns and assault rifles. It wants gun owners to be able to carry these weapons anywhere they want, even among children, concealed or displayed, and preferably without the annoyance of permits, background checks, or safety precautions.'b'After the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007, the N.R.A. defied logic and pushed a bill to allow guns on college campuses. Thanks to help from the American Legislative Exchange Council, the conservative organization of state lawmakers to which the N.R.A. has contributed heavily, 'b'five states'b' now allow campus guns. Only nine states prohibit guns at sporting events, and just 26 prohibit them where alcohol is served.'b'Wisconsin actually allows guns in the public gallery that looks down on the state assembly, and the N.R.A. 'b'pressured lawmakers last week'b' to keep it that way. The N.R.A. and the American Legislative Exchange Council were behind the \xe2\x80\x9cstand your ground\xe2\x80\x9d laws that allow people to shoot others if they believe they are in danger, which has led to 'b'hundreds of deaths'b' while allowing killers to walk free.'b'State gun laws matter. Of the 10 states with the most restrictive laws, seven also have the lowest gun death rates, 'b'according to a study'b' by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Similarly, lax gun laws correlate to a high level of gun deaths.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s good to see several states step up to their responsibilities to prevent violence instead of following the southern and western states that appear to be encouraging it. 'b'New York was out front this week in passing'b' a ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines, among other measures. A similar ban is 'b'moving ahead in Illinois'b'. New Jersey and Connecticut are moving more slowly, appointing task forces to make recommendations, but are at least heading in the right direction.'b'California is considering legislation that would limit sales of ammunition, requiring background checks and permits for bullet buyers. Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, the site of so much carnage, has reversed his opposition to new restrictions, proposing universal background checks as well as an overhaul of the state mental health system to identify those who should be kept away from weapons.'b'Still, too many states continue to put their citizens at risk as they pledge ever-greater fealty to the gun manufacturers. It\xe2\x80\x99s time the states became laboratories for safety rather than violence.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2'b''b'This is part of a continuing series on the epidemic of gun violence and possible solutions. Other editorials are at\xc2\xa0'b'nytimes.com/gunchallenge'b'.'b''b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to turn on your TV or read an editorial page these days without encountering someone declaring, with an air of great seriousness, that excessive spending and the resulting budget deficit is our biggest problem. Such declarations are rarely accompanied by any argument about why we should believe this; it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be part of what everyone knows.'b'This is, however, a case in which what everyone knows just ain\xe2\x80\x99t so. The budget deficit isn\xe2\x80\x99t our biggest problem, by a long shot. Furthermore, it\xe2\x80\x99s a problem that is already, to a large degree, solved. The medium-term budget outlook isn\xe2\x80\x99t great, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not terrible either \xe2\x80\x94 and the long-term outlook gets much more attention than it should.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s true that right now we have a large federal budget deficit. But that deficit is mainly the result of a depressed economy \xe2\x80\x94 and you\xe2\x80\x99re actually supposed to run deficits in a depressed economy to help support overall demand. The deficit will come down as the economy recovers: Revenue will rise while some categories of spending, such as unemployment benefits, will fall. Indeed, that\xe2\x80\x99s already happening. (And similar things are happening at the state and local levels \xe2\x80\x94 for example, California appears to be back in budget surplus.)'b'Still, will economic recovery be enough to stabilize the fiscal outlook? The answer is, pretty much.'b'Recently the nonpartisan 'b'Center on Budget and Policy Priorities took Congressional Budget Office projections'b' for the next decade and updated them to take account of two major deficit-reduction actions: the spending cuts agreed to in 2011, amounting to almost $1.5 trillion over the next decade; and the roughly $600 billion in tax increases on the affluent agreed to at the beginning of this year. What the center finds is a budget outlook that, as I said, isn\xe2\x80\x99t great but isn\xe2\x80\x99t terrible: It projects that the ratio of debt to G.D.P., the standard measure of America\xe2\x80\x99s debt position, will be only modestly higher in 2022 than it is now.'b'The center calls for another $1.4 trillion in deficit reduction, which would completely stabilize the debt ratio; President Obama has called for roughly the same amount. Even without such actions, however, the budget outlook for the next 10 years doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look at all alarming.'b'Now, projections that run further into the future do suggest trouble, as an aging population and rising health care costs continue to push federal spending higher. But here\xe2\x80\x99s a question you almost never see seriously addressed: Why, exactly, should we believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary, or even possible, to decide right now how we will eventually address the budget issues of the 2030s?'b'Consider, for example, the case of Social Security. There was a case for paying down debt before the baby boomers began to retire, making it easier to pay full benefits later. But George W. Bush squandered the Clinton surplus on tax cuts and wars, and that window has closed. At this point, \xe2\x80\x9creform\xe2\x80\x9d proposals are all about things like raising the retirement age or changing the inflation adjustment, moves that would gradually reduce benefits relative to current law. What problem is this supposed to solve?'b'Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s probable (although not certain) that, within two or three decades, the Social Security trust fund will be exhausted, leaving the system unable to pay the full benefits specified by current law. So the plan is to avoid cuts in future benefits by committing right now to ... cuts in future benefits. Huh?'b'O.K., you can argue that the adjustment to an aging population would be smoother if we commit to a glide path of benefit cuts now. On the other hand, by moving too soon we might lock in benefit cuts that turn out not to have been necessary. And much the same logic applies to Medicare. So there\xe2\x80\x99s a reasonable argument for leaving the question of how to deal with future problems up to future politicians.'b'The point is that the case for urgent action now to reduce spending decades in the future is far weaker than conventional rhetoric might lead you to suspect. And, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like 'b'the case for urgent action on climate change'b'.'b'So, no big problem in the medium term, no strong case for worrying now about long-run budget issues.'b'The deficit scolds dominating policy debate will, of course, fiercely resist any attempt to downgrade their favorite issue. They love living in an atmosphere of fiscal crisis: It lets them stroke their chins and sound serious, and it also provides an excuse for slashing social programs, which often seems to be their real objective.'b'But neither the current deficit nor projected future spending deserve to be anywhere near the top of our political agenda. It\xe2\x80\x99s time to focus on other stuff \xe2\x80\x94 like the still-depressed state of the economy and the still-terrible problem of long-term unemployment.'b'President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s second inaugural comes at an interesting moment, what you might call the end of the era of the Grand Bargain. Throughout his first term, Democrats and Republicans didn\xe2\x80\x99t achieve a Grand Bargain on spending and taxes, but there was a sense that history was moving in that direction.'b'The Simpson-Bowles commission sketched out a vision of what a Grand Bargain might look like. Obama and John Boehner tried to craft some semi-Grand Bargains. There was a lot of talk at think tanks of what the best combination of tax reform and entitlement reform might be.'b'The \xe2\x80\x9cfiscal-cliff\xe2\x80\x9d fiasco has persuaded many smart people that a Grand Bargain is not going to happen any time soon. A political class that botched the fiscal cliff so badly are not going to be capable of a gigantic deal on complex issues. It\xe2\x80\x99s like going into a day care center and asking a bunch of infants to perform \xe2\x80\x9cSwan Lake.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Polarization is too deep. Special interests are too strong. The negotiators are too rusty. Republicans are not going to give up their vision of a low-tax America. Democrats are not willing to change the current entitlement programs.'b'So as the president enters his second term, there has to be a new controlling narrative, a new strategy for how to spend the next four years.'b'As you know, I am an earnest, good-government type, so the strategy I\xe2\x80\x99d prefer might be called Learning to Crawl. It would be based on the notion that you have to learn to crawl before you can run. So over the next four years, legislators should work on a series of realistic, incremental laws that would rebuild the habits of compromise, competence and trust.'b'We could do some education reform, expand visa laws to admit more high-skill workers, encourage responsible drilling for natural gas, maybe establish an infrastructure bank. Political leaders would erode partisan orthodoxies and get back into the habit of passing laws together. Then, down the road, their successors could do the big things.'b'I may be earnest, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not an idiot. I know there is little chance that today\xe2\x80\x99s partisan players are going to adopt this kind of incremental goo-goo approach. It\xe2\x80\x99s more likely that today\xe2\x80\x99s majority party is going to adopt a different strategy, which you might call Kill the Wounded. It\xe2\x80\x99s more likely that today\xe2\x80\x99s Democrats are going to tell themselves something like this:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe live at a unique moment. Our opponents, the Republicans, are divided, confused and bleeding. This is not the time to allow them to rebuild their reputation with a series of modest accomplishments. This is the time to kick them when they are down, to win back the House and end the current version of the Republican Party.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFirst, we change the narrative. The president ran in 2008 against Washington dysfunction, casting blame on both parties. Over the years, he has migrated to a different narrative: The Republicans are crazy. Washington could be working fine, but the Republicans are crazy.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt every public appearance, the president should double-down on that theme. The Democratic base already believes it. The media is sympathetic. Independents could be persuaded.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen, wedge issues. The president should propose no new measures that might unite Republicans, the way health care did in the first term. Instead, he should raise a series of wedge issues meant to divide Southerners from Midwesterners, the Tea Party/Talk Radio base from the less ideological corporate and managerial class.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s already started with a perfectly designed gun control package, inviting a long battle with the N.R.A. over background checks and magazine clips. That will divide the gun lobby from suburbanites. Then he can re-introduce Bush\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive immigration reform. That will divide the anti-immigration groups from the business groups (conventional wisdom underestimates how hard it is going to be for Republicans to back comprehensive reforms).'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen he could invite a series of confrontations with Republicans over things like the debt ceiling \xe2\x80\x94 make them look like wackos willing to endanger the entire global economy. Along the way, he could highlight women\xe2\x80\x99s issues, social mobility issues (student loans, community college funding) and pick fights on compassion issues, (hurricane relief) \xe2\x80\x94 promoting any small, popular spending programs that Republicans will oppose.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTwice a month, Democrats should force Republicans to cast an awful vote: either offend mainstream supporters or risk a primary challenge from the right.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Just as Senator Mitch McConnell made defeating President Obama his main political objective, Democrats seem likely to make winning back the House their primary political objective. Experts are divided on how plausible this is, but the G.O.P. is unpopular and the opportunity is there.'b'This isn\xe2\x80\x99t the Washington I want to cover, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the most likely one.

Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan who left lasting legacies. He has carefully studied what made those great presidents great. But he can also learn from presidents known primarily for their failures.'b'Consider, for example, James Monroe \xe2\x80\x94 the only person, besides Mr. Obama, to be the third president in a row to be re-elected. His first term, which began in 1817, was known as the Era of Good Feelings because it coincided with the demise of any viable opposition party. When he was re-elected in 1820, he won every electoral vote but one. Yet most Americans know nothing about his presidency except perhaps the Monroe Doctrine, which pledged American intervention to protect the Americas from European interference.'b'Once wildly popular, Monroe is now barely remembered. First, his legislative achievements eroded over time. He signed two of the most important laws of the 19th century: the Missouri Compromise, which admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, and the Tenure of Office Act of 1820, which restricted the terms of certain officials in the executive branch. But subsequent presidents tried to repeal or amend the laws, and the Supreme Court eventually declared both unconstitutional.'b'Second, Monroe had no distinctive constitutional vision. The last member of a \xe2\x80\x9cVirginia dynasty,\xe2\x80\x9d starting with Washington, Jefferson and Madison, he lacked their vision or stature. Even without opposition, Monroe was unsure where to lead the country. His last two years in office were so fractious that they became known as \xe2\x80\x9cthe era of bad feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d His collapse was extraordinary in its speed.'b'Third, Monroe, unlike his predecessor, Madison, had no natural heir. Subsequent presidents, including his successor, John Quincy Adams, who had been his secretary of state, felt little fidelity to his legacy.'b'If Mr. Obama wants to avoid Monroe\xe2\x80\x99s mistakes, he must extend the narrative of his presidency with a view to posterity. He should consider whom he wants to follow him and which of his legislative initiatives Republicans might support. If Mr. Obama doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get involved in the next election or cannot produce significant bipartisan achievements, he risks having his successors belittle or bury his legacy.'b'Grover Cleveland, who also served two terms (though they were not consecutive), is even more forgotten than Monroe. He was the only Democrat elected in the late 19th century and the only president other than Roosevelt to have won a plurality of the popular vote in three consecutive presidential elections. (Benjamin Harrison won the Electoral College in 1888, despite having received fewer votes.)'b'Cleveland is forgotten because he blocked rather than built. He devoted his first term, 1885 to 1889, to vetoing laws that he thought favored special interests. He eventually cast more vetoes than any president except Franklin Roosevelt. In his second term, from 1893 to 1897, the Senate retaliated against his efforts to replace executive officials by stalling hundreds of his nominations. Cleveland successfully appealed to the public to break the impasse with the Senate, but his contempt for Congress took its toll.'b'In his second term, his disdain for Congress, bullying and stubbornness prevented him from any meaningful action to relieve the depression that followed the Panic of 1893. Mr. Obama, whose relations with Congress, even members of his own party, have often been distant, should take heed.'b'Unlike Cleveland, Calvin Coolidge had the vision and rhetoric required for an enduring legacy, but he, too, failed the test of time. Virtually unknown when he became vice president to Warren G. Harding, Coolidge inherited a scandal-ridden administration when Harding died in 1923. He worked with Congress to root out corruption, established regular press briefings and handily won the 1924 election. Over the next four years, he signed the most significant federal disaster relief bill until Hurricane Katrina and the first federal regulation of broadcasting and aviation. He helped enact the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which famously (and unsuccessfully) tried to outlaw war.'b'Coolidge\xe2\x80\x99s vision had wide appeal. His conviction that the business of America is business still resonates among many Republicans, but he squandered his good will with the Republican-led Senate when, shortly after his inauguration in 1925, he insisted on renominating Charles Warren as attorney general after the Senate had rejected his nomination. Coolidge could have easily been elected to a second full term, but he lost interest in politics after his son died in 1924. He did not help his secretary of commerce, Herbert Hoover, win the presidency in 1928 and said nothing as the economy lapsed into the Great Depression. He was widely ridiculed for his penchant for silence. The eventual recognition of the failures of his international initiatives and laissez-faire economic policies destroyed his legacy.'b'A final president whose failures are instructive to Mr. Obama is Jimmy Carter. He is best praised for what he has done since leaving office, but Americans have forgotten that he actually accomplished almost everything he wanted legislatively, including landmark laws on the environment and government ethics. Carter\xe2\x80\x99s failure to communicate a positive vision of his presidency was arguably even more significant in his defeat in the 1980 election than the Iran hostage crisis and the high inflation of the late 1970s.'b'Being re-elected does not ensure Mr. Obama a permanent legacy. His challenge is to frame an inspiring vision that ties together the formidable achievements of his first term \xe2\x80\x94 the health care overhaul, the auto industry rescue, reform of financial regulations, withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan and the killing of Osama bin Laden \xe2\x80\x94 \xc2\xa0with goals, still not strongly articulated, for his second. He has to tell a story of his presidency that he wants Americans to remember and not allow others, particularly his detractors, to frame the narrative.'b'In this deeply partisan era, Mr. Obama won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to stand above the fray like Monroe and Coolidge, but he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t become mired in it, like Cleveland and Carter. He must work with Congress rather than becoming embroiled in battles with it.'b'On several issues, including gay rights and the debt ceiling, Mr. Obama has appeared detached from the political process \xe2\x80\x94 \xc2\xa0 following rather than leading. He has only a few years\xc2\xa0to build on the real achievements of his first term and be remembered as something more than having been the first black president. By examining the failures of predecessors like Monroe, Cleveland, Coolidge and Carter, he can avoid suffering a similar disheartening fate.'b'A FEW years ago, I awoke at 2:30 a.m. to more than a \xe2\x80\x9crapping, rapping at my chamber door.\xe2\x80\x9d It was a full-force pounding of a body trying to break into my little house in Washington, D.C.

I watched as the wood expanded with each pound. The white paint splintered some. The deadbolt held at the top, but the bottom half of the door popped open, letting in the steam heat from the summer night. I took that chair and slammed it so the side pushed the door back in line with the frame. I held that chair with everything my 5 foot 3 inches had. My dog sat right by me on the rug, ready.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe police are outside,\xe2\x80\x9d the dispatcher said.'b'I let go of the chair\xe2\x80\x99s arms and thanked the woman for staying on the phone with me. I answered the questions from the police and looked at the drunk man in the back of the patrol car, kicking at the seats. When they left, I pushed the couch, chair, coffee table and even a lamp in front of the locked door. I did that every night for a week until a steel-gated security door was installed.'b'And then, I did more.'b'I considered buying a gun. The threat of violence rattles you like that. What rolled round my head after that dark morning was: what if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard the noise, what if it\xe2\x80\x99s different next time? While I held that chair with all of my strength, I wished that I had had a gun because if he had gotten in, then I could have pointed it at him, maybe deterred him and if necessary pulled the trigger.'b'So I looked at guns. Some had mother-of-pearl handles and looked like something Mae West would use in a movie. Others were Glocks, shotguns and rifles. I had gone as far as to dial the number of the Metropolitan Police Department\xe2\x80\x99s firearms registration division and begin the process. Then I stopped and put my BlackBerry down.'b'I remembered who I am.'b'I am one of the millions of people in this country who live with depression. I knew that in the gun registration form there would be a version of this question: Have you ever voluntarily or involuntarily been committed to a hospital? The answer is yes \xe2\x80\x94 voluntarily. But because my hospitalization was years earlier and I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in treatment at the time, I could have gotten a gun.'b'My depression appeared for the first time in the late \xe2\x80\x9990s, right before I began writing for politicians. It comes and goes like fog. Medicine can help. I have my tricks to manage and get through it. Sometimes it sticks around for a day or a week, and sometimes it stays away for a couple of years. But it never leads me to sleep all day, cry and wear sweat pants like the people in the commercials. You\xe2\x80\x99d look at me and never know that sometimes my fight against the urge to die is so tough the only way I get through it is second by second; I live by the second hand.'b'According to the 'b'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention'b', 38,364 Americans lost that fight in 2010 and committed suicide; 'b'19,392'b' used a gun. No one ever attempted to break down my door in the early morning again, but I had an episode when my depression did come back in full force in the early winter of 2009, after I made a career-ending decision and isolated myself too much; on a January night in 2010; and again in May 2012, after testifying in the federal criminal trial of John Edwards, my former boss. If I had purchased that gun and it had been in my possession, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I would have been able to resist and would be here typing these words.'b'The other day, the president and the vice president announced their plans to curb gun violence in the wake of the shooting in Newtown, Conn. I agree with all of their measures. But I believe they should be bolder and stop walking on eggshells about what to do with people like me and those not even close to being like me but still labeled with the crazy term \xe2\x80\x9cmentally ill.\xe2\x80\x9d The executive actions the president signed to increase access and treatment are all good, although the experts will struggle with confidentiality and privacy issues.'b'But since most people like me are more likely to harm ourselves than to turn into mass-murdering monsters, our leaders should do more to keep us safe from ourselves.'b'Please take away my Second Amendment right. Do more to help us protect ourselves because what\xe2\x80\x99s most likely to wake me in the early hours isn\xe2\x80\x99t a man\xe2\x80\x99s body slamming at my door but depression, that raven, tapping, rapping, banging for relief.'b'I have a better chance of surviving if I never have the option of being able to pull the trigger.'b'WASHINGTON'b'ON the second day of my chemical-detox diet, I was very hungry. I\xe2\x80\x99d been eating like a rabbit, all carrots and greens that I\xe2\x80\x99d gathered, barehanded, from the baskets of the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s market, no gloves or plastic bags allowed. I cooked up some quinoa that I bought packaged in paper from the supermarket sometimes known as Whole Paycheck. I was effectively a vegan because I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find meat or cheese that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t wrapped in plastic, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have access to accommodating livestock.'b'My 7-year-old daughter and I were participating in a pilot study conducted in 2011 by the Silent Spring Institute and the 'b'Breast Cancer'b' Fund (a 'b'follow-up study'b' was published later that year in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives). We had urinated into some glass containers a few weeks earlier, back when we were \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d Americans, and now we were spending three days trying to reduce our exposure to plastics before supplying our urine again.'b'We wanted to see what it would take to nudge down our bodies\xe2\x80\x99 levels of a handful of common chemicals with the potential to mimic or disrupt hormones, including phthalates (found in some plastics and added to products like lotions to bind fragrances), triclosan (an antibacterial ingredient in many soaps, toothpastes and cutting boards) and 'b'bisphenol A'b' (or BPA, a plastic-hardener and epoxy additive that may affect children\xe2\x80\x99s brain development and that some believe may be linked to breast and 'b'prostate'b' cancers).'b'Manufacturers have phased BPA out of some products, and last year, the Food and Drug Administration 'b'outlawed its use in baby bottles'b' and sippy cups. This month Suffolk County, N.Y., 'b'banned certain cash register receipts'b' that carry it.'b'Risks aside, the normal phase was a lot more fun. My daughter and I painted our toenails, took floral-scented bubble baths, ate refried beans out of a can and drank a couple of sodas. Go America! For detox, I became an isolated Anxiety Mom. We scrubbed off the nail polish. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t venture far from home because I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ride in a car (phthalates waft out of plastic interiors) or shop (because of those store receipts). That turned out to be something of a relief, since I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wear makeup or deodorant. I lost three pounds. It was practically like living in the 19th century, except for my trusty bicycle helmet, which I wore despite the fact that it is a terrific example of the technology BPA makes possible.'b'A 'b'study published in 2010'b' found a very effective way to reduce urinary phthalate levels was to live meatless in a Buddhist temple for five days. A 'b'study'b' recently published in the journal NeuroToxicology found that pregnant women in Old Order Mennonite communities, which eschew many modern conveniences, had urinary BPA levels one-fourth the national median. Those Mennonites eat more fresh food than the rest of us and make their own dairy products, but they also buy fewer consumer goods, which can be additional sources of BPA. The chemical is found in dental fillings, eyeglass lenses and CDs, among other products.'b'In lab-animal studies, BPA has been linked to mammary gland tumors, prostate and urethra problems and cardiac irregularities. The Food and Drug Administration maintains that BPA is safe in low levels, although in 2010 it expressed \xe2\x80\x9c'b'some concern'b' about the potential effects of BPA on the brain, behavior and prostate gland in fetuses, infants and young children.\xe2\x80\x9d And yet, last year\xe2\x80\x99s bottle announcement seemed to be less about protecting infants than about putting confused parents at ease.'b'If anything, it has had the opposite effect. Parents who were worried about exposing their babies to a hormone-mimicking substance are just as worried about exposing their unborn children to it in the womb, or passing it along to newborns through 'b'breast milk'b'. New sippy cups won\xe2\x80\x99t change that.'b'One thing that could is adopting my extreme detox regime. My original BPA level was 5.1 nanograms per\xc2\xa0milliliter of urine, putting me in the upper quartile of Americans. (Levels here are, incidentally, twice those of Canada, which began restricting some uses of BPA in 2008.) After my three days of detox, my level dropped to 0.8, for an 84 percent reduction (I was not quite able to out-Mennonite the Mennonites \xe2\x80\x94 their everyday level was 0.71). My daughter\xe2\x80\x99s level dropped even lower, to 0.65. That\xe2\x80\x99s my little cave girl. The researchers speculated that perhaps my polycarbonate eyeglasses kept me from shedding more BPA.'b'In fact it\xe2\x80\x99s surprisingly easy to change our bodies\xe2\x80\x99 BPA chemistry; it just requires a big shift in eating habits and behavior for most of us. The substance passes in and out of the body quickly, but we are fed it in a daily drip.'b'So is it time to crank up my crank meter and demand that my children step away from the rubber duckie and join a religious sect? No. I like modern life, and I really like those canned refrieds.'b'Parents have enough to worry about without scrutinizing labels of baby bottles and wearing hazmat gloves to the grocery store. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we should be relieved when the F.D.A. and local governments like Suffolk County help take over this doleful parenting task for us. It\xe2\x80\x99s why we need the government to require testing of commercial chemicals for hormonal effects, and to regulate them in a meaningful way. And it\xe2\x80\x99s why we need manufacturers to design products with safer substances in the first place.'b'As far as my family is concerned, we can eat only so much quinoa out of a paper bag.'b'This is a month when anyone with a telescope or good binoculars can gaze up at one of the brightest objects in the night sky and revisit a staggering achievement in astronomy: 'b'Galileo\xe2\x80\x99s discovery'b', over several January days in 1610, of Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s four largest moons.'b'At first, Galileo thought he was seeing stars. But watching them move in relation to Jupiter, he figured out what they really were \xe2\x80\x94 an epiphany that began to upend the given view of the universe. Here was a celestial body with other celestial bodies circling it. For a biblical cosmology that placed Earth at the center of all that moved, the implications would prove devastating.'b'The Morgan Library and Museum in Manhattan has a beautifully preserved relic of that scientific triumph: the scrap of an 'b'envelope'b' on which Galileo, in 1611, tracked the shifting positions of the Jovian moons. He had published his findings about the moons the year before in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Starry Messenger,\xe2\x80\x9d and he was working, night after night, to better define the periods of the moons\xe2\x80\x99 orbits. In his (literally!) back-of-the-envelope jottings and little pictures, one can sense a great mind puzzling out a perplexing story.'b'Galileo\xe2\x80\x99s achievement was the end of geocentrism, but it was hardly the end of ignorance and magical thinking. When obstinacy places reason under siege, as it does to this day \xe2\x80\x94 when fundamentalism defames biological science in the classroom, or the politics of denial prevent action to deal with a changing climate, it helps to recall our debt to a man who set a different example more than 400 years ago. It took just a wooden tube and some polished lenses, a critical and inquisitive mind, and four points of light that didn\xe2\x80\x99t behave the way they were supposed to.'b'When Patricia Durkin was 19, she began having hallucinations. Later, the paranoid thoughts began. When she was 22, doctors diagnosed schizophrenia.'b'Now 59, Ms. Durkin, who lives in Brooklyn, controls her mental illness with medication. Ms. Durkin also has been going intermittently for about 25 years to Brooklyn Community Services, an agency supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.'b'She participates in programs for adults with persistent mental illness and has made some progress in the last couple of years, like learning to go shopping alone. But she misses her mother, who used to visit her every Saturday. The visits stopped four years ago when her mother went to live in a nursing home in New Jersey. And Ms. Durkin, who is afraid to use public transportation, has not seen her mother since. Meditation and relaxation music help to control Ms. Durkin\xe2\x80\x99s anxieties. Recently, the Brooklyn agency used $100 from the Neediest Cases Fund to buy Ms. Durkin music and a CD player to use at home. One of her goals is to feel comfortable enough to make a trip to see her mother again.'b'Donations to The Times\xe2\x80\x99s Neediest Cases Fund go to seven charities: Brooklyn Community Services; Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York; Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens; the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Aid Society; the Community Service Society of New York; the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies; and the UJA-Federation of New York.

And prosecuting a capital case in Maryland costs three times as much as pursuing a homicide conviction that carries a sentence of life without parole. In short, the penalty has been a huge waste of taxpayer money on a policy that manifestly does not work. Significantly, he said, the state has gathered sobering proof that its use of the death penalty has been so unfair \xe2\x80\x94 so arbitrary and capricious \xe2\x80\x94 as to be unjust and immoral.'b'The Maryland Commission on Capital Punishment 'b'reported'b' in 2008 that the \xe2\x80\x9cadministration of the death penalty clearly shows racial bias\xe2\x80\x9d and that the chances of a state prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cseeking and imposing a death sentence differs alarmingly across jurisdictions in Maryland, even when the cases are similar.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In addition, the reversal rate in Maryland death penalty cases has been stunningly high; it was 80 percent for the years 1995 to 2007, the commission reported. Prosecutors have withheld potentially exculpatory evidence. Judges have made decisions that were unfair to defendants. The police have forced involuntary confessions.'b'Four years ago, the Maryland Legislature chose not to repeal the state\xe2\x80\x99s death penalty law and instead made it the most stringent in the country. A person cannot be sentenced to death without DNA evidence tying a defendant to the murder, a videotaped voluntary confession or a videotape of the crime. But this law makes the state\xe2\x80\x99s administration of capital punishment even more arbitrary and capricious, since this evidence is so rarely collected.'b'As a practical matter, Maryland cannot execute anyone now. Its highest court 'b'ruled'b' in 2006 that the state cannot use the lethal injection protocol devised by the corrections department because the Legislature did not review and approve it, as state law requires. In fact, the state has not executed anyone since 2005. But the law remains on the books, and the time has come to abolish it.'b'As Governor O\xe2\x80\x99Malley said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe know what does not work. And we know that the way forward is always found through greater respect for the human dignity of all.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Bloomberg administration\xe2\x80\x99s failure to reach an agreement with the New York City teachers\xe2\x80\x99 union on the details of a state-mandated teacher evaluation system by the Thursday deadline has cost the city hundreds of millions of dollars in state money. The State Education Department notified the city on Friday that it would face even harsher penalties if it failed to promptly establish a timeline and budget for complying with the law.'b'Under a 2010 state law, which was passed by the Legislature in a bid to win nearly $700 million in competitive grants from the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s Race to the Top program, the state was required to create a new teacher evaluation system. The old system, which everyone agreed was terrible, relied on spotty observations by administrators and found an overwhelming majority of teachers \xe2\x80\x9csatisfactory\xe2\x80\x9d whether or not they were performing in the job.'b'The new system rates teachers as \xe2\x80\x9chighly effective,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ceffective,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdeveloping\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cineffective.\xe2\x80\x9d Those rated as \xe2\x80\x9cineffective\xe2\x80\x9d for two consecutive years can be dismissed through an expedited process. The state law requires that 60 percent of a teacher\xe2\x80\x99s score be based on subjective measures like classroom observation and 20 percent based on students\xe2\x80\x99 academic improvement on state tests. Another 20 percent is to be based on locally approved measures of student achievement, to be decided with the union.'b'According to the State Education Department, 99 percent of the state\xe2\x80\x99s nearly 700 school districts managed to negotiate new evaluation systems by the Thursday deadline, thus avoiding sanctions that could lead to a loss of state aid. New York City, by contrast, mounted a disastrous negotiation process that failed at the 11th hour, leading to the loss of $240 million in state aid and endangering more than $250 million in federal grants.'b'The city blames the union, asserting that the union wanted a two-year \xe2\x80\x9csunset\xe2\x80\x9d provision that would render the evaluation provision inoperative in 2015, making it extremely difficult to dismiss ineffective teachers. The union disputes this interpretation, countering that Mayor Bloomberg simply blew up the deal when his negotiators came to him with an agreement he did not like. In any case, the sunset provision should not be an obstacle. According to state estimates, 90 percent of the evaluation systems in the state have similar provisions, which would allow local officials to revisit the newly developed evaluation systems and dismissal policies to make sure that they are fair and working as planned.'b'The state education commissioner, John King Jr., was not persuaded by the city\xe2\x80\x99s argument and expressed disappointment that the negotiations broke off over what he described as minor disagreements. He noted in a letter on Friday to the New York City schools chancellor, Dennis Walcott, that the city would lose more state aid if it failed to make clear progress on the evaluation system very soon. If the city fails to comply, the state will refuse to approve city spending plans for about $1 billion in federal education aid \xe2\x80\x94 and might even take the unusual step of redirecting a portion of the money for other purposes.'b'To avoid that disastrous outcome, Mr. Bloomberg and the union will need to return to the bargaining table and get this deal done as quickly as possible. If the two sides fail to arrive at an agreement very soon, the state should continue turning up the pressure on every front, to make sure that the city complies with the law and that its schoolchildren get the credible teacher evaluation systems they clearly need.'b'In 2006, Cerberus Capital Management, the private equity firm run by the secretive financier Steven Feinberg, set out to raise $6.5 billion in a new fund called Cerberus Institutional Partners Series IV. Feinberg\xe2\x80\x99s reputation for extracting value from troubled companies \xe2\x80\x94 by replacing management, shuttering facilities and creating \xe2\x80\x9cefficiencies\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 was such that by May 2007, when the fund was finally closed, it had gotten commitments for nearly $1 billion more than it had sought.'b'Cerberus Institutional Partners Series IV is the fund that took over Chrysler in 2007. It bought General Motors\xe2\x80\x99 financing arm, now called Ally Financial. It gobbled up hospitals, purchased bus companies, and even bought the raunchy magazine Maxim.'b'It is also 'b'the fund that bought Bushmaster Firearms'b', the company that made the assault weapon 'b'used by Adam Lanza'b' to massacre 20 children and seven adults in Newtown, Conn., last month. 'b'It bought Remington Arms'b', the maker of the pump-action shotgun 'b'that was among the guns James Holmes used'b' to kill 12 people and wound 58 in Aurora, Colo. It bought a handful of other firearms companies, which it then merged into a new parent company, Freedom Group. At which point, Cerberus was the largest manufacturer of guns and ammunition in the country.'b'Not long ago, I obtained a partial list of the institutional investors that committed money to the Cerberus fund. One of the investors, the 'b'California State Teachers\xe2\x80\x99 Retirement System'b', which put in $500 million, 'b'has already announced that it will divest its gun holdings'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be investing in things like that,\xe2\x80\x9d says Bill Lockyer, the California state treasurer. He noted that assault weapons are illegal in California.'b'Most of the other big investors, however, have kept their heads down. TIAA-CREF, the financial services giant, committed $147.8 million to the Series IV fund. (\xe2\x80\x9cNo comment,\xe2\x80\x9d said a spokesman.) The 'b'State of Wisconsin Investment Board'b' put up $100 million. The 'b'University of Texas endowment'b' made a $75 million commitment; the 'b'Regents of the University of California'b' kicked in $40 million; the 'b'University of Missouri endowment'b' was an investor. So were 'b'the Los Angeles Fire and Police Pension'b' system, the 'b'Indiana Public Retirement System'b', and the 'b'Pennsylvania Public School Employees\xe2\x80\x99 Retirement System'b' (which kicked in $400 million). And plenty of others.'b'When I called these investors to ask their rationale for investing in a fund that financed a gun \xe2\x80\x9croll-up,\xe2\x80\x9d as the Cerberus strategy is called, I got three main responses. The first was that the percentage of their investment that went to Freedom Group was minuscule. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a very small investment in Bushmaster, which translates to about $1 million,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dianne Klein, a spokeswoman for the University of California system. (She added that the California system was going to divest its gun holdings.) Jennifer Hollingshead at the University of Missouri told me that the endowment\xe2\x80\x99s exposure was less than $450,000 \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cwhich represents about 0.01 percent of our total portfolio.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The second response was that, as limited partners, the institutional investors didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a say in how Cerberus invested the money. The fact that Feinberg decided to buy companies whose guns have repeatedly been used for mass slaughter was, in effect, his decision to make.'b'The third was that the core duty of a pension fund or university endowment is to maximize returns. Nobody made this point more vehemently than Bruce Zimmerman, a spokesman for the University of Texas Investment Management Company. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have no plans to divest,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe invest strictly on economic considerations, and we do not take into account social and political consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Cerberus never tried to hide what it was doing. And why would it? It was proud of its gun strategy. It held annual meetings with its investors and talked freely about Freedom Group. Investors were also aware that in 2010, 'b'Cerberus had tried'b' (and failed) to take Freedom Group public.'b'But until Newtown, none of the investors gave the business a second\xe2\x80\x99s thought. Aurora, Fort Hood, Wisconsin \xe2\x80\x94 and dozens of other mass slaughters \xe2\x80\x94 came and went, and the investors stuck with Cerberus.'b'Newtown, it is often said, has changed that dynamic, sensitizing the country to the insanity of its gun laws, and giving gun control advocates hope that reform might finally be possible. But with the tragedy barely a month old, you can already feel the pushback. Supporters of the National Rifle Association in Congress are vowing to resist any effort to tighten the nation\xe2\x80\x99s gun laws. Gun-friendly state legislators are pushing absurd laws aimed at pre-empting federal gun legislation. And then there are the investors, who have a unique ability to push companies to change, if they so choose. (Just recall the South African boycott.)'b'What I learned this week is that, Newtown notwithstanding, too many of them have other priorities. Making money is still more important than saving lives.'b'There is nothing the world loves more than an athlete who\xe2\x80\x99s playing the game on behalf of a dying loved one.'b'In the land of sports, people who have terminal illnesses are always more interested in the team\xe2\x80\x99s fortunes than in having their son/brother/lover/best friend at their bedside. The story\xe2\x80\x99s been a staple ever since the expiring Ronald Reagan told Notre Dame to \xe2\x80\x9cwin just one for the Gipper\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cKnute Rockne \xe2\x80\x94 All American.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And now we have Manti Te\xe2\x80\x99o, the star linebacker for Notre Dame, whose dying girlfriend turned out to be imaginary. But imaginary with a lot of team spirit. \xe2\x80\x9cBabe, if anything happens to me, you promise that you\xe2\x80\x99ll stay there and you\xe2\x80\x99ll play and you\xe2\x80\x99ll honor me through the way you play,\xe2\x80\x9d she told him when she was critically injured in a car crash, fell into a coma and then emerged to learn she had leukemia. When she was conscious, she devoted much of her time to writing inspirational letters to Te\xe2\x80\x99o before each game.'b'Such a girlfriend does not exist. Somebody made her up, and the sports world is currently debating whether Te\xe2\x80\x99o was the victim of a hoax, or part of the conspiracy.'b'All I can say is, the story tells you a lot.'b'Fans cheered when Te\xe2\x80\x99o played through what he said was the day of the funeral of his girlfriend, Lennay Kekua, who died on the same day as his actual grandmother. (\xe2\x80\x9cI knew...that my girlfriend and my family would want me to be out there. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want me to be sulking over things,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Sports Illustrated.)'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s the American way. But as the story unfolded, it turned out that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t 'b'ever'b' require his presence. In an interview with Sports Illustrated, Te\xe2\x80\x99o said that at one point, he was on his way home to Hawaii for summer break when the comatose Lennay almost died in a hospital in California. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were scheduled to pull the plug while I was in the air,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Sports Illustrated.'b'It didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to occur to him that he might have dropped by. Do you think this is a young-man fantasy \xe2\x80\x94 a girlfriend so lacking in neediness that you don\xe2\x80\x99t even have to visit her in the hospital while she\xe2\x80\x99s in a coma followed by leukemia?'b'In fact, there was apparently never any physical connection. They talked on the phone. Texted all the time. But the star linebacker \xe2\x80\x94 who reportedly saw other flesh-and-blood girls on campus \xe2\x80\x94 didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to feel this special romance was lacking anything simply because it had no three-dimensional aspects.'b'Maybe in an era when \xe2\x80\x9cdating\xe2\x80\x9d seems to mean \xe2\x80\x9csend texts about whether to get together later,\xe2\x80\x9d this counts as a fulfilling relationship.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s possible Te\xe2\x80\x99o was the credulous victim of an elaborate trick. But he was surrounded by a veritable army of coaches, chaplains and mentors, who were presumably privy to the Lennay saga from the start. Certainly they knew all about it when the Notre Dame publicity machine made it a core part of the football team\xe2\x80\x99s undefeated-until-the-championship-game season. But nobody seemed to raise an eyebrow.'b'If you listened to the story while sitting next to Te\xe2\x80\x99o on a 'b'bus'b', you would have warned him not to tell a national TV audience about this girlfriend until he got some proof she actually existed. (\xe2\x80\x9cWe met just, ummmm, just she knew my cousin. And kind of saw me there so. Just kind of regular,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Sports Illustrated.)'b'But nobody at Notre Dame seems to have paid enough attention to figure out that the girl at the center of their winning-season story existed in the same universe as the Little Mermaid.'b'Right after Christmas, Te\xe2\x80\x99o told his coach that a woman who sounded like the dead girlfriend had called him to say she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t deceased after all. The coach told the higher ups, and Notre Dame hired an outside firm to investigate the case. When an expos\xc3\xa9 broke on the Web site Deadspin, the school\xe2\x80\x99s athletic director, Jack Swarbrick, held a press conference to tearfully announce that the investigation showed that Te\xe2\x80\x99o was the victim of a \xe2\x80\x9cvery elaborate, sophisticated hoax perpetrated for reasons we can\xe2\x80\x99t fully understand. But it had a cruelty at its core.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This all occurred a couple of years after the Notre Dame team was involved in a genuine tragedy when a freshman from a neighboring girls\xe2\x80\x99 college reported she had been sexually assaulted by a football player. The school did not order up an outside investigation. In fact, there appeared to be no investigation at all. After a period of dead silence in which she received a threatening text from a friend of the player, the girl died from an overdose of medication. Nothing else happened. Writing this week in The Washington Post, Melinda Henneberger, a Notre Dame graduate, noted that \xe2\x80\x9cmy alma mater held the kind of emotional news conference for the fake dead girl they never held for the real one, Lizzy Seeberg.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Game\xe2\x80\x99s over. Notre Dame loses.'b'IN the first three weeks or so of trading this year, the Standard &amp; Poor\xe2\x80\x99s 500-stock index, a measure of the broad market, has climbed more than 4 percent \xe2\x80\x94 and on Jan. 18, in fact, closed at its 'b'highest level'b' since December 2007. Last January, the S.&amp;P. 500 rose 4.4 percent \xe2\x80\x94 a blistering pace that, if kept up for the rest of 2012, would have translated into a compound annual return of nearly 67 percent. (Alas, it did not.) January 2011 was also a hot one for stocks, its monthly return translating into an annualized gain of 31 percent.'b'Mention such returns to the average Wall Street type and you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to get a yawn. Going back to the 1920s, after all, the first month of the year has, with striking regularity, been a great time to invest \xe2\x80\x94 a phenomenon known, fittingly, as \xe2\x80\x9cthe 'b'January Effect'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'First discussed in a 'b'1942'b' article by the investment banker Sidney B. Wachtel, this celebrated winter anomaly has two components: the stock market tends to do well over all in January, and small-company shares typically outperform large stocks. For the rest of the year, the latter trend often reverses, and big stocks beat the small fry.'b'Why exactly the January Effect persists is a mystery \xe2\x80\x94 in an efficient market, such calendar-driven bonanzas aren\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to happen.'b'Some believe the phenomenon is a result of tax-loss selling: investors dump their loser stocks in December to recognize a capital loss and then buy them back in January, pushing up share prices. Others say it\xe2\x80\x99s because of institutional money managers, who shed their weakest-performing or riskiest-looking small stocks before Dec. 31 so that their reported year-end holdings look better to clients. Like the tax-loss sellers, these \xe2\x80\x9cwindow dressers\xe2\x80\x9d return to buying when the calendar turns anew.'b'But what if the January Effect has a more fundamental cause \xe2\x80\x94 one that ties directly to human nature?'b'In a 'b'paper'b' published in The Journal of Behavioral Finance in 2011, I proposed that this most famous of regular irregularities in the stock market was attributable to our strong inclination to be optimistic at the turn of the year. Investors, exhibiting the same flash of wishful thinking exuded by any New Year\xe2\x80\x99s resolution maker, take a flier on those little stocks that \xe2\x80\x9chave great potential.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, as the hopefulness fades over the year, the January could-bes fall back into might-have-beens, typically doing a little worse than the market as a whole.'b'For an experiment that might test this hypothesis, I gathered a portfolio of stocks particularly susceptible to optimism \xe2\x80\x94 those for which Wall Street analysts had sharply varying opinions regarding their prospects, with some analysts wildly upbeat in their assessments and others quite pessimistic. I argued that in January, share prices would reflect the optimistic view rather than the gloomy one and that in the rest of the year the opposite would occur \xe2\x80\x94 a pattern that monthly stock returns later bore out.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s more, recent research on the brain suggests that some human beings are hard-wired for such optimism. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the neuroscientist 'b'Tali Sharot'b', at University College London, and her team have been 'b'studying'b' communication between the brain\xe2\x80\x99s frontal cortex and subcortical regions deep in the brain; inveterate optimists, it seems, tend to have stronger communication links between these areas.'b'Whether or not this brain cross-talk spikes in January is an open question \xe2\x80\x94 as is another major piece of the puzzle: Why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the January Effect disappear in anticipation of the January Effect, as investors try to take advantage of what\xe2\x80\x99s coming? I believe that the \xe2\x80\x9cfalse hope syndrome,\xe2\x80\x9d a notion that has been explored by the psychologists 'b'Janet Polivy'b' and 'b'C. Peter Herman'b', may account for some of the reason.'b'The theory is that people are optimistic at the turn of the year and often make idealistic resolutions: lose 50 pounds, write that novel, cut down the binge spending or make a windfall in the stock market. As the year progresses, they fall short of their goals and eventually forget or give up. But come next January, the goals are back, starting the cycle of failure and renewed effort all over again.'b'Looking further into brain activity, Dr. Sharot and her team may have found why false hopes exist neurologically. They contend that unrealistic optimism is a pervasive human trait. Evaluating how this 'b'optimism is maintained'b' in the face of information that challenges it, they found that desirable information was encoded in a different part of the brain than undesirable information.'b'Optimists and pessimists both process desirable information effectively, but the brain neurons of extreme optimists do not effectively encode undesirable information. This reduced ability to remember disappointments is probably an advantage for many people \xe2\x80\x94 like professional athletes, who need confidence after tough losses. But for investors looking for long-term winners at the start of the year, it\xe2\x80\x99s best to give yourself a gut check before you buy.'b'HEGEL once wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat experience and history teaches us is that people and governments have never learned anything from history.\xe2\x80\x9d Actually, I think people do learn. The problem is that they forget \xe2\x80\x94 sometimes amazingly quickly. That seems to be happening today, even though recovery from the economic debacle of 2008-9 is far from complete.'b'Evidence of this forgetting is everywhere. The public has lost interest in the causes of the crisis; many, of course, are just struggling to get by. Unrepentant financiers whine about \xe2\x80\x9cexcessive\xe2\x80\x9d regulation and pay lobbyists to battle every step toward reform. Conservatives bemoan \xe2\x80\x9cbig government\xe2\x80\x9d and yearn to return to laissez-faire deregulation. Higher international standards for bank capital and liquidity have been delayed. I could go on.'b'Instead, let me try to encapsulate what we must remember about the financial crisis into 10 financial commandments, all of which were brazenly violated in the years leading up to the crisis.'b''b'1. Remember That People Forget'b''b'Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner lamented last year that before the crisis, \xe2\x80\x9cThere was no memory of extreme crisis, no memory of what can happen when a nation allows huge amounts of risk to build up.\xe2\x80\x9d He was right. As the renegade economist Hyman Minsky knew, it is normal for speculative markets to go to extremes. A key reason, Minsky believed, is that, unlike elephants, people forget. When the good times roll, investors expect them to roll indefinitely. When bubbles burst, they are always surprised.'b''b'2. Do Not Rely on Self-Regulation'b''b'Self-regulation of financial markets is a cruel oxymoron. We need zookeepers to watch over the animals. The government must not outsource this function to \xe2\x80\x9cmarket discipline\xe2\x80\x9d (another oxymoron) or to for-profit companies like credit-rating agencies. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 isn\xe2\x80\x99t perfect, but it has the potential to change regulation for the better. But most of its reforms are still being phased in, and as the rules are being drafted, the industry (here and abroad) is fighting them tooth and nail and often prevailing.'b''b'3. Honor Thy Shareholders'b''b'Boards of public corporations are supposed to protect the interests of shareholders, partly by monitoring the behavior of top executives, who are employees, not emperors. In the years before the crisis, too many directors forgot those responsibilities, and both their companies and the broader public suffered from the malign neglect. Will they now remember? Some will \xe2\x80\x94 for a while. But sanctions on directors for poor performance are minimal.'b''b'4. Elevate Risk Management'b''b'One bitter lesson of the crisis is that, when it comes to risk taking, what you don\xe2\x80\x99t know can hurt you. Too many C.E.O.\xe2\x80\x99s let their subordinates ride roughshod over risk managers, tipping the balance toward greed and away from fear. The primary responsibility for keeping risk-management systems up to snuff rests with top executives and boards of directors. But the Federal Reserve and other regulators are now watching and mustn\xe2\x80\x99t let up.'b''b'5. Use Less Leverage'b''b'Excessive leverage \xe2\x80\x94 otherwise known as over-borrowing \xe2\x80\x94 was one of the chief foundations of the house of cards that collapsed so violently in 2008. Overpaid investment \xe2\x80\x9cgeniuses\xe2\x80\x9d used leverage to manufacture extraordinary returns out of ordinary investments. Bankers and investors (not to mention home buyers) deluded themselves into thinking they could earn high returns without assuming big risks. But leverage is like alcohol: a little bit has health benefits, but too much can kill you. The banks\xe2\x80\x99 near-death experiences, plus preparation for higher capital requirements to come, are temporarily keeping them sober. But watch for the binge drinking to return.'b''b'6. Keep It Simple, Stupid'b''b'Modern finance profits from complexity, because befuddled customers are more profitable ones. But do all those fancy financial instruments actually do the economy any good? Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chairman, once said the A.T.M. was the only beneficial financial innovation in the recent past. He may have exaggerated, but he had a point. Who needs credit default swaps on collateralized debt obligations, and other such concoctions?'b''b'7. Standardize Derivatives and Trade Them on Exchanges'b''b'Derivatives acquired a bad name in the crisis. But if they are straightforward, transparent, well collateralized, traded in liquid markets by well-capitalized counterparties and sensibly regulated, derivatives can help investors hedge risks. It is the customized, opaque, \xe2\x80\x9cover the counter\xe2\x80\x9d derivatives that are the most dangerous \xe2\x80\x94 and the ones more likely to serve the interests of the dealers than their customers. Dodd-Frank pushed some derivatives toward greater standardization and transparent trading on exchanges, but not enough. The industry is pushing to keep more derivatives trading out of the sunshine.'b''b'8. Keep Things on the Balance Sheet'b''b'Before the crisis, some banks took important financial activities off their balance sheets to hide how much leverage they had. But the joke was on them. The crisis revealed that some chief executives were only dimly aware of the off-balance-sheet entities their banks held. These \xe2\x80\x9cmasters of the universe\xe2\x80\x9d hadn\xe2\x80\x99t mastered their own books. Dodd-Frank specifies that \xe2\x80\x9ccapital requirements shall take into account any off-balance-sheet activities of the company.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s a welcome step toward making off-balance-sheet entities safe and rare. Now regulators must make the rule work.'b''b'9. Fix Perverse Compensation 'b''b'Offering traders monumental rewards for success, but a mere slap on the wrist for failure, encourages them to take excessive risks. Chief executives and corporate directors should \xe2\x80\x9cclaw back\xe2\x80\x9d pay when putative gains turn into losses. If they don\xe2\x80\x99t, we may need the heavy hand of government to do it.'b''b'10. Watch Out for Consumers'b''b'The meek won\xe2\x80\x99t inherit their fair share of the earth if they are constantly being fleeced. What we learned in the crisis is that failure to protect unsophisticated consumers from financial predators can undermine the whole economy. That surprising lesson mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be forgotten. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau should institutionalize it.'b'Mark Twain is said to have quipped that while history doesn\xe2\x80\x99t repeat itself, it does rhyme. There will be financial crises in the future, and the next one won\xe2\x80\x99t be a carbon copy of the last. Neither, however, will it be so different that these commandments won\xe2\x80\x99t apply. Financial history does rhyme, but we\xe2\x80\x99re already forgetting the meter.'b'AS President Obama prepares to deliver his second Inaugural Address, beware: second inaugurals have not fared well in American history. First inaugurals have provided many memorable lines. Franklin D. Roosevelt, taking office in the riptide of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s greatest depression, asserted, \xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\xe2\x80\x9d John F. Kennedy told Americans, \xe2\x80\x9cAsk not what your country can do for you \xe2\x80\x94 ask what you can do for your country.\xe2\x80\x9d By contrast, the words of second inaugurals have largely slipped from memory.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s one important exception \xe2\x80\x94 the second inaugural of Abraham Lincoln, delivered on March 4, 1865.'b'Why have second inaugurals fared poorly, and why did Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s succeed?'b'To begin with, second inaugural addresses are almost always too long. Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, Jackson, Grant, Reagan, Clinton and Bush II all gave second addresses longer than their first. Lincoln understood that less is more. He spoke only 701 words.'b'Second, one word typically dominates second inaugural addresses \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cI,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d! Re-elected presidents like to personalize second inaugurals \xe2\x80\x94 believing they have more of a mandate than they did the first time around.'b'By contrast, Lincoln disappeared in his second inaugural. The speech contains the word \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d only once. Lincoln was pointing beyond himself to the future of the American democratic experiment, \xe2\x80\x9cto do all which may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves; and with all nations.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Third, second inaugural addresses are often too predictable. Audiences come expecting to hear about second-term agendas. Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s audience expected him to answer key questions. Would the Confederate States of America be treated as a conquered nation? How should one distinguish the guilty from the innocent?'b'But maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad idea to give an audience too much satisfaction. Lincoln decided not to address any of these questions. If his listeners expected a triumphalist address heralding a victorious North, they were instead asked to help initiate a new era of reconciliation \xe2\x80\x94 one marked \xe2\x80\x9cwith malice toward none, with charity toward all.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'LINCOLN also surprised his audience by steeping his address in religious language. In those 701 words he mentioned God 14 times, referenced the Bible 4 times and emphasized the importance of prayer 3 times. The point is not to count but to listen to the way he invoked religion as a balm for a nation deeply divided.'b'Lincoln, so knowledgeable of the Constitution, understood that even though the founders separated church and state, America has never separated religion and politics. Lincoln is instructive in how religion can become inclusive. \xe2\x80\x9cBoth read the same Bible, and pray to the same God,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, telling an audience angry at the deaths of so many sons that the South read the Bible as much as the North.'b'Lincoln made a final move that also set himself apart. Inaugural addresses can be exercises in self-congratulation, both of the candidate and the nation. In his second Inaugural Address Lincoln, quoting Matthew 18:7, lovingly scolded America. \xe2\x80\x9cWoe unto the world because of offenses,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Lincoln dared to declare there was something evil at the core of this great nation: \xe2\x80\x9cIf we shall suppose that American Slavery is one of those offenses.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This year\xe2\x80\x99s audience will expect Mr. Obama to detail his priorities for the next four years, from fixing the economy to reforming immigration to curbing gun violence.'b'Maybe, like Lincoln, he should surprise his audience.'b'At the service in Newtown, Conn., we heard a president sure-footed in invoking faith as an antidote and using Scripture not as a mere illustration but as the core of his argument. Many have wondered why this side of the president remained veiled during his first four years. This summer, one of the president\xe2\x80\x99s spiritual advisers told me that the president did not want to politicize religion. I respect that answer. But his fellow citizens would welcome the spirit of the man we heard in Connecticut, who called for deep healing, not only for the grieving parents, but also for a hurting nation.'b'Daniel Day-Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s riveting portrayal of our 16th president in the movie \xe2\x80\x9cLincoln\xe2\x80\x9d has meant that our most eloquent president has emerged once again in our national dialogue. No president has come into office with a surer grasp of Lincoln than Barack Obama. He knows Lincoln continually surprised those closest to him. What the nation needs on Jan. 21 is not a lawyerly, rational address on the issues facing our nation but a president ready to share his heart. And daring to tell us how we must change.'b'IF you are in psychotherapy, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance your therapist knows more about your inner thoughts and secret desires than anyone else.'b'So, if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a mate, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t your therapist be a more reliable matchmaker than 'b'eHarmony'b' and 'b'Match.com'b' and other sites that rely on impersonal algorithms?'b'The idea that therapists might play Cupid with patients tantalizes patients and therapists. An anecdotal survey of my psychiatrist colleagues suggests that the matchmaking impulse is very common.'b'A senior colleague, for example, tells me he was treating a young man who was struggling to find a partner. My colleague said he knew someone who was perfect for his patient and wanted to set them up on a date, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t because he was afraid \xe2\x80\x94 there were too many ways even the most well-intentioned therapist fix-up could go wrong.'b'Why? Psychotherapy, especially insight-oriented therapy, is designed to conjure intense feelings \xe2\x80\x94 on the part of the patient and therapist. Much of what patients feel toward their therapists, the so-called transference, are unconscious feelings that are redirected from important early figures in their lives \xe2\x80\x94 parents, family members and teachers. Your therapist mirrors this phenomenon with his own countertransference.'b'One of psychotherapy\xe2\x80\x99s aims is to use the patient-therapist relationship to better understand the patient\xe2\x80\x99s relationships with others and to remedy problems in the little lab that is the therapeutic connection.'b'Both parties are under constant temptation to act on their unconscious feelings, rather than analyze and understand them. No matter how smart or experienced the therapist, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to follow those feelings and get your patient \xe2\x80\x94 and possibly yourself \xe2\x80\x94 in trouble. Strict boundaries between personal and professional behavior are meant to insure against such hazards.'b'But temptation lurks. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had matchmaker fantasies myself. A patient of mine, who was divorced, told me she was reluctant to enter the online dating scene. It felt overwhelming, she said, and it seemed improbable that she would meet a plausible mate.'b'An old friend and colleague of mine lost his wife to cancer some years ago and I knew \xe2\x80\x94 or thought I knew \xe2\x80\x94 that he would hit it off with my patient. I began to wonder how I could discreetly bring them together. Could I invite him for dinner and tell him to meet me in the waiting area outside my office around the time of her appointment? Too chancy. Too obvious.'b'I thought maybe I should just ask my patient if she would like to meet my friend. That would involve crossing useful boundaries. And would bring my personal life in conflict with my job as therapist, which, among other things, is to help patients understand themselves and discover how to make their own lives as full and rich as possible. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t find partners for my patient any more than I should cook her dinner: both are skills she has to develop for herself.'b'Additionally (and why was I thinking this through so fully?) she might feel coerced into something she really didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to do. A therapeutic relationship is by definition unequal; therapists have considerable power, and patients want to please their therapists. My patient might be reluctant to decline.'b'Worse yet, what if the date went badly? My patient might wonder whether I really understood her at all or whether I was setting her up as a kind of test.'b'A colleague told me that when she was in training, her boss, a senior psychiatrist, suggested that she go on a date with one of his patients. She thought it odd, but being curious and open-minded, she agreed.'b'They went out for drinks, she said, and her date spent the evening pumping her for information about her boss. My colleague\xe2\x80\x99s date seemed less interested in her than in learning more about his therapist.'b'My colleague later realized that her boss, who was married, had a crush on her. \xc2\xa0She thinks he set up the match so that he might vicariously enjoy the experience of dating her. True or not, it seems the therapist may not have been acting in his patient\xe2\x80\x99s best interest.'b'Freud himself dabbled in therapeutic matchmaking and in fact went so far as to encourage one of his patients to leave his wife and pursue another woman. At Freud\xe2\x80\x99s urging, Horace Frink, a psychiatrist Freud analyzed and later nominated to head the New York Psychoanalytic Society, divorced his wife and married Angelika Bijur, one of Dr. Frink\xe2\x80\x99s own patients.'b'Whatever else Freud had in mind, it seems he may have had personal and financial motives for the union between Dr. Frink and Ms. Bijur, who happened to be a wealthy heiress. In a letter to Dr. Frink, Freud said of the proposed marriage, \xe2\x80\x9cIf matters turn out all right, let us change this imaginary gift into a real contribution to the Psychoanalytic Funds.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A marriage arranged \xe2\x80\x94 and sanctified \xe2\x80\x94 by Freud himself! That\xe2\x80\x99s a proposition hard to defy. Alas, Dr. Frink experienced depression and psychosis soon after the marriage and divorced Ms. Bijur a few years later. Today such psychiatric meddling would be likely to create a public scandal and a malpractice suit.'b'PRAGMATIC psychotherapists continue to wrestle with questions involved in patient fix-ups. The psychologist Clifford N. Lazarus, for example, argues that therapists are in a good position to evaluate personality traits that could make or break a match, and with high-functioning patients, it is ethical to give it a try. He suggests that therapists use informed consent, the same way a psychiatrist discusses the pros and cons of an antidepressant medication before starting treatment. The idea is to inform the patient of the potential benefits (could be a good match) and hazards (rejection; hard feelings toward your therapist, with the potential to wreck the therapeutic relationship) and receive consent. Case closed.'b'Not quite. This approach skirts the untidy fact of transference and countertransference \xe2\x80\x94 the matching sets of powerful and unconscious feelings that patients and therapists have toward each other. You might get your patient to \xe2\x80\x9cagree\xe2\x80\x9d to any number of contingencies, but there is no bargaining with his unconscious.'b'The fact is that consent, no matter how well-informed \xe2\x80\x94 or well-intentioned \xe2\x80\x94 is insufficient to protect against the possible mischief inherent in therapist-driven matchmaking.'b'Looking to your therapist to set up a date is as ill-advised as it is to look to Match.com for help with depression or an eating disorder. Therapists would be wise to leave matchmaking to Cupid, or his online minions.'b'Readers discuss how to make workplaces more family-friendly.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'The United States lags behind most of the world\xe2\x80\x99s developed nations in rankings of the best places for mothers, especially working mothers. One reason is that the careers of many Americans demand schedules incompatible with the requirements of parenthood. Having no available middle ground, some primary caregivers (mostly mothers) leave their careers. If they do later return, they nearly always do so at salaries and positions well behind peers who did not interrupt their careers.'b'This problem can\xe2\x80\x99t be remedied simply by extending maternity and paternity leaves. Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and France have shown us a solution. By law, employers there cannot unreasonably refuse an employee\xe2\x80\x99s request for a part-time or nonstandard schedule. Employers in Britain must \xe2\x80\x9cseriously consider\xe2\x80\x9d such requests, and not discriminate against those who ask. As their needs change, employees can also seek to return to full time.'b'Legislation modeled after the modest British law and introduced six years ago by Representative Carolyn Maloney, with co-sponsorship by Senators Barack Obama, Edward M. Kennedy and Hillary Rodham Clinton, is stalled in Congress. By increasing access to part-time schedules, the 'b'Working Families Flexibility Act'b' would end or diminish the practice of assigning less important work to part-time workers and lessen their career stigma. Full-time workers taking reduced schedules might create jobs for those unemployed.'b'Workplace flexibility is not just for the benefit of parents. Significant numbers of men and women would gladly reduce their hours and pay to have more time for other pursuits. (Improving the circumstances of unskilled workers involuntarily on unpredictable part-time schedules is an important but different concern.)'b'More than a century ago, the labor movement introduced the then radical 40-hour workweek and the vacation to improve Americans\xe2\x80\x99 lives. Passage of the Working Families Flexibility Act by Congress would be another important step.'b'ROBERT WARING'b' Redwood City, Calif., Jan. 14, 2013'b''b''b'The writer is the author of \xe2\x80\x9cUpside Down: The Paradoxes of Gender in the Twenty-First Century.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b''b'Readers React'b''b'As a scholar who has studied the economics of work and family for more than 40 years, I applaud Mr. Waring\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that Congress once again take up (and this time pass) the Working Families Flexibility Act.'b'But we need to recognize that as things stand now, taking advantage of flexible work arrangements is often a double-edged sword. Because of the stigma associated with part-time employment (allegations that those who work part time are not seriously committed to their jobs and therefore don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve serious consideration for promotion), employees who take a part-time option often suffer later when they wish to resume full-time work and move up in their organization.'b'We see this stigma operating in exactly those countries that Mr. Waring cites as being leaders in offering work-family flexibility, because those countries generally have less economic opportunity for women and fewer women in leadership positions.'b'Legislation by itself cannot remove the stigma of part-time work. Only organizations and the people who make promotion decisions can do that. Organizations could benefit by studying and emulating the flexibility model at Deloitte, which allows employees to move off and on career ladders without prejudice as their family and personal needs change. This model not only increases employee satisfaction, but also positively affects a company\xe2\x80\x99s bottom line.'b'MYRA H. STROBER'b' Stanford, Calif., Jan. 17, 2013'b''b''b'The writer is professor emerita at Stanford University.'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'Mr. Waring brings up a critical concern for a 21st-century work force \xe2\x80\x94 the dual demands on individuals and families to care for young children and/or older relatives while also managing job requirements. Study after study has shown that flexible work arrangements are key to meeting America\xe2\x80\x99s diverse work force needs.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why I will reintroduce the Working Families Flexibility Act in the new Congress. The bill gives employees the right to request flexible work options in terms of hours, schedules, work location and notice of scheduled assignments. For employees, these options help boost satisfaction and morale for themselves and their families.'b'For businesses, flexible work arrangements help increase employee retention and productivity while reducing absenteeism.'b'Given demographic and work force changes in the last 50 years, it makes sense to promote policies that are a win-win for the work force and the bottom line of businesses.'b'CAROLYN B. MALONEY'b' Washington, Jan. 17, 2013'b''b''b'The writer, a Democrat, represents the 12th Congressional District in New York.'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'As the co-founder of a Web site whose mission is to connect flexible job seekers with local businesses, I think that the time for the passage of this bill has come and gone. Six years ago when the Working Families Flexibility Act was first proposed, the employment landscape was very different from what it is today. With unemployment at 4.6 percent and a competitive labor market, individuals had the ability to request flexibility in their schedule and have these demands met to keep morale high and retain talent.'b'Compare that with today, when not only are layoffs the norm, but also workers increasingly are seeing their hours trimmed by employers, not to offer them flexibility, but to manage the bottom line. This trend is likely to continue, with 'b'58 percent of businesses reporting'b' that they will hire more part-time and hourly workers in the years ahead, regardless of improvements in the market.'b'It is this group that needs increased consideration, not only for jobs, but also for having access to insurance and payment protections. Flexibility is not the problem. Instead it is the need to offer increased protection when working independently.'b'LYNN DIXON'b' New York, Jan. 17, 2013'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'I have a 9-month-old baby and just returned to work as a teacher. The public believes that teachers have ideal schedules for raising children, and for older children that is mostly true. But flexibility in work hours is almost impossible for teachers. There is no way to work from home, and rarely a way to teach part time. I truly believe I should still be home with my baby. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she\xe2\x80\x99s getting what is best for her by my being gone from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. each day.'b'This is such an important issue. The United States is far too far behind the rest of the Western world.'b'LATASHA WEBB'b' Washington, Jan. 16, 2013'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'I am a strong fan of workplace flexibility \xe2\x80\x94 not only for the benefits that the employee receives, but for the employer\xe2\x80\x99s benefit as well. Loyal employees are the backbone of any solid corporation.'b'Being flexible with work schedules, work locations, time off without pay, job sharing and so forth has helped the companies I have worked with develop a solid corps of competent, dedicated employees who would never leave. Whether their needs are long term or short term, many employees value flexibility in the workplace over anything else. This is particularly true for women, who often find themselves taking care of children, parents and even in-laws.'b'ELENOR DENKER'b' Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Jan. 16, 2013'b''b''b'The writer is a human resources consultant.'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'From my reading of the legislation, an employer is required to listen to, and to not retaliate for, a request for shorter or flexible hours. But it is not required to grant a request, at least as long as it can reasonably claim it would cost more to do so.'b'Two things that should happen to encourage part-time or flexible work arrangements:'b'First, exemptions from paying overtime pay should be tightened. Merely using one\xe2\x80\x99s brain on the job, or occasionally telling another employee what to do, should not prevent extra pay for more than 40 hours worked in a week. If employers had to pay their employees overtime for extra work, having part-time or flexible workers available would be an advantage, not a liability.'b'Second, this problem is directly affected by our employer-based health care system. As long as hiring a new employee involves a large fixed cost for health care benefits, employers will naturally avoid adding workers to fill in for those who would want to work fewer hours. This is yet another advantage of a single-payer health care system.'b'JIM STAHL'b' Orange Village, Ohio, Jan. 16, 2013'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'Mr. Waring\xe2\x80\x99s views about part-time work and flexible schedules apply to the needs of an ever-growing demographic: the family caregiver. By some estimates, there are nearly 66 million caregivers in the United States who provide care to someone who is ill, disabled or old. About two-thirds of these caregivers are women. The average caregiver is 49 years old, and works. As boomers age and face multiple chronic health conditions, the need for caregivers will escalate.'b'Creating workplace policies that attend to the needs of family caregivers are essential if we are to be the kind of society we aim to be: one that values, respects and supports families and communities. Giving caregivers the flexibility they need to respond to their loved one\xe2\x80\x99s changing circumstances can alleviate some of the stress and anxiety that make caregiving work so hard. Allowing people to move in and out of the full-time work force offers them opportunities to balance work and family life. In an increasingly virtual world, such schedules are not that difficult to imagine or set up.'b'My own employer\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to try such measures enabled me to help care for my father when he was ill. Thanks to Wi-Fi and a laptop, I could sit with my dad, keeping an eye out for him, while logging in to my workplace, keeping up with my duties there. It was not a perfect arrangement, but it worked for us.'b'JANICE LYNCH SCHUSTER'b' Riva, Md., Jan. 16, 2013'b''b''b'The writer is senior writer for the Center for Elder Care and Advanced Illness at Altarum Institute.'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'The Working Families Flexibility Act could be, as Mr. Waring notes, a step that improves the quality of part-time jobs. It would give a nation of workers the right to ask for schedule changes (but not an automatic right to get them). A little noted but intriguing aspect of the act could nudge a workplace culture shift: The employee who requests the change must put on a manager\xe2\x80\x99s hat and recommend how the company could adapt.'b'Whether the act moves us faster toward sustainable work environments would only be known in the test of time. It is worth a shot.'b'Our economy needs not just jobs but jobs that sustain our work force over time. While most employers readily tout that their most valuable asset is their workers, too many say one thing and do another. About 40 percent of private sector workers do not have paid sick days, so wages get docked, or employees come in with the flu, or they lose their jobs. The Healthy Families Act, which would set a national floor for sick days, has also been stalled in Congress.'b'Work is also not sustainable when jobs provide too few and erratic hours.'b'We have a lot of workplace housekeeping to do; it\xe2\x80\x99s a full-time job.'b'JODIE LEVIN-EPSTEIN'b' Washington, Jan. 16, 2013'b''b''b'The writer is deputy director of CLASP: Policy Solutions That Work for Low-Income People.'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b''b'The Writer Responds'b''b'Professor Strober identifies why some countries have chosen to lead in offering workplace flexibility: to counter longstanding stigma against women in male workplace roles by increasing women\xe2\x80\x99s participation. As new situations become normalized and familiar, they are more accepted. Legislation alone will not change hearts and minds, but it\xe2\x80\x99s been the catalyst for greatly reducing other forms of discrimination.'b'That America\xe2\x80\x99s skilled workers often cannot negotiate nonstandard schedules, as noted by Ms. Dixon, demonstrates the need for this legislation.'b'Business can be quick to reject any proposed regulation, but women\xe2\x80\x99s greater work force participation over the past 40 years \xe2\x80\x94 made possible in part by anti-discrimination laws \xe2\x80\x94 helped the gross domestic product grow by 25 percent. How much more could it grow if flexible schedules unleashed the full potential of caregivers now sidelined or underused?'b'Are there costs? Sure. There would be time spent rejecting unreasonable requests and frivolous discrimination claims. But a 2005 'b'British study'b' found that employers accepted 80 percent of flexible scheduling requests.'b'In larger companies, more employees may mean hiring more managers. Some employers might provide full benefits to part-timers, as some law firms do, while in other workplaces those on reduced schedules might pay more for benefits.'b'As Ms. Denker observes, workplace flexibility engenders great loyalty, an invaluable corporate asset. Loyal employees are more productive and don\xe2\x80\x99t take their skills and experience to competing firms.'b'To strengthen our national commitment to families, readers should contact their members of Congress to support Representative Maloney\xe2\x80\x99s leadership on behalf of the Working Families Flexibility Act.'b'ROBERT WARING'b' Redwood City, Calif., Jan. 18, 2013'b''b'BARACK OBAMA\xe2\x80\x99s critics and supporters tend to agree: the first four years of the Obama administration have included plenty of disappointment and frustration.'b'Some of the that can be attributed to inherited challenges like the financial crisis. Some were caused by unexpected developments overseas. Some are the result of a dysfunctional Congress better known for logjams, corruption and ideological intransigence than action. (So much so that 'b'a recent poll'b' showed that Americans like Congress less than cockroaches, colonoscopies and root canals.)'b'But Mr. Obama and his team would benefit, as they begin the second term, by acknowledging that many of the biggest problems facing the administration flow directly from the man at the top. Mr. Obama is a lousy manager. As chief executive he gets a C \xe2\x80\x94 and then only if graded on a curve that takes into account his predecessor\xe2\x80\x99s managerial weaknesses.'b'For all of the notable achievements of Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s first term \xe2\x80\x94 getting troops out of Iraq, passing health care and financial services reform, signing legislation that guarantees that women get equal pay for equal work, removing Osama bin Laden \xe2\x80\x94 many of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s shortcomings are traceable, at least in part, to troubles connected to the way Mr. Obama has chosen to run the government.'b'The administration has not done a good job of delegating to and empowering cabinet officials. Nor does it seem to have built necessary teams and coalitions or anticipated and planned for likely challenges. The Obama team\xe2\x80\x99s failure to make the most of stimulus funding, to make progress on climate change, to react swiftly to international crises in Egypt, Libya and Syria, and to maintain good relations with allies on Capitol Hill and beyond stem from lack of managerial skill.'b'A predicate problem is that the president\xe2\x80\x99s team has focused so intently on presenting Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s strengths that they, like many senior managers, seem to have begun to believe their own news releases.'b'Consider what is, perhaps, the iconic image of the Obama presidency: the photo of Mr. Obama, in the Situation Room, with Hillary Rodham Clinton and other members of his national security team, awaiting news of the raid on Osama bin Laden. The May 2011 photo depicts an engaged leader, in the center of a closely knit team, willing to take calculated risks but viscerally aware of the human stakes involved.'b'Like many official photos, this one said much about the president without revealing the full truth. Seemingly united in that moment, the president\xe2\x80\x99s team is, in fact, a fractious group whose members are often at odds with one another, and Mr. Obama may be the most aloof president since Richard M. Nixon. Shot in the Situation Room, the nerve center of our government, the photo gives no indication that many of the president\xe2\x80\x99s appointees see it and the rest of the West Wing as kinds of fortresses far removed from other government agencies.'b'There is no single template for the effective exercise of presidential power. In the modern era, Dwight D. Eisenhower applied the skills he mastered as a general, Lyndon B. Johnson horse-traded his way to legislative triumphs, Ronald Reagan managed with a light touch as if he were a congenial \xe2\x80\x9cchairman of the board,\xe2\x80\x9d the elder George Bush oversaw what was arguably the most disciplined and inclusive national security process in recent history and Bill Clinton was able to strike a balance between master politician and wonk in chief.'b'Each of these presidents understood the danger of personalizing the presidency, of making it too much about one man; each took care to harness resources within his cabinet and among his deputies.'b'Successful modern presidents share an experience that Barack Obama does not have: before becoming president, each played an executive or leadership role that provided insight as to how to run an effective government.'b'The management troubles that have dogged the Obama administration are not unique to Mr. Obama or his team. One of the biggest problems facing America today is that in Washington, the ability to effectively run complex organizations is among the skill sets that is least valued in our leaders.'b'Often people with no management experience \xe2\x80\x94 academics, writers or politicians who have never run an office with more than a handful of people \xe2\x80\x94 are put in charge of giant, complicated government agencies or processes. In part this is because so many people in government mistakenly believe that being able to articulate ideas is the same as being able to put ideas into action.'b'This administration provides an object lesson in how, when too many staffers have excessive influence, political calculations often trump good policy choices. When an inner circle maintains too tight a stranglehold over the president\xe2\x80\x99s time and attention, too few views come into play. If isolated by an inner circle, the president will have a harder time fostering cooperation in his administration. During his first term, Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s inner circle included Michelle Obama, Valerie Jarrett, David Axelrod, David Plouffe and Pete Rouse. Even top administration officials believe these gatekeepers held power too closely. Staff casualties resulted.'b'When Obama campaign insiders on the National Security Council staff were thought to have more access to the president than their boss, Gen. James L. Jones, the general reportedly felt undermined and left the administration. Ms. Jarrett is said to be seen as so powerful that hardly anyone dares to cross her.'b'Despite constant behind-the-scenes grumbling from top officials, few appear to have successfully challenged her. Acknowledging how much the president values her opinion, staffers complain about her involvement in matters outside her competence. Battles with Ms. Jarrett reportedly played a role in at least one top official\xe2\x80\x99s decision to leave the administration.'b'Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s top advisers say they often feel alienated from the president. There is a sense in the White House that \xe2\x80\x9cBarack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s theory of government is he is the government.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s perceived aloofness didn\xe2\x80\x99t help his relations with Congress. Many Hill Democrats resent the fact that the president essentially did not consult with them during the last campaign, regularly keeping them away from him during his campaign appearances.'b'CHIEF executives who have visited the White House for much publicized consultations with the president and senior staff report that Mr. Obama appears to be more interested in delivering his message than in listening to others. This, too, speaks to Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s management weakness. Selecting a diverse team, creating a system in which ideas surface, listening to those ideas and then empowering others to put them into action are the cornerstones of good management \xe2\x80\x94 and of effective leadership.'b'The fact that Mr. Obama is not a good manager does not mean Americans were unwise to have elected him rather than Mitt Romney, who presented himself as an experienced business leader. There is no shortage of successful businessmen who flopped in government; Paul H. O\xe2\x80\x99Neill, John W. Snow or John E. Bryson are examples. Public sector management poses its own unique challenges. Great business leaders and great governmental leaders require different personalities, skill sets, tactics and backgrounds.'b'The challenge here extends beyond Mr. Obama. The American electorate doesn\xe2\x80\x99t ask questions about management skills. Congress rarely raises the issue of management when considering nominees for large, complicated cabinet agencies, many of which are larger than big corporations. Establishing a culture in which the metrics of successful governance are valued, discussed and evaluated is a vital step toward addressing a problem of which the current president\xe2\x80\x99s management troubles is but a symptom. It would be helpful to have a permanent professional bureaucracy with continuing management responsibilities, as do many other nations. It would also be useful to consider salaries for top officials that provide incentives to the most qualified (much could be learned here from Singapore, which has blazed an important trail in this regard).'b'In the end, the success of our constitutional system depends primarily on how the occupant of the Oval Office governs. No president can succeed unless he views his job as collaborative, as requiring the motivation and empowerment of a vast United States executive branch bureaucracy, as being in partnership with Congress, as benefiting from a broad and diverse group of advisers, as being the kind of undertaking that promotes creativity even if it means embracing unpopular or even unsuccessful ideas. We know that for the next four years we will have a much more experienced president than the one who occupied it during the term just past. But if Barack Obama is to be a successful president \xe2\x80\x94 if he is to lead our country toward economic recovery, climate health and increased security \xe2\x80\x94 he must master the day-to-day management of government.'b'ANDREW CUOMO doesn\xe2\x80\x99t dally. If he deems something important, he pounces on it. Last week he did that with gun control, signing sweeping new legislation.'b'He\xe2\x80\x99s also ambitious. A 2016 presidential bid may be in the offing, especially if Hillary Clinton doesn\xe2\x80\x99t jump in. And the national profile that he\xe2\x80\x99s forging \xe2\x80\x94 trailblazer on gay marriage, guardian of public safety \xe2\x80\x94 almost surely reflects his sense of where the country is heading and what voters will and won\xe2\x80\x99t reward.'b'How, then, are we supposed to read his romantic situation?'b'He\xe2\x80\x99s unmarried, but has been living with the irrepressible food celebrity Sandra Lee for years now, most recently in her Westchester house. \xe2\x80\x9cPublic concubinage\xe2\x80\x9d is what one Roman Catholic official once 'b'called their cohabitation'b', generating a flurry of articles that mentioned \xe2\x80\x9cliving in sin.\xe2\x80\x9d The couple made no apologies. And they\xe2\x80\x99ve never signaled any plans to wed.'b'That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a factor in Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s successful New York gubernatorial campaign, but whether it would be a liability in a national race is hard to say. Political strategists told me yes, no, maybe. I\xe2\x80\x99m rooting for no, because that would be an affirmation that we, as a voting public, have wised up to the frequent lack of any correlation between a tableau of traditional family life and the values, character and skills it takes to govern effectively. And I\xe2\x80\x99m intrigued by politicians who are writing fresh scripts and handling their personal situations in surprising ways.'b'Recently I visited Colorado, whose governor, 'b'John Hickenlooper'b', is another prominent Democrat sometimes mentioned in connection with 2016. I met up with him just a few hours after his State of the State address. Its distinctions included this: when he thanked his wife, Helen Thorpe, for coming to hear it, he was reminding Coloradans that the two had separated midway through 2012, less than two years into his first term.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI greatly appreciate Helen being here today,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the gathered lawmakers. Then, mentioning their 10-year-old son, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cEven with the changes in our life, she remains a beacon of light to me and Teddy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Hickenlooper has handled the separation not with terse acknowledgments and speedy pivots to the next topic but with a transparent emotionalism. It\xe2\x80\x99s arresting \xe2\x80\x94 and refreshing. The couple announced that he was moving out of their Denver house and into the governor\xe2\x80\x99s mansion in a joint statement that the governor\xe2\x80\x99s office e-mailed to their friends and to journalists last July. Half news release, half personal letter, it was unlike any political document I\xe2\x80\x99d seen.'b'In it he and Thorpe wrote that they remained \xe2\x80\x9cclose friends,\xe2\x80\x9d that they and Teddy would still take vacations and spend holidays together and that acquaintances should \xe2\x80\x9cfeel free to include both of us in social gatherings, as we will not find it awkward.\xe2\x80\x9d They also said that neither of them had had an affair.'b'During my recent conversations with Hickenlooper, he brought up Thorpe readily and repeatedly. She\xe2\x80\x99s a journalist, and he proudly described her progress on a new book. He expressed sorrow that the public eye and the whirl of his political life had never really suited her. When they married in 2002, his political career had really yet to begin.'b'He said that over the last few years, as he rose in political prominence, they were careful to carve out private time, thinking that that would do the trick. He was sure to be home with his wife by 7 p.m. at least four of every seven nights, he said.'b'But, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cThere was just always somebody interrupting. She\xe2\x80\x99s someone who just thinks so deeply and feels so deeply \xe2\x80\x94 it was just so distracting for her. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate that properly.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t run for governor, I asked, would the marriage have survived? \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s conceivable,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Then he volunteered that when they discussed separating, she had told him: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to run for president, I\xe2\x80\x99m in. We\xe2\x80\x99ll stay married. I\xe2\x80\x99ll figure it out and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was amazingly generous,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'HE turned down that offer, he told me, because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to prolong her unhappiness and had \xe2\x80\x9cpretty much made my mind up to focus on Colorado and not to spend time imagining any national campaigns.\xe2\x80\x9d There are few signs that he\xe2\x80\x99s gearing up for one.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI never considered how a voter might respond,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMarriage \xe2\x80\x98status\xe2\x80\x99 still matters to some people, but it seems like less and less.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Is he right? Could he or Cuomo run for national office without a spouse at his side? Could Mayor Cory Booker of Newark, another rising Democratic star? He\xe2\x80\x99s steadfastly single. What about Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles, whose marriage unraveled messily in 2007? Although Jerry Brown strode unmarried onto the national stage \xe2\x80\x94 and sought the Democratic presidential nomination sans bride \xe2\x80\x94 decades ago, that was a different thing. He was a decided iconoclast, and his stubborn bachelorhood was part and parcel of his outr\xc3\xa9 political appeal.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s certainly no divorce taboo in contemporary presidential politics. Ronald Reagan demonstrated that, and then came Bob Dole and John McCain, with one divorce apiece, and Rudy Giuliani and Newt Gingrich, with two each. Gingrich last year won two Republican primaries in socially conservative Southern states, including South Carolina, where another messily divorced Republican, Mark Sanford, the state\xe2\x80\x99s former governor, announced a candidacy for Congress last week.'b'Lucky for him and Gingrich and others, there\xe2\x80\x99s no infidelity taboo, either. Bill Clinton demolished that. Lewinsky or no Lewinsky, most Americans have come to see his presidency as a bright one and Hillary as an estimable public servant, yet none of those supporters mistake the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 marriage for the stuff of storybooks, unless maybe we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about Rona Jaffe or David Baldacci novels.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ve seemingly moved away from conventional and na\xc3\xafve expectations, if we ever really had them, and in the years to come we\xe2\x80\x99ll surely see, on the national stage, more proof of that: candidates without partners, candidates with partners they haven\xe2\x80\x99t wed, candidates with partners of the same sex.'b'And my guess is that many of them will do just fine, as long as they aren\xe2\x80\x99t defensive or opaque and they permit enough of a view into their lives and hearts for voters to see \xe2\x80\x94 and identify with \xe2\x80\x94 a bedrock of common longings, a braid of recognizable frailties and frustrations.'b'Hickenlooper is doing that, and if Cuomo does likewise, he could find that an outspoken, aggressive support of regulations on firearms is a bigger political problem in much of the United States than, er, concubinage is. Ours is a peculiar land, growing saner in some regards even as we remain absolutely bonkers in others.'b'WASHINGTON'b'WHEN he was a young henchman for his father in Albany, Andrew Cuomo gave intensity a bad name.'b'Now that he is New York\xe2\x80\x99s governor himself, Cuomo gives intensity a good name.'b'In the old days, that dark zeal was scattered around, directed at anyone who insulted or crossed him. Now he channels it more narrowly on the handful of things he wants to get done that he thinks the public wants.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was 23 years old then; now I\xe2\x80\x99m 55 years old,\xe2\x80\x9d he says with an air of the Stephen Sondheim classic \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Still Here.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI was a linear, focused person. Then I got knocked on my rear end. I went through professional and personal hell. So now I keep it very simple. One day at a time. I\xe2\x80\x99m killing myself to do the best job I can as governor. I do what I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to do and forget about the unhealthy things that used to distract me. I put one foot in front of the other. We take on big problems. And to say there\xe2\x80\x99s no solution to the problems is not an option.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Following the grotesque murders of children in Newtown, Conn., and firefighters in Webster, N.Y., the governor bellowed \xe2\x80\x9cStop the madness\xe2\x80\x9d and shoved through tough gun-control legislation so blindingly fast that some state senators had scarcely read the bill, and the N.R.A. conceded that it had no time to thwart it.'b'Cuomo, who worked the phones every day for a month, straight through the holidays, to drum up support, dismisses criticism of rushing and secrecy: \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone said, \xe2\x80\x98You did it so quickly.\xe2\x80\x99 That perspective is skewed. We\xe2\x80\x99re years and years late. The federal assault weapons ban had lapsed. The state assault weapons ban was on the books, but everybody knew it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t working. Government just failed to perform, and people died. So it\xe2\x80\x99s all bittersweet because I have to say to myself, maybe if we had done earlier what we were supposed to do, figured out how to overcome the politics of extremes, we could have saved all those lives.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe should have done it as a prophylactic, but maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s human nature to tend to respond to an emergency. You have to sniffle before you get a flu shot.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'You could say it\xe2\x80\x99s not so hard to pass such a bill in a left-leaning state with a popular governor (he is floating at a 71 percent favorability rating), and that it\xe2\x80\x99s a far easier achievement than the gay marriage bill.'b'But with the president privately signaling some pessimism on new gun laws, as his domestic policy aides take a slower, less stringent approach, it\xe2\x80\x99s bracing to see somebody, anybody, actually make government hum.'b'Cuomo doesn\xe2\x80\x99t spend much time on TV baring his soul or hustling to get name recognition. (He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to.) He focuses-focuses-focuses on the matter at hand, and on proving that government can work \xe2\x80\x94 if you apply the proper intensity at times of intense awareness.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to try to hit a home run,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHome run hitters also have notoriously high strikeout rates. But it\xe2\x80\x99s like when we tried to pass marriage equality. You have to be willing to fail.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'On BuzzFeed, Blake Zeff said \xe2\x80\x9cthe latest unachievable triumph\xe2\x80\x9d shows that Cuomo has \xe2\x80\x9ca seemingly superhuman mastery of legislative politics.\xe2\x80\x9d And The Daily News christened Cuomo \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s Sheriff.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m psyched,\xe2\x80\x9d Sheriff Andy said in a call from Albany, not Mayberry, joking, \xe2\x80\x9cBut I never really saw myself in a big cowboy hat.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And there is always suspicion swirling: What is Andrew up to? He is always up to something, but is he really deserving of the ever-present assumption that self-advancement trumps his true beliefs? On gun control, was he driven to beat the White House to the punch \xe2\x80\x94 or perhaps to beat a fellow governor and 2016 prospect, Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley of Maryland? Was he pandering to the left to make up for centrist moves?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEven when we\xe2\x80\x99re building a bridge,\xe2\x80\x9d the governor noted dryly, \xe2\x80\x9copponents say, \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re only building a bridge to run for president.\xe2\x80\x99 People are cynical about politicians.

But Cuomo, who devotes a lot of time to wining, dining and wheedling legislators, is far more deft at carrots, sticks and baby-talk than President Obama is. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fascinating \xe2\x80\x94 and open \xe2\x80\x94 question about whether those skills could work the same way to jolt comatose Washington.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s more nuanced than carrots and sticks,\xe2\x80\x9d the governor explained. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople are complex. It\xe2\x80\x99s about the full panorama of relationships, the positive and negative. There\xe2\x80\x99s love, fear, desire to please, fear of reprisal. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a fist. I would much rather be home watching a ballgame. But it takes time. It takes effort. It\xe2\x80\x99s the job.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b"Editors' note: We're resurfacing this story from the archives to help you get 2017 off to a successful start."b''b'WHAT does self-awareness have to do with a restaurant empire? A tennis championship? Or a rock star\xe2\x80\x99s dream?'b'David Chang\xe2\x80\x99s experience is instructive.'b'Mr. Chang is an internationally renowned, award-winning Korean-American chef, restaurateur and owner of the Momofuku restaurant group with eight restaurants from Toronto to Sydney, and other thriving enterprises, including bakeries and bars, a PBS TV show, guest spots on HBO\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cTreme\xe2\x80\x9d and a foodie magazine, Lucky Peach. He says he worked himself to the bone to realize his dream \xe2\x80\x94 to own a humble noodle bar.'b'He spent years cooking in some of New York City\xe2\x80\x99s best restaurants, apprenticed in different noodle shops in Japan and then, finally, worked 18-hour days in his tiny restaurant, Momofuku Noodle Bar.'b'Mr. Chang could barely pay himself a salary. He had trouble keeping staff. And he was miserably stressed.'b'He recalls a low moment when he went with his staff on a night off to eat burgers at a restaurant that was everything his wasn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x94 packed, critically acclaimed and financially successful. He could cook better than they did, he thought, so why was his restaurant failing? \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t figure out what the hell we were doing wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d he told us.'b'Mr. Chang could have blamed someone else for his troubles, or worked harder (though available evidence suggests that might not have been possible) or he could have made minor tweaks to the menu. Instead he looked inward and subjected himself to brutal self-assessment.'b'Was the humble noodle bar of his dreams economically viable? Sure, a traditional noodle dish had its charm but wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work as the mainstay of a restaurant if he hoped to pay his bills.'b'Mr. Chang changed course. Rather than worry about what a noodle bar should serve, he and his cooks stalked the produce at the greenmarket for inspiration. Then they went back to the kitchen and cooked as if it was their last meal, crowding the menu with wild combinations of dishes they\xe2\x80\x99d want to eat \xe2\x80\x94 tripe and sweetbreads, headcheese and flavor-packed culinary mashups like a Korean-style burrito. What happened next Mr. Chang still considers \xe2\x80\x9ckind of ridiculous\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the crowds came, rave reviews piled up, awards followed and unimaginable opportunities presented themselves.'b'During the 1970s, Chris Argyris, a business theorist at Harvard Business School (and now, at 89, a professor emeritus) began to research what happens to organizations and people, like Mr. Chang, when they find obstacles in their paths.'b'Professor Argyris called the most common response single loop learning \xe2\x80\x94 an insular mental process in which we consider possible external or technical reasons for obstacles.'b'LESS common but vastly more effective is the cognitive approach that Professor Argyris called double-loop learning. In this mode we \xe2\x80\x94 like Mr. Chang \xe2\x80\x94 question every aspect of our approach, including our methodology, biases and deeply held assumptions. This more psychologically nuanced self-examination requires that we honestly challenge our beliefs and summon the courage to act on that information, which may lead to fresh ways of thinking about our lives and our goals.'b'In interviews we did with high achievers for a book, we expected to hear that talent, persistence, dedication and luck played crucial roles in their success. Surprisingly, however, self-awareness played an equally strong role.'b'The successful people we spoke with \xe2\x80\x94 in business, entertainment, sports and the arts \xe2\x80\x94 all had similar responses when faced with obstacles: they subjected themselves to fairly merciless self-examination that prompted reinvention of their goals and the methods by which they endeavored to achieve them.'b'The tennis champion Martina Navratilova, for example, told us that after a galling loss to Chris Evert in 1981, she questioned her assumption that she could get by on talent and instinct alone. She began a long exploration of every aspect of her game. She adopted a rigorous cross-training practice (common today but essentially unheard of at the time), revamped her diet and her mental and tactical game and ultimately transformed herself into the most successful women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis player of her era.'b'The indie rock band OK Go described how it once operated under the business model of the 20th-century rock band. But when industry record sales collapsed and the band members found themselves creatively hamstrung by their recording company, they questioned their tactics. Rather than depend on their label, they made wildly unconventional music videos, which went viral, and collaborative art projects with companies like Google, State Farm and Range Rover, which financed future creative endeavors. The band now releases albums on its own label.'b'No one\xe2\x80\x99s idea of a good time is to take a brutal assessment of their animating assumptions and to acknowledge that those may have contributed to their failure. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to find pat ways to explain why the world has not adequately rewarded our efforts. But what we learned from conversation with high achievers is that challenging our assumptions, objectives, at times even our goals, may sometimes push us further than we thought possible. Ask David Chang, who never imagined that sweetbreads and duck sausage rice cakes with kohlrabi and mint would find their way beside his humble noodle dishes \xe2\x80\x94 and make him a star.'b'When a city condemns private property to make way for a public highway, that is a classic \xe2\x80\x9ctaking\xe2\x80\x9d for which government must provide \xe2\x80\x9cjust compensation\xe2\x80\x9d under the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s Fifth Amendment.'b'Over the last few decades, a divided Supreme Court has 'b'extended'b' property rights at the expense of community interests by 'b'expanding'b' the \xe2\x80\x9ctakings\xe2\x80\x9d concept to include regulatory actions that are \xe2\x80\x9cfunctionally equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d to direct appropriation. These might include actions that render the property essentially worthless, undermine an owner\xe2\x80\x99s right to keep it private, or greatly limit its use.'b'In 'b'Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District'b', however, the plaintiffs have asked for a radical redefinition of takings so elastic that even Justice Antonin Scalia, a strong advocate of property rights and of a broad interpretation of the takings law, rose up in protest.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA taking of what?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer during 'b'oral argument'b' before the Supreme Court last week. His question was echoed by Justice Elena Kagan, who asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the taking?\xe2\x80\x9d and by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who was even blunter: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are we even in this case?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The justices were plainly skeptical, and a brief look at the case explains why. It involves a decision by the water management district in Central Florida \xe2\x80\x94 an agency charged with protecting wetlands \xe2\x80\x94 to deny a permit to the Koontz family to develop three-plus acres of wetlands near Orlando because the family refused to contribute money to wetlands protection elsewhere in the state.'b'This kind of mitigation under environmental law is common in cases involving statutes protecting clean water and endangered species. The family offered to preserve 11 acres that it owned, but the water management district rightly said that preserving what already existed was not mitigation.'b'The Koontz family sought monetary compensation, but as the justices noted, the district has not condemned an iota of the land and has not required the family to do anything to its property. It simply denied the family a permit for development.'b'That was the gist of the Florida Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'ruling'b' in favor of the district. The United States Supreme Court should uphold that decision, blocking efforts by the family and its ideological allies to stretch the notion of a regulatory taking far beyond any defensible limits.'b'A detailed report put out by JPMorgan Chase last week on how it lost $6 billion from ill-fated trading in 2012 should be required reading for policy makers and financial executives. The 129-page 'b'document'b' serves as a case study of how excessive complexity and poor oversight still threaten many parts of the financial system more than four years after the failure of Lehman Brothers.'b'The subject of the report is the bank\xe2\x80\x99s trading of complex derivatives known as credit default swaps that are similar to the instruments that forced the government to bail out the American International Group in 2008. At JPMorgan, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest bank and one of many that received government aid during the crisis, these investments did not threaten the institution\xe2\x80\x99s survival as they did with A.I.G. But they caused losses large enough to dent the bank\xe2\x80\x99s reputation for managing risk well, and cost its top executive, Jamie Dimon, a 50 percent reduction in his 2012 pay.'b'The report, which was prepared by JPMorgan executives, is not exhaustive: it does not explain, for instance, how an early loss estimate of $2 billion eventually grew to $6 billion. But it provides important insights into why the losses took the bank and regulators by surprise. The main reason is that they were not paying attention to a small group of traders working for the bank\xe2\x80\x99s chief investment unit, which was supposed to be hedging, or protecting against future losses.'b'In fact, far from mitigating the bank\xe2\x80\x99s risk, the London-based traders amassed a large, complex financial portfolio in the misguided hope that doing so would help the bank avoid a relatively modest loss of about $100 million, according to the report. As they dug themselves into a deeper and deeper hole, the risks they were taking were either kept from or ignored by senior managers and bank supervisors.'b'But not everybody was oblivious. Investors at other banks and hedge funds who were trading with JPMorgan noticed and took advantage of the situation. They even dubbed the group\xe2\x80\x99s principal trader the \xe2\x80\x9cLondon Whale\xe2\x80\x9d because he took a very large position in the market.'b'The report\xe2\x80\x99s findings suggest that some of the riskiest trading would have been either prohibited or at least better monitored had regulators finished drafting regulations about derivatives and short-term trading by banks that are required under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.'b'But the far bigger lesson from this report is that senior bank officials and regulators need to be more vigilant than they have been in overseeing potentially risky activity wherever it may be taking place. The report found that even as the London group, which makes trades for JPMorgan itself, engaged in more complex transactions and took on more risk, its activities were more lightly monitored than the trading by other divisions, like JPMorgan\xe2\x80\x99s investment bank, which provides financial services and advice to corporations and others.'b'The board of JPMorgan did the right thing in making this report public so that investors, depositors and the general public can better understand what happened. 'b'Last week'b', federal banking regulators ordered JPMorgan to improve its risk management systems and told its board to report on its progress. Given the nature of risk, we will probably not know how well these measures are working until the next crisis.'b'PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA\xe2\x80\x99S Second Inaugural Address, revised for maximum honesty:'b'My fellow Americans, I am grateful for the honor of this hour, mindful of the consequential times in which we live, and determined to fulfill the oath that I have sworn and you have witnessed.'b'[long pause]'b'Hey, no, just kidding: That\xe2\x80\x99s from George W.

It\xe2\x80\x99s so nice to have you back on the bandwagon, guys! I\xe2\x80\x99ve been surfing the Interwebs, reading the tweets, and it feels like old times. The Obama realignment is all the rage again. The thrill is back on MSNBC. Newsweek\xe2\x80\x99s comparing me to Jesus. All I need is a 'b'will.i.am'b' video to really take me back.'b'But don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten that when the going got tough, you guys went weak at the knees. I always knew my fellow liberal elites were self-involved, self-dramatizing and out of touch: I was in academia, remember? But the kind of mood swings I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to put up with have been absolutely ridiculous.'b'The fact is, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been your dream president; you\xe2\x80\x99ve just spent four years coming up with reasons not to notice. I spend a gazillion dollars on stimulus, and the next day I wake up and it\xe2\x80\x99s all, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t he spend 'b'two 'b'gazillion dollars?\xe2\x80\x9d I pass universal health care \xe2\x80\x94 your goal for what, a thousand years or so? \xe2\x80\x94 and it takes all of five seconds before you start whining about how I didn\xe2\x80\x99t cure cancer too. I suffer a few setbacks \xe2\x80\x94 that midterm business, a bad debate \xe2\x80\x94 and you start panicking about how some stuffed-suit corporate raider who stepped out of an Eisenhower-era time capsule is going to beat cool, multiracial, 21st-century ME.'b'Please. 'b'Please. 'b''b'Next, a big, big shout-out to my opponents on the right \xe2\x80\x94 I really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done it without you.

But in the larger war, has any president ever been so lucky in his enemies?'b'Every time I needed to paint the American right as paranoid and out-of-touch, misogynistic and mindless, you were there for me.

Todd Akin \xe2\x80\x94 I love you, man.'b'And that parade of lightweights you put up against Romney in the primaries? A godsend. Bless you, Herman Cain. Never change, Michele Bachmann. Oh \xe2\x80\x94 and hope you enjoy being president of Purdue, Mitch Daniels.'b'Of course, my friends in right-wing media have been lucky in me as well. I kept your ratings stellar, your book sales booming, your page views sky-high. You got the income stream, I kept the power. So here\xe2\x80\x99s to another flush four years for you.'b'Finally, to all the centrist wise men and reasonable-sounding conservatives \xe2\x80\x94 how do you like me now? You said I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get re-elected unless I was more bipartisan, more moderate, more Clintonian. You blamed me for Washington\xe2\x80\x99s gridlock and assumed the country would as well. You said I should campaign on Simpson-Bowles, of all things, instead of social issues.'b'Well, guess what? I did it my way, and it worked. I got tax increases without entitlement cuts, I flipped the script on the culture war, and now Marco Rubio is going to help me pass an immigration bill. I\xe2\x80\x99m still up for a grand bargain, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t need one: The economy\xe2\x80\x99s limping back, the deficit should stabilize in the short run, and the long term \xe2\x80\x94 well, that\xe2\x80\x99s my successor\xe2\x80\x99s problem. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to win on gun control and climate change, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll settle for making the case and seeing whether a Biden administration (you only think I\xe2\x80\x99m kidding) can finish the job.'b'Sure, second terms can be dicey propositions. But as long as I don\xe2\x80\x99t get impeached or start a land war in Asia, I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling pretty good about my legacy.'b'And oh, you centrist chin-strokers who kept saying I was no Clinton?

This time, in the rare opening for change that has followed the massacre in Newtown, Conn., no one should fall for it. The argument that the existing laws would be sufficient if only the officials in charge did their job and enforced them properly is nothing more than a clever diversion. Beyond ignoring deadly loopholes \xe2\x80\x94 many inserted at the N.R.A.\xe2\x80\x99s insistence \xe2\x80\x94 this poses a false choice between strong laws and strong enforcement. Why should one preclude the other? America needs both.'b'Some of the steps Mr. Obama has endorsed \xe2\x80\x94 making background checks universal and cracking down on illegal gun trafficking \xe2\x80\x94 are needed to make existing laws more effective. Other things, like reducing the supply of assault weapons and large ammunition clips that so often figure in mass shootings, will require new laws. Obviously, better enforcement does not help when there is no underlying statute.'b'It is true that the Justice Department should prosecute more people who lie or deliberately provide inaccurate information about their criminal histories on background checks. Studies show that those who lie are more likely than the average person to commit violent crimes after they are denied a firearm purchase. Mr. Obama is trying to correct this with a presidential memorandum encouraging \xe2\x80\x9csupplemental efforts\xe2\x80\x9d by United States attorneys around the country to prosecute felons who lie to evade the background check.'b'This sort of common-sense strategy has long been recommended by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the group co-founded by Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York. Yet in 2010, the latest date for which figures are available, just 44 of the nearly 80,000 Americans who flunked backgrounds checks because they lied or gave incorrect information were charged with a crime. That\xe2\x80\x99s an indefensibly low number even given competing prosecutorial priorities (though consistent with the record of the Bush administration). But insufficient prosecutorial attention is hardly a reason to oppose new federal gun laws that would make Americans safer.'b'Nevertheless, the N.R.A.\xe2\x80\x99s cynical effort to shift the debate to lax enforcement continues without letup. An N.R.A. official, Andrew Arulanandam, intoned recently that the government\xe2\x80\x99s failure to aggressively investigate people who failed their background checks meant that people who should not be buying guns in the first place were escaping justice \xe2\x80\x94 in his words, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'getting away scot-free'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d He failed to mention that it is only because of the 1993 Brady Act, which the N.R.A. vehemently opposed, that the nation even has a system that can identify prohibited buyers and those who lie.'b'The hypocrisy of the N.R.A.\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the problem is weak enforcement is exposed by its efforts over the years to undercut what enforcement there is. It has tried mightily to ensure that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives lacks the leadership, resources and legal authority to do its job properly. Restrictions enacted at the gun lobby\xe2\x80\x99s behest make it exceedingly hard to identify dealers who falsify sales records, for example, and bar the bureau from putting gun-sale records into a central database for speedy tracing of weapons used in crimes.'b'Further details of the N.R.A.\xe2\x80\x99s anti-enforcement efforts were revealed by Dennis Henigan, a former vice president of the Brady Campaign, a leading gun-control group, in his 2009 book \xe2\x80\x9cLethal Logic.\xe2\x80\x9d It recounts how the N.R.A. campaigned in the 1980s to weaken the 1968 Gun Control Act that President Lyndon Johnson pushed through after the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy. The result was the Firearm Owners\xe2\x80\x99 Protection Act of 1986, a misnamed law that has made it difficult to investigate and prosecute gun trafficking to this day. For example, it protects unscrupulous gun dealers by prohibiting A.T.F. agents from making more than one unannounced inspection a year. It also makes it hard to revoke their licenses. Those and other damaging provisions from the 1986 law should be tossed out as part of the new, still only hazily defined anti-trafficking measure Mr. Obama has pledged to fight for. The N.R.A.\xe2\x80\x99s opposition won\xe2\x80\x99t make that easy.'b'Keeping guns out of the wrong hands has never been a gun lobby priority. Its priority has been weak enforcement of weak laws.'b'ANNAPOLIS, Md.'b'IN the last campaign cycle, Barack Obama headlined 220 fund-raisers, unprecedented for a presidential re-election effort, and collected more than $1 billion. So one might think that he should be free to focus exclusively on governing. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not likely.'b'There was a time when periods of campaigning and of governing were clearly divided. \xe2\x80\x9cSince he is President, he cannot be politically active until well after the July Convention,\xe2\x80\x9d advisers to President Harry S. Truman wrote in a 1947 pre-campaign memo. \xe2\x80\x9cHe must be President of all the people and not merely the leader of a party, until the very last minute.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That time is long gone. Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s first term bore the two hallmarks of what has become the permanent campaign: disproportionate travel to key electoral states and substantial time dedicated to political fund-raising from practically the moment he took office.'b'The president\xe2\x80\x99s time is, as Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, has said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe most precious resource in the White House.\xe2\x80\x9d Why, then, would Mr. Obama, who does not have to face the voters again, feel the need to stump in his second term?'b'The answer goes back to the campaign finance reforms of the 1970s, which were intended to limit the role of money in our electoral system but which have become largely anachronistic. Individual contributions were limited, so presidents were forced to spend ever more time raising fairly small contributions from large numbers of donors, particularly as TV advertising became more prevalent and expensive. Meanwhile, in 1976 the Supreme Court struck down limits on Congressional campaign expenditures, adding to the pressure on presidents to raise money for their fellow party members.'b'Ronald Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s 100 second-term fund-raisers topped the 80 he attended in his first term. In 1986, he tried unsuccessfully to preserve his party\xe2\x80\x99s control of the Senate, which Republicans had won six years earlier on the coattails of his 1980 presidential victory. In his final two years in the White House, Reagan kept raising money, to aid his party, Senate candidates and George Bush, who became the first sitting vice president elected to the presidency since 1836.'b'Bill Clinton headlined 471 second-term fund-raisers \xe2\x80\x94 almost triple his first-term total of 167. He was committed to retiring the Democratic National Committee\xe2\x80\x99s substantial debt following the 1996 election. Then, before the 1998 midterms and amid the Monica S. Lewinsky scandal, he tried to help his party retake Congress from the Republicans, who had swept both chambers in 1994. (Congress remained in Republican hands, and Mr. Clinton was impeached by the House but then acquitted by the Senate.) In his final years in office he raised yet more money, to help his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who moved to New York to run for the Senate, as well Vice President Al Gore, who campaigned to succeed him.'b'George W. Bush headlined 155 fund-raisers in his second term; he was on course to surpass the 173 in his first term until the 2008 financial crisis made him cancel a series of appearances. He failed to block the Democrats from taking both houses of Congress in 2006. But even as his approval ratings plunged to record lows, he remained his party\xe2\x80\x99s most prolific fund-raiser until he left office.'b'Since Mr. Obama took office, the permanent campaign has ramped up even more. Last year, neither major-party presidential nominee accepted public financing for the first time since the program was created as a pillar of the reforms of the \xe2\x80\x9970s. The Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s 2010 decision in the Citizens United case, which empowered outside political groups to raise money free from contribution limits, has only added to the fund-raising demands on the president.'b'Presidents are frequently criticized for campaigning instead of governing, but in a highly polarized era without lasting Congressional majorities, the stakes every two years grow ever higher: witness the gridlock between the Democratic-controlled Senate and the Republican majority in the House. For the White House, campaigning does not come at the expense of governing but facilitates the possibility of more effective governing \xe2\x80\x94 not to mention the establishment of a political legacy.'b'Mr. Obama has already pledged to raise money for the special election in Massachusetts for the seat that Senator John Kerry will vacate if he is confirmed as secretary of state. Unlimited campaign spending, relatively low contribution limits and narrow margins of party control in both houses of a bitterly divided Congress ensure that the fund-raising will only accelerate. After all, the battle of 2014 is already under way.'b'FIFTY years ago, Birmingham, Ala., provided the enduring iconography of the civil rights era, testing the mettle of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. so dramatically that he was awarded the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize.'b'During his protest there in May 1963, the biblical spectacle of black children facing down Public Safety Commissioner Eugene (Bull) Connor\xe2\x80\x99s fire hoses and police dogs set the stage for King\xe2\x80\x99s Sermon on the Mount some four months later at the Lincoln Memorial. And the civil rights movement\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cYear of Birmingham\xe2\x80\x9d passed into history as an epic narrative of good versus evil.'b'Our understanding of the \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d has expanded beyond the lone-dreamer theory to embrace other activists, like King\xe2\x80\x99s partner in Birmingham, 'b'the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth'b'. Yet the evil segregationist archetype is fixed in the popular mind as the villainous housewife of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Help\xe2\x80\x9d or the cretinous mob of \xe2\x80\x9cDjango Unchained\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 nobody we\xe2\x80\x99d ever know, or certainly ever be.'b'But the disquieting reality is that the conflict was between not good and evil, but good and normal. The brute racism that today seems like mass social insanity was a \xe2\x80\x9cway of life\xe2\x80\x9d practiced by ordinary \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d people.'b'According to the Southern community\xe2\x80\x99s consensus of \xe2\x80\x9cnormal,\xe2\x80\x9d those fighting for rights now considered mainstream were \xe2\x80\x9cextremists,\xe2\x80\x9d and public servants could rationalize plans to murder men like Shuttlesworth, confident that they were on the right side of history.'b'Consider new evidence about a plan by Connor to have Shuttlesworth assassinated. Under Connor\xe2\x80\x99s orders, Detective Tom Cook found a black man vulnerable to the law, supplied him with a gun and planted him by the steps of a church where Shuttlesworth was speaking one night. The plot was foiled when a passing police car frightened the hit man away.'b'What distinguishes this from other officially sanctioned schemes to kill Shuttlesworth is proof that it was known by the state\xe2\x80\x99s largest news organization, The Birmingham News, owned by the Newhouse family, which also sponsored extensive surveillance of local citizens.'b'Cook described the attempt to a young reporter at The News, Tom Lankford, who was considered \xe2\x80\x9cBull\xe2\x80\x99s boy\xe2\x80\x9d by the police he covered. He was also the prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 of the paper\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive, Vincent Townsend, who had given him a sizable budget for surveillance equipment to fulfill his own desire, as the city\xe2\x80\x99s power broker, \xe2\x80\x9cto know every word they\xe2\x80\x99re saying,\xe2\x80\x9d according to Mr. Lankford, \xe2\x80\x9c10 minutes after they\xe2\x80\x99ve said it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Logically, then, Townsend was also aware that the city commissioner he had supported editorially intended to murder an innocent, nonviolent man. But The News remained silent on Connor\xe2\x80\x99s criminal proclivities, and the lawman who had no qualms about telling a reporter of his key role in an attempted murder must not have realized he was doing anything wrong.'b'Mr. Lankford saw Townsend\xe2\x80\x99s goal as \xe2\x80\x9cracial peace in troubled Birmingham,\xe2\x80\x9d and believed that it was being served by the surveillance he conducted in frequent concert with the police. Indeed their mission was aided by a previously undisclosed communitywide network.'b'The phone company gave Mr. Lankford and his law-enforcement cohorts spiked pole climbers and instructions on \xe2\x80\x9crunning\xe2\x80\x9d various junction boxes, and lent them an old truck still bearing the Southern Bell logo.'b'A local rabbi \xe2\x80\x94 one of the eight clergymen to whom King addressed his \xe2\x80\x9cLetter From Birmingham Jail\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 purchased spy equipment for the police, intending for it to be used on racist groups under investigation for placing dynamite at a local temple in 1958.'b'But the electronics also ended up being used on white community leaders and, naturally, the civil rights movement. Mr. Lankford says he and a police detective even eavesdropped on union officials representing Newhouse\xe2\x80\x99s broadcast employees during contract negotiations. One popular wiretap target was a local pastor, A. D. King, who was overheard arranging a rendezvous for him and his visiting older brother, Martin Luther King, with women who were not their wives. The police organized a sting, with Mr. Lankford along to take pictures. We may never know if the intelligence on the brothers was correct, because the detectives lost the car carrying the elder King that night in a traffic jam.'b'But the most surprising detail about this incident is that it happened in October 1963, months after Connor was forced from office. That means that the new, supposedly enlightened city government was carrying on his battle to destroy the movement that had just irrevocably put Birmingham on the map, next to Gettysburg: those \xe2\x80\x9cevents of Birmingham\xe2\x80\x9d had moved John F. Kennedy to introduce what became the Civil Rights Act of 1964.'b'As its yearlong commemoration of those events now begins, white Birmingham will be tempted to fall back on its favorite \xe2\x80\x9cBull Connor as bad apple\xe2\x80\x9d defense. Even for those who lived through segregation, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to accept the civic truth of Shuttlesworth\xe2\x80\x99s time: that \xe2\x80\x9cracial peace\xe2\x80\x9d was an objective supported by murder.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone behaves badly \xe2\x80\x94 given the chance,\xe2\x80\x9d Hemingway wrote in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Sun Also Rises.\xe2\x80\x9d What sets white Southerners apart is that they had so many ways to go wrong, confronting a moral dilemma each time they drank from a white water fountain. Painting all segregationists as cartoon racists encourages the rest of us to take cover under a blanket illusion of blamelessness \xe2\x80\x94 give or take an Abu Ghraib or a Penn State football program. Or the F.B.I.\xe2\x80\x99s own obscene wiretap campaign to discredit Martin Luther King.'b'If I were to indulge in the annual \xe2\x80\x9cIf King were alive ...\xe2\x80\x9d game, I would guess he\xe2\x80\x99d be morally embarrassing the insidious new \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 assassination by drone, for example, and the repressed torture \xe2\x80\x9cdebate\xe2\x80\x9d that has returned on such a timely holiday. Do we really want to be a country that argues about whether torture \xe2\x80\x9cworks\xe2\x80\x9d? So did segregation.'b'PROVIDENCE, R.I.'b'BARACK OBAMA has arrived at a historical moment enjoyed by only one other Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt: he gets to deliver a second Inaugural Address.'b'The second inaugurals we remember bear witness to political realignment. The words of Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, in particular, testify to the closing of one era and the opening of another. In 1936 and 1984, Roosevelt and Reagan each won big. Their triumphs consolidated political transformations that had been building for some time and allowed their respective parties to reset the nation\xe2\x80\x99s political center of gravity.'b'Without the benefit of historical distance, how do we judge whether we are in the midst of such a realignment? Are the country\xe2\x80\x99s deepest political instincts undergoing fundamental change? Coming up with an answer is not easy.'b'Roosevelt and Reagan were historical opponents in the 20th century version of our longstanding battle between empowered and limited government. Roosevelt argued that \xe2\x80\x9cwe have begun to bring private autocratic powers into their proper subordination to the public\xe2\x80\x99s government.\xe2\x80\x9d Reagan might as well have been talking to F.D.R. when he countered, \xe2\x80\x9cWe asked things of government that government was not equipped to give.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yet to understand the full meaning of their re-election, we have to look closely at what allowed each party to define an era. The Democratic Party dominated the period between 1932 and 1980 with nearly unassailable Congressional majorities. The Republican Party was far more dependent on the executive branch and a few friendly Congresses.'b'The House of Representatives had a Democratic majority every year but four between 1933 and 1995, the Senate every year but four between 1933 and 1981. While the Roosevelt-Truman and Kennedy-Johnson presidencies were instrumental in developing Democratic liberalism, it was Congressional Democratic strength that defined the era and boxed in Eisenhower and Nixon.'b'That Republicans have rarely enjoyed such unassailable majorities helps us understand recent history. Each generation of Republican strategists announced the emergence of a new Republican majority, beginning with Kevin Phillips in 1969 and continuing on through Lee Atwater, the Contract With America, Karl Rove and the Tea Party.'b'This is precisely why contemporary Republicans worry about Mr. Obama, and it partly explains Republican Congressional behavior since 1994. Despite their success in shifting the nation\xe2\x80\x99s politics rightward since 1980, Republicans have not been able to lock in the kind of year in, year out majorities the Democrats once enjoyed.'b'As the rage of the culture wars loses its political purchase, demographic trends have further deepened Republican anxiety. Postelection polls revealed what party insiders already knew: they lead a largely white party that skews older and more toward the middle and upper classes. Republicanism \xe2\x80\x94 as many insiders admit \xe2\x80\x94 is on an unsustainable path. Mr. Obama once said that Reagan \xe2\x80\x9cchanged the trajectory of America\xe2\x80\x9d because he \xe2\x80\x9ctapped into what people were already feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d Could Mr. Obama do the same and orchestrate a quiet realignment with shifting demographics on his side?'b'Despite the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re much closer to national health insurance, many liberals find this idea laughable. They see Mr. Obama as an even more committed centrist than Bill Clinton and they are convinced, with some justification, that they no longer really have a national party. They see a Democratic Party controlled by its corporate center and a Republican Party controlled by its right wing. The man who looked like an avatar of realignment in 2008 appears to many liberals in 2013 as a passive compromiser.'b'Their view is understandable. The de facto 60-vote supermajority now effectively required in the Senate, the gerrymandering of Congressional districts for Republican advantage, the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s rightward lurch, the post-Citizens United deluge of money and the long assault on organized labor would seem to make a new liberal political alignment exceedingly unlikely.'b'A directionless politics prevails instead. At the national level, there is no political will to address long-term problems like soaring health care costs, climate change, infrastructure decay and prison overpopulation.'b'Meanwhile, states like Michigan have further eroded labor and reproductive rights, while others, like California, with its Democratic supermajority, seem poised to safeguard the same while increasing spending. As the left-wing political activist Michael Harrington said in 1976, the country is \xe2\x80\x9cmoving vigorously left, right and center, all at once.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The historian Matthew D. Lassiter has called this the politics of the \xe2\x80\x9cvolatile center.\xe2\x80\x9d Rather than a leftward or rightward realignment, we may be in for decades of furious contests not just for voters in the middle but over middling political ideas.'b'Which brings us back to Mr. Obama. In the long shadow of the New Deal and the Reagan Revolution, the marathon debates over whether the top marginal income-tax rate should be 35 or 39.6 percent seem unworthy of his predecessors\xe2\x80\x99 larger visions. But presidents don\xe2\x80\x99t realign American politics; they consolidate realignments whose complex sources lie elsewhere.'b'This is Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s real problem. Taken together, his health care reform and his cautious rejection of most of the policies of George W. Bush may well be judged by future historians as a meaningful adjustment. But there is insufficient clarity in the political landscape for him to articulate a new political calculus of the sort devised by Roosevelt and Reagan. The president\xe2\x80\x99s voice is simply one more in the raucous cacophony that currently defines our public square.'b'In the final hours of the last Congress, the Senate approved action against an intolerable failure of criminal justice \xe2\x80\x94 'b'the backlog of scores of thousands of rape test kits'b' allowed to sit untested for years in police custody. Victims are denied justice while the perpetrators remain free to rape again.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe have these monsters allowed to walk the streets,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lavinia Masters, 'b'a rape victim at the age of 13 who had to wait two decades'b' before the kit of physical evidence from the assault in Texas was tested and led to a serial predator who had been free for years. The Senate bill would reduce the rape-kit backlog by redirecting financing toward this problem. It authorizes a national audit for DNA matching that could involve as many as 400,000 untested kits, according to Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who sponsored the measure.'b'Congress enacted a law to deal with the problem in 2004, but the $151 million in annual financing became diverted to other purposes even as police and laboratory officials complained that they lacked sufficient resources to deal with the kits, which can cost $1,000 each to process. The level of justice denied was shockingly documented in recent years when the Fort Worth, Tex., police submitted 960 kits for testing to the 'b'Center for Human Identification'b', a DNA science project at the University of North Texas. The kits turned up 102 suspects, leading to 47 arrests and 36 felony convictions, according to the police. These numbers suggest that many rapists still roam free and show the need for Congress to revive and enact the rape-kit bill.'b'This is a law-and-order measure requiring no ideological fight over additional financing. The Senate vote in December was unanimous. The House should be no less emphatic in repairing this scandalous injustice to rape victims.'b'\xc2\xa0'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Myth of Nuclear Necessity'b',\xe2\x80\x9d by Ward Wilson (Op-Ed, Jan. 14), drives home the point that these weapons of mass destruction are dangerous and ultimately useless.'b'Nuclear weapons place society under the constant threat of nuclear terrorism or even accidental launching.

Most of the stem cells used in such research have been derived from days-old human embryos through a process that destroys the embryos and is strongly opposed by many religious and social conservatives.'b'Although federal law since 1996 has prohibited federal financing of research that destroys an embryo, the Obama administration, like the Clinton administration before it, concluded that if stem cells were derived (and embryos destroyed) with private or state money, federal money could support subsequent research. Rules issued by the Obama administration were challenged in court by two researchers who work on adult stem cells; they contended that no research could get taxpayer money if it depended on an embryo having been destroyed at some point.'b'After conflicting lower court rulings, a federal appeals court dismissed the case, saying the administration\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the law was permissible. And now the Supreme Court has declined to hear an appeal.

Steve LaTourette, an Ohio Republican who just retired from his House seat, said the dozen insurrectionists should be kicked out of the party caucus, since they 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t have a clue\xe2\x80\x9d'b' how to legislate. Even Ralph Reed, the former leader of the Christian Coalition, said Republicans need to pick up on clear shifts in demographics and attitudes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Republican Party can\xe2\x80\x99t stay exactly where it is and stick its head in the sand and ignore the fact that the country is changing,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'he told The Times'b' this month.'b'The upcoming session will give Republican leaders a chance to ignore pressure from the right and begin working with Democrats. The tests are coming quickly: Will they block all gun-control proposals and a reasonable immigration plan? Will they force a government shutdown to resist new revenues and demand cuts to safety-net programs? If the answers to these questions are yes, the party will remain hijacked by its most shrill minority.'b'On the day President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, an exuberant Vice President Biden famously pronounced the reform a \xe2\x80\x9cbig something deal\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 except that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t use the word \xe2\x80\x9csomething.\xe2\x80\x9d And he was right.'b'In fact, I\xe2\x80\x99d suggest using this phrase to describe the Obama administration as a whole. F.D.R. had his New Deal; well, Mr. Obama has his Big Deal. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t delivered everything his supporters wanted, and at times the survival of his achievements seemed very much in doubt. But if progressives look at where we are as the second term begins, they\xe2\x80\x99ll find grounds for a lot of (qualified) satisfaction.'b'Consider, in particular, three areas: health care, inequality and financial reform.'b'Health reform is, as Mr. Biden suggested, the centerpiece of the Big Deal. Progressives have been trying to get some form of universal health insurance since the days of Harry Truman; they\xe2\x80\x99ve finally succeeded.'b'True, this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the health reform many were looking for. Rather than simply providing health insurance to everyone by extending Medicare to cover the whole population, we\xe2\x80\x99ve constructed a Rube Goldberg device of regulations and subsidies that will cost more than single-payer and have many more cracks for people to fall through.'b'But this was what was possible given the political reality \xe2\x80\x94 the power of the insurance industry, the general reluctance of voters with good insurance to accept change. And experience with Romneycare in Massachusetts \xe2\x80\x94 hey, this is a great age for irony \xe2\x80\x94 shows that such a system is indeed workable, and it can provide Americans with a huge improvement in medical and financial security.'b'What about inequality? On that front, sad to say, the Big Deal falls very far short of the New Deal. Like F.D.R., Mr. Obama took office in a nation marked by huge disparities in income and wealth. But where the New Deal had a revolutionary impact, empowering workers and creating a middle-class society that lasted for 40 years, the Big Deal has been limited to equalizing policies at the margin.'b'That said, 'b'health reform will provide substantial aid'b' to the bottom half of the income distribution, paid for largely through new taxes targeted on the top 1 percent, and the \xe2\x80\x9cfiscal cliff\xe2\x80\x9d deal further raises taxes on the affluent. Over all, 1-percenters will see their 'b'after-tax income fall'b' around 6 percent; for the top tenth of a percent, the hit rises to around 9 percent. This will reverse only a fraction of the huge upward redistribution that has taken place since 1980, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not trivial.'b'Finally, there\xe2\x80\x99s financial reform. The Dodd-Frank reform bill is often disparaged as toothless, and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not the kind of dramatic regime change one might have hoped for after runaway bankers brought the world economy to its knees.'b'Still, if plutocratic rage is any indication, the reform isn\xe2\x80\x99t as toothless as all that. And 'b'Wall Street put its money'b' where its mouth is. For example, hedge funds strongly favored Mr. Obama in 2008 \xe2\x80\x94 but in 2012 they gave three-quarters of their money to Republicans (and lost).'b'All in all, then, the Big Deal has been, well, a pretty big deal. But will its achievements last?'b'Mr. Obama overcame the biggest threat to his legacy simply by winning re-election. But George W. Bush also won re-election, a victory widely heralded as signaling the coming of a permanent conservative majority. So will Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s moment of glory prove equally fleeting? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.'b'For one thing, the Big Deal\xe2\x80\x99s main policy initiatives are already law. This is a contrast with Mr. Bush, who didn\xe2\x80\x99t try to privatize Social Security until his second term \xe2\x80\x94 and it turned out that a \xe2\x80\x9ckhaki\xe2\x80\x9d election won by posing as the nation\xe2\x80\x99s defender against terrorists didn\xe2\x80\x99t give him a mandate to dismantle a highly popular program.'b'And there\xe2\x80\x99s another contrast: the Big Deal agenda is, in fact, fairly popular \xe2\x80\x94 and will become more popular once Obamacare goes into effect and people see both its real benefits and the fact that it won\xe2\x80\x99t send Grandma to the death panels.'b'Finally, progressives have the demographic and cultural wind at their backs. Right-wingers flourished for decades by exploiting racial and social divisions \xe2\x80\x94 but that strategy has now turned against them as we become an increasingly diverse, socially liberal nation.'b'Now, none of what I\xe2\x80\x99ve just said should be taken as grounds for progressive complacency. The plutocrats may have lost a round, but their wealth and the influence it gives them in a money-driven political system remain. Meanwhile, the deficit scolds (largely financed by those same plutocrats) are still trying to bully Mr. Obama into slashing social programs.'b'So the story is far from over. Still, maybe progressives \xe2\x80\x94 an ever-worried group \xe2\x80\x94 might want to take a brief break from anxiety and savor their real, if limited, victories.'b'More than 60,000 innocent civilians have been slaughtered in President Bashar al-Assad\xe2\x80\x99s desperate bid to retain power in Syria. In the two-year reign of terror, he has also forced staggering numbers of Syrians to relocate within the country or flee across the border, creating a disaster that is threatening to destabilize the region. The international community has an obligation to do more to ease the suffering.'b'Some 650,000 Syrians are now 'b'registered as refugees by the United Nations'b' or awaiting registration, an increase of almost 100,000 in the past month alone. That includes about 155,000 in Turkey, 148,000 in Lebanon, 142,000 in Jordan, 73,000 in Iraq and 14,000 in Egypt. Thousands more are not registered. The total could reach one million this year. Many Syrians have fled because of bombings by army troops, still others because of sexual violence. According to the'b' International Rescue Committee'b', refugees identified rape \xe2\x80\x94 including gang rapes in front of family members \xe2\x80\x94 as a \xe2\x80\x9cprimary reason\xe2\x80\x9d for fleeing.'b'Women and children still face sexual and other violence in the camps, and a lack of medical care and counseling to help them recover. Neighboring countries have opened borders and set up camps, clinics and schools. But the need is bigger than any host government can handle. The situation has been made worse by a harsh winter.'b'Complicating matters, the vast majority of refugees have settled not in camps but in towns and cities. A few have been taken in by families but most live in \xe2\x80\x9cwretched conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d packed in small rented rooms and dilapidated apartments, says the I.R.C. Most international aid goes to the camps.'b'The main task facing the international community is to assist the countries that have welcomed the refugees and now confront political and economic pressures as a result. It is in no one\xe2\x80\x99s interest to see these countries destabilized by this humanitarian emergency. The United Nations\xe2\x80\x99 refugee agency has requested $1 billion from the international community to meet the needs of refugees and $500 million more to aid Syrians inside the country. Pledges have been slow.'b'The United States and the 27-member European Union have been the two top donors so far, with Washington giving $210 million and the E.U. giving $477 million. The laggards have been the wealthy Persian Gulf states, which have a direct interest in regional stability but whose scattershot contributions totaling $155 million have sometimes bypassed the United Nations and other agencies seeking to coordinate the response. More is also required of Russia and China, which have enabled Mr. Assad in his brutal war but done little to help his victims.'b'Almost everybody who weighs in on the nomination of Chuck Hagel to be the next secretary of defense, pro or con, begins by genuflecting to his experience in Vietnam, as if it goes without saying that this is a compelling asset for the civilian who oversees the Pentagon. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be an exception.'b'Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s wartime service, which earned him awards for valor and two purple hearts, was unquestionably honorable. No doubt he has a deeper awareness than most people that wars are messy, which is not without value. His tour as an infantry squad leader, even more than his Republican Party card, provides useful political cover for a president who favors a less interventionist foreign policy and a smaller defense budget. But the notion that experience of war imparts a special wisdom is one of our enduring fallacies.'b'Just to be clear, I think the president is entitled to pick a defense secretary who is compatible with his views and has his trust. Besides, as Hillary Clinton and Bob Gates can testify, under this president foreign and defense matters are run from the White House. The new secretaries of state and defense will probably be, as their predecessors have been, more executors than authors of policy.'b'And most of the arguments for voting against Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s confirmation are flimsy at best. He once described Israel\xe2\x80\x99s friends in Washington as \xe2\x80\x9cthe Jewish lobby?\xe2\x80\x9d So does the Israeli press. He\xe2\x80\x99s in favor of talking to Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah? Great. As another defense minister, Moshe Dayan, once observed: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to make peace, you don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to your friends. You talk to your enemies.\xe2\x80\x9d Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s attitudes toward gay rights and women\xe2\x80\x99s freedom are \xe2\x80\x94 or were, back when he was a senator from a red state \xe2\x80\x94 unenlightened? I would bet that, like most of us, he has evolved, but in any case those are issues the president decides. The most small-minded reasons for opposing Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s confirmation are the unspoken, partisan ones: the hope of embarrassing the president, or the urge to pay Hagel back for his support of the Democrat Bob Kerrey, a fellow Vietnam vet, in last year\xe2\x80\x99s Nebraska Senate race.'b'There is no end of bad reasons to vote no. But among the reasons to vote yes, the fact that Hagel has tasted combat should be regarded with skepticism. You hope that he brings to the job a non-bullying management style, strategic judgment, political dexterity and an open mind, but none of those are qualities likely to have been perfected in the jungles of Vietnam. It\xe2\x80\x99s even worth considering whether his military service could be a handicap.'b'The last time I wrestled with this issue was about 10 years ago when John Kerry was contemplating a run for the presidency and calculating how heavily to exploit his wartime command of a riverboat in Vietnam. (In the end, I\xe2\x80\x99d say he overplayed it \xe2\x80\x94 remember \xe2\x80\x9creporting for duty\xe2\x80\x9d? \xe2\x80\x94 and the emphasis left him more vulnerable to the infamous swift-boat smear.)'b'Whether or not Senator Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s Vietnam experience brought him wisdom, I decided at the time, was better judged by examining his wisdom than his experience. A decade later that observation is relevant again as Kerry awaits his own hearings on his nomination to be secretary of state. If you had only his voting record on recent American wars to go by, you\xe2\x80\x99d be hard pressed to detect any coherent wisdom of the battlefield. His service in Vietnam did not keep Kerry from casting two big, politically expedient \xe2\x80\x94 and, in hindsight, misguided \xe2\x80\x94 votes on Iraq: in 1991 against the first President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s justified war to drive Iraq out of Kuwait, and in 2002 in favor of authorizing the second President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s Iraq folly. Fortunately for Kerry (and for us), his work as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and his role as President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s informal emissary on missions to Afghanistan and Pakistan have been more impressive.'b'Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s voting record on military affairs, like Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s, sometimes seems less a matter of considered judgment than political reflex. Along with Kerry, Hagel voted for the 2002 resolution authorizing war against Iraq. But in 2007 he co-sponsored a resolution against the troop surge. The surge succeeded well enough that it enabled Obama to withdraw from Iraq without shame. Considering Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s call on that issue, one military analyst I checked with speculated that \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps the mishandling of Vietnam blinded him to the fact that other wars could be done right.\xe2\x80\x9d In any case, the record makes you wonder whether a sense of war that was imprinted on Hagel 45 years ago will be all that helpful in waging new and different wars.'b'The deference to the military service credential is bipartisan. Hawks complain when a president who never put on a uniform presumes to override the generals on spending or, say, the size of a troop deployment. Doves protest when leaders without war experience rattle their swords. Thus when the nation was led into Iraq by George Bush and Dick Cheney, a president who spent the Vietnam years at home in the National Guard and a vice president who said he \xe2\x80\x9chad other priorities\xe2\x80\x9d during that war, there were jeers of \xe2\x80\x9cchicken hawk!\xe2\x80\x9d And one antiwar senator \xe2\x80\x94 yes, that would be Chuck Hagel \xe2\x80\x94 proposed that a hawkish Pentagon adviser who was gung-ho to invade Iraq should be drafted as part of the first wave into Baghdad.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe horror of it, the pain of it, the suffering of it,\xe2\x80\x9d Hagel told a 'b'Veterans History Project'b' interviewer in 2002. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople just don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it unless they\xe2\x80\x99ve been through it. There\xe2\x80\x99s no glory, only suffering in war.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If you follow the logic far enough, it takes you to a glib notion: that anyone who has not seen combat and is not putting his own life on the line is less deserving of a voice. Which, by the way, would pretty much disqualify an entire gender from the discussion.'b'Back then, 'b'Eliot Cohen'b', a neocon military historian with whom I do not often agree, wrote the following about the combat credential: \xe2\x80\x9cAccording to this view, to fill a senior policy position during a war one would of course prefer a West Point graduate who had led a regiment in combat, as opposed to a corporate lawyer turned politician with a few weeks\xe2\x80\x99 experience in a militia unit that did not fight. The former profile fits Jefferson Davis, and the latter Abraham Lincoln.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Experience can be illuminating, but it can also be a trap. There\xe2\x80\x99s a reason we worry about generals \xe2\x80\x9cfighting the last war.\xe2\x80\x9d The troop surge strategy that David Petraeus pulled off so successfully in Iraq was widely considered a costly failure when it was replicated in the much more complicated mess of Afghanistan.'b'Politicians, no less than generals, can be blinkered by experience. Vietnam made a whole generation wary of any interventions, however justified. Bill Clinton, who never fought but who was shaped by the catastrophe of Vietnam, took a lot of persuading before he did the right thing in Bosnia. He has said of his failure to send troops to stop the genocide in Rwanda that \xe2\x80\x9c'b'we just blew it.'b'\xe2\x80\x9d This tendency to recoil from conflict was called \xe2\x80\x9cVietnam syndrome,\xe2\x80\x9d and Hagel may have the symptoms.'b'In \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Endgame'b',\xe2\x80\x9d their history of the war in Iraq, Michael Gordon and Bernard Trainor recount a trip then-Senator Obama and Senator Hagel took to Iraq in 2008. Obama deftly probes General Petraeus on the nuances of winding down the conflict. But Hagel comes across as prickly and inflexible. At one point, he seems to suggest that the general should be trimming his troop requests to fit the domestic political realities in Washington, and Petraeus takes offense. \xe2\x80\x9cI will do what you want me to do,\xe2\x80\x9d Petraeus retorts. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give my best military advice. You seem to want me to tailor my advice to a policy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Another useful Pentagon skill they didn\xe2\x80\x99t teach infantrymen in Vietnam: how to manage generals.'b'President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'first Inaugural Address'b' offered a clear and bracing vision for a way out of the depth of an economic crisis and two foreign wars. 'b'His second'b', on Monday, revealed less of his specific plans for the next four years but more of his political philosophy.'b'He argued eloquently for a progressive view of government, founded on history and his own deep conviction that American prosperity and the preservation of freedom depend on collective action. In the coming days, there will be no let up of political combat over the debt ceiling, gun control, national security and tax policies that can either reduce income inequality or allow such inequality to stifle economic growth and opportunity for all but the very wealthiest in this society.'b'But, on Monday, the president stepped back from those immediate battles to explain what it means in the broadest sense to be \xe2\x80\x9cwe the people,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s most eloquent description of our common heritage.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe have always understood that when times change, so must we,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges; that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In every sphere of life \xe2\x80\x94 improving education, building roads, caring for the poor and elderly, training workers, recovering from natural disasters, providing for our defense \xe2\x80\x94 progress requires that Americans do these things together, Mr. Obama said.'b'That applies, he said, to \xe2\x80\x9cthe commitments we make to each other \xe2\x80\x94 through Medicare, and Medicaid, and Social Security \xe2\x80\x94 these things do not sap our initiative; they strengthen us. They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'President Obama rejected any argument that the American people can be divided into groups whose interests are opposed to each other. The choice is not \xe2\x80\x9cbetween caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cFor we remember the lessons of our past, when twilight years were spent in poverty, and parents of a child with a disability had nowhere to turn.\xc2\xa0 We do not believe that in this country freedom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness for the few.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0'b'He spoke only obliquely of the persistent gridlock in Congress, where he will face right-wing Republicans whose bleak agenda would weaken civil rights, shred the social safety net and block important programs that could help put millions of jobless Americans back to work. \xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate.\xc2\xa0 We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Instead, he took the fight to the people, laying out his principles and priorities: addressing the threat of climate change, embracing sustainable energy sources, ensuring equality of gays and lesbians, expanding immigration and equal pay for women. Disappointingly, the need for stricter gun controls was noted solely in a reference to the safety of children in places like Newtown, Conn.'b'On foreign policy, President Obama expressed with fervor a view of the role of the United States in a world that is threatened by terrorism on many continents. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully \xe2\x80\x94 not because we are na\xc3\xafve about the dangers we face, but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica will remain the anchor of strong alliances in every corner of the globe; and we will renew those institutions that extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad, for no one has a greater stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Obama is smart enough to know that what he wants to achieve in his second term must be done in the next two years \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps even in the first 18 months. Throughout his first term, he clung to a hope of bipartisanship even when it became obvious that his Republican adversaries had no interest in compromise of any sort.'b'Time is not on his side. It is pointless to wait for signs of conciliation from the extreme right, whose central ideology is to render government ineffective. He has gotten off to a good start by 'b'putting forward a comprehensive plan to tighten gun laws'b', despite outrageous propaganda against sensible controls from the gun lobby.'b'Mr. Obama acknowledged that there is much left to be done to shore up the economic recovery and invest in education and opportunities for the next generation. And, above all, he stressed the importance of the middle class to America\xe2\x80\x99s economic survival. \xe2\x80\x9cOur country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s natural for a second-term president to be thinking about his place in history. There is no doubt that Mr. Obama has the ambition and intellect to place himself in the first rank of presidents. With this speech, he has made a forceful argument for a progressive agenda that meets the nation\xe2\x80\x99s needs. We hope he has the political will and tactical instincts to carry it out.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Misguided Social Security \xe2\x80\x98Reform'b'\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 13):'b'I share your concern that President Obama has been too eager to go along with Congressional Republicans to reduce Social Security benefits by lowering cost-of-living adjustments for millions of retirees, widows and orphans.

Or strychnine, a poison?'b'Why would she take a bath in scalding water? Or spend the night in the snow?'b'Because she wanted to end a pregnancy. Historically, women have chosen all those methods to induce abortion. The first known descriptions appeared around 1500 B.C. in the Ebers Papyrus, an ancient Egyptian medical text that mentioned an abortion engineered by a plant-fiber tampon coated with honey and crushed dates.'b'For most of history, abortion has been a dangerous procedure a woman attempted to perform on herself. In private. Without painkillers.'b'What is most striking about this history of probes and poisons is that throughout all recorded time, there have been women so desperate to end a pregnancy that they were willing to endure excruciating pain and considerable risk, including infection, sterility, permanent injury, puncture and hemorrhage, to say nothing of shame and ostracism. Where abortion was illegal, they risked prosecution and imprisonment. And death, of course.'b'The newspapers of the mid-1800s were full of advertisements for potions, pills and powders that claimed to cause miscarriage. \xe2\x80\x9cFrench Periodical Pills: Warranted to Have the Desired Effect in All Cases\xe2\x80\x9d was one such knowing ad that appeared in The Boston Daily Times in 1845. Those ads spoke euphemistically of \xe2\x80\x9ccuring female complaint,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9crenovating\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cunblocking\xe2\x80\x9d the womb. They treated a problem that women called \xe2\x80\x9csuppression of the courses,\xe2\x80\x9d the idea being that monthly \xe2\x80\x9cturns\xe2\x80\x9d were the norm and that any cessation of normal periods meant they were \xe2\x80\x9csuppressed,\xe2\x80\x9d or that the womb was \xe2\x80\x9cobstructed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Many of the cures for these \xe2\x80\x9cailments\xe2\x80\x9d were nothing but sugar and dust. But some of them were nonetheless quite effective. Those were the dangerous ones, containing as they commonly did, turpentine, opium, pennyroyal, aloes, snakeroot, myrrh or oil of rue. One of the most common ingredients was ergot, or claviceps purpurea, a fungus found on the stalks of grain. Women as early as the 16th century had observed that cows that consumed ergot miscarried their calves. The fungus, however, had disastrous side effects, called ergotism, also known as St. Anthony\xe2\x80\x99s fire. Symptoms included a burning sensation in the limbs because of blood constriction, which led to gangrene. The poison could also cause seizures, itching, psychosis, vomiting, contractions, diarrhea and death.'b'Oil of tansy was another common abortifacient. Here is John Irving\xe2\x80\x99s unforgettable description, from his scrupulously researched novel \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cider House Rules,\xe2\x80\x9d of a doctor trying to save a woman after too many tansy-oil miscarriages: \xe2\x80\x9cHer abdomen was full of blood...but when he tried to sew up [the] uterus, his stitches simply pulled through the tissue, which he noticed was the texture of a soft cheese...his finger passed as easily through the intestine as through gelatin.\xe2\x80\x9d Tansy oil rots internal organs.'b'Notwithstanding such ghastly scenarios, abortion did not always \xe2\x80\x94 or even usually \xe2\x80\x94 result in death. Many women survived it, which is why for most of history it was one of the main forms of birth control. If they did choose to enlist help, they most often called upon another woman, usually a skilled midwife. But by the 1850s, male doctors began to take over all aspects of women\xe2\x80\x99s reproductive care, sidelining midwives and leading the movement to outlaw the practice of abortion. Did they save some women\xe2\x80\x99s lives by unmasking the dangers of \xe2\x80\x9cmedicines\xe2\x80\x9d to cause miscarriage? Undoubtedly. But by withholding midwives\xe2\x80\x99 knowledge of how to provide a relatively safe abortion in the early stage of pregnancy, they drove other women to undergo the procedure at the hands of the unskilled, until the United States Supreme Court made abortion legal on Jan. 22, 1973.'b'Women\xe2\x80\x99s historical willingness to endure horrible dangers, to submit to extreme and prolonged pain, to risk grave injury and death rather than remain pregnant, tells us something important about female desperation and determination, and the price women were \xe2\x80\x94 and still are \xe2\x80\x94 willing to pay to control their own bodies. What it tells us is that women will always find ways to end an unwanted pregnancy, no matter what the law says, no matter the risks to themselves.'b'If the Supreme Court were ever to overturn Roe v. Wade, or if anti-abortion forces continue to successfully chisel away at a woman\xe2\x80\x99s access to safe abortion, many women will still choose abortion \xe2\x80\x94 by their own hands. Leeches, lye and Spanish fly are still among the many tools available to the self-abortionist. So are knitting needles, with predictable, disastrous consequences. There is no law that will end the practice of abortion, only laws that can protect a woman\xe2\x80\x99s right to choose it, or not, and to keep it the safe and private procedure still available to us in 2013, 40 years after the Supreme Court made it legal.'b'WASHINGTON'b'FORTY years after Roe v. Wade, Americans seem to be traveling in opposite directions on abortion. The Democratic Party\xe2\x80\x99s latest platform opposes \xe2\x80\x9cany and all efforts to weaken or undermine\xe2\x80\x9d legal abortion. On the other hand, the last two years saw the adoption by state legislatures of the highest number of 'b'laws regulating or restricting abortion'b' in decades.'b'Is there anything the contending sides in the abortion debate can agree on?'b'I have a suggestion: wherever we stand on the issue, we ought to have access to high-quality, up-to-date information on how many women in each state are undergoing the procedure, by what method, at what stage of pregnancy and how many times. We should know the age of the women involved and, if relevant, whether there was parental notice. Americans should insist that abortion statistics be comprehensively gathered, rapidly totaled and assessed, and reliably published by a publicly accountable body.'b'Many would be surprised to know that this is not already the case. As a recent 'b'study by my organization'b', the Charlotte Lozier Institute, documents, abortion reporting varies considerably state by state. Most states mandate the gathering of data; most publish some type of report; and most share data with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which publishes an annual report. (And of course all keep the names of individual women seeking abortions confidential.)'b'But many states report annual abortion information on a delayed and sometimes desultory basis. As of the end of December, the majority of states still had not released their annual reports covering 2011. The 'b'C.D.C.\xe2\x80\x99s most recent report'b' (which showed a significant 5 percent drop in total abortions) was released on Nov. 23 and provided data for 2009, the first year of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s first term. Compare this with other public health metrics: in October the C.D.C. released its preliminary report on state rates of infant mortality for 2011. Data from 2010 on children\xe2\x80\x99s dental visits became available last May.'b'Worse, a small number of states, including two that are central to the abortion debate \xe2\x80\x94 California, which has the country\xe2\x80\x99s sixth highest abortion rate, and Maryland, which has the fifth highest and a reputation for serving as a haven for late-term abortions not permitted in other states \xe2\x80\x94 do not provide information to the C.D.C. at all.'b'We know what California\xe2\x80\x99s and Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s abortion rates are because their doctors and clinics, like those across the nation, voluntarily submit data to the Guttmacher Institute. Guttmacher is an independent enterprise, but it was once affiliated with Planned Parenthood, the largest abortion provider in the United States. There is no reason to think that the institute, whose abortion totals are consistently about a third higher than the C.D.C.\xe2\x80\x99s because of these omitted states, is not a reliable source of data for the number of legal abortions occurring nationwide. And yet we would not be comfortable with our primary information on tobacco or manufacturing pollution coming from entities rooted in those sectors.'b'Fortunately, several states are moving ahead with their own 21st-century reporting systems. Minnesota and Arizona require prompt reporting, making information available on state Web sites or to researchers, in some cases within weeks of the end of each month. They publish annual reports that are researcher-friendly at low cost to the taxpayer.'b'But we still need a national government body to do this work. In 1993, the C.D.C. abandoned its last effort to make the states participate in a comprehensive system for consistent state reporting. I believe a rebirth of federalism might be a good thing. But as long as the federal government spends close to one in every three health care dollars, and as long as the states accept money from Uncle Sam to finance family planning, then the states should be required to set and maintain reasonable reporting standards on abortion and to share their data with Washington.'b'Bill Clinton coined the phrase that abortion should be \xe2\x80\x9csafe, legal and rare.\xe2\x80\x9d Most Americans can agree on at least two-thirds of that formula \xe2\x80\x94 women should be safe, and abortion should be rare \xe2\x80\x94 from the get-go. Very few people would be sad to learn that the abortion rate in our country was going down. The least we can do is track those numbers in a reliable way.'b'No one believes that reporting is the most important issue, ethical or otherwise, in this profoundly important social question. Numbers do not determine morality. But unless we know the full scope and truth about abortion, we\xe2\x80\x99re debating in darkness.'b'For six years, Democrats in the Senate have chafed at an unprecedented abuse of the filibuster by Republicans, who have used the practice to hold up nominees high and low and require a supermajority for virtually every bill. But now that they finally have an opportunity to end much of this delay and abuse, Democrats are instead considering only a few half-measures.'b'When the Senate returns on Tuesday, it will still technically be in the first legislative day of the session, 'b'which means only a simple majority is necessary to change the rules'b' for the rest of the session.'b'With the support of 51 senators, the rules could be changed to require a \xe2\x80\x9ctalking filibuster,\xe2\x80\x9d forcing those objecting to a bill to stand and explain their reasons, at length. The current practice of routinely requiring a 60-vote majority for a bill through a silent objection would end, breaking the logjam that has made the chamber 'b'a well of inefficiency'b' and frustration.'b'Several younger senators, led by Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Tom Udall of New Mexico, say that if pressed, a majority of the Senate would support 'b'their plan for the talking filibuster'b'. But older senators aren\xe2\x80\x99t so sure, and 'b'have reportedly persuaded Harry Reid, the majority leader, to back off the idea'b'. With the experience of having been in the minority themselves, these Democrats are fearful of losing a powerful tool should Republicans ever return to power in the chamber.'b'That would squander a moment for change. Supermajorities were never intended to be a routine legislative barrier; they should be reserved for the most momentous bills, and the best way to make that happen is to require that objectors work hard for their filibuster, assembling a like-minded coalition and being forthright about their concerns rather than hiding in the shadows or holding up a bill with an e-mailed note.'b'Currently there are six opportunities to filibuster most bills, and Republicans have exploited them all. Mr. Reid wants to reduce those opportunities and speed things up, primarily by ending the filibuster on motions to proceed to debate on bills.'b'That change alone could a cut a week of delay on most measures. He also wants to curb filibusters that prevent conference committees from meeting and that hold up some presidential nominations.'b'A faster-moving Senate would be useful, but that should not be the only goal. The best way to end the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s sorry history of inaction is to end the silent filibuster, forcing lawmakers to explain themselves if they want to block legislation supported by the majority.'b'If New Yorkers need another good reason to support a major cleanup of their state\xe2\x80\x99s scandalously lax campaign finance laws, they need only look at the latest filing from Gov. Andrew Cuomo.'b'Mr. Cuomo has been talking about reforming the state\xe2\x80\x99s campaign financing system for years, most recently in his 'b'State of the State speech'b' this month. But that has not slowed his stunningly intense use of loopholes that allow special interests to lard his campaign with thousands of dollars and make small donors more irrelevant.'b'With a re-election campaign more than a year away, Mr. Cuomo has $22.5 million 'b'on hand'b'. Over the last two years, only 1 percent of what the campaign raised came from contributors giving less than $1,000.'b'Small donors were swamped by big givers, according to an analysis of Cuomo campaign filings by New York Public Interest Research Group. Since 2010, 142 people or organizations have given $8.4 million in chunks of $40,000 or more to that campaign. One real estate developer, Leonard Litwin, has given the governor $500,000, according to the research group. The normal limits for contributions are already high: $60,800 per donor per statewide race. But Mr. Litwin and others can give more by creating a number of limited-liability companies that each dole out the maximum allowed. It\xe2\x80\x99s legal, but that is the problem in Albany. The financing laws are loose and badly enforced, just as many Albany lawmakers prefer.'b'Mr. Cuomo has said that he supports a statewide version of New York City\xe2\x80\x99s public financing of campaigns. \xe2\x80\x9cIt works well in New York City,\xe2\x80\x9d he said recently. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will work well in New York State.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely correct, but Mr. Cuomo has to push for it, just as he pushed for same-sex marriage and gun control and on-time, balanced budgets.'b'New York\xe2\x80\x99s powerful governor cannot simply give speeches about the unfairness of his state\xe2\x80\x99s campaign financing laws while he uses its loopholes to enrich his own campaign. It is time for him to make good on those promises and bring cleaner, fairer and more open campaign financing to Albany.'b'Seneca Falls, Selma, Stonewall. The alliteration of that litany made it seem obvious and inevitable, a bit of poetry just there for the taking. Just waiting to happen.'b'But it has waited a long time. And President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s use of it in his speech on Monday \xe2\x80\x94 his grouping of those three places and moments in one grand and musical sentence \xe2\x80\x94 was bold and beautiful and something to hear. It spoke volumes about the progress that gay Americans have made over the four years between his first inauguration and this one, his second. It also spoke volumes about the progress that continues to elude us.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths \xe2\x80\x94 that all of us are created equal \xe2\x80\x94 is the star that guides us still, just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall,\xe2\x80\x9d the president said, taking a rapt country on a riveting trip to key theaters in the struggle for liberty and justice for all.'b'Seneca Falls is a New York town where, in 1848, the women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage movement gathered momentum. Selma is an Alabama city where, in 1965, marchers amassed, blood was shed and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. stood his ground against the unconscionable oppression of black Americans.'b'And Stonewall? This was the surprise inclusion, separating Obama\xe2\x80\x99s oratory and presidency from his predecessors\xe2\x80\x99 diction and deeds. It alludes to a gay bar in Manhattan that, in 1969, was raided by police, who subjected patrons to a bullying they knew too well. After the raid came riots, and after the riots came a more determined quest by L.G.B.T. Americans for the dignity they had long been denied.'b'The causes of gay Americans and black Americans haven\xe2\x80\x99t always existed in perfect harmony, and that context is critical for appreciating Obama\xe2\x80\x99s reference to Stonewall alongside Selma. Blacks have sometimes questioned gays\xe2\x80\x99 use of \xe2\x80\x9ccivil rights\xe2\x80\x9d to describe their own movement, and have noted that the historical experiences of the two groups aren\xe2\x80\x99t at all identical. Obama moved beyond that, focusing on the shared aspirations of all minorities. It was a big-hearted, deliberate, compelling decision.'b'He went on, seconds later, to explicitly mention \xe2\x80\x9cgay\xe2\x80\x9d Americans, saying a word never before uttered in inaugural remarks. What shocked me most about that was how un-shocking it was.'b'Four years ago we lived in a country in which citizens of various states had consistently voted against the legalization of same-sex marriage.'b'But on Nov. 6, the citizens of all three states that had the opportunity to legalize gay marriage at the ballot box did so, with clear majorities in Maryland, Maine and Washington endorsing it.'b'Four years ago the inaugural invocation was given by a pastor with a record of antigay positions and remarks. This year, a similar assignment was withdrawn from a pastor with a comparable record, once it came to light. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, an openly gay man was chosen to be the inaugural poet, and in news coverage of his biography, his parents\xe2\x80\x99 exile from Cuba drew more attention than his sexual orientation. That\xe2\x80\x99s how far we\xe2\x80\x99ve come.'b'And the distance traveled impresses me more than the distance left. I want to be clear on that. I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of our country and president, despite their shortcomings on this front and others. It takes time for minds to open fully and laws to follow suit, and the making of change, in contrast to the making of statements, depends on patience as well as passion.'b'But the \xe2\x80\x9cgay\xe2\x80\x9d passage of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s speech underscored the lingering gap between the American ideal and the American reality. \xe2\x80\x9cOur journey is not complete,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cuntil our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law \xe2\x80\x94 for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He means the right to marry. As long as we gay and lesbian Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t have that, we\xe2\x80\x99re being told that our relationships aren\xe2\x80\x99t as honorable as those of straight couples. And if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, then we\xe2\x80\x99re not as honorable, either. Is there really any other reading of the situation?'b'Despite our strides, gay and lesbian couples even now can marry only in nine states and the District of Columbia. The federal government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t recognize those weddings, meaning that in terms of taxes, military benefits and matters of immigration, it treats gays and lesbians differently than it treats other Americans. It relegates us to an inferior class.'b'The Supreme Court could soon change, or validate, that. There are relevant cases before it. For his part Obama could show less deference to states\xe2\x80\x99 rights, be more insistent about what\xe2\x80\x99s just and necessary coast-to-coast, and push for federal protections against employment discrimination when it comes to L.G.B.T. Americans. His actions over the next four years could fall wholly in line with Monday\xe2\x80\x99s trailblazing words. My hope is real, and grateful, and patient.'b'The best Inaugural Addresses make an argument for something. President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s second one, which surely has to rank among the best of the past half-century, makes an argument for a pragmatic and patriotic progressivism.'b'His critics have sometimes accused him of being an outsider, but Obama wove his vision from deep strands in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s past. He told an American story that began with the Declaration and then touched upon the railroad legislation, the Progressive Era, the New Deal, the highway legislation, the Great Society, Seneca Falls, Selma and Stonewall.'b'Turning to the present, Obama argued that America has to change its approach if it wants to continue its progress. Modern problems like globalization, technological change, widening inequality and wage stagnation compel us to take new collective measures if we\xe2\x80\x99re to pursue the old goals of equality and opportunity.'b'Obama wasn\xe2\x80\x99t explicit about why we have failed to meet these challenges. But his critique was implicit. There has been too much \xe2\x80\x9cme\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 too much individualism and narcissism, too much retreating into the private sphere. There hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been enough \xe2\x80\x9cus,\xe2\x80\x9d not enough communal action for the common good.'b'The president then described some of the places where collective action is necessary: to address global warming, to fortify the middle class, to defend Medicare and Social Security, to guarantee equal pay for women and equal rights for gays and lesbians.'b'During his first term, Obama was inhibited by his desire to be postpartisan, by the need to not offend the Republicans with whom he was negotiating. Now he is liberated. Now he has picked a team and put his liberalism on full display. He argued for it in a way that was unapologetic. Those who agree, those who disagree and those of us who partly agree now have to raise our game. We have to engage his core narrative and his core arguments for a collective turn.'b'I am not a liberal like Obama, so I was struck by what he left out in his tour through American history. I, too, would celebrate Seneca Falls, Selma and Stonewall, but I\xe2\x80\x99d also mention Wall Street, State Street, Menlo Park and Silicon Valley. I\xe2\x80\x99d emphasize that America has prospered because we have a decentralizing genius.'b'When Europeans nationalized their religions, we decentralized and produced a great flowering of entrepreneurial denominations. When Europe organized state universities, our diverse communities organized private universities. When Europeans invested in national welfare states, American localities invested in human capital.'b'America\xe2\x80\x99s greatest innovations and commercial blessings were unforeseen by those at the national headquarters. They emerged, bottom up, from tinkerers and business outsiders who could never have attracted the attention of a president or some public-private investment commission.'b'I would have been more respectful of this decentralizing genius than Obama was, more nervous about dismissing it for the sake of collective action, more concerned that centralization will lead to stultification, as it has in every other historic instance.'b'I also think Obama misunderstands this moment. The Progressive Era, New Deal and Great Society laws were enacted when America was still a young and growing nation. They were enacted in a nation that was vibrant, raw, underinstitutionalized and needed taming.'b'We are no longer that nation. We are now a mature nation with an aging population. Far from being underinstitutionalized, we are bogged down with a bloated political system, a tangled tax code, a byzantine legal code and a crushing debt.'b'The task of reinvigorating a mature nation is fundamentally different than the task of civilizing a young and boisterous one. It does require some collective action: investing in human capital. But, in other areas, it also involves stripping away \xe2\x80\x94 streamlining the special interest sinecures that have built up over the years and liberating private daring.'b'Reinvigorating a mature nation means using government to give people the tools to compete, but then opening up a wide field so they do so raucously and creatively. It means spending more here but deregulating more there. It means facing the fact that we do have to choose between the current benefits to seniors and investments in our future, and that to pretend we don\xe2\x80\x99t face that choice, as Obama did, is effectively to sacrifice the future to the past.'b'Obama made his case beautifully. He came across as a prudent, nonpopulist progressive. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure he rescrambled the debate. We still have one party that talks the language of government and one that talks the language of the market. We have no party that is comfortable with civil society, no party that understands the ways government and the market can both crush and nurture community, no party with new ideas about how these things might blend together.'b'But at least the debate is started. Maybe that new wind will come.'b'ISRAELIS go to the polls today in an election that will likely give Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a third term; like the current one, Israel\xe2\x80\x99s next governing coalition will probably be heavily reliant on right-wingers and religious parties.'b'Even so, Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s second term could offer a pivotal opportunity to restart the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. In his first term, he backed away from the process, figuring that America could mediate only if the parties themselves wanted to make peace \xe2\x80\x94 and that new talks were unlikely to be productive.'b'This is a mistake. The greatest enemy to a two-state solution is the sheer pessimism on both sides. Unless President Obama uses his new mandate to show leadership, the region will have no place for moderates \xe2\x80\x94 or for America either.'b'The rationale for inaction rests on four related assumptions: that strident forces dominate because their ideologies do; that the status quo \xe2\x80\x94 demographic trends that would lead to the enfranchisement of occupied Palestinians, a \xe2\x80\x9cone-state solution\xe2\x80\x9d and the end of Israel as a Jewish democracy \xe2\x80\x94 will eventually force Israel to its senses; that the observer-state status secured by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the United Nations is empty because his West Bank government is broke, dysfunctional and lacking in broad support; and that given the strength of the Israeli lobby, Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s hands are tied.'b'These assumptions seem daunting, but they are misguided. First, while Hamas, the militant Islamists who control Gaza, and Israel\xe2\x80\x99s ultra-rightists, who drive the settlement enterprise, are rising in popularity, the reason is not their ideologies, but young people\xe2\x80\x99s despair over the occupation\xe2\x80\x99s grinding violence.'b'Last month, a poll by the S. Daniel Abraham Center for Middle East Peace, based in Washington, found that two-thirds of Israelis would support a two-state deal, but that more than half of even left-of-center Israelis said Mr. Abbas could not reach binding decisions to end the conflict. The same month, the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, in Ramallah, found that 52 percent of Palestinians favored a two-state resolution (a drop from three-quarters in 2006, before two Israeli clashes over Gaza). But two-thirds judged the chance of a fully functional Palestinian state in the next five years to be low or nonexistent. In short, moderates on both sides still want peace, but first they need hope.'b'Second, the status quo is not a path to a one-state solution, but to Bosnian-style ethnic cleansing, which could erupt as quickly as the Gaza fighting did last year and spread to Israeli Arab cities. Right-wing Israelis and Hamas leaders alike are pushing for a cataclysmic fight. Mr. Abbas, whose Fatah party controls the West Bank, has renounced violence, but without signs of a viable diplomatic path he cannot unify his people to support new talks. If his government falls apart, or if the more Palestinian territory is annexed (as right-wing Israelis want), or if the standoff in Gaza leads to an Israeli ground invasion, bloodshed and protests across the Arab world will be inevitable. Such chaos might also provoke missiles from Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shiite militant group based in Lebanon.'b'Third, the Palestinian state is not a Fatah-imposed fiction, but a path toward economic development, backed by international diplomacy and donations, that most Palestinians want to succeed. It has a $4 billion economy; an expanding network of entrepreneurs and professionals; and a banking system with about $8 billion in deposits. A robust private sector can develop if given a chance.'b'Fourth, American support need not only mean direct talks. The administration could promote investments in Palestinian education and civil society that do not undermine Israeli security. Mr. Obama could demand that Israel allow Palestinian businesses freer access to talent, suppliers and customers. He could also demand a West Bank-Gaza transportation corridor, to which Israel committed in the 1993 Oslo accords.'b'America is as much a player as a facilitator. The signal it sends helps determine whether the parties move toward war or peace. The White House, despite its frosty relationship with Mr. Netanyahu, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t set itself up as a worthy mediator by opposing Palestinian membership in the United Nations and vetoing condemnations of settlements.'b'In nominating Chuck Hagel to lead the Pentagon, Mr. Obama rightly ignored attacks by \xe2\x80\x9cpro-Israel\xe2\x80\x9d (really pro-Netanyahu) groups. He should appoint a Middle East negotiator trusted by all sides \xe2\x80\x94 say, Bill Clinton or Colin L. Powell. He should lead, not thwart, European attempts to make a deal. He has stated that the settlements will lead to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s global isolation; he should make clear that they endanger American interests, too.'b'Washington has crucial leverage, though this won\xe2\x80\x99t last forever. When it weighs in, it becomes a preoccupying political fact for both sides. If it continues to stand back, hopelessness will win.'b'Obama finds his old dance partner at the inaugural ball.'b'CARACAS, 'b'Venezuela'b''b'ON Jan. 10, while 'b'Hugo Ch\xc3\xa1vez'b' lay in a hospital bed in Havana, he was symbolically sworn in as Venezuela\xe2\x80\x99s new president in a ceremony here. The crowd that attended his virtual inauguration was moved to tears by a recording of Mr. Ch\xc3\xa1vez\xe2\x80\x99s singing the national anthem. The country is experiencing the very odd circumstance of being both with and without its leader; he is not here, but his voice endures.'b'From the intensive care unit, the president \xe2\x80\x9ccontinues to perform his duties\xe2\x80\x9d; he gives orders and sends kisses to children. This is what his vice president says. According to the Supreme Court, the Congress cannot consider him absent, for no matter how ill he is, only Mr. Ch\xc3\xa1vez himself has the authority to declare himself absent. The opposition is demanding a \xe2\x80\x9cfe de vida\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 proof that he is still alive, as if he were a kidnapping victim. Day after day, on the street, on Twitter, our president dies and comes back to life. But this is not a magical realist novel.'b'After 14 years as president, Mr. Ch\xc3\xa1vez controls all public powers: the legislative body, the Supreme Court, the public prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s office, to say nothing of the 'b'oil industry'b'. Of all those who have held office since the end of the military dictatorship in 1958, none has concentrated power quite as Mr. Ch\xc3\xa1vez has.'b'From the moment he won his first election, he knew that he had not made it to the presidency in order to run a sound government. He had come to change the course of history. In the name of the dispossessed, he revived the ghost of the South American military caudillo, creating a new version of that traditional strongman. He sings ranchera songs on Sunday and negotiates with Iran on Monday. He is a child of the telenovela who invokes the old-fashioned left. As president he deftly combines power with melodrama.'b'He astutely took advantage of the failure of neoliberalism and the traditional elites, as well as the antipolitical climate at the time, promising to democratize the country\xe2\x80\x99s oil income and eliminate deep social inequalities. And riding the wave of an oil boom, he secured the loyalty of the poor.'b'But his \xe2\x80\x9c21st century socialism\xe2\x80\x9d is a populist, patronage-oriented model that depends less on ideology than it does on the price of a barrel of crude. He has managed to revive the illusion of a sustainable society that distributes rather than creates wealth. And thanks to this illusion, he has been able to maintain his ironclad grip on power.'b'Last October\xe2\x80\x99s elections gave him the chance to complete, \xe2\x80\x9cdemocratically,\xe2\x80\x9d 20 years as president. \xe2\x80\x9cVeinte a\xc3\xb1os no es nada,\xe2\x80\x9d he said \xe2\x80\x94 a line from a famous tango song meaning \xe2\x80\x9c20 years is nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d More than eight million voters seemed to agree with him; probably around the number of people who have benefited from his administration\xe2\x80\x99s social programs, which are called, rather religiously, \xe2\x80\x9cmissions.\xe2\x80\x9d (Though the government says the number is much higher.)'b'Venezuelans today are less poor than they once were. But they are also far more dependent on the state, and more susceptible to a propaganda machine that attributes this \xe2\x80\x9cmiracle\xe2\x80\x9d to Mr. Ch\xc3\xa1vez. Over the past decade, his government has invested around $400 billion in social spending, an oil-infused luxury that few countries in the region have ever been able to indulge in.'b'There is one element of the Ch\xc3\xa1vez leadership, however, that is no different from any of Latin America\xe2\x80\x99s other personality-driven authoritarian regimes: its messianic nature. \xe2\x80\x9cWith Ch\xc3\xa1vez, everything; without Ch\xc3\xa1vez, nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d is the government\xe2\x80\x99s official slogan. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are all Ch\xc3\xa1vez\xe2\x80\x9d is its battle cry and love song. Over time, the state has built a powerful industry around the cult of personality. Few Venezuelans will ever forget the moment when Mr. Ch\xc3\xa1vez, in a televised event at a church, implored Jesus Christ for more days on earth. Now, following an uncertain convalescence in Cuba that is being closely monitored by the Castro brothers, the president of Venezuela is already a myth on his way to consecration.'b'When he does go, many will feel orphaned. He fashioned himself into the axis around which the life of the country revolved, and his unique brand of authority will, without his physical presence, be very difficult to maintain. His absence will create a void in a society that was forced to divide and organize itself in two blocks: for or against Ch\xc3\xa1vez. The propaganda machine that has turned Mr. Ch\xc3\xa1vez into a religious talisman will not necessarily serve to legitimize the many pretenders, including his chosen successor, Vice President Nicol\xc3\xa1s Maduro, who are waiting to inherit his charismatic legacy.'b'That legacy, of course, is more than pure messianic zeal. Mr. Ch\xc3\xa1vez will leave behind a country plagued with problems. With deep political divisions. With an appalling level of violence, including around 21,000 homicides last year. With the wild economic distortions that come from having some of the highest inflation on the continent and the cheapest gasoline on the planet. With dwindling productivity, an overvalued currency and an enormous foreign debt load. With unchecked public spending, and still one great dream that has yet to be fulfilled: the illusion of eliminating poverty forever.'b'To this end, absence might be just what Hugo Ch\xc3\xa1vez needs to save him from his own failure. Myths survive only when they rise above the miseries of reality.'b'BY the time he was 76, my father was frail. His balance was poor and he had trouble walking. He lived alone in Baltimore in a big house full of stairs, and watching him come tottering down those stairs was terrifying. Each time, I thought he might fall. He refused to make the house safer \xe2\x80\x94 no stair lifts, no grab rails (they would disfigure the house, he said) \xe2\x80\x94 and would not consider living anywhere else. When my brother and his wife invited my father to move in, the invitation was vigorously declined. And we lived in three different cities, far apart.'b'To try to cope better with this situation, my brother and I created a shared Google calendar \xe2\x80\x94 an online calendar in which we could both make entries from wherever we happened to be. Each time either of us spoke to our father, we marked it in the calendar \xe2\x80\x94 what time of day it was, how he sounded, what we spoke about. (If one of us called and he did not answer, we marked that, too. Yes, we both have an obsessive streak.)'b'For example, on Oct. 13, 2009, at 1:30, I telephoned home, spoke to my father and wrote in the calendar that he was \xe2\x80\x9cjust off to see the new doctor, writing a list of his medications. Nothing else to report; leaves starting to turn and it\xe2\x80\x99s starting to get cold.\xe2\x80\x9d Later that afternoon, he called my brother and said that he liked the new doctor (she was \xe2\x80\x9cslim, tall, pretty, and seemed very nice\xe2\x80\x9d), and that he had indeed discussed his medications with her.'b'The upshot was that we had an excellent record of how he was \xe2\x80\x94 whether he was getting out, if he was cheerful or feeling low, changes to his medicines, any falls he said he had had. The calendar also allowed us to make sure that one of us spoke to him just about every day. And if I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t reach him, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to wonder if he was lying hurt and helpless at the bottom of the stairs for days \xe2\x80\x94 I could look at the calendar and see that my brother had spoken to him a few hours ago.'b'We never told my father we did this \xe2\x80\x94 he probably would have been furious. There is, after all, something weird about the idea that people are taking notes on you, however loving their motives. It was our imperfect solution to an imperfect setup. And it helped us.'b'Just before his 79th birthday, my father started collapsing. First, he fell in the street. He thought he had tripped, but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure. Then he fell several times in the house (fortunately, not while on the stairs). The calendar provided a full record of it \xe2\x80\x94 and we could both see that there was something new, something abnormal. It turned out that his heart was stopping. My brother flew down and took him to a hospital, where he had a pacemaker put in.'b'But the calendar had other, more subtle effects, too. It was, in essence, a journal kept by two people who read each other\xe2\x80\x99s entries, and so it gradually became a conversation between the two of us as well as a straight-up record of events. One day, he\xe2\x80\x99s infuriating my brother with speculations about two friends\xe2\x80\x99 having an inappropriate affair: \xe2\x80\x9cI said I thought he was being outrageous and that it was none of his business, even if his wild speculations were true. I hope he has the sense not to say anything to anyone else about his unfounded, wild, no evidence claims.\xe2\x80\x9d Another day, I\xe2\x80\x99m remarking, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m worried by the extent to which he does not seem to cook for himself anymore.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As you might expect, there are times when reading someone else\xe2\x80\x99s journal entries is disquieting and revealing. I discovered aspects of my brother\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with our father that I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t appreciated. One of his entries said: \xe2\x80\x9cAsked about my accident (first time).\xe2\x80\x9d This was more than a year after my brother had been hit by a car and badly hurt. My heart cracked: I had not realized how inattentive my father had been.'b'Going back through the calendar now, more than 18 months after my father died, the entries chart a relentless physical decline \xe2\x80\x94 profound fatigue, sore hips and knees, aching wrists, swollen legs, inflamed teeth, increasing forgetfulness, the savage indignities of old age. One day, he took a bath but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get out of the tub. Luckily, the housekeeper arrived; she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get him out either, so she recruited the postman to help. My father thought this was hilarious: I admired his ability to laugh.'b'For through it all, there\xe2\x80\x99s such courage. Yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s just had a pacemaker installed and he\xe2\x80\x99s feeling rotten, but he\xe2\x80\x99s making strawberry jam. One day, \xe2\x80\x9cHe sounded very low \xe2\x80\x94 lonely, old, and scared.\xe2\x80\x9d But another, he\xe2\x80\x99s reading a history of some sinister French aristocrats and planning to install a wood stove in the fireplace. A beloved friend is coming to stay. He\xe2\x80\x99s just learned a new poem.'b'At the time, I was glad we kept the calendar because it helped us to cope with a difficult situation. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m glad for a different reason: it helps me remember small details about him, the little things that slip out of memory, that fade with time. Laughs, tears, worries, frustrations, joy and love \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s all in the calendar.'b'MOSCOW'b'LAST week, Alexander Dolmatov, an activist in a political party opposed to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s president, Vladimir V. Putin, 'b'committed suicide'b' at a detention center in the Netherlands. He had fled Russia last June, hoping to be granted political asylum. When his application was denied, he took his life \xe2\x80\x94 the only way to guarantee that he would not be deported home and, most likely, face time in prison.'b'A Dutch official 'b'said'b' \xe2\x80\x9cthe asylum denial is not the reason for his suicide,\xe2\x80\x9d citing a note Mr. Dolmatov, who was 36, left behind. In that note, which Mr. Dolmatov\xe2\x80\x99s mother shared with me, he expressed regret for \xe2\x80\x9chaving brought shame on everybody.\xe2\x80\x9d However, his lawyer has said that Mr. Dolmatov might have written the note under duress. Mr. Dolmatov\xe2\x80\x99s mother has asked the Dutch government for an investigation.'b'Mr. Dolmatov\xe2\x80\x99s case is only the latest example of the fallout of 2011-12 protests against the Putin regime. It raises questions about concern for human rights in the West, which once sheltered numerous defectors from the Soviet Union but is now less hospitable to dissidents. Instead of Western Europe, America and Israel, today\xe2\x80\x99s dissidents are seeking refuge in former Soviet republics \xe2\x80\x94 though their safety is not guaranteed there.'b'Last year, two opposition activists, Anastasia Rybachenko and Mikhail Maglov, fled Russia. Ms. Rybachenko, who had initially sought asylum in Germany, is now a student in Estonia; Mr. Maglov has applied for asylum in Ukraine.'b'Another dissident who had fled to Ukraine, Leonid Razvozzhayev, vanished in October after requesting asylum at a United Nations office in Kiev. Days later, he 'b'emerged'b' outside a Moscow courthouse, saying he had been kidnapped, repatriated and tortured.'b'Sergei Kuznetsov, a Russian journalist who has exposed corruption, left in 2011 and moved to Georgia after his attempts to seek refuge in Britain and Israel failed. The European Union has been criticized for dithering on asylum requests from Chechens and other ethnic minorities who have left Russia.'b'Mr. Dolmatov, Ms. Rybachenko and Mr. Maglov were all casualties of a government crackdown over a series of protests in Bolotnaya Square, which has a long history as a site of repression. Two legendary Cossack leaders were executed there: Stepan Razin in 1671 and Yemelyan Pugachev in 1775.'b'More recently, the square was the site of the biggest protests in Russia since the Soviet era. In December 2011, tens of thousands of Russians gathered there to protest fraud and manipulation in parliamentary elections. Mr. Putin, the president from 2000 to 2008, was prime minister at the time, while his prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 Dmitri A. Medvedev was president. The men announced a series of political reforms and a reshuffling of Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s staff, which gave liberals slight hope.'b'Mr. Putin, a K.G.B. officer during the Soviet era, has always been nervous about street protests. His regime was terrified by the largely peaceful revolutions that toppled dictators in Serbia in 2000, Georgia in 2003 and Ukraine in 2004, as well as the Arab Spring.'b'But the Kremlin quickly recovered from its initial fright. Last May, just before Mr. Putin and Mr. Medvedev switched jobs, thousands of Russians again thronged Bolotnaya Square. Instead of concessions, the government responded with repression. It went after ordinary participants in the protests, including a student, a journalist, even a chemist. Sometimes the authorities would first search the home of a suspect, then detain him a few days later. Because of that delay, several opposition participants managed to avoid detention by fleeing Russia after their homes were searched.'b'One of them, Mr. Dolmatov, went farther than others in his flight to safety. Unlike other people persecuted in connection with the demonstrations, he had been under surveillance by the F.S.B. (the K.G.B.\xe2\x80\x99s successor) long before the demonstrations started, because he worked for a state-run missile-design company and had a government security clearance. After he fled, during a search of his parents\xe2\x80\x99 home, a government agent told them their son was lucky to have left, or he would have been charged not only with protesting but also spying.'b'Mr. Dolmatov is returning to Russia \xe2\x80\x94 to be buried. His death is a tragedy to those who knew him and also to thousands of anti-Putin protesters who, fearing persecution, have hoped that the West would offer them a haven.'b'During the cold war, Western public opinion was resolutely on the side of harboring persecuted Soviet dissidents. But as the European Union has drawn closer to Russia economically, interest in Russian human rights has waned, except when developments are so outrageous \xe2\x80\x94 like the assassination of the journalist Anna Politkovskaya in 2006 \xe2\x80\x94 that they cannot be ignored. If the West\xe2\x80\x99s doors remain closed, more Russian dissidents will become victims of the state \xe2\x80\x94 or die by their own hands.'b'First, my congratulations and condolences to John Kerry for being nominated to be our next secretary of state. There is no one better for the job today and no worse job to have today. It is no accident that we\xe2\x80\x99ve started measuring our secretaries of state more by miles traveled than milestones achieved. It is bloody hard to do big diplomacy anymore.'b'Why? Well, as secretary of state today you get to deal with Vladimir Putin, who was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple. That is, even though Russia\xe2\x80\x99s economy is hugely corrupt and nowhere nearly as innovative as it should be, Putin sits atop a huge reserve of oil and gas that makes him think he\xe2\x80\x99s a genius and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to listen to anyone. When recently confronted with his regime\xe2\x80\x99s bad behavior, his first instinct was to block American parents from adopting Russian orphans, even though so many of them badly need homes. If there were an anti-Nobel Peace Prize, Putin would win hands down.'b'When Putin isn\xe2\x80\x99t available to stiff us, China, to whom we owe a gazillion dollars, is ready to stand in. Those two are the real nations, where there\xe2\x80\x99s at least someone to answer the phone \xe2\x80\x94 and hang up on us. Elsewhere, the secretary of state gets to deal with failed or failing states, like Mali, Algeria, Afghanistan and Libya, whose governments cannot deliver for their people, let alone for us. If he is looking for a break, Kerry could always call on our longtime ally Egypt, whose president, Mohamed Morsi, we find out, in 2010 described Jews as \xe2\x80\x9cdescendants of apes and pigs.\xe2\x80\x9d Who knew?'b'So what\xe2\x80\x99s a secretary of state to do? I\xe2\x80\x99d suggest trying something radically new: creating the conditions for diplomacy where they do not now exist by going around leaders and directly to the people. And I\xe2\x80\x99d start with Iran, Israel and Palestine. We live in an age of social networks in which every leader outside of North Korea today is now forced to engage in a two-way conversation with their citizens. There\xe2\x80\x99s no more just top-down. People everywhere are finding their voices and leaders are terrified. We need to turn this to our advantage to gain leverage in diplomacy.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s break all the rules.'b'Rather than negotiating with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s leaders in secret \xe2\x80\x94 which, so far, has produced nothing and allows the Iranian leaders to control the narrative and tell their people that they\xe2\x80\x99re suffering sanctions because of U.S. intransigence \xe2\x80\x94 why not negotiate with the Iranian people? President Obama should put a simple offer on the table, in Farsi, for all Iranians to see: The U.S. and its allies will permit Iran to maintain a civil nuclear enrichment capability \xe2\x80\x94 which it claims is all it wants to meet power needs \xe2\x80\x94 provided it agrees to U.N. observers and restrictions that would prevent Tehran from ever assembling a nuclear bomb. We should not only make this offer public, but also say to the Iranian people over and over: \xe2\x80\x9cThe only reason your currency is being crushed, your savings rapidly eroded by inflation, many of your college graduates unemployed and your global trade impeded and the risk of war hanging overhead, is because your leaders won\xe2\x80\x99t accept a deal that would allow Iran to develop civil nuclear power but not a bomb.\xe2\x80\x9d Iran wants its people to think it has no partner for a civil nuclear deal. The U.S. can prove otherwise.'b'On Israel-Palestine, the secretary of state should publicly offer President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority the following: the U.S. would recognize the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank as the independent State of Palestine on the provisional basis of the June 4, 1967, lines, support its full U.N. membership and send an ambassador to Ramallah, on the condition that Palestinians accept the principle of \xe2\x80\x9ctwo states for two peoples\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 an Arab state and a Jewish state in line with U.N. General Assembly Resolution 181 \xe2\x80\x94 and agree that permanent borders, security and land swaps would be negotiated directly with Israel. The status of the refugees would be negotiated between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, which represents all Palestinians inside and outside of Palestine. Gaza, now a de facto statelet, would be recognized as part of Palestine only when its government recognizes Israel, renounces violence and rejoins the West Bank.\xc2\xa0'b'Why do this? Because there will be no Israeli-Palestinian breakthrough unless the silent majorities on both sides know they have a partner \xe2\x80\x94 that Palestinians have embraced two states for two peoples and that Israelis have embraced Palestinian statehood. Neither Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor President Abbas have shown a real commitment to nurture these preconditions for peace, and our secret diplomacy with both only plays into their hands. We need to blow this charade wide open by trying to publicly show Iranians, Israelis and Palestinians that they really do have options that their leaders don\xe2\x80\x99t want them to see. (Israel\xe2\x80\x99s election on Tuesday showed that the peace camp in Israel is still alive and significant.) It may not work. The leaders may still block it or the people may not be interested. But we need to start behaving like a superpower and forcing a moment of truth. Our hands are full now, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t waste four more years with allies (or enemies) who may be fooling us.'b'New York City mayors have long tolerated one of the most inefficient school transportation systems in the country \xe2\x80\x94 made so by a labor agreement that undermines competitive bidding and poorly designed bus routes.'b'Mayor Michael Bloomberg has finally had enough. He recently declared that the next round of contracts the city negotiates with the bus companies will not include job security measures that, he feels, have driven costs out of control. His decision 'b'triggered a strike'b' that has idled more than half the city\xe2\x80\x99s school buses and forced an estimated 113,000 children to find new ways to get to school. The city is seeking competitive bids on 1,100 routes, or about a sixth of the total number of routes in the system. The strike has been painful. But the city will need to hold its ground if it wants to bring runaway costs under control and genuine competition to the bidding process.'b'As The Times 'b'reported last week'b', New York City spends almost $7,000 annually for each student passenger, as opposed to about $3,200 by Los Angeles, $5,000 by Chicago and $1,000 by Miami. The system, which costs about $1.1 billion a year, over the years has been afflicted by corruption. Both union and city officials have been sent to jail for shaking down bus companies or offering favors in exchange for payoffs.'b'In addition, about a third of the 150,000 or so 'b'students who receive busing services are special education students'b'. These children must often be bused for long distances on tight schedules, which means that buses that can seat 60 or more make only a few stops and carry only a handful of passengers. The city tried to revise the routing system in 2007, but it botched the attempt so badly that it was forced to stick with the status quo.'b'But the uncompetitive labor agreements are the main focus of the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s reform efforts. The agreements made decades ago require private bus companies to hire drivers based on an industrywide seniority list. The companies have complained that this drives up labor costs by requiring start-up companies seeking a share of the city\xe2\x80\x99s business to pay workers the same wages they earned at established companies.'b'New York\xe2\x80\x99s highest court made the same point in a prekindergarten school busing case in 2011. The court observed that the job protection provision had anticompetitive consequences. Requiring newcomers to the business to hire workers at salaries and benefit levels paid by older companies either discourages newcomers from bidding for contracts or causes them to bid blind without knowing what their true costs will be.'b'The drivers\xe2\x80\x99 union has accused Mr. Bloomberg of union-busting and told parents that getting rid of the job protection provision would lead bus companies to hire unqualified drivers who would put children\xe2\x80\x99s lives at risk. But adequate regulations governing driver training and safety standards are already in place.'b'For its part, the city says it is willing to endure the strike for as long as it takes in order to break with a costly and archaic contract system.

PITCHES'b'\nCarlstadt, N.J., Jan. 14, 2013'b''b'For a disheartening example of how intense lobbying and financial contributions can distort the legislative process in Washington, consider what happened to the \xe2\x80\x9cfiscal cliff\xe2\x80\x9d bill approved three weeks ago by Congress.'b'Senators who play a major role in federal health care financing were happy to help Amgen, the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest biotechnology company, evade Medicare cost-cutting controls by delaying price restraints on a class of drugs used by kidney dialysis patients, including Sensipar, a drug made by Amgen. That provision was inserted into the final fiscal bill by Senate aides. Many members of Congress did not know it was in the bill until just hours before it was approved.'b'Although other companies will benefit financially from that delay, Amgen, which has 74 lobbyists in Washington, was the only company to lobby aggressively for the provision. The delay will cost the Medicare program up to $500 million over a two-year period.'b'The disturbing details were revealed in a report by 'b'Eric Lipton and Kevin Sack'b' of The Times on Sunday. The maneuvering to exempt these drugs undercuts a five-year effort to change the incentives used to pay for kidney dialysis care. Previously, Medicare had paid providers separately for the drugs and for administering dialysis treatment, a system that often encouraged overprescribing.'b'But, in 2008, Congress reversed the incentives by requiring Medicare to pay a single, bundled rate for a patient\xe2\x80\x99s dialysis treatment and related medications, starting in 2011. But certain oral drugs, including Sensipar, were given a two-year reprieve, to expire in 2014, from being included in that more cost-effective bundled system. The fiscal bill has now extended that exclusion for an additional two years.'b'Supporters of the delay \xe2\x80\x94 notably, Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat of Montana, who leads the Senate Finance Committee, and Orrin Hatch, of Utah, the ranking Republican on that committee \xe2\x80\x94 say it is needed to give the Medicare system and dialysis providers time to absorb other complicated changes in federal reimbursements for kidney care. But there is good reason to suspect other factors were involved as well. Both senators have political and financial ties to Amgen, as does Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, who exerted great influence over the fiscal negotiations and praised the Medicare provisions.'b'A top aide to Mr. Hatch, who was involved in negotiating the dialysis delay, previously worked as a health policy analyst for Amgen. The current lobbyists for Amgen include former chiefs of staff for both Mr. Baucus and Mr. McConnell. And the three senators have received substantial contributions from Amgen\xe2\x80\x99s employees and its political action committee since 2007 \xe2\x80\x94 almost $68,000 to Senator Baucus, $59,000 to Senator Hatch, and $73,000 to Senator McConnell.'b'Amgen\xe2\x80\x99s strong influence prevailed even though it had pleaded guilty just weeks ago to marketing an anti-anemia drug illegally and agreed to pay criminal and civil penalties of $762 million, a record settlement for a biotechnology company.'b'This dreadful episode is a classic example of the power of special interests to shape legislation and shows how hard it may be to carry out the reforms needed to cut health care costs.'b'When Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. congratulated President Obama after he completed 'b'his oath of office on Monday'b', Americans heard the cordial, affirming voice that regularly fills the courtroom of the Supreme Court. But the chief justice\xe2\x80\x99s graciousness did not mean he was endorsing the president or his views.'b'As the president\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Inaugural Address'b' made plain and as important rulings of the Roberts court show, the Obama and Roberts visions of America are very different. No disagreement is more fundamental than that about the connection between justice and prosperity.'b'To Mr. Obama, prosperity enables justice and vice versa. Persuasively, he said in his address, \xe2\x80\x9cTogether, we discovered that a free market only thrives when there are rules to ensure competition and fair play.\xe2\x80\x9d He also said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed as anybody else.\xe2\x80\x9d And commitments to justice, like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Roberts court, on the other hand, with the chief justice in the majority, has regularly ruled as if justice and prosperity are unrelated or even antithetical \xe2\x80\x94 by 'b'protecting'b' large corporations from class-action lawsuits; by 'b'making it'b' much harder for private lawsuits to succeed against mutual fund malefactors, even when they have admitted to lying and cheating; or by 'b'allowing'b' corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts of money on political campaigns and advance their narrow interests by exerting influence unjustly over government.'b'When the chief justice 'b'cast'b' his critical vote to uphold the Affordable Care Act last June, he made clear that he did not favor the law, which is the most important commitment to justice and prosperity so far of the Obama administration. He wrote tartly, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The connection between justice and prosperity is clear and strong. \xe2\x80\x9cEconomic growth,\xe2\x80\x9d the scholar Benjamin Friedman 'b'documented'b', \xe2\x80\x9cmore often than not fosters greater opportunity, tolerance of diversity, social mobility, commitment to fairness and dedication to democracy.\xe2\x80\x9d And justice of all kinds, especially social justice, is an essential means of achieving prosperity, as economic progress in the South 'b'demonstrated'b' after the civil rights laws brought racial progress.'b'The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the coming months about the continuing need for a critical section of the 'b'Voting Rights Act'b' that prevents racial discrimination and about the 'b'basic rights of gay Americans'b'. Those cases are unquestionably about justice and fundamental issues of fairness. But their outcomes will inevitably affect prosperity as well, because they deal with issues of participation in American society and, as a result, in the American economy.'b'The cameras lingered on President Obama after the inaugural ceremony just before he entered the Capitol, as he turned back toward the Mall and took in the crowd of a million or so of the American people whose general welfare he again swore to promote. When Chief Justice Roberts administered the oath, he had a similar chance to be reminded of the multitudes to whom the Supreme Court pledges \xe2\x80\x9cEqual Justice Under Law\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and to be reminded of the strong link between justice and prosperity.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Obama Offers a Liberal Vision: \xe2\x80\x98We Must Act\xe2\x80\x99'b' \xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 22):'b'The inauguration went above politics to our country\xe2\x80\x99s vast cultural sea change of inclusion.'b'Let us count the ways:'b'\xc2\xb6From Myrlie Evers-Williams, the widow of the slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers, to the president\xe2\x80\x99s ringing \xe2\x80\x9cthrough Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall\xe2\x80\x9d and explicit call for gay rights.'b'\xc2\xb6From Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the Rev.

Haaretz, the left-leaning newspaper, called it a vote of no confidence that showed Mr. Netanyahu has \xe2\x80\x9cfailed in the political sphere, the foreign policy sphere and the socioeconomic sphere.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We wish we were as certain of what it means.'b'Mr. Netanyahu is weakened and his political future less certain, but 'b'he is still expected to be prime minister'b' after the postelection horse trading is done.'b'The television celebrity 'b'Yair Lapid surprised many people'b' by leading his party, 'b'Yesh Atid'b', to second place behind Mr. Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s conservative Likud-Beiteinu ticket, taking 19 of Parliament\xe2\x80\x99s 120 seats. Likud-Beiteinu won 31 seats, down from the 42 seats the parties held before. Mr. Lapid has indicated a willingness to form a coalition with Mr. Netanyahu, but other parties could also be enlisted in that effort. That could mean more centrist leaders joining Mr. Netanyahu and tempering his hard-right line on talks with the Palestinians and other issues, but it could also mean more hard-liners. The rejection of religious parties by an overwhelming majority of voters sends a signal that Israelis are tired of sectarian divisiveness and the often-oppressive policies that religious leaders have championed.'b'We wish Mr. Lapid\xe2\x80\x99s election success constituted an unambiguous endorsement of vigorous peace talks, but voters in exit polls said they were more focused on domestic issues. Even though 'b'Mr. Netanyahu did worse than predicted'b', voters still gave the most seats to his ticket, which was purged of some moderates in favor of more right-wing candidates.'b'Still, there is a reason to hope that the new government could be more receptive to a peace initiative. The vote suggests that if it is not, Israelis may give even more support next time to a centrist coalition not led by Mr. Netanyahu. Mr. Lapid has been skeptical of the Palestinian leadership\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to negotiate and has not made peace talks a priority. But he supports a two-state solution and renewing peace talks that have been frozen for four years.'b'Although he also has endorsed a two-state solution, Mr. Netanyahu has so aggressively built new settlements that it soon may be impossible to create a contiguous Palestinian state. His push has triggered international condemnation and strained relations with Washington.'b'Mr. Lapid is not the only new force in Israeli politics. 'b'Naftali Bennett'b', a settlement advocate and leader of a religious-Zionist party, is even more hard-line toward the Palestinians than Mr. Netanyahu. His party did worse than some had predicted, winning only 11 seats, but he remains a vocal force against the Palestinians.'b''b'Mr. Bennett has said'b' that he would do everything in his power to make sure Palestinians never get a state. Such talk endangers Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security by ensuring permanent occupation of the West Bank. It insults Palestinians who rejected violence and recognized Israel\xe2\x80\x99s right to exist as part of the 1993 Oslo Accords. It is no vision for Israel\xe2\x80\x99s future.'b'\xc2\xa0'b'The White House on Wednesday renewed its call for peace talks'b' to resume. This won\xe2\x80\x99t mean much if President Obama is not ready to invest political capital in a new diplomatic initiative. Unlike the bungled effort in his first term, though, he needs to carefully prepare the political ground, including making his first trip to Israel as president and explaining to the Israeli people how any peace plan will enhance their security.'b'ON Monday, President Obama said that during his second term, Americans would act together to \xe2\x80\x9cbuild the roads and networks and research labs that will bring new jobs and businesses to our shores\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cwe cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries \xe2\x80\x94 we must claim its promise.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The president is right that digital communication networks \xe2\x80\x94 especially high-capacity fiber networks reaching American homes and businesses \xe2\x80\x94 can be a powerful economic engine. But we are far away from being able to realize that vision, even as we cede the advantage such technology offers to other countries.'b'Although Julius Genachowski, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, has challenged the country to build additional 'b'gigabit fiber networks'b' \xe2\x80\x94 about 100 times faster than most residential connections today \xe2\x80\x94 his words won\xe2\x80\x99t advance our digital future unless they are backed up with the leadership necessary to enact pro-growth, pro-innovation and competition-enabling rules.'b'At the heart of the problem lie a few powerful companies with enormous influence over policy making. Both the wireless and wired markets for high-speed Internet access have become heavily concentrated, and neither is subject to substantial competition nor oversight. Companies like Time Warner Cable routinely get their way when they seek to prevent local officials from encouraging competition. At the federal level, Verizon Wireless is keeping the F.C.C. in court arguing over the scope of its regulatory powers \xe2\x80\x94 a move that has undermined the agency\xe2\x80\x99s authority.'b'As a result, prices are too high and speeds too slow. A third of Americans opt not to buy high-speed Internet access at home, often because they can\xe2\x80\x99t afford it.'b'Incumbents like Comcast and Verizon Wireless (now cooperating in a joint marketing venture) claim that their market is characterized by robust competition. But where is the competition when 94 percent of new wired high-speed customers bought service from their local cable distributors during the third quarter of 2012? Not surprisingly, America lags behind almost every other industrialized country in high-speed access \xe2\x80\x94 even France, the b\xc3\xaate noir of American free-marketeers, has better and cheaper Internet access.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s little question that our wired (Comcast and Time Warner Cable) and wireless (AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless) giants need to be reined in. We need reasonably priced, globally competitive, ubiquitous communications infrastructure so that Americans can compete and innovate.'b'To get there, the federal government needs to pursue three goals. First, it must remove barriers to investment in local fiber networks. Republican and Democratic mayors around the country are rightly jealous of the new, Google-built fiber network in Kansas City, Mo., which is luring start-ups from across the country. And yet in nearly 20 states, laws sponsored by incumbent network operators have raised barriers for cities wanting to foster competitive networks.'b'In response, Congress must act to restore local communities\xe2\x80\x99 right to self-determination by pre-empting these unfair and anticompetitive state laws. We must also create infrastructure banks that provide long-term, low-interest financing to support the initial costs of building these networks.'b'Second, the F.C.C. must make reasonably priced high-speed access available to everyone. In the 20th century, we made a commitment to provide universal telephone service to every American and to subsidize that utility service for our poor and rural neighbors. High-speed Internet access is now undisputedly the dominant communications technology of our era. We need to make sure that subsidies are available for competitive companies willing to extend world-class service to more Americans.'b'The F.C.C.\xe2\x80\x99s Connect America Fund, which is supposed to promote such expansion, is mostly funneled back through existing communications companies. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t the way to encourage new wired network providers to enter local markets. Nor will voluntary programs run by local monopoly cable distributors like Comcast meet our country\xe2\x80\x99s needs.'b'Finally, the F.C.C. must foster more competition by changing the rules that keep the status quo in place. There is a raft of regulations and processes at the F.C.C. that incumbents wield to maintain their market power, including rules about access to programming and to telephone poles that favor existing providers. The agency has ample administrative power to fix these details and to gather the information it needs to develop and enforce effective policies.'b'We have allowed our affection for consolidation and profit-taking to shape our country\xe2\x80\x99s ability to compete on the global stage. Although today\xe2\x80\x99s communications networks should make it possible for anyone to create value, communications companies that control access in America have the ability to crush competition and innovation.'b'With a truly pro-competition agenda at the F.C.C., we could discover great reservoirs of increased productivity and new forms of making a living. Contrary to what giant companies like Comcast and Verizon would have us believe, communications regulation does not stymie entrepreneurial behavior. It unleashes human ingenuity.'b'BEFORE the recent French intervention in 'b'Mali'b' began, 412,000 people had already left their homes in the country\xe2\x80\x99s north, fleeing 'b'torture, summary executions, recruitment of child soldiers and sexual violence against women at the hands of fundamentalist militants'b'. Late last year, in Algeria and southern Mali, I interviewed dozens of Malians from the north, including many who had recently fled. Their testimonies confirmed the horrors that radical Islamists, self-proclaimed warriors of God, have inflicted on their communities.'b'First, the fundamentalists banned music in a country with one of the richest musical traditions in the world. Last July, they stoned an unmarried couple for adultery. The woman, a mother of two, had been buried up to her waist in a hole before a group of men pelted her to death with rocks. And in October the Islamist occupiers began compiling lists of 'b'unmarried mothers'b'.'b'Even holy places are not safe. These self-styled \xe2\x80\x9cdefenders of the faith\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'demolished the tombs'b' of local Sufi saints in the fabled city of Timbuktu. The armed groups also reportedly destroyed many churches in the north, where displaced members of the small Christian minority told me they had previously felt entirely accepted. Such Qaeda-style tactics, and the religious extremism that demands them, are completely alien to the mainstream of Malian Islam, which is known for its tradition of tolerance.'b'That openness is exactly what the jihadists seek to crush. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that we are building a new country on the base of 'b'Shariah'b' is just something the people living here will have to accept,\xe2\x80\x9d the Islamist police commissioner in the town of Gao said last August. Until military action began this month, local citizens were on their own in resisting the imposition of Shariah \xe2\x80\x94 and they fought back valiantly. A radio 'b'journalist was severely beaten'b' by Islamist gunmen after speaking on the radio against amputations. Women marched through the streets of Timbuktu against Islamist diktats on veiling until gunfire ended their protest.'b'The acting principal of a coed high school in Gao told me his school had been occupied by militants from the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa. They announced that they had come to protect the premises. Instead, they quickly stole its computers, refrigerators and chairs. \xe2\x80\x9cWe consider ourselves under occupation,\xe2\x80\x9d the principal told me. \xe2\x80\x9cWe consider ourselves martyrs.\xe2\x80\x9d He has risked his life to keep his school open, to continue to educate boys and girls together, though he must put them on opposite sides of the classroom now. \xe2\x80\x9cMy presence creates hope for my students. I cannot kill this hope,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me.'b'Since the jihadist takeover, Gao\xe2\x80\x99s economy has come to a standstill. Every Thursday, there are theocratic show trials in Arabic, a language many residents do not speak. The fundamentalists focus on teaching the predominantly Muslim population of Gao \xe2\x80\x9chow to be Muslim.\xe2\x80\x9d Like Al Shabab in Somalia and the Taliban in Afghanistan, they have a morality brigade that patrols the city, checking who is not wearing a sufficient veil and whose telephone sins with a musical ringtone. Speaking to a woman in public is an offense; this ban has caused such terror that some men flee in fear if they simply see a woman on the street.'b'The principal had been attending public punishments to document the atrocities. This meant repeatedly watching his fellow citizens get flogged. He has seen what it looks like when a \xe2\x80\x9cconvict\xe2\x80\x9d has his foot sawed off. Close to tears, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo one can stand it, but it is imposed on us. Those of us who attend, we cry.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some local and international opponents of military intervention have advocated negotiation with the rebel groups as an alternative. But negotiating with groups who believe they are God\xe2\x80\x99s agents and whose imposed mode of governance is utterly alien to the people of northern Mali is unlikely to succeed, especially while the north remains occupied. \xe2\x80\x9cThe population is not for the Shariah\xe2\x80\x9d is the refrain I heard again and again \xe2\x80\x94 from those displaced from Timbuktu and Kidal; from women and men; from Muslims and Christians. The preservation of Mali\xe2\x80\x99s tradition of secularism is essential for them all.'b'Policy decisions regarding this potential Afghanistan-in-the-Sahara must be informed by the fact that what is happening there is not simply a question of regional or global security, but of basic human rights. The current intervention in Mali could deal a decisive blow to the recent advance of fundamentalism across North Africa, but only if French and West African soldiers take care to distinguish between civilians and their jihadist oppressors, who hide among the innocent.'b'They must also avoid simply shifting the problem elsewhere in the region. After all, one of the causes of the Islamist occupation of northern Mali was the displacement of armed men from Libya after the overthrow of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011. Algeria had lost hundreds of thousands of its own people to fundamentalist armed groups since the 1990s. Since then, many Algerian jihadists have crossed the border into northern Mali, reproducing the problem there.'b'Some Malians fear that foreign intervention may have grave consequences for their homes and livelihoods. But most of the displaced northerners I met last month, before France intervened, had already decided that \xe2\x80\x9cthe risks of nonintervention are 10,000 times worse than the risks of intervention,\xe2\x80\x9d as a women\xe2\x80\x99s rights activist told me in Bamako. Or, as a young refugee from Gao whom I met in Algeria put it: \xe2\x80\x9cWe do not want war, but if these people don\xe2\x80\x99t leave us alone, we have to fight them.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Point to a group of toddlers in an upper-middle-class neighborhood in America, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a good bet that they will go to college, buy nice houses and enjoy white-collar careers.'b'Point to a group of toddlers in a low-income neighborhood, and \xe2\x80\x94 especially if they\xe2\x80\x99re boys \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99re much more likely to end up dropping out of school, struggling in dead-end jobs and having trouble with the law.'b'Something is profoundly wrong when we can point to 2-year-olds in this country and make a plausible bet about their long-term outcomes \xe2\x80\x94 not based on their brains and capabilities, but on their ZIP codes. President Obama spoke movingly in 'b'his second Inaugural Address'b' of making equality a practice as well as a principle. So, Mr. President, how about using your second term to tackle this most fundamental inequality?'b'For starters, this will require a fundamental rethinking of antipoverty policy. American assistance programs, from housing support to food stamps, have had an impact, and poverty among the elderly has fallen in particular (they vote in high numbers, so government programs tend to cater to them). But, too often, such initiatives have addressed symptoms of poverty, not causes.'b'Since President Lyndon Johnson declared a \xe2\x80\x9cwar on poverty,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'the United States has spent some $16 trillion'b' or more on means-tested programs. Yet the proportion of Americans living beneath the poverty line, 'b'15 percent'b', is higher than in 'b'the late 1960s in the Johnson administration'b'.'b'What accounts for the cycles of poverty that leave so many people mired in the margins, and how can we break these cycles? Some depressing clues emerge from a new book, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Giving Our Children a Fighting Chance'b',\xe2\x80\x9d by Susan Neuman and Donna Celano.'b'Neuman and Celano focus on two neighborhoods in Philadelphia. In largely affluent Chestnut Hill, most children have access to personal computers and the shops have eight children\xe2\x80\x99s books or magazines on sale for each child living there.'b'Take a 20-minute bus ride 'b'on Germantown Avenue'b' and you\xe2\x80\x99re in the Philadelphia Badlands, a low-income area inhabited mostly by working-class blacks and Hispanics. Here there are few children\xe2\x80\x99s books, few private computers and only two public computers for every 100 children.'b'On top of that, there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference in parenting strategies, the writers say. Upper-middle-class parents in America increasingly engage in competitive child-rearing. Parents send preschoolers to art classes and violin lessons and read \xe2\x80\x9cHarry Potter\xe2\x80\x9d books to bewildered children who don\xe2\x80\x99t yet know what a wizard is.'b'Meanwhile, partly by necessity, working-class families often take a more hands-off attitude to child-raising. Neuman and Celano spent 40 hours monitoring parental reading in the public libraries in each neighborhood. That was easy in the Badlands \xe2\x80\x94 on an average day \xe2\x80\x9cnot one adult entered the preschool area in the Badlands.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When I was a third-grader, a friend struggling in school once went with me to the library, and my mother helped him get a library card. His grandmother then made him return it immediately, for fear that he would run up library fines.'b'The upshot is that many low-income children never reach the starting line, and poverty becomes self-replicating.'b'Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s why some of the most cost-effective antipoverty programs are aimed at the earliest years. For example, 'b'the Nurse-Family Partnership'b' has a home-visitation program that encourages new parents of at-risk children to amp up the hugging, talking and reading. It ends at age 2, yet 'b'randomized trials show'b' that those children 'b'are less likely to be arrested as teenagers and the families require much less government assistance'b'.'b'Or take 'b'Head Start'b'. Critics have noted that the advantage its preschoolers gain in test scores fades by third grade, but scholars also have found that Head Start has important impacts on graduates, including lessening the chance that they will be convicted of a crime years later.'b'James Heckman, 'b'a Nobel Prize-winning economist'b', argues that the most crucial investments we as a country can make are 'b'in the first five years of life'b', and that they pay for themselves. Yet these kinds of initiatives are underfinanced and serve only a tiny fraction of children in need.'b'We don\xe2\x80\x99t have any magic bullets. But randomized trials and long-term data give us a better sense of what works \xe2\x80\x94 and, for the most part, it\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re not doing, like improved education, starting with early childhood programs for low-income families. Job-training for at-risk teenagers also has an excellent record. Marriage can be a powerful force, too, but there\xe2\x80\x99s not much robust evidence about which programs work.'b'So, President Obama, to fulfill the vision for your second term, how about redeploying the resources we\xe2\x80\x99ve spent on the war in Afghanistan to undertake nation-building at home \xe2\x80\x94 starting with children so that they will no longer be limited by their ZIP codes.'b'Congressional Republicans like nothing more than beating a dead horse if it might embarrass the Obama administration \xe2\x80\x94 like their unceasing attempt to accuse the administration of lying to the American people 'b'about the attack'b' in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.'b'The allegations are specious, but that didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop some Republicans from repeating them on Wednesday during 'b'Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Congressional testimony'b'. 'b'Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky was particularly out of control'b', rather absurdly comparing the scope of the Benghazi attack to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not clear what drives this obsession after the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 failed attempt to derail President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s re-election over Benghazi. Is it the prospect, however vague it now is, that Mrs. Clinton might run for president in 2016?'b'Mrs. Clinton was professional and authoritative 'b'for hours in the witness chair'b' before 'b'the Senate Foreign Relations Committee'b' and, later, 'b'the House Committee on Foreign Affairs'b'. But she understandably reached her limit 'b'when Senator Ron Johnson pummeled her'b' with the same questions Republicans have hammered at repeatedly since Mr. Stevens and his colleagues were killed in September. These have nothing to do with what happened, why and how to prevent a recurrence, but whether various statements \xe2\x80\x94 especially by Susan Rice, the United States ambassador to the United Nations \xe2\x80\x94 proved to be perfectly accurate.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWith all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Clinton said, her voice rising in anger. \xe2\x80\x9cWas it because of a protest? Or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they\xe2\x80\x99d go and kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She said, rightly, that in the days after the attack, officials were struggling in real time, under crisis conditions, to get the best information they could. What is essential now is to improve security, not keep rehashing the C.I.A.-authorized talking points that Ms. Rice delivered on the Sunday talk shows, she said.'b'There were, of course, serious questions raised, including how Democrats and Republicans need to approve sufficient funds to protect embassies and diplomats overseas. But there was also a fair amount of surreal behavior.'b'Mr. Paul asked about Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s recent ill health in one breath and then in the next declared that, if he had been president, he would have fired her for Benghazi. Calling the killings the \xe2\x80\x9cworst tragedy\xe2\x80\x9d since Sept. 11 was insulting to the nearly 8,000 soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan or the many hundreds of Americans killed in senseless gun violence each year.

While the deregulation of the 1980s was in part necessary and successful, the stock market crash in 1929, the savings and loan scandals in the 1980s, and our recent Great Recession all suggest that our problems lie with too much deregulation and not enough collective action to guard against the abuse of private initiative.

He\xe2\x80\x99s not perfect, but he is exceptional.'b'During his address, the president challenged us to examine our ideas of America, to see today in the context of yesterday, to rise on the winds of change and not be afraid of them.'b'He put change itself at the center of the message and talked about how American constants like equality and altruism and stewardship are not static but dynamic, forever in need of care and maintenance and updating and refitting.'b'As the president said:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes us exceptional -- what makes us American \xe2\x80\x94 is our allegiance to an idea, articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago: \xe2\x80\x98We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\xe2\x80\x99 Today we continue a never-ending journey, to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time. For history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, they have never been self-executing; that while freedom is a gift from God, it must be secured by His people here on Earth.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The speech was ambitious and aimed for the history books and may well have found its mark.'b'No speech can do all things, but a good one does some things exceedingly well.'b'This speech eschewed seasonal issues \xe2\x80\x94 economic ups and downs, international conflicts \xe2\x80\x94 for the everlasting concepts.'b'He could have delivered a great speech with the emphasis inverted, and no one would have balked.'b'The economy is still sluggish. People are still anxious about their jobs, if indeed they have a job. It is unclear how, or if, we can get back to prerecession prosperity.'b'And the world keeps getting smaller and more hazardous. Europe remains in a precarious economic state. The Middle East remains a mess of volatility. And as we saw last week with the hostage crisis in Algeria, Islamic extremists seem to be broadening their influence in northern Africa.'b'And yet the president focused on America, the meaning of America, the promises and truisms of America, the aspirations of and challenges facing America. And he did so through a progressive lens, tying liberalism to America\xe2\x80\x99s historical idealism. He offered a liberal anchoring, that it is not a disavowing of American values but an affirmation of them.'b'In the president\xe2\x80\x99s words:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe have always understood that when times change, so must we; that fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges; that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And he went further, placing the gay rights movement in the context of the women\xe2\x80\x99s rights and civil rights movements:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths -- that all of us are created equal -- is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall ...\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He continued:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOur journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law -- for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The most striking phrase in that passage, aside from the fact that it was included in an Inaugural Address at all, is \xe2\x80\x9cthe love we commit.\xe2\x80\x9d In a time when so many conservatives talk ad nauseam about the differentiation between rights granted by God and those authored by governments, this phrase, the commission of love, the root of many religions, reframes gay rights as God-given rights like other human rights and therefore beyond the right of governments to restrict.'b'And that was only one of the things that made the speech special.'b'The president also acknowledged the value to our society of caring for the poorest and most vulnerable. He called on America to address climate change. And he took a sideswipe at those opposing any and all new gun regulations, saying,'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOur journey is not complete until all our children, from the streets of Detroit to the hills of Appalachia to the quiet lanes of Newtown, know that they are cared for, and cherished, and always safe from harm.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This was a great moment in progressive politics.'b'Unapologetic, defiant even, and true to the core values of our country.'b'Women in the military are going to get to serve in combat. They killed the Equal Rights Amendment to keep this from happening, but, yet, here we are. And about time.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think people have come to the sensible conclusion that you can\xe2\x80\x99t say a woman\xe2\x80\x99s life is more valuable than a man\xe2\x80\x99s life,\xe2\x80\x9d the retired Air Force Brig. Gen. Wilma Vaught once told me.'b'Vaught is the president of the Women in Military Service for America Memorial Foundation. She retired from active duty in 1985, so she remembers a different era entirely. \xe2\x80\x9cI went to Vietnam, and when I found out I was going, the first thing I wanted to know was if I\xe2\x80\x99d be trained in weapons. They told me I didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be. That\xe2\x80\x99s unheard of today,\xe2\x80\x9d she said on Wednesday when I caught up with her on the phone.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cI wore my skirts.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Now they wear fatigues and tote rifles. So the Joint Chiefs of Staff have bowed to reality and told Defense Secretary Leon Panetta that \xe2\x80\x9cthe time has come\xe2\x80\x9d to stop excluding women from combat positions. The transformation won\xe2\x80\x99t happen immediately, and it might not be universal. But it\xe2\x80\x99s still a groundbreaking change. When the recommendation became public Wednesday, except for a broadside from the Concerned Women for America (\xe2\x80\x9cour military cannot continue to choose social experimentation and political correctness over combat readiness\xe2\x80\x9d), the reception seemed overwhelmingly positive.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to remember \xe2\x80\x94 so many parts of recent history now seem hard to remember \xe2\x80\x94 but it was the specter of women under fire that did more than anything else to quash the movement for an Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution in the 1970s. \xe2\x80\x9cWe kept saying we hope no one will be in combat, but, if they are, women should be there, too,\xe2\x80\x9d recalled Gloria Steinem.'b'The fear of putting women in the trenches has been dispelled on two fronts. One, of course, is the change in the way the American public thinks about women. The other is the shortage of trenches in modern warfare, when an officer on the front lines is not necessarily in a more dangerous position than a support worker. Shoshana Johnson, a cook, was shot in both ankles, taken captive and held for 22 days after her unit was separated from a convoy crossing the Iraqi desert. Lori Piestewa, a Native American and, like Johnson, a single mother, was driving in the same convoy full of clerks and maintenance workers. She was skillfully steering her Humvee through mortar fire when a truck immediately ahead of her jackknifed and her front wheel was hit by a rocket. She was fatally injured in the ensuing crash.'b'The biggest safety concern for women in the military is actually not so much enemy fire as sexual attacks from fellow members of their own service. Because the crime is so underreported, it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to say how many women suffer sexual assault while they\xe2\x80\x99re in uniform, but 3,192 cases were recorded in 2011. Allowing women to get the benefits of serving in combat positions won\xe2\x80\x99t make that threat worse. In fact, it might make things better because it will mean more women at the top of the military, and that, inevitably, will mean more attention to women\xe2\x80\x99s issues.'b'The military\xe2\x80\x99s idea of what constitutes a combat position is more about bureaucracy than bullets. Today women are on armed patrols and in fighter planes. But they can\xe2\x80\x99t hold approximately 200,000 jobs officially termed \xe2\x80\x9ccombat,\xe2\x80\x9d which often bring more pay and can provide a stepping stone for promotions. The system is complicated. But cynics might wonder if some of the military brass fear women\xe2\x80\x99s upward mobility more than the danger.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe only have one four-star general who\xe2\x80\x99s a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who cheered the recommendation from the Joint Chiefs. It was, she said, \xe2\x80\x9ca great step forward for our military,\xe2\x80\x9d and one that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really expected. Only recently, Gillibrand recalled, she and her allies declared victory when they merely got language in the defense authorization bill requiring the Defense Department to study the question of women in combat.'b'Women now make up almost 15 percent of the American military and their willingness to serve made the switch to an all-volunteer Army possible. They\xe2\x80\x99ve taken their posts with such seamless calm that the country barely noticed. The specter that opponents of the E.R.A. deemed unthinkable \xe2\x80\x94 our sisters and daughters dying under fire in foreign lands \xe2\x80\x94 has happened over and over and over. More than 130 women have died and more than 800 have been wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan. The House of Representatives includes a female double-amputee in the person of the newly elected Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, a former military pilot who lost both her legs when her helicopter was shot down in Iraq.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ve come a long, sometimes tragic, heroic way.'b'In an unusual recognition of reality, House Republicans backed away on Wednesday from a chaotic default crisis and 'b'dropped their ruinous demand'b' that spending be cut on an equal basis with a rise in the debt ceiling. On a vote of 285 to 144, the House agreed to suspend the debt ceiling for three months, adding the puerile condition that the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s pay should be delayed until it passes a budget. The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, said the extension would pass his chamber and 'b'promised to come up with a budget'b', four years late.'b'For the moment, at least, the vote vindicates President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s strategy not to negotiate in any way over the debt ceiling. After the debacle of the 2011 debt crisis, which damaged the nation\xe2\x80\x99s credit rating and its standing in the world of global finance, Speaker John Boehner knew that his demand for equal cuts in spending was no longer sustainable. If the hostage that Republicans wanted to take \xe2\x80\x94 the economy of the United States \xe2\x80\x94 couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be used as a bargaining chip, it might as well be released.'b'Nonetheless, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, was right to call the measure 'b'\xe2\x80\x9ca gimmick unworthy of the fiscal and economic challenges that we face.\xe2\x80\x9d'b' Postponing a crisis for 90 days does nothing to reassure markets, or businesses, or ordinary bondholders worried about their investments. It does nothing to inspire confidence in voters that their elected officials are grappling with the budget in a serious way, even if, in the end, Republicans are quietly planning on raising the debt ceiling anyway as part of further spending negotiations. (The stopgap resolution that currently pays for the government runs out at the end of March, and if Republicans think they can use the debt ceiling as a cudgel in that fight, they will find a solid wall of opposition.)'b'Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s bill doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even raise the ceiling; it simply suspends its enforcement, showing how meaningless the mechanism is. Now that it is clear that the ceiling can be easily eliminated, both parties should agree to do so, averting not just this crisis but all those in the future.'b'The issue will have to be revisited in May, but the bill at least moves the budget debate closer to where it should be: the annual appropriations process. Let each chamber put its policy priorities on the table for public examination and then hash out the differences in the full glare of the C-Span cameras.'b'If the House actually wants to put forth a balanced budget over the next 10 years, as 'b'Mr. Boehner vowed to do'b' on Wednesday, let the public see what that really means: unimaginable cuts and changes to Medicare and Medicaid, and the elimination of scores of popular and vital programs that benefit both the poor and the middle class. Up to now, Republicans have been understandably wary of specifying how that would be done without raising taxes. Mitt Romney wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it, and even Representative Paul Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s budgets up to now wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t balance the budget until 2040.'b'Similarly, the Senate should finally go on the record with its own budget, one that combines further tax increases on the wealthy, investments in education, energy and public works, and sensible spending cuts. (It should have done so for the last four years, but too many Democrats were afraid of publicly agreeing with Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s proposals.)

They agreed to cap overall emissions of carbon dioxide, the major pollutant driving 'b'global warming'b', and require the more than 200 power plants in the region to buy permits to emit the greenhouse gas.'b'The governors reasoned that plant operators would have an incentive to clean up their emissions if they had to pay for the carbon dioxide they discharged. Over the first three years of the 'b'Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative'b', average annual emissions were indeed 23 percent less than in the previous three years, and auctions of allowances \xe2\x80\x94 or permits to pollute \xe2\x80\x94 raised $952 million, much of which has been invested in clean energy programs.'b'But the future effectiveness of this market-based 'b'cap-and-trade'b' system, the first but not the only one of its kind in the nation, is now in question. The nine states in the initiative are preparing to reset the emissions cap \xe2\x80\x94 or the total amount of carbon dioxide that power plants can emit \xe2\x80\x94 and some of the proposals would allow power plants to increase the amount of carbon dioxide they dump into the atmosphere.'b'Cap-and-trade programs are designed to lower emissions gradually by reducing the cap and the allowances that are available. Polluters get flexibility in cutting emissions by being able to trade allowances among themselves. The idea is to achieve the reductions at the lowest cost through market forces rather than through direct regulation.'b'But of the four cap-adjustment proposals under consideration, three would reset the cap above current emissions and allow pollution to rise through 2020. Only a fourth option would continue to drive down pollution by resetting the cap at 91 million tons, the current emissions level, and then reducing it by another 2.5 percent a year through 2020.'b'Opponents of the initiative, known as R.G.G.I., argue that lower-cost 'b'natural gas'b' has eliminated the need for the program by reducing the use of dirtier coal and 'b'oil'b'. Growing investments in energy efficiency and renewable electricity have also helped to reduce emissions by cutting demand for electricity from power plants that burn fossil fuels.'b'But those developments don\xe2\x80\x99t argue against R.G.G.I., which determines what electricity generators may not do \xe2\x80\x94 namely, discharge unlimited quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. If market forces deliver emissions reductions cheaper and faster than anticipated, then states should lock in that progress with a binding cap to ensure that emissions don\xe2\x80\x99t rise and that incentives for reducing pollution remain.'b'The proposals that would allow emissions to increase reflect the success of opponents of efforts to slow climate change, who have fought against initiatives like R.G.G.I.'b'Americans for Prosperity, an organization backed by the billionaire Koch brothers, has been at the forefront of this effort. The group sought unsuccessfully to repeal R.G.G.I. in Maine and New Hampshire, and A.F.P. members sued but failed to extricate New York from the initiative. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey did pull his state out of the initiative last year, arguing that low-cost natural gas made the program unnecessary.'b'R.G.G.I.\xe2\x80\x99s economic performance tells a different story. Auctions of allowances pay for energy efficiency programs that curb power plant emissions, bring down energy prices and save consumers money. These savings flow back into the economy, increasing growth and employment in the region. An 'b'independent report'b' published in 2011 by the 'b'Analysis Group'b', a consulting firm, said that electric customers would save $1.1 billion on their bills over 10 years from energy efficiency measures paid for by the sale of allowances. These savings would generate an additional $1.6 billion in economic growth, as money that otherwise would be spent on electricity generated with imported fossil fuels is instead spent in the local economy.'b'This initiative carries broad significance. President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s reaffirmed commitment to address climate change will move forward in part through regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, and R.G.G.I. could serve as a template for other states seeking to comply with new federal requirements.'b'Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York recently committed to ensuring the program\xe2\x80\x99s continuing effectiveness, and we encourage all of the participating states to make the program as strong as possible and put the public good over interests vested in the dangerous status quo of unchecked pollution.'b'MUMBAI, India'b'MANY think of India, born of a violent partition in 1947, as itself harboring two identities: a smartphone wielding, English-speaking, fast-growing democracy that prefers macchiatos to masala chai, and a predominantly lower-caste, mystically minded mass of peasants who spend their days herding buffalos and wading through water-clogged rice paddies.'b'Geographic and class divisions have come to the fore again following the notorious gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old physiotherapy student in New Delhi last month \xe2\x80\x94 a case that drew more attention to the status of women in India than any event in recent history.'b'The sight of thousands of women demanding justice led observers to point to the demonstrations as \xe2\x80\x9ca middle-class movement,\xe2\x80\x9d akin in style to the Arab Spring. Their power was demonstrated in 2011, when a hunger strike by the anticorruption activist 'b'Anna Hazare'b' set off a wave of protests against graft.'b'Armed with diplomas and aspirations for upward mobility, a rapidly expanding consumer class is said to be driving political activism and, thanks to its media savviness, forcing the government to listen. The woman who was killed fit this narrative: an ambitious college student who had watched \xe2\x80\x9cLife of Pi\xe2\x80\x9d with a male friend on the night of the attack.'b'But where does this narrative leave rural women, who make up about 70 percent of India\xe2\x80\x99s female population? There can be no genuine change without them.'b'After the rape, Mohan Rao Bhagwat, the head of the Hindu nationalist group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, said: \xe2\x80\x9cSuch crimes hardly take place in \xe2\x80\x98Bharat,\xe2\x80\x99 but occur frequently in \xe2\x80\x98India.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Bharat, the Hindi word for India, is, in this view, a rustic idyll where virtuous women keep their bodies covered, and thereby are safe and protected.'b'Of course, Mr. Bhagwat was swiftly ridiculed. Using the hashtag #Bharat, many posted tongue-in-cheek online comments. One wrote on Facebook: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t live in India. Migrate to Bharat instead.\xe2\x80\x9d They noted the persistence of child marriages, domestic violence and sexual assault in what urban Indians still call \xe2\x80\x9cthe hinterlands.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'With the record now corrected, attention returned to the capital and its middle-class protesters, whose adroit use of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram had captured the world\xe2\x80\x99s imagination. The gulf separating the women of \xe2\x80\x9cBharat\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cIndia\xe2\x80\x9d seemed all too real.'b'But urban Indian women owe a debt to their rural forebears. In the 1970s, Himalayan women led one of the country\xe2\x80\x99s most successful grass-roots mobilizations, the Chipko movement. By hugging trees destined to become timber, the women protected their soil from erosion, as well as their supplies of water and firewood. They started what many consider India\xe2\x80\x99s first ecological movement.'b'Rural women have taken the lead in contemporary battles too. Consider the Pink Gang, or 'b'Gulabi Gang'b', based in Bundelkhand, a remote area of central India that is often written off as \xe2\x80\x9clawless\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbandit plagued.\xe2\x80\x9d Founded by Sampat Devi Pal, who was married off around the age of 13, had her first child at 15 and is essentially illiterate, the 'b'Pink Gang'b' \xe2\x80\x94 an all-women\xe2\x80\x99s vigilante organization estimated to have around 20,000 members, named after their pink saris and batons \xe2\x80\x94 gained fame for beating up men who had abused their wives. The gang has fought corrupt politicians and crooked police officers as well. It also runs vocational centers that empower women.'b'The women of Khairlanji village, in the state of Maharashtra, are another example. In 2006, after a mob raped and killed a mother and daughter from a dalit (lower-caste) family, and also killed two males in their family, lower-caste women used handbills to organize mass protests that swept across the region. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was an entirely new kind of protest organization,\xe2\x80\x9d said S. P. S. Yadav, the police commissioner in Nagpur, one of Maharashtra\xe2\x80\x99s largest cities.'b'The fate of India\xe2\x80\x99s women will rely on the uniting of rural and urban activism \xe2\x80\x94 and there are signs of hope that this is happening. Shuddhabrata Sengupta, an artist with the Raqs Media Collective who has covered the protest for 'b'Kafila.org'b', a political blog, told me the mass movement \xe2\x80\x9ccuts across age, experience and class in ways that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any other mobilization has in recent times.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A leading activist, Kavita Krishnan, a leader of the All India Progressive Women\xe2\x80\x99s Association, said: \xe2\x80\x9cI met many women who work as domestic help at the protests. There were local protests held in working class slums and localities all over Delhi. I know there were protests in far-flung parts of India.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Previously, when Ms. Krishnan tried to raise awareness about divisive subjects, like the rape of lower-caste women by upper-caste men, \xe2\x80\x9cwe did not get support,\xe2\x80\x9d she recalled. This has changed. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that it is rare that you get this moment where people\xe2\x80\x99s ears are wide open and you get an audience that is thinking of the nature of rape. You can\xe2\x80\x99t compare this moment with any previous moment.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If rape happens in \xe2\x80\x9cBharat\xe2\x80\x9d as well as \xe2\x80\x9cIndia,\xe2\x80\x9d then the solution will come only from the mobilization of the women of both \xe2\x80\x9cnations.\xe2\x80\x9d That would be a double blow to bigots like Mr. Bhagwat, who deny that unity is possible, and to the oppression of women across the subcontinent. If anything can unite Indian women across the divide, it is this moment.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think there is an element of discovering solidarity with strangers,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Sengupta says of the movement. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it has even taken protesters by surprise.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'Evidence of Rape Ignored'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 21) highlights the backlog of unanalyzed rape kits as one reason serial rapists remain free, and implies that analyzing the backlog will eliminate the problem.

President Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande has indicated that he plans to honor the philosopher and novelist with what may be France\xe2\x80\x99s highest tribute: a symbolic reburial in the Panth\xc3\xa9on. In the roughly two centuries since this massive neo-Classical church was converted into a secular mausoleum, fewer than 80 people have been admitted into its gravestone club. If inducted, Diderot will arguably be the first member to be celebrated as much for his attacks on reigning orthodoxies as for his literary stature.'b'Like many Enlightenment writers, Diderot preached the right of the individual to determine the course of his or her life. But the type of liberty that underpins Diderot\xe2\x80\x99s body of work differs markedly from today\xe2\x80\x99s hackneyed understanding of freedom. His message was of intellectual emancipation from received authorities \xe2\x80\x94 be they religious, political or societal \xe2\x80\x94 and always in the interest of the common good. More so than the deists Voltaire and Rousseau, Diderot embodied the most progressive wing of Enlightenment thought, a position that stemmed from his belief that skepticism in all matters was \xe2\x80\x9cthe first step toward truth.\xe2\x80\x9d He was, in fact, the precise type of secular Enlightenment thinker that some members of the 'b'Texas State Board of Education'b' have attempted to write out of their high school curriculum.'b'Rare are the writers whose legacy has shifted as dramatically as Diderot\xe2\x80\x99s. When he died in 1784, at age 70, the vast majority of his short stories, novels and philosophical works lay hidden away in trunks. He was remembered primarily for two things: coediting the world\xe2\x80\x99s first comprehensive 'b'encyclopedia'b', a project to which he contributed an astonishing 10,000 articles, and being a scandalous freethinker and atheist.'b'Articles in the \xe2\x80\x9cEncyclop\xc3\xa9die\xe2\x80\x9d tweaked Christian dogma. A famous example was the cross-references provided for the word \xe2\x80\x9canthropophagy,\xe2\x80\x9d or cannibalism: they directed readers to the entries for \xe2\x80\x9cEucharist,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccommunion\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9caltar.\xe2\x80\x9d Small wonder that the publication of the \xe2\x80\x9cEncyclop\xc3\xa9die\xe2\x80\x9d was twice banned and that the work was eventually driven underground.'b'The few works Diderot had published before becoming fully engaged in this project did not help his popularity. In 1748, he penned \xe2\x80\x9cThe Indiscreet Jewels,\xe2\x80\x9d a forerunner to \xe2\x80\x9cThe Vagina Monologues,\xe2\x80\x9d in which women\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cjewels\xe2\x80\x9d engaged in a frank discussion of their erotic adventures. The following year, he waded into deeper water when he challenged arguments supporting the existence of God in \xe2\x80\x9cLetter on the Blind\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a book that earned him three months in prison.'b'Armed with both hindsight and access to his 'b'unpublished writings'b', we now know a different Diderot. By the 19th century, the writer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovered\xe2\x80\x9d texts began inspiring the likes of Goethe, Hegel and Nietzsche. Marx cited him as his favorite writer \xe2\x80\x94 twice. Freud, too, was a great fan. It was Diderot who had said that if you allowed a child to grow up totally without education, \xe2\x80\x9che would in time combine the reasoning of the infant with the passions of the grown man, and would strangle his father and sleep with his mother.\xe2\x80\x9d Ring a bell?'b'Readers today never fail to be amazed by Diderot\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to confront both the unconscionable and the uncomfortable, often embracing subject matter that his contemporaries fled. He vehemently condemned the enslavement of Africans (and gave a philosophical voice to the slave); he challenged his era\xe2\x80\x99s views on religious celibacy and forced vocations (in a tear-jerking pseudo-memoir of a sexually abused nun); and he entertained the possibility that his cherished materialism denied us free will (in his novel \xe2\x80\x9cJacques the Fatalist\xe2\x80\x9d).'b'An ardent empiricist, Diderot also took pride in questioning his own beliefs. In \xe2\x80\x9cRameau\xe2\x80\x99s Nephew,\xe2\x80\x9d Diderot gave life to a character who assailed the author\xe2\x80\x99s deep-rooted humanism. One of the most memorable eccentrics in all of literature, the hedonistic protagonist preached the beauty of evil, the joys of social parasitism and the right to be a self-seeking individual. This same ability to think beyond his own perspective also generated Diderot\xe2\x80\x99s most prophetic work of fiction, \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99Alembert\xe2\x80\x99s Dream,\xe2\x80\x9d a text that conjures up a godless world of speculative \xe2\x80\x9cgenetic\xe2\x80\x9d manipulation and proto-evolutionary theory, 90 years before Darwin.'b'After rejecting Diderot for panth\xc3\xa9onisation 100 years ago because of his atheism, the French now seem ready to bestow upon their countryman the high honor he has long deserved. No doubt Diderot himself would have been pleased. \xe2\x80\x9cPosterity is for the philosopher what the next world is for the man of religion,\xe2\x80\x9d he once wrote. But we all might take pride as well \xe2\x80\x94 because if Diderot is, at long last, welcomed into the Panth\xc3\xa9on, it will be a collective acknowledgment that part of what makes an artist great is having the courage to provoke and challenge.'b'The message ought to resonate on this side of the Atlantic, too. While it\xe2\x80\x99s sometimes easy for Americans to forget, thumbing one\xe2\x80\x99s nose at the establishment has been central to our own cultural and political traditions since, well, Diderot\xe2\x80\x99s time. After all, that\xe2\x80\x99s how we became Americans in the first place.'b'President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s second Inaugural Address offered a lot for progressives to like. There was the spirited defense of gay rights; there was the equally spirited defense of the role of government, and, in particular, of the safety net provided by Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. But arguably the most encouraging thing of all was what he didn\xe2\x80\x99t say: He barely mentioned the budget deficit.'b'Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s clearly deliberate neglect of Washington\xe2\x80\x99s favorite obsession was just the latest sign that the self-styled deficit hawks \xe2\x80\x94 better described as deficit scolds \xe2\x80\x94 are losing their hold over political discourse. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a very good thing.'b'Why have the deficit scolds lost their grip? I\xe2\x80\x99d suggest four interrelated reasons.'b'First, they have cried wolf too many times. They\xe2\x80\x99ve spent three years warning of imminent crisis \xe2\x80\x94 if we don\xe2\x80\x99t slash the deficit now now now, we\xe2\x80\x99ll turn into Greece, Greece, I tell you. It is, for example, almost two years since Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles declared that we should expect a fiscal crisis within, um, two years.'b'But that crisis keeps not happening. The still-depressed economy has kept interest rates at near-record lows despite large government borrowing, just as Keynesian economists predicted all along. So the credibility of the scolds has taken an understandable, and well-deserved, hit.'b'Second, both deficits and public spending as a share of G.D.P. have started to decline \xe2\x80\x94 again, just as those who never bought into the deficit hysteria predicted all along.'b'The truth is that the budget deficits of the past four years were mainly a temporary consequence of the financial crisis, which sent the economy into a tailspin \xe2\x80\x94 and which, therefore, led both to low tax receipts and to a rise in unemployment benefits and other government expenses. It should have been obvious that the deficit would come down as the economy recovered. But this point was hard to get across until deficit reduction started appearing in the data.'b'Now it has \xe2\x80\x94 and reasonable forecasts, like those of Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs, suggest that the federal deficit will be below 3 percent of G.D.P., a not very scary number, by 2015.'b'And it was, in fact, a good thing that the deficit was allowed to rise as the economy slumped. With private spending plunging as the housing bubble popped and cash-strapped families cut back, the willingness of the government to keep spending was one of the main reasons we didn\xe2\x80\x99t experience a full replay of the Great Depression. Which brings me to the third reason the deficit scolds have lost influence: the contrary doctrine, the claim that we need to practice fiscal austerity even in a depressed economy, has failed decisively in practice.'b'Consider, in particular, the case of Britain. In 2010, when the new government of Prime Minister David Cameron turned to austerity policies, it received fulsome praise from many people on this side of the Atlantic. For example, the late David Broder urged President Obama to \xe2\x80\x9cdo a Cameron\xe2\x80\x9d; he particularly commended Mr. Cameron for \xe2\x80\x9cbrushing aside the warnings of economists that the sudden, severe medicine could cut short Britain\xe2\x80\x99s economic recovery and throw the nation back into recession.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Sure enough, the sudden, severe medicine cut short Britain\xe2\x80\x99s economic recovery, and threw the nation back into recession.'b'At this point, then, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the deficit-scold movement was based on bad economic analysis. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not all: there was also clearly a lot of bad faith involved, as the scolds tried to exploit an economic (not fiscal) crisis on behalf of a political agenda that had nothing to do with deficits. And the growing transparency of that agenda is the fourth reason the deficit scolds have lost their clout.'b'What was it that finally pulled back the curtain here? Was it the way the election campaign revealed Representative Paul Ryan, who received a \xe2\x80\x9cfiscal responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d award from three leading deficit-scold organizations, as the con man he always was? Was it the decision of David Walker, alleged crusader for sound budgets, to endorse Mitt Romney and his budget-busting tax cuts for the rich? Or was it the brazenness of groups like Fix the Debt \xe2\x80\x94 basically corporate C.E.O.\xe2\x80\x99s declaring that you should be forced to delay your retirement while they get to pay lower taxes?'b'The answer probably is, all of the above. In any case, an era has ended. Prominent deficit scolds can no longer count on being treated as if their wisdom, probity and public-spiritedness were beyond question. But what difference will that make?'b'Sad to say, G.O.P. control of the House means that we won\xe2\x80\x99t do what we should be doing: spend more, not less, until the recovery is complete. But the fading of deficit hysteria means that the president can turn his focus to real problems. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a move in the right direction.'b'One of the features of the Obama years is that we get to witness an enormous race, which you might call the race between meritocracy and government. On the one side, there is the meritocracy, which widens inequality. On the other side, there is President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s team of progressives, who are trying to mitigate inequality. The big question is: Which side is winning?'b'First, there is our system of higher education, which is like a giant vacuum cleaner that sucks up some of the smartest people from across the country and concentrates them in a few privileged places.'b'Smart high school students from rural Nebraska, small-town Ohio and urban Newark get to go to good universities. When they get there they often find a culture shock.'b'They\xe2\x80\x99ve been raised in an atmosphere of social equality and now find themselves in a culture that emphasizes the relentless quest for distinction \xe2\x80\x94 to be more accomplished, more enlightened and more cutting edge. They may have been raised in a culture that emphasizes roots, but they go into a culture that emphasizes mobility \xe2\x80\x94 a multicultural cosmopolitanism that encourages you to go anywhere on your quest for self-fulfillment. They may have been raised among people who enter the rooms of the mighty with the nerves of a stranger, but they are now around people who enter the highest places with the confident sense they belong.'b'But the system works. In the dorms, classrooms, summer internships and early jobs they learn how to behave the way successful people do in the highly educated hubs. There\xe2\x80\x99s no economic reason to return home, and maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s not even socially possible anymore.'b'The highly educated cluster around a few small nodes. Decade after decade, smart and educated people flock away from Merced, Calif., Yuma, Ariz., Flint, Mich., and Vineland, N.J. In those places, less than 15 percent of the residents have college degrees. They flock to Washington, Boston, San Jose, Raleigh-Durham and San Francisco. In those places, nearly 50 percent of the residents have college degrees.'b'As Enrico Moretti writes in \xe2\x80\x9cThe New Geography of Jobs,\xe2\x80\x9d the magnet places have positive ecologies that multiply innovation, creativity and wealth. The abandoned places have negative ecologies and fall further behind.'b'This sorting is self-reinforcing, and it seems to grow more unforgiving every year. One small study caught my eye. Robert Oprisko of Butler University found that half of the jobs in university political science programs went to graduates of the top 11 schools. That is to say, if you have a Ph.D. from Harvard, Stanford, Princeton and so on, your odds of getting a job are very good. If you earned your degree from one of the other 100 degree-granting universities, your odds are not. These other 100 schools don\xe2\x80\x99t even want to hire the sort of graduates they themselves produce. They want the elite credential.'b'Barack Obama (Occidental, Columbia, Harvard) benefited from this sorting system. So did his wife (Princeton, Harvard). So did most people in his administration. So did many people who read this newspaper and many of us who write for it.'b'Members of the administration have worked reasonably hard to mitigate the inequality that their own rise has produced. They\xe2\x80\x99ve worked reasonably hard to redistribute money from the rich people in the magnet areas to the poorer people in the flight areas. For example, the health care law increases taxes on the top 1 percent by about $20,000 per household. It increases benefits for the working class by between $400 and $800 per household. The recent tax increases will do more of the same.'b'The first problem with the effort is that it\xe2\x80\x99s like shooting a water gun into a waterfall. The Obama measures, earned after a great deal of political pain, simply aren\xe2\x80\x99t significant enough to counteract the underlying trends.'b'The second problem is the focus on income redistribution. Recently, there\xe2\x80\x99s been far more talk about tax increases than any other subject. But the income disparities are a downstream effect of the human capital and geographic disparities. Pumping a few dollars into San Joaquin, Calif., where 2.9 percent of the residents have bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degrees and 20.6 percent have high school degrees, may ease suffering, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t alter the dynamic.'b'The final problem is that, in an effort to reduce the economic concentration of power, the administration is concentrating political power in Washington. If the problem is that talent is fleeing blighted localities, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to see how you make that better if decision-making and resources are concentrated faraway in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital.'b'This is not to make a partisan point. The Republicans do not have a better approach. It\xe2\x80\x99s simply to say that the liberal agenda is not very good at addressing the inequality problem it seeks to solve. The meritocracy is overwhelming the liberal project.'b'The cinema complex in Aurora, Colo., 'b'reopened last week'b', six months after a gunman killed 12 patrons, wounded 58 and left deep scars on a community still struggling to recover. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone heals, some slower, some in different ways,\xe2\x80\x9d contended Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado in the face of angry complaints from some of the victims\xe2\x80\x99 families that the reopening, with prayers, a \xe2\x80\x9cnight of remembrance\xe2\x80\x9d and a screening of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,\xe2\x80\x9d was insensitive and crass.'b'His point about the certainty of healing, while undoubtedly heartfelt, is too often and too easily offered by political leaders when, in fact, Aurora, like Newtown, Conn., and countless other places savaged by multiple shootings across decades, must struggle for years with the legacy and its wounds, largely alone as the spotlight fades. The trials of gun-damaged victims who survive mass assaults is one of the intangibles that must not be overlooked if the nation, and the political system, is to have any hope in the renewed fight for stronger gun controls.'b'For all the talk at the movie house of healing, one surviving victim, 23-year-old Caleb Medley, remained in grievous suffering on his back with severe brain and motor damage and the loss of an eye. His family exulted when he was briefly helped to his feet last month, and hoped that he might be able to leave rehabilitation soon for an extended care facility, however limited his horizons. Seven family members of another victim, Ashley Moser, take turns making sure the 25-year-old woman, a paraplegic after a neck wound, is rotated twice a night in her bed. Her aunt, Annie Dalton, reports Ashley remains deeply depressed with little motivation as she faces the fact that her 6-year-old daughter, Veronica, was shot dead that night while the paralyzed mother lost a fetus soon after the gun spree.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no closure here,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Dalton, a retired public school principal, politely reported of Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s life. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a tough road,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, citing all manner of bureaucratic tangles about health insurance, fading rehabilitation coverage, other financial demands beyond estimating, and endless tasks like the family\xe2\x80\x99s learning to move Ashley on a board to distant doctors\xe2\x80\x99 appointments.'b'There is familiar ritual in Aurora\xe2\x80\x99s aftermath that the rest of the nation needs to know. A charity fund that grew so quickly after the carnage \xe2\x80\x94 to about $5 million \xe2\x80\x94 is depleted. It was distributed by Ken Feinberg, the respected compensation guru from 9/11 and other tragedies, under a formula that devotes 70 percent to those who suffered brain damage or paralysis \xe2\x80\x94 something more than $200,000 each. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s not enough money,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Feinberg apologized to claimants with lower-rated trauma. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a horrible situation,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of Aurora\xe2\x80\x99s needs.'b'In caring for her niece, Ms. Dalton can barely speak of the fresh massacre in Newtown or the \xe2\x80\x9cunreal\xe2\x80\x9d power of the National Rifle Association in dominating the conversation about a problem that in the last 40 years has taken one million lives and left countless others like Ashley and her family to manage unspeakably debilitated lives. \xe2\x80\x9cThe next tragedy is on its way,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Dalton said of the one certain lesson in Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s fate.'b'The dark art of statehouse gerrymandering reached a new low in Virginia this week. Senate Republicans in Richmond used the absence of a Democratic member, who traveled to the presidential inauguration, to ram through a 'b'surprise redistricting map'b' patently designed to aid the G.O.P.\xe2\x80\x99s grab for majority power in the next election.'b'The chamber is divided 20-20 between the parties. A redistricting plan had been adopted after the 2010 census. But no sooner had Senator Henry Marsh III, a black civil rights leader, left for the inauguration on Martin Luther King\xe2\x80\x99s Birthday than the Republicans pounced like street thugs to limit debate to 30 minutes and pass their shabbily partisan ploy by a vote of 20 to 19.'b'Like most states, the Virginia commonwealth has a long history of political eye-gouging in the pursuit of voting maps that boost the careers of one party\xe2\x80\x99s members while keeping voters in the dark. But the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 blitzkrieg was breathtaking as they dredged up an innocuous House bill, grafted their remapping scheme onto it, and rushed it to the floor without any notice to the public.'b'The Republican House is expected to approve the changes, which would make eight of the state\xe2\x80\x99s 40 Senate districts \xe2\x80\x94 including six held by Democrats \xe2\x80\x94 more heavily Republican. At the same time, more Democrats would be packed into three solidly Democratic districts. Republicans laughably argued that the remapping was needed to meet civil rights laws for fairer minority representation \xe2\x80\x94 this despite the party\xe2\x80\x99s statehouse history of blocking Congressional redistricting plans bolstering minorities.'b'The Senate maneuver created such instant scandal that even the Republican governor, Robert McDonnell, had to admit, \xe2\x80\x9cI certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good way to do business.\xe2\x80\x9d He can best make his point by vetoing the remapping as a piratical exercise in legislative hubris.'b'Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York presented an extra-lean state budget this week, his third conservative spending plan since taking office in 2011. The total outlays for fiscal year 2013-14, including federal funds to rebuild after Hurricane Sandy, will be almost $143 billion. The budget contains some real bonuses, including a plan to raise the minimum wage and a proposal for a workable database for gun ownership. But it could also raise the debt load, especially in struggling upstate areas.'b'The budget, which must be approved by the Legislature before April 1, increases state spending by less than 2 percent statewide. That is admirable restraint, but the budget is not free of Albany\xe2\x80\x99s traditional sleight-of-hand, like one-time cash infusions. For instance, the governor would dip into reserves for the state insurance fund, although he does say that the money will go mainly to capital projects, not daily expenses. And since the state is nearing a debt limit imposed in 2000, the governor wants to free the State University of New York to issue more of its own debt in the future.'b'One of the more questionable aspects of the budget is a provision labeled the \xe2\x80\x9cStable Rate Pension Contribution Option.\xe2\x80\x9d Innocent as that sounds, the provision would give local communities the freedom to stretch out their pension obligations to the state by paying less now, and almost certainly more later on. The mayor of Syracuse, Stephanie Miner, describes this as \xe2\x80\x9ckicking the can down the road.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli would have to approve this idea, a decision he should consider carefully. Communities like Syracuse pay pension costs into the state\xe2\x80\x99s $150 billion pension fund, and lower contributions from these communities could make the state plan more vulnerable.'b'Besides, most of these cities need more help than this revision to the pension plan. Many are struggling with the 2 percent property tax cap Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature imposed in 2011, and there has been little relief from state mandates. Nor does this budget offer these communities anything new in the way of unrestricted state assistance.'b'There are other questions for legislators to consider, but by Albany standards this is mostly a low-trauma budget that will need only a few fixes.'b'The Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s decision to 'b'end its ban on women in combat'b' is a triumph for equality and common sense. By opening infantry, artillery and other battlefield jobs to all qualified service members regardless of sex, the military is showing that categorical discrimination has no place in a society that honors fairness and equal opportunity.'b'Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who overturned the ban this week, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who unanimously urged him to do it, deserve praise for bringing military policy in line with reality. Women have been in the thick of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan for more than a decade. More than 280,000 have been deployed there, thousands have been injured and more than 150 killed. With the rule abolished, such service and sacrifice will no longer be unofficial and unrecognized.'b'It is encouraging that the push for change came from the top, from leaders who said integration was no bar to a stronger, better military. The Pentagon also was facing pressure from lawsuits, including one brought last November on behalf of four service women and the Service Women\xe2\x80\x99s Action Network, an advocacy group, claiming that gender-based discrimination was unconstitutional and unfairly harmed their careers.'b'One plaintiff, Maj. Mary Jennings Hegar, an Air National Guard helicopter pilot who was shot down and wounded in Afghanistan, said she could not seek combat leadership positions because, in the Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s view, she had not officially seen combat. Major Hegar is only one of untold thousands of women whose career paths have been sharply limited by that gap in their r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9s.'b'When the new policy is fully in place, we hope many more women will apply for jobs that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have considered, in certain schools, leadership courses and in those branches of service \xe2\x80\x94 namely the Army and Marine Corps \xe2\x80\x94 where their opportunities have been most proscribed. The result will be more diversity, from a deeper pool of talent, and thus a stronger, better military.'b'There will also be grumbling. When the news broke Wednesday afternoon, military news sites like Army Times and Marine Corps Times lit up with comments, some ranging from laughably sexist to reprehensible. \xe2\x80\x9cThey shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be bused in from the field every 3 days for a shower while the guys stay out for 45 days,\xe2\x80\x9d said one commenter. \xe2\x80\x9cThe castration of the U.S. Army continues,\xe2\x80\x9d said another. \xe2\x80\x9cGod help us all.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some right-wing commentators rehashed false stereotypes that women couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hack it, and warned that women would be captured and raped and men would get shot trying to protect them instead of killing the enemy. These lurid hypotheticals deny the reality that military women face far greater danger of sexual assault and harassment from their fellow troops \xe2\x80\x94 a crisis that the Pentagon has slowly been addressing, and that full combat integration should help to remedy. Adding women to the leadership corps will foster a healthier military culture freed from testosterone-soaked abuse and scandal.'b'Many in the military already understand that many women can do combat jobs as well as men, if not better, but none have the chance to prove it. \xe2\x80\x9cFully support,\xe2\x80\x9d one Army Times commenter wrote of the new policy, \xe2\x80\x9cas long as the training and the physical standards for such positions remain what they need to be to accomplish the mission and make every team member able to provide support and cover for their teammates.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'To the Editor: 'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'Make Law Schools Earn a Third Year'b',\xe2\x80\x9d by Daniel B.

Even as a second-year law student (saddled with loans and still not in sight of graduation), I find this effort to make law school more affordable misguided.'b'In any law school, the first year is devoted entirely to broad survey courses. The second and third, by contrast, combine more of the same with opportunities for practical experience and interdisciplinary study. Compressing these years into one would require the retention of the survey courses (needed to pass the bar) and the reduction or elimination of the rest.

Not so in law schools. The law school graduate is fit to perform virtually none of the basic things that a lawyer must do.'b'Adding to the problem is that judges, who are among the most overworked and underpaid professionals in the country, will have to spend their time in on-the-job training.'b'Frankly, law school is a waste of money for the students and their parents, and is best equated to the price one must pay to belong to a union.'b'RAOUL LIONEL FELDER'b' New York, Jan. 22, 2013'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Penny-wise and pound-foolish best describes the proposal for two years of law school instead of three.'b'As Daniel B.

President Clinton also began to improve relations with India to counterbalance China\xe2\x80\x99s rise.'b'This strategy has enjoyed bipartisan support. President George W. Bush continued to improve relations with India, while deepening economic ties with China. His deputy secretary of state, Robert B. Zoellick, made clear that America would accept the rise of China as a \xe2\x80\x9cresponsible stakeholder.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crebalancing\xe2\x80\x9d toward Asia involves moving naval resources to the Pacific, but also trade, human rights and diplomatic initiatives. As his national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, 'b'said'b' in November, the American-Chinese relationship \xe2\x80\x9chas elements of both cooperation and competition.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Asia is not a monolith, and its internal balance of power should be the key to our strategy. Japan, India, Vietnam and other countries do not want to be dominated by China, and thus welcome an American presence in the region. Unless China is able to attract allies by successfully developing its \xe2\x80\x9csoft power,\xe2\x80\x9d the rise in its \xe2\x80\x9chard\xe2\x80\x9d military and economic power is likely to frighten its neighbors, who will coalesce to balance its power.'b'A significant American military and economic presence helps to maintain the Asian balance of power and shape an environment that provides incentives for China to cooperate. After the 2008-9 financial crisis, some Chinese mistakenly believed that America was in permanent decline and that this presented new opportunities. A result was that China worsened its relations with Japan, India, South Korea, Vietnam and the Philippines \xe2\x80\x94 a misstep that confirmed that \xe2\x80\x9conly China can contain China.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But America\xe2\x80\x99s rebalancing toward Asia should not be aggressive. We should heed Mr. Kennan\xe2\x80\x99s warning against overmilitarization and ensure that China doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel encircled or endangered. The world\xe2\x80\x99s two largest economies have much to gain from cooperation on fighting climate change, pandemics, cyberterrorism and nuclear proliferation.'b'With China becoming more dependent on Middle Eastern energy, we should discuss maritime regulations to ensure free passage of ships and include China in Pacific naval exercises. We should help China develop domestic energy resources like shale gas and encourage China and Japan to revive their 2008 plan for joint undersea gas exploitation. And we should make clear that if China meets certain standards, it can join the negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed free-trade agreement around the Pacific Rim.'b'Containment is simply not a relevant policy tool for dealing with a rising China. Power is the ability to obtain the outcomes one wants, and sometimes America\xe2\x80\x99s power is greater when we act with others rather than merely over others.'b'For most of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s first term, Republicans used legislative trickery to try to prevent the functioning of two federal agencies they hate, the National Labor Relations Board and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. First they would filibuster the president\xe2\x80\x99s nominees to the agencies, knowing that neither agency could operate without board members or a director. Then they would create fake legislative sessions for the Senate during its recess, intended solely to prevent Mr. Obama from making recess appointments as an end run.'b'Astonishingly, 'b'a federal appeals court upheld this strategy'b' on Friday. Mr. Obama had declared that Congress was not really open for business during its one-minute, lights-on-lights-off sessions intended only to thwart him, and he made recess appointments. A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said his N.L.R.B. appointments were unconstitutional, buying the argument of Republicans that the Senate was really in session.'b'The court even broke with the presidential practice of 150 years by ruling that only vacancies arising during a narrow recess period qualify for recess appointments.'b'White House officials said the administration would appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, but if it is upheld, it will invalidate scores of decisions made by the labor board over the last year. Without lawfully appointed members, the board would lack a quorum and could take no action, unable to police union elections or ensure that companies treat unions properly. That is exactly the outcome hoped for by business interests and the right, furious that a board under Democratic control tends to rule in labor\xe2\x80\x99s favor (after years of ruling for business during the Bush years).'b'The decision also threatens the work of the consumer bureau, which has been operating under a director, Richard Cordray, appointed during a recess after Republicans filibustered his nomination. A similar lawsuit is moving through the courts challenging his appointment.'b'The administration\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers made 'b'a solid argument'b' that a legislative session during which no business takes place, and when no nominations can be considered, is not a real session. The vast majority of senators, in fact, were out of town. Used in this way, the administration said, sham \xe2\x80\x9cpro forma\xe2\x80\x9d sessions prevented two executive-branch agencies from performing their lawful duties. Both agencies were created by majorities in Congress, but they were undermined by minorities.'b''b'The court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion'b' took no notice of the underhanded nature of these actions: Senate Republicans asked the House to remain in session solely to prevent Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s recess appointments, and 'b'the Constitution prevents the Senate from adjourning'b' without the consent of the House, even if it meets only for a minute every three days. Using a cramped definition of \xe2\x80\x9crecess,\xe2\x80\x9d the panel\xe2\x80\x99s Republican-appointed judges allowed a minority to abuse 'b'the recess-appointments clause'b' of the Constitution for political ends.'b'The situation demonstrates how dysfunctional Washington has become because of these Republican abuses. Although Democrats also used pro forma sessions for this purpose under President George W. Bush, Republicans have blocked Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s appointments at a far higher rate, and they have gone much further by trying to shut down executive agencies through use of the filibuster.'b'Democrats could have changed this by agreeing to curb filibuster abuses this week, particularly on high-level presidential appointments, but they squandered the opportunity. The court\xe2\x80\x99s decision demonstrates how their timidity is being used against them. With no sign that Republicans are willing to let up on their machinations, Mr. Obama was entirely justified in using his executive power to keep federal agencies operating.'b'The federal courts are bearing down on the New York City Police Department\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionally suspect stop-and-frisk program, under which hundreds of thousands of citizens are stopped on the streets each year, often illegally and for no discernible reason. Earlier this month, the federal judge who is presiding over three lawsuits that challenge different parts of the program 'b'issued her harshest ruling yet'b', putting the city on notice that some aspects of stop and frisk are clearly unconstitutional.'b''b'The ruling'b', by Judge Shira Scheindlin of Federal District Court in Manhattan, came in the case of Ligon v. the City of New York. The case was brought on behalf of people who say they were illegally stopped, given tickets or arrested on trespassing charges in private apartment buildings, some of them in buildings where they lived.'b'The judge excoriated the city for flagrant indifference to the Fourth Amendment. The amendment has been interpreted by the courts to mean that police officers can legally stop and detain a person only when they have a reasonable suspicion that the person is committing, has committed or is about to commit a crime.'b'The department\xe2\x80\x99s patently illegal strategy, the judge said, encouraged officers to \xe2\x80\x9cstop and question first, develop reasonable suspicion later.\xe2\x80\x9d The ruling focuses on detentions that occurred as people were entering or leaving one of many residential buildings in the Bronx whose managers had simply asked the department to patrol the area and arrest trespassers. The Trespass Affidavit Program, or TAP, has thus not only led to unjustified detentions but has also placed untold numbers people at risk of detention merely for entering their own homes or visiting friends and relatives. Their experiences, as described in the ruling, makes perfectly clear why the largely minority citizens targeted and victimized by the program come away feeling angry and ill used.'b'Describing the typical, humiliating sequence of events, the judge wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cThe police suddenly materialize, stop the person, demand identification, and question the person about where he or she is coming from and what he or she is doing.\xe2\x80\x9d She added that \xe2\x80\x9cattempts at explanation are met with hostility; especially if the person is a young black man, he is frisked, which often involves an invasive search of his pockets; in some cases the officers then detain the person in a police van,\xe2\x80\x9d where he or she is grilled about drugs or weapons. In some cases, the stop escalates into an arrest, the judge noted, with the person fingerprinted and held overnight. Even if the charges are quickly dropped, the arrest can follow the person for years.'b'The judge tore into the city for persisting in this behavior even after prosecutors and department lawyers had become aware that unlawful stops were occurring. In 2011, for example, the Bronx prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s office become so concerned about the legality of stops made outside the TAP buildings that it routinely 'b'declined to prosecute'b' cases based on them.'b'Judge Scheindlin ordered the Police Department to immediately cease trespass stops outside TAP buildings unless officers have the reasonable suspicion required by law, though she has issued a temporary stay. She has also scheduled a remedy hearing in March, at which time she could require the city to take various remedial steps, including a formal written policy explaining the circumstances under which officers can legally stop people on suspicion of trespass.'b'There are other procedures that can be followed without threatening law enforcement. Instead of defending the indefensible, the city should finally bring the stop-and-frisk program into line with the law.'b'Somalia has been the paradigm of failed states since before 1993, when militants shot down two Black Hawk helicopters and killed 18 American soldiers in Mogadishu. One of the world\xe2\x80\x99s poorest, most violent countries, it has been pummeled by warring militias, famine and pirates. But the country recently has shown enough positive movement that the Obama administration 'b'last week'b' hosted President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud in Washington and recognized Somalia\xe2\x80\x99s government for the first time in more than two decades. The evolution is worth examining as the West tries to grapple with militants in Mali.'b'The election of Mr. Mohamud, a moderate political activist and academic, 'b'by Parliament last September'b' ended eight years of corrupt and failed transitional governments. Backed by a new Constitution, he has started building governing institutions with a focus on security, on delivering public services and on judicial and financial reform. Investment from the Somalian diaspora, Turkey and elsewhere is coming back. So are foreign embassies.'b'None of this would have happened if the security situation had not also improved. Since 2006, the country has been torn by an insurgency led by the militant group Al Shabab, which claims allegiance with Al Qaeda. But since 2011, African Union troops, backed by American drone and aircraft strikes 'b'on targeted militant leaders'b', have pushed Al Shabab out of the capital and other key towns. Washington has poured $650 million into the African Union force over the last six years and spent hundreds of millions more on humanitarian and development assistance for Somalia.'b'The decision to recognize the Somali government was a reasonable move that will open the door to other American and international aid and may make Mr. Mohamud\xe2\x80\x99s political adversaries think twice about trying to throw him out. But it would be a mistake to read too much into the progress that has been made. The government is weak and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t control much territory beyond the capital. Its army is virtually nonexistent. Al Shabab still lurks as a dark force. If the African Union force, and especially Kenyan and Ugandan troops, left Somalia anytime soon, the gains could all be lost. It remains to be seen whether competing warlords and clans can ever cooperate to build a real state. Mr. Mohamud needs to follow through on a United Nations plan for reconciliation.'b'It is early to draw firm conclusions, and there are many differences, but Somalia may offer some cautionary advice for the fight now being waged by France at the other end of the African continent against militants in Mali. Degrading militants is likely to take years. Regional forces, rather than foreign forces from farther afield, are best positioned to lead the fight. And political progress is at least as important as military gains.'b'When I was a kid, my parents would occasionally go out together for dinner at a restaurant. To make sure the other patrons thought they were engaged in lively conversation, my mother would quietly tell my father stories like \xe2\x80\x9cGoldilocks and the Three Bears.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99d nod and ask questions like \xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened next?\xe2\x80\x9d It actually worked out very well.'b'The other day, when I was listening to the House of Representatives debate the debt ceiling, I tried to imagine ways to make Congress as easy to tackle over the dinner table as the Three Bears.'b'The debt ceiling is the first of several fiscal cliffs the country is facing in the near future and the scenario is certainly riveting: The Treasury is due to run out of money to pay our bills in late February, at which time the national credit rating could crater, sending financial markets around the world into a free fall.'b'But, in practice, we\xe2\x80\x99re just talking about rearranging deadlines. This week, the House voted to push the debt-ceiling crisis back to the end of the line. And the obvious topic of conversation, if you were sitting over pasta with your husband, would be: Which fiscal cliff would you rather fall off first?'b'Imagine Goldilocks finding the first cliff too steep, and the next one too bumpy. But can you have a cliff that\xe2\x80\x99s just right?

But I\xe2\x80\x99m not quite sure I want to look over the edge of the cliff when it comes to the debt limit,\xe2\x80\x9d Speaker John Boehner said in a speech this week. So, there\xe2\x80\x99s one vote.'b'This was the speech in which Boehner claimed that the Obama administration was attempting to \xe2\x80\x9cannihilate\xe2\x80\x9d the Republicans and \xe2\x80\x9cjust shove us into the dustbin of history.\xe2\x80\x9d He was peeved about the inauguration speech, which actually didn\xe2\x80\x99t so much attack the Republicans as ignore them completely, as if they had all the significance of the Modern Whig Party. Nothing more painful than not being noticed.'b'Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s speech, to the Ripon Society, included repeated references to the fact that the Senate has not passed a budget for several years. (\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that irritates our members more.\xe2\x80\x9d) Here\xe2\x80\x99s another topic for dinner: Why are the Republicans so obsessed with this issue? The Congressional budget isn\xe2\x80\x99t all that critical; it\xe2\x80\x99s more of a theory than a law. But Boehner and his members behave as if the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s failure to come up with one is a threat to the national well-being that makes global warming look like a week of bad weather.'b'To lure the party\xe2\x80\x99s right wing into voting for the debt ceiling postponement, Boehner tacked on a section that would defer lawmakers\xe2\x80\x99 pay if their chamber doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come up with a budget this year. That would presumably be the senators, since the House passes a budget every year, in the form of a plan so improbable that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even drag it through the presidential campaign.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I grew up in Wisconsin, if you had a job ... and didn\xe2\x80\x99t do the work, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t get paid,\xe2\x80\x9d Ryan declaimed in the House debate. Have you ever noticed how much Ryan talks about jobs he had in high school and college? Do you think he just likes talking about the brief period when he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t employed as a professional politician? Or is it just that he wants us to remember that he once drove the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile?'b'Nevertheless, the Senate should obviously do a budget. When the House passed its bill this week, Senate Democrats said they would. In fact, their leaders were practically wearing party hats. They can\xe2\x80\x99t 'b'wait'b'.'b'Once they do, we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about it over dinner. I hope there are bears in the plot.'b'CORVALLIS, Ore.'b'IT\xe2\x80\x99S rare that our daily lives adhere to dramatic form. But as reported on 'b'Today.com/Moms'b' (\xe2\x80\x9cWaiter hailed as hero after standing up for boy with Down syndrome\xe2\x80\x9d), among other places, a little morality play took shape a few days ago in a Houston restaurant.'b'According to the Today.com article, the Castillo family \xe2\x80\x94 Eric, Kim and their 5-year-old son, Milo, who has Down syndrome \xe2\x80\x94 were having dinner at Laurenzo\xe2\x80\x99s Prime Rib when a family nearby asked to be seated elsewhere.'b'As the waiter, Michael Garcia, recounted to the NBC affiliate KPRC-TV in Houston: \xe2\x80\x9cI heard the man say, \xe2\x80\x98Special needs children need to be special somewhere else.\xe2\x80\x99 My personal feelings took over, and I told him, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be able to serve you, sir.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98How could you say that?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Garcia said he asked the man before he left the restaurant. \xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98How could you say that about a beautiful 5-year-old angel?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'b'For many people, this will be a simple feel-good story. But as the father of an 11-year-old girl with Down syndrome, I found the story more complicated. Beyond its satisfying ending, you can learn a lot about the conflicted place of Down syndrome in the world. The casual insensitivity of the patron\xe2\x80\x99s remark, while not always expressed this blatantly, is all too common. And whether you call Mr. Garcia a hero or not, he unquestionably did the right thing, and his kind of bravery makes an enormous difference in the lives of people with disabilities.'b'As Ms. Castillo pointed out, he put his job on the line. Even more inspiring, he knew the Castillo family, who are regulars at the restaurant, and he acted in the name of connection, denying the very separation \xe2\x80\x94 between \xe2\x80\x9cspecial\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 that the unidentified patron implied.'b'Ms. Castillo\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of her son also stood out because it broke through the prescribed roles of the story. Her description is loving and positive, yet she emphasizes ordinary qualities as well as angelic ones. She said her son likes to give hugs, but is also occasionally \xe2\x80\x9cobnoxious which, like any other 5-year-old, he can be.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She also noted that Milo has friends \xe2\x80\x9cboth with and without Down syndrome.\xe2\x80\x9d That detail stayed with me, not only because it is true to my experience but also because it suggests how far we\xe2\x80\x99ve come. The history of disability in our country is mostly tragic. During decades of routine institutionalization and sterilization, a shared preschool \xe2\x80\x94 let alone friendship, or being a valued regular customer at a Houston restaurant \xe2\x80\x94was not on the table. If there were a slogan for those grim decades, \xe2\x80\x9clet them be special somewhere else\xe2\x80\x9d would sum things up pretty well.'b'Most of the progress for children with Down syndrome in the United States \xe2\x80\x94 their right to go to school, for instance \xe2\x80\x94 is recent and gained momentum, in part, from a recognition that \xe2\x80\x9csomewhere else\xe2\x80\x9d often meant an institutional horror no human being should ever have to experience. Geraldo Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s 1972 hidden-camera expos\xc3\xa9 of the Willowbrook State School on Staten Island was instrumental in showing exactly how grim conditions could be. That expos\xc3\xa9 was one small part of a tidal change in which advocates for the disabled inspired by the civil rights movement, committed parents and others fought for the things that today\xe2\x80\x99s parents take for granted. When our daughter Laura was born, my wife and I often wondered about the future. But we did not wonder whether she would be allowed to go to kindergarten.'b'Our advances, however, are still a work in progress. While it\xe2\x80\x99s true that open bigotry is less common than it used to be, the absence of direct hostility is not the same as the absence of ignorance. The word \xe2\x80\x9cretard\xe2\x80\x9d is common in the schoolyard and on our screens: while our taboos about difference shift with incredible speed, slurs about intellectual disability often get a pass. From the movies \xe2\x80\x9cTropic Thunder\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hangover,\xe2\x80\x9d from Rahm Emanuel to Ann Coulter, \xe2\x80\x9cretard\xe2\x80\x9d still tends to be seen as edgy, not bigoted. Of course, the issues in question transcend labels: in the Houston restaurant, the word \xe2\x80\x9cspecial\xe2\x80\x9d was used as an insult, which only testifies to the resilience of prejudice. Any word can be repurposed for contempt.'b'What is it about intellectual disability that we find so difficult? Sometimes it seems our focus on \xe2\x80\x9cpositive\xe2\x80\x9d qualities, like being \xe2\x80\x9ccute\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chappy\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csweet,\xe2\x80\x9d is meant to compensate for disability. We\xe2\x80\x99re a long way from seeing all human beings as part of a single continuum. We also, it has to be said, do a lot better with children than adults \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps because historically we imagine adults with Down syndrome as children. A child with Down syndrome may have a place at the table, but adults are a different matter. In housing and employment, their place is uncertain; the 'b'recent scandal 'b'in New York State with rampant, unchecked abuse in group homes should give pause to anyone who thinks that our American history with disability has come to a happy ending.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s moving to me that Milo Castillo\xe2\x80\x99s story takes place in a restaurant, given the civil rights history of lunch counters and water fountains. What\xe2\x80\x99s a more visceral expression of belonging than where we\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to eat? Where else would manners and rights intersect? As presented in the television report, the opinion voiced by the unidentified patron \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cbe special somewhere else\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 is seen as a shocking instance of rudeness. It is. But more significantly, it\xe2\x80\x99s the sentiment that, when widespread, makes it possible for people to lose rights in the first place.'b'Dehumanizing practices depend on dehumanizing ideas. Instead of seeing the scene in the restaurant as a story with a heroic resolution, we might see it as a debate carried out in words and actions. Taking a kid with Down syndrome to a restaurant is a statement: he\xe2\x80\x99s a family member first, and he belongs. Saying that the kid shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be there, as the patron did, is one response; Mr. Garcia\xe2\x80\x99s principled refusal to provide service is yet another. That scene, tidy as it is, is only one part of a long American conversation about who does and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t belong.'b'Beneath the human interest story, in other words, is a question about who counts as human. For parents of children with Down syndrome like me, every daily act is an answer. What I live for, though, is the day when the question doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come up.'b'In late March 2009, 'b'Yahoo Sports published a story'b' alleging that the University of Connecticut had violated 'b'N.C.A.A.'b' rules in its efforts to recruit Nate Miles, a 6-foot-7 basketball player from Toledo, Ohio. The N.C.A.A. enforcement staff, led by Tim Nevius, one of its top investigators, opened an inquiry.'b'By then, Miles was back in Toledo; he\xe2\x80\x99d been expelled from UConn in October 2008, before ever playing a game. No longer a \xe2\x80\x9cstudent-athlete,\xe2\x80\x9d Miles refused to cooperate. Yet Nevius interviewed Dr. Chris MacLaren, a Florida orthopedic surgeon, who had once operated on Miles\xe2\x80\x99s foot. Without any consent from the patient, Nevius asked for, and MacLaren provided, details of Miles\xe2\x80\x99s surgery and its costs.'b'This, of course, was a gross violation of medical ethics. It was also, in all likelihood, a violation of 'b'medical privacy laws'b'. But when several lawyers involved in the case brought this potential illegality to the attention of the 'b'Committee on Infractions'b' \xe2\x80\x94 which metes out punishment to rules violators, and which includes a number of lawyers \xe2\x80\x94 the response was coldly dismissive. A medical release from Miles \xe2\x80\x9cwas not required,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Shepard Cooper, then the committee director. How did he know? Because Nevius had told him so. So much for the law.'b'Earlier this week, Mark Emmert, the N.C.A.A. president, acknowledged that the enforcement staff had, once again, done something deeply unethical. Except he didn\xe2\x80\x99t phrase it like that. In recounting the sordid details, involving an investigation into the 'b'University of Miami'b', Emmert made it sound as if they were aberrations, the actions of several rogue employees who were no longer there. Describing the transgressions as \xe2\x80\x9cstunning,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'Emmert announced'b' that he had hired a lawyer to review its investigative practices, insisting that his goal was to ensure that N.C.A.A. investigations were consistent with \xe2\x80\x9cour values.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What sanctimonious claptrap. The only thing stunning about this latest outrage is that Emmert acknowledged it. (My guess is that it was about to leak anyway.)'b'To recap: Nevin Shapiro, the man at the center of 'b'the Miami scandal'b' \xe2\x80\x94 who is now in prison for running a 'b'Ponzi scheme'b' \xe2\x80\x94 claims to have given University of Miami athletes cash, prostitutes, jewelry, \xe2\x80\x9cand on one occasion, an abortion\xe2\x80\x9d for a player\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend, 'b'according to Yahoo Sports'b', which broke this news as well. Incredibly, N.C.A.A. investigators engaged one of Shapiro\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy lawyers, 'b'Maria Elena Perez'b', which would seem like an insurmountable conflict of interest. Then, they used her ability to conduct depositions in the Shapiro bankruptcy case to gather information it could not otherwise obtain. Though Perez insists she did nothing wrong, this is the sort of ethical breach that can cost a lawyer her license.'b'When I expressed astonishment at this turn of events to Richard G. Johnson, a lawyer who has tangled with the N.C.A.A., he scoffed. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not unusual,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is part and parcel of the way the N.C.A.A. does business.\xe2\x80\x9d Andy Oliver, a former client of Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s who is now a pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates, became the subject of an N.C.A.A. investigation after his former lawyer violated lawyer-client confidentiality in speaking to the N.C.A.A. (Oliver ultimately won 'b'a reported'b' $750,000 settlement.)'b'In the case of former University of Southern California assistant football coach Todd McNair, which 'b'I wrote about several weeks ago'b', the enforcement staff\xe2\x80\x99s evidence against him was so dubious that a judge has ruled that he will likely win a defamation suit he brought against the N.C.A.A. In another case that 'b'I wrote about'b', the boyfriend of an N.C.A.A. investigator bragged that his girlfriend was going to nail a player she was investigating \xe2\x80\x94 months before her investigation had been completed.'b'Indeed, in the Miami case, this is not even the N.C.A.A.\xe2\x80\x99s only ethically dubious stunt. Just before Thanksgiving, 'b'the enforcement staff sent out letters'b' to numerous former athletes who had refused to cooperate \xe2\x80\x94 as is their right. The letters said that if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk in the next few days, the N.C.A.A. would assume that they were guilty of rules violations and punish their alma mater.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe N.C.A.A. thinks it is the 51st state,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson told me. Its investigators regularly solicit the assistance of law enforcement officials, acting as if they have some kind of equal standing. But they don\xe2\x80\x99t. The N.C.A.A. is not a regulatory body. It is merely an association that creates rules designed to prevent its labor force \xe2\x80\x94 college football and basketball players \xe2\x80\x94 from making any money. Most of its investigations \xe2\x80\x94 investigations that are selective, highhanded and a mockery of due process \xe2\x80\x94 are aimed at enforcing its dubious rules.'b'Over the last year, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve stumbled across one outrage after another, I\xe2\x80\x99ve wondered when someone in a position to do something about the N.C.A.A. \xe2\x80\x94 college presidents, maybe? Members of Congress? \xe2\x80\x94 would stand up and say \xe2\x80\x9cenough.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s getting awfully hard to look the other way.'b'If you can\xe2\x80\x99t win by playing fair, cheat.'b'That seems to be the plan of Republican lawmakers in several battleground states that stubbornly keep going for Democrats during presidential elections. Thanks in part to gerrymandering, many states already have \xe2\x80\x94 and will continue to have in the near future \xe2\x80\x94 Republican-controlled legislatures.'b'Republican lawmakers in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin are considering whether to abandon the winner-take-all approach to awarding Electoral College votes and replace it with a proportional allocation.'b'That change would heavily favor Republican presidential candidates \xe2\x80\x94 tilting the voting power away from cities and toward rural areas \xe2\x80\x94 and make it more likely that the candidate with the fewest votes over all would win a larger share of electoral votes.'b'One day I will have to visit the evil lair where they come up with these schemes. They pump them out like a factory. Voter suppression didn\xe2\x80\x99t work in November, and it may even have backfired in some states, so they just devised another devilish plan.'b'Pete Lund, a Republican state representative in Michigan, \xe2\x80\x9cplans to reintroduce legislation that would award all but two of Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s 16 Electoral College votes according to congressional district results,\xe2\x80\x9d said 'b'an article'b' Friday in The Detroit News.'b'The paper continued, \xe2\x80\x9cThe remaining two would go to the candidate winning the statewide majority.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Lund, who proposed a similar bill in 2012, made Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 intentions completely clear, saying, according to the article: \xe2\x80\x9cIt got no traction last year. There were people convinced Romney was going to win and this might take (electoral) votes from him.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'These bills are a brazen attempt to alter electoral outcomes and chip away at the very idea of democracy, to the benefit of Republican candidates.'b'The Detroit News also reported that, according to an analysis by Mark Brewer, the state Democratic Party chairman: \xe2\x80\x9cRomney would have gotten nine of Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s electoral votes and Obama would have received seven in 2012 under Lund\xe2\x80\x99s proposal. Instead, Obama garnered all 16 Michigan electoral votes en route to his national tally of 332.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Meanwhile, Obama beat Romney in the state by a margin of nearly 450,000 votes.'b'Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s bill is further along than Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s. It\xe2\x80\x99s already being debated.'b'For reference, although Obama won the state of Virginia and all of its electoral votes last year, as he did in 2008, according to 'b'The Roanoke Times'b' on Friday, \xe2\x80\x9cIf the system had been in effect for the 2012 election, Republican Mitt Romney would have won nine of Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s 13 electoral votes, and President Barack Obama would have won four.\xe2\x80\x9d Keep in mind that in November, Obama won the state by almost 150,000 votes.'b'Republicans in Virginia are just as forthright about their intention to tilt the electoral playing field in their favor.'b'The Washington Post 'b'reported'b' Thursday that the sponsor of Virginia bill\xe2\x80\x99s, Charles W.

In Republican Bizarro World, where the \xe2\x80\x9cintegrity of the vote\xe2\x80\x9d is a phrase used to diminish urban votes and in which democracy is only sacrosanct if Republicans are winning, this statement actually makes sense.'b'David Weigel of Slate 'b'explained'b' the point of the Virginia plan this way: \xe2\x80\x9cMake the rural vote matter more and make the metro vote count less.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Luckily, as the Roanoke paper noted Friday, Ralph Smith, the powerful Republican Virginia state senator, isn\xe2\x80\x99t on board:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSmith said this morning that he opposes the legislation, calling it \xe2\x80\x98a bad idea.\xe2\x80\x99 Smith sits on the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee, which will hear the bill next week.

My prognosis was \xe2\x80\x9cgrave\xe2\x80\x9d: I would never live independently, hold a job, find a loving partner, get married. My home would be a board-and-care facility, my days spent watching TV in a day room with other people debilitated by mental illness. I would work at menial jobs when my symptoms were quiet. Following my last psychiatric hospitalization at the age of 28, I was encouraged by a doctor to work as a cashier making change. If I could handle that, I was told, we would reassess my ability to hold a more demanding position, perhaps even something full-time.'b'Then I made a decision. I would write the narrative of my life. Today I am a chaired professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law. I have an adjunct appointment in the department of psychiatry at the medical school of the University of California, San Diego, and am on the faculty of the New Center for Psychoanalysis. The MacArthur Foundation gave me a 'b'genius grant'b'.'b'Although I fought my diagnosis for many years, I came to accept that I have schizophrenia and will be in treatment the rest of my life. Indeed, excellent psychoanalytic treatment and medication have been critical to my success. What I refused to accept was my prognosis.'b'Conventional psychiatric thinking and its diagnostic categories say that people like me don\xe2\x80\x99t exist. Either I don\xe2\x80\x99t have schizophrenia (please tell that to the delusions crowding my mind), or I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have accomplished what I have (please tell that to U.S.C.\xe2\x80\x99s committee on faculty affairs). But I do, and I have. And I have undertaken research with colleagues at U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. to show that I am not alone. There are others with schizophrenia and such active symptoms as delusions and hallucinations who have significant academic and professional achievements.'b'Over the last few years, my colleagues, including Stephen Marder, Alison Hamilton and Amy Cohen, and I have gathered 20 research subjects with high-functioning schizophrenia in Los Angeles. They suffered from symptoms like mild delusions or hallucinatory behavior. Their average age was 40. Half were male, half female, and more than half were minorities. All had high school diplomas, and a majority either had or were working toward college or graduate degrees. They were graduate students, managers, technicians and professionals, including a doctor, lawyer, psychologist and chief executive of a nonprofit group.'b'At the same time, most were unmarried and childless, which is consistent with their diagnoses. (My colleagues and I intend to do another study on people with schizophrenia who are high-functioning in terms of their relationships. Marrying in my mid-40s \xe2\x80\x94 the best thing that ever happened to me \xe2\x80\x94 was against all odds, following almost 18 years of not dating.) More than three-quarters had been hospitalized between two and five times because of their illness, while three had never been admitted.'b'How had these people with schizophrenia managed to succeed in their studies and at such high-level jobs? We learned that, in addition to medication and therapy, all the participants had developed techniques to keep their schizophrenia at bay. For some, these techniques were cognitive. An educator with a master\xe2\x80\x99s degree said he had learned to face his hallucinations and ask, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the evidence for that? Or is it just a perception problem?\xe2\x80\x9d Another participant said, \xe2\x80\x9cI hear derogatory voices all the time. ... You just gotta blow them off.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Part of vigilance about symptoms was \xe2\x80\x9cidentifying triggers\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cprevent a fuller blown experience of symptoms,\xe2\x80\x9d said a participant who works as a coordinator at a nonprofit group. For instance, if being with people in close quarters for too long can set off symptoms, build in some alone time when you travel with friends.'b'Other techniques that our participants cited included controlling sensory inputs. For some, this meant keeping their living space simple (bare walls, no TV, only quiet music), while for others, it meant distracting music. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll listen to loud music if I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear things,\xe2\x80\x9d said a participant who is a certified nurse\xe2\x80\x99s assistant. Still others mentioned exercise, a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol and getting enough sleep. A belief in God and prayer also played a role for some.'b'One of the most frequently mentioned techniques that helped our research participants manage their symptoms was work. \xe2\x80\x9cWork has been an important part of who I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said an educator in our group. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you become useful to an organization and feel respected in that organization, there\xe2\x80\x99s a certain value in belonging there.\xe2\x80\x9d This person works on the weekends too because of \xe2\x80\x9cthe distraction factor.\xe2\x80\x9d In other words, by engaging in work, the crazy stuff often recedes to the sidelines.'b'Personally, I reach out to my doctors, friends and family whenever I start slipping, and I get great support from them. I eat comfort food (for me, cereal) and listen to quiet music. I minimize all stimulation. Usually these techniques, combined with more medication and therapy, will make the symptoms pass. But the work piece \xe2\x80\x94 using my mind \xe2\x80\x94 is my best defense. It keeps me focused, it keeps the demons at bay. My mind, I have come to say, is both my worst enemy and my best friend.'b'THAT is why it is so distressing when doctors tell their patients not to expect or pursue fulfilling careers. Far too often, the conventional psychiatric approach to mental illness is to see clusters of symptoms that characterize people. Accordingly, many psychiatrists hold the view that treating symptoms with medication is treating mental illness. But this fails to take into account individuals\xe2\x80\x99 strengths and capabilities, leading mental health professionals to underestimate what their patients can hope to achieve in the world.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not just schizophrenia: earlier this month, The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry posted a study showing that a small group of people who were given diagnoses of autism, a developmental disorder, later stopped exhibiting symptoms. They 'b'seemed to have recovered'b' \xe2\x80\x94 though after years of behavioral therapy and treatment. A recent New York Times Magazine article described a new company that hires high-functioning adults with autism, taking advantage of their unusual memory skills and attention to detail.'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to sound like a Pollyanna about schizophrenia; mental illness imposes real limitations, and it\xe2\x80\x99s important not to romanticize it. We can\xe2\x80\x99t all be Nobel laureates like John Nash of the movie \xe2\x80\x9cA Beautiful Mind.\xe2\x80\x9d But the seeds of creative thinking may sometimes be found in mental illness, and people underestimate the power of the human brain to adapt and to create.'b'An approach that looks for individual strengths, in addition to considering symptoms, could help dispel the pessimism surrounding mental illness. Finding \xe2\x80\x9cthe wellness within the illness,\xe2\x80\x9d as one person with schizophrenia said, should be a therapeutic goal. Doctors should urge their patients to develop relationships and engage in meaningful work. They should encourage patients to find their own repertory of techniques to manage their symptoms and aim for a quality of life as they define it. And they should provide patients with the resources \xe2\x80\x94 therapy, medication and support \xe2\x80\x94 to make these things happen.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEvery person has a unique gift or unique self to bring to the world,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of our study\xe2\x80\x99s participants. She expressed the reality that those of us who have schizophrenia and other mental illnesses want what everyone wants: in the words of Sigmund Freud, to work and to love.'b'In one of the 23 'b'executive actions'b' on gun control signed this month, President Obama instructed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other federal science agencies to conduct research into the causes and prevention of gun violence. He called on Congress to aid that effort by providing $10 million for the C.D.C. in the next budget round and $20 million to expand the federal reporting system on violent deaths to all 50 states, from the current 18.'b'That Mr. Obama had to make such a decree at all is a measure of the power of the gun lobby, which has 'b'effectively shut down'b' government-financed research on gun violence for 17 years. Research on guns is crucial to any long-term effort to reduce death from guns. In other words, treat gun violence as a public health issue.'b'But that is precisely what the National Rifle Association and other opponents of firearms regulation do not want. In the absence of reliable data and data-driven policy recommendations, talk about guns inevitably lurches into the unknown, allowing abstractions, propaganda and ideology to fill the void and thwart change.'b'The research freeze began at a time when the C.D.C. was making strides in 'b'studying gun violence as a public health problem'b'. Before that, the issue had been regarded mainly as a law enforcement challenge or as a problem of disparate acts by deranged offenders, an approach that remains in sync with the N.R.A. worldview.'b''b'Public health research emphasizes'b' prevention of death, disability and injury. It focuses not only on the gun user, but on the gun, in much the same way that public health efforts to reduce motor vehicle deaths have long focused on both drivers and cars.'b'The goal is to understand a health threat and identify lifesaving interventions. At their most basic, gun policy recommendations would extend beyond buying and owning a gun (say, background checks and safe storage devices) to manufacturing (childproofing and other federal safety standards) and distribution (stronger antitrafficking laws), as well as educating and enlisting parents, physicians, teachers and other community leaders to talk about the risks and responsibilities of gun ownership.'b'But by the early 1990s, C.D.C. gun research had advanced to the point that it contradicted N.R.A. ideology. Some studies found, for example, that people living in a home with a gun were not safer; they faced a significantly elevated risk of 'b'homicide'b' and 'b'suicide'b'.'b'The N.R.A. denounced the research as \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical opinion masquerading as medical science,\xe2\x80\x9d and in 1996, Congress took $2.6 million intended for gun research and redirected it to traumatic brain injury. It prohibited the use of C.D.C. money \xe2\x80\x9cto advocate or promote gun control.\xe2\x80\x9d Since then, similar prohibitions have been imposed on other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health.'b'Technically, the prohibition is not a ban on all research, but the law has cast a pall that even prominent foundations and academic centers cannot entirely overcome. That is in part because comprehensive public health efforts require systematic data gathering and analysis, the scale and scope of which is a government undertaking. To understand and prevent motor vehicle deaths, for instance, the government tracks more than 100 variables per fatal crash, including the make, model and year of the vehicles, the speed and speed limit, the location of passengers, seat belt use and air bag deployment.'b'Guns deaths do not get such scrutiny. That does not mean we do not know enough to act. The evidence linking gun prevalence and violent death is strong and compelling; 'b'international comparisons'b' are also instructive.'b'But we need more data to formulate, analyze and evaluate policy to focus on what works and to refine or reject what does not. How many guns are stolen? How do guns first get diverted into illegal hands? How many murderers would have passed today\xe2\x80\x99s background checks? What percentage of criminal gun traces are accounted for by, say, the top 5 percent of gun dealers? How many households possess firearms: is it one-third as some surveys suggest, or one-half?'b'The gun lobby is likely to claim that any federally financed gun research, per se, is banned by law, a charge that would force debate of whether evidence-based policy recommendations are tantamount to lobbying. Or the C.D.C. may choose to focus on data collection and leave the policy recommendations to outside researchers. That would be a sorry situation for government scientists, but an improvement over the status quo.'b'It is obvious that gun violence is a public health threat. A 'b'letter'b' this month to Vice President Joseph Biden Jr.\xe2\x80\x99s gun violence commission from more than 100 researchers in public health and related fields pointed out that mortality rates from almost every major cause of death have declined drastically over the past half century. Motor vehicle deaths per mile driven in America have fallen by more than 80 percent. But the homicide rate in the United States, driven by guns, is almost exactly the same as it was in 1950.'b'Carl Malamud is the founder and president of the nonprofit 'b'Public.Resource.Org'b'.

A Failed Tradition,\xe2\x80\x9d and I\xe2\x80\x99d like at the outset to say the same. During a career that has included no small number of formal interviews and informal conversations with them, I\xe2\x80\x99ve met many I admire, men of genuine compassion and remarkable altruism, more dedicated to humanity than to any dogma or selective tradition.'b'But while I have nothing against priests, I have quite a lot against an institution that has done a disservice to them and to the parishioners in whose interests they should toil. I refer to the Roman Catholic Church, specifically to its modern incarnation and current leaders, who have tucked priests into a cosseted caste above the flock, wrapped them in mysticism and prioritized their protection and reputations over the needs and sometimes even the anguish of the people in the pews. I have a problem, in other words, with the church\xe2\x80\x99s arrogance, a thread that runs through Wills\xe2\x80\x99s book, to be published next month; through fresh revelations of how assiduously a cardinal in Los Angeles worked to cover up child sexual abuse; and through the church\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to silence dissenters, including an outspoken clergyman in Ireland who was recently back in the news.'b'LET\xe2\x80\x99S start with Los Angeles. Last week, as a result of lawsuits filed against the archdiocese of Los Angeles by hundreds of victims of sexual abuse by priests, 'b'internal church personnel files were made public'b'. They showed that Cardinal Roger M. Mahony\xe2\x80\x99s impulse, when confronted with priests who had molested children, was to hush it up and keep law enforcement officials at bay. While responses like this by Roman Catholic bishops and cardinals have been extensively chronicled and are no longer shocking, they remain infuriating. At one point Cardinal Mahony instructed a priest whom he\xe2\x80\x99d dispatched to New Mexico for counseling not to return to California, lest he risk being criminally prosecuted. That sort of shielding of priests from accountability allowed them, in many cases across the United States, to continue their abusive behavior and claim more young victims.'b'Cardinal Mahony, who led the Los Angeles archdiocese from 1985 to 2011, 'b'released a statement'b' last week in which he said that until 2006, when he began to meet with dozens of victims, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t grasp \xe2\x80\x9cthe full and lasting impact these horrible acts would have\xe2\x80\x9d on the children subjected to them. I find that assertion incredible and appalling. It takes no particular sophistication about matters of mental health to intuit that a child molested by an adult \xe2\x80\x94 in these cases, by an adult who is supposed to be a moral exemplar and tutor, even a conduit to the divine \xe2\x80\x94 would be grievously damaged. The failure to recognize that and to make sure that abusive priests\xe2\x80\x99 access to children was eliminated, even if that meant trials and jail sentences, suggests a greater concern for the stature of clergymen than for the souls of children.'b'Church officials and defenders note that Cardinal Mahony\xe2\x80\x99s gravest misdeeds occurred in the 1980s, before church leaders were properly educated about recidivism among pedophiles and before the dimensions of the child sexual abuse crisis in the church became clear. They point out that the church\xe2\x80\x99s response improved over time. That\xe2\x80\x99s true, but what hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed is the church\xe2\x80\x99s hubris. This hubris abetted the crisis: the particular sway that abusers held over their victims and the special trust they received from those children\xe2\x80\x99s parents were tied into the church\xe2\x80\x99s presentation of priests as paragons.'b'And this hubris also survives the crisis, manifest in the way that the Vatican, a gilded enclave so far removed and so frequently out of step with the rest of the world, clamps down on Catholics who challenge its rituals and rules. Much of what these dissenters raise questions about \xe2\x80\x94 the all-male priesthood, for example, or the commitment to celibacy that priests are required to make \xe2\x80\x94 aren\xe2\x80\x99t indisputable edicts from God. They\xe2\x80\x99re inventions of the mortals who took charge of the faith.'b'And yet with imperious regularity, Vatican officials issue their relished condemnations. These officials are reliably riled by nuns, a favorite target of their wrath. And they\xe2\x80\x99ve been none too pleased with an Irish priest, the Rev. Tony Flannery, 66, who was 'b'suspended from his ministry'b' by the Vatican last year and informed, 'b'he recently said'b', that he could return to it on the condition that he publicly express his endorsement of a range of official positions that he had questioned, including the exclusion of women from the priesthood. Last Sunday he broke a long silence to say that the Vatican had threatened him with excommunication and to call its approach toward him \xe2\x80\x9creminiscent of the Inquisition.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Among the Vatican\xe2\x80\x99s issues with him was his stated belief in a 2010 article that the priesthood, rather than originating with Jesus and a specially selected group of followers, was selfishly created later by a \xe2\x80\x9cprivileged group within the community who had abrogated power and authority to themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That may sound like an extreme assertion, but the new book by Wills, a Pulitzer Prize winner who has written extensively about Christianity and the church, says that at the start, Christianity not only didn\xe2\x80\x99t have priests but opposed them. The priesthood was a subsequent tweak, and the same goes for the all-male, celibate nature of the Roman Catholic clergy and the autocratic hierarchy that this clergy inhabits, an unresponsive government whose subjects \xe2\x80\x94 the laity \xe2\x80\x94 have limited say.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t admit to error, the church hierarchy,\xe2\x80\x9d Wills told me on the phone on Thursday. \xe2\x80\x9cAny challenge to their prerogative is, in their eyes, a challenge to God. You can\xe2\x80\x99t be any more arrogant than that.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe Catholics were taught not only that we must have priests but that they must be the right kind of priests,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes in the book, which argues that priests aren\xe2\x80\x99t ultimately necessary. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat we were supposed to accept is that all priesthoods are invalid ones except the Roman Catholic.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s an awfully puffed-up position, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a corresponding haughtiness in the fact that bishops can assign priests to parishes without any real obligation to get input or feedback from the parishioners those priests serve. This way of doing business in fact enabled church leaders to shuttle priests accused of molestation around, keeping them one step ahead of their crimes.'b'It has also helped to turn many Catholics away from the church, while prompting others to regard its leaders as ornamental and somewhat irrelevant distractions. They cherish the essence and beauty of their religion. They just can\xe2\x80\x99t abide the arrogance of many of its appointed caretakers.'b'Prime Minister David Cameron, like much of the British public, is ambivalent about his country\xe2\x80\x99s future in the European Union. He correctly recognizes that a Britain outside the union would count for less in world affairs, forfeit the privileged access it now enjoys to its largest trading partner, and lose its seat at the European table where matters of great importance to Britain are discussed \xe2\x80\x94 from cross-border banking rules to environmental regulation.'b'Yet he wishes the European project had limited itself to a loose customs union instead of the more ambitious goal of \xe2\x80\x9can ever closer union\xe2\x80\x9d enshrined in the founding treaties that Britain accepted when it joined in 1973 and embodied in a host of labor, environmental and human rights standards, border conventions and consumer regulations. It did not, and most of Mr. Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s European partners do not wish to revisit that fundamental question.'b'Mr. Cameron expressed his ambivalence 'b'in a long- awaited speech on Wednesday'b'. He pretended that Britain could have it both ways. Without going into details of what he might find acceptable, he promised that if his Conservatives won the next election, in two years, he would try to renegotiate the terms of British membership and submit the results to a referendum in 2017 or 2018.'b'Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s elegant straddle may serve Mr. Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s political needs of the moment. But, for Britain, it is an unwise and risky course. It presages four or five years of costly uncertainty for potential investors in a struggling British economy that Mr. Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s wrongheaded austerity policies have failed to revive. Ambivalence may prove a political luxury with a high economic price tag. And we are concerned that Britain\xe2\x80\x99s European Union partners may be inclined to take its voice less seriously, not more, during the run-up to the promised referendum.'b'That referendum may not happen. Four years is a long time in British politics and in the evolution of the European Union. Germany holds potentially important elections this year. So does Italy. In Britain, the Conservatives trail Labour in the polls. Mr. Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s coalition partner, the Liberal Democrats, are more enthusiastic about Europe and less enthusiastic about a referendum than he is. Mr. Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s real aim for now may be to appease militant euro-skeptics in his party and nip a growing challenge from the United Kingdom Independence Party on his right.'b'As this page has often argued, there is much to criticize in the way the European Union runs its affairs, from wasteful agricultural subsidies to the catastrophic mishandling of Greece\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign debt. Mr. Cameron is right to challenge Europe to become less protectionist and more democratic. He is right to insist that the 10 union countries that have not joined the euro not be ignored in economic and financial policy discussions by the 17 that have. But it is hard to see how he can press these views unless Britain remains an active and respected voice in European deliberations, now and in the future.'b'DAVOS, Switzerland'b'IT\xe2\x80\x99S the annual conclave of the presumed powerful, 'b'the World Economic Forum'b' in Davos, with the wealthy flying in on private jets to discuss issues like global poverty. As always, it\xe2\x80\x99s a sea of men. This year, 'b'female participation is 17 percent'b'.'b'Perhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising, considering that global business and political leaders are overwhelmingly male. In America, only 'b'17 percent of American Fortune 500 board seats'b' are held by women, a mere 3 percent of board chairs are women \xe2\x80\x94 and women 'b'are barely represented in President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s cabinet'b'.'b'Indeed, I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing that the average boardroom doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have much better gender equality than a team of cave hunters attacking a woolly mammoth 30,000 years ago.'b'So what gives? A provocative answer comes from 'b'Sheryl Sandberg'b', the chief operating officer of Facebook, who has written a smart book due out in March that attributes the gender gap, in part, to chauvinism and corporate obstacles \xe2\x80\x94 but also, in part, to women who don\xe2\x80\x99t aggressively pursue opportunities.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe hold ourselves back in ways both big and small, by lacking self-confidence, by not raising our hands, and by pulling back when we should be leaning in,\xe2\x80\x9d Sandberg writes in the book, 'b'called \xe2\x80\x9cLean In.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe internalize the negative messages we get throughout our lives, the messages that say it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong to be outspoken, aggressive, more powerful than men. We lower our own expectations of what we can achieve. We continue to do the majority of the housework and child care. We compromise our career goals to make room for partners and children who may not even exist yet.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Sandberg and I discussed the issue on a panel here in Davos, and I think that there is something real and important in what she says. When I lecture at universities, the first questions are invariably asked by a man \xe2\x80\x94 even at a women\xe2\x80\x99s college. When I point at someone in a crowd to ask a question, the women in the area almost always look at each other hesitantly \xe2\x80\x94 and any man in the vicinity jumps up and asks his question.'b''b'A McKinsey survey'b' published in April found that 36 percent of male employees at major companies aspired to be top executives, compared with 18 percent of the women. 'b'A study of Carnegie Mellon M.B.A. graduates'b' in 2003 found that 57 percent of the men, but only 7 percent of the women, tried to negotiate a higher initial salary offer.'b'Sandberg, one of the most prominent women in corporate America, is not known as a shrinking violet. She confesses that when she was in elementary school, she trained her younger brother and sister to follow her around, listen to her give speeches and periodically shout: \xe2\x80\x9cRight!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yet she acknowledges that she has harbored many insecurities, sometimes shedding tears at the office, as well as doubts about her juggling of work and family.'b'When she joined Facebook as its No. 2, she was initially willing to accept the first offer from Mark Zuckerberg, the founder. She writes that her husband and brother-in-law hounded her to demand more, so she did \xe2\x80\x94 and got a better deal.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am hoping that each woman will set her own goals and reach for them with gusto,\xe2\x80\x9d Sandberg writes. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am hoping that each man will do his part to support women in the workplace and in the home, also with gusto.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yet I wish that there could be two versions of Sandberg\xe2\x80\x99s book. One marketed to young women would encourage them to be more assertive. One marketed to men (and women already in leadership) would emphasize the need for structural changes to accommodate women and families.'b'Is Sandberg blaming the victim? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so, but I also don\xe2\x80\x99t want to relax the pressure on employers to do a much better job of recruiting and promoting women.'b'Nature and social mores together make motherhood more all-consuming than fatherhood, yet the modern job was built for a distracted father. That\xe2\x80\x99s not great for dads and can be just about impossible for moms \xe2\x80\x94 at least those who don\xe2\x80\x99t have great wealth or extraordinary spouses.'b'Sandberg famously leaves the office at 5:30 most days to be with her kids, but not many women (or men) would dare try that.'b'Some people believe that women are more nurturing bosses, or that they offer more support to women below them. I\xe2\x80\x99m skeptical. Women can be jerks as much as men.'b'But we need more women in leadership positions for another reason: 'b'considerable evidence suggests'b' that more diverse groups reach better decisions. Corporations should promote women not just out of fairness, but also because it helps them perform better. Lehman Brothers might still be around today 'b'if it were Lehman Brothers &amp; Sisters'b'.'b'So, yes, let\xe2\x80\x99s encourage young women to \xe2\x80\x9clean in,\xe2\x80\x9d but let\xe2\x80\x99s also change the workplace so that when they do lean in and assert themselves, we\xe2\x80\x99re directly behind them shouting: \xe2\x80\x9cRight!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Scientists who had 'b'stopped research'b' during the past year on a newly created bird flu virus because of safety and terrorism concerns have announced plans to resume their work. We wish we could be as sanguine as they are that all the earlier concerns have been dealt with.'b'The concerns arose after two research groups, one in the Netherlands and one in Wisconsin, genetically altered a bird flu virus, which seldom infects humans but is lethal when it does. Five to nine genetic mutations in the Dutch experiment allowed the bird flu virus to spread by coughs and sneezes among ferrets, a laboratory model for what might happen in humans.'b'The scientists published their first papers last year in two leading journals, Science and Nature, after agreeing to a voluntary moratorium on further research until governments and research organizations could decide on ground rules to protect the public.'b'Now, they say, 'b'the work can resume'b' in countries that have set conditions to ensure safety and security. That will not help the Wisconsin researchers, whose work was financed by the National Institutes of Health, which has not yet issued guidelines. But it may benefit the Dutch team, whose work was also financed by the N.I.H. but which believes it can use money from other sources to restart its studies.'b'Critics of the research had focused initially on whether terrorists might steal the virus or use the publications as a blueprint to make their own lethal strain. Later the emphasis shifted to safety \xe2\x80\x94 the risk that the virus might escape from a laboratory or that inept imitators might unwittingly unleash an epidemic.'b'The researchers claim that the benefits of the research \xe2\x80\x94 greater understanding of how flu viruses adapt to mammals and advance warning as to whether bird flu is close to becoming transmissible through the air \xe2\x80\x94 outweigh what they consider small risks in such experiments.'b'But as 'b'an editorial in Nature'b' observed, \xe2\x80\x9can independent risk-benefit analysis\xe2\x80\x9d of such research \xe2\x80\x9cis still lacking.\xe2\x80\x9d The editorial warned, wisely, \xe2\x80\x9cThe potential risks of the work demand exceptional precautions in any future research.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'SNOW was my first love. From November\xe2\x80\x99s first flakes and the season\xe2\x80\x99s first blizzard, to unexpected midnight dustings and late March blasts, snow fell frequently and happily on my childhood in western Massachusetts. I never complained about the unshoveled, post-blizzard darkness of my paper route, nor about scrambling over icy drifts en route to school. In the evenings I read in front of our wood stove, captivated by thoughts of Narnia\xe2\x80\x99s endless winter.'b'Snow gives us a new world. It gives us (not least) a day off to contemplate it. Snow bestows silence: deep snowfalls \xe2\x80\x9cspread their peace,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saint-Exup\xc3\xa9ry. Above all, snow gives meaning to the great indoors. Thoreau wrote that in winter, \xe2\x80\x9cwarmth stands for all virtue.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Coming in from the cold requires going out. I loved to build fires as dusk and snow began to fall; even more, I loved to stagger with an armful of logs back to a house aglow between an ivory landscape and an ice field of stars.'b'Fortunately, despite worries about a warming planet, no one is predicting the end of snow anytime soon. Some cold places will see more snow, because warmer air can carry more moisture. In the Northern Hemisphere, snow coverage this past December was the greatest since records began in 1966, 'b'Rutgers University\xe2\x80\x99s Global Snow Lab'b' reported. But Dr. 'b'David Robinson'b', a climatologist at Rutgers, warns that year-to-year fluctuations and regional differences can deceive casual observers. In general, he says, there has been an \xe2\x80\x9coverall decline in snowfall.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Other studies echo that conclusion. The 'b'United States Global Change Research Program'b'\xe2\x80\x99s recently released draft 'b'National Climate Assessment'b' reports that \xe2\x80\x9cOverall snow cover has decreased in the Northern Hemisphere, due in part to higher temperatures that shorten the time snow spends on the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d The report also notes a decline in the frequency of very snowy winters and in snow accumulations in the American West, and said we can expect more rainstorms \xe2\x80\x9cin previously snow-dominated settings.\xe2\x80\x9d A 'b'recent study'b' by the Natural Resources Defense Council warns that without action on climate change, the snow season in the Northeast will be halved by 2100.'b'I have some sympathy for those who say good riddance to snow. Snow, when it overturns our normal routines, can be its own reward: a Berkshire friend\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cblizzard action plan\xe2\x80\x9d involves music and joyful bread-baking. But disrupted transportation and the challenges that winter weather can impose on older people are no joke.'b'Whatever your 'b'feelings for snow'b', its evanescence will cost you. 'b'Frank Lowenstein'b', a climate specialist with 'b'the Nature Conservancy'b', told me: \xe2\x80\x9cthe snowpack out West is how we store water for the summer for half the country. And it\xe2\x80\x99s disappearing.\xe2\x80\x9d That means less summer water for cities, agriculture and recreation. It means more wildfires. Changing ecosystems will also affect wildlife, while less snowy landscapes absorb still more heat from the sun. The National Climate Assessment expects heat-related deaths to increase more than winter-weather-related fatalities will decline.'b'Nor should we forget how often and how beautifully snow has fallen upon America\xe2\x80\x99s cultural landscape. Think Rockwell and Frost, of course, Bing Crosby and 'b'Emerson'b' (\xe2\x80\x9cthe mad wind\xe2\x80\x99s night-work/The frolic architecture of the snow\xe2\x80\x9d). It\xe2\x80\x99s not as if Melville compared the 'b'color of his whale'b' to a cold winter rain. We may not associate snowboarders with quiet contemplation of winter\xe2\x80\x99s formal elegance. But note the words chosen by 'b'Protect Our Winters'b', a snowboarder-founded group that encourages winter sports enthusiasts to \xe2\x80\x9csave a season that fuels our passions.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'The National Ski Areas Association'b' has already enrolled about 20 ski areas in its Climate Challenge program (slogan: \xe2\x80\x9cKeep Winter Cool\xe2\x80\x9d).'b'IF you\xe2\x80\x99re still unmoved by what we\xe2\x80\x99ll lose as the snows melt from America\xe2\x80\x99s lands and imagination, then join me on a Dickensian tour of the ghost of winter future \xe2\x80\x94 also known as Britain.'b'Snow in Britain is beloved but rare: beloved because it\xe2\x80\x99s rare. The Oxford scholar Robert Douglas-Fairhurst reminded me that a few unusually snowy winters, coincidental with Dickens\xe2\x80\x99s childhood, infused \xe2\x80\x9cA Christmas Carol,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Pickwick Papers\xe2\x80\x9d and, ultimately, the modern British psyche with blizzard-laden fantasies out of all proportion to actual precipitation, at least of the frozen kind. If Dickens got Britain\xe2\x80\x99s fictitious snowball rolling, think of 'b'Dylan Thomas'b', the winter weather at 'b'Harry Potter'b'\xe2\x80\x99s Hogwarts, and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Snowman,\xe2\x80\x9d a deeply beloved children\xe2\x80\x99s book ('b'the film'b' was introduced by David Bowie, whose recent surprise single a British reviewer compared to unexpected overnight snow).'b'Last weekend\xe2\x80\x99s widespread snow across Britain 'b'produced scenes'b' as joyful and exuberant as ever. Still, not all Britons love their rare winter guest. Stephen Bayley, a critic and writer, despises snow. Mr. Bayley fingers Prince Albert, Queen Victoria\xe2\x80\x99s consort, for bringing Christmas trees to Windsor, and \xe2\x80\x9cwith them a sort of Teutonic forest-worship which, in the popular imagination, was associated with snow.\xe2\x80\x9d And Dr. Douglas-Fairhurst notes that British snow, like most love affairs, \xe2\x80\x9ctends to bring as much misery as pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d Britain\xe2\x80\x99s inability to clear snow from roads and rails is legendary.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s also suspicious, given the joyful day off from work and school that typically results. But whatever the truth behind the snowy London streets undisturbed by \xe2\x80\x9csnow ploughs,\xe2\x80\x9d the contrast between Britain\xe2\x80\x99s snow-blind love and the damp browns of the country\xe2\x80\x99s typical winter landscape offers a chilling warning to Americans taking pleasure in yet another season of sidewalks that don\xe2\x80\x99t require shoveling. Tennyson \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cring, happy bells, across the snow!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 reminded the Victorians that it is better to have loved and lost. True for snow? Americans may know sooner than they might wish.'b'Is there a stranger figure in American literature than the narrator of \xe2\x80\x9cMoby-Dick\xe2\x80\x9d? He says, \xe2\x80\x9cCall me Ishmael\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the very first words of the book \xe2\x80\x94 but that isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly the same as saying \xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Ishmael.\xe2\x80\x9d He could be anyone, of any name, but Ishmael is what the reader must agree to call him before the book can get under way. I recently drove with a friend from my farm in New York State to Southern California, and Ishmael was our companion. We picked him up, so to speak, on the dark, icy streets of New Bedford, round about 1851, and delivered him within sight of what he calls \xe2\x80\x9cyour contemplative Pacific,\xe2\x80\x9d ageless as always.'b'As \xe2\x80\x9cMoby-Dick\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded \xe2\x80\x94 read aloud by the sterling William Hootkins \xe2\x80\x94 I began to feel as though we were carrying a garrulous hitchhiker, a transcendental encyclopedist, indeed a back-seat whaler of sorts. Sometimes Ishmael reclined at his leisure, telling his tale with an outspoken, formal bravado, the way he tells the Town-Ho story to some Spanish gentlemen in Lima in the 54th chapter. Mostly, he leaned forward into the space between the driver\xe2\x80\x99s and passenger\xe2\x80\x99s seats, shifting between philosophical agony and philosophical reverie, looking out upon the country passing by, moralizing it for us, perpetually searching out its meaning.'b'And to Ishmael nothing escaped meaning, no matter how slight or significant it was. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d That was his perpetual question. It sprang to mind at the sight of the sedimentary road cuts in rural Missouri, at the glutted rivers we passed, at harvested fields laced with frost. A pasture of white cattle gave Ishmael the shivers. To him, nothing was merely itself. This world of appearances through which we were driving, real enough to us, was to Ishmael but the spiritual world protruding into our senses. At Marsha\xe2\x80\x99s Country Kitchen in Chandler, Okla., everyone stared at us as we entered \xe2\x80\x94 two New Yorkers and their imaginary narrator. We felt as though we had approached some metaphysical border, as though we ourselves were members of the phantom boat crew Ahab smuggles aboard the Pequod, at whom everyone stares in wonderment when they make their first appearance in Chapter 47.'b'I stopped to look at the long disused lamps in the window of the thrift shop next door to Marsha\xe2\x80\x99s, and in my ear Ishmael whispered, once again, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you not find a strange analogy?\xe2\x80\x9d Nothing would placate him but saying yes. And yet, somehow, I came to love his digressions, philosophical and factual. They are as characteristic of Ishmael as his puzzling inner knowledge of Ahab\xe2\x80\x99s state of being. If we had driven to California as circuitously as Ishmael narrates, we would be somewhere in the Yukon now, bound for Los Angeles.'b'I began to be glad of a few things. The most important is this: \xe2\x80\x9cMoby-Dick\xe2\x80\x9d was published eight years before Darwin\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cOn the Origin of Species.\xe2\x80\x9d What would Ishmael have made of evolution? How it would have enriched, not to say engulfed, his telling! In \xe2\x80\x9cMoby-Dick,\xe2\x80\x9d nature is a horror. If a creature is believed to be knowing, like the great white whale, it is assumed to be malevolent. And if it has no humanlike awareness, it is endowed, like the polar bear, with \xe2\x80\x9cirresponsible ferociousness.\xe2\x80\x9d Beneath \xe2\x80\x9cthe loveliest tints of azure,\xe2\x80\x9d there is \xe2\x80\x9cthe universal cannibalism of the sea.\xe2\x80\x9d Under Ishmael\xe2\x80\x99s tutelage, I began to feel guilty for admiring the sunset as we rolled toward Albuquerque. Who knew what the sun was scorching as it rolled over the horizon?'b'I was always glad at day\xe2\x80\x99s end too, when we parked and turned off \xe2\x80\x9cMoby-Dick.\xe2\x80\x9d Not that the book ended then. Usually, in the evening, I would begin reading the book where we had left off listening. I have never been so struck by the silence of the printed word. I have never grasped so clearly how inward words have to go in our minds before they come alive. I was the one leaning forward, hearkening to Ishmael, keenly aware of the whiteness of the page, just as I had been every time I\xe2\x80\x99d read \xe2\x80\x9cMoby-Dick\xe2\x80\x9d before.'b'Someone must survive to tell the tale, and I will be giving nothing away to say that it is Ishmael, lone survivor of the Pequod. My question is this. Why does Ishmael survive in italics? The rest of the book is set in roman type, but the epilogue is not. What manner of being is this italicized survival? I searched for the strange analogy that must be hidden in it, but I could not find it.'b'I would like to say that we drove down to the docks at San Pedro to drop off Ishmael and his carpetbag, where he might drive away the spleen and regulate his circulation by putting to sea again. But of course we did nothing of the sort. We parked instead under the peaceful, flickering shade of an Australian eucalyptus, which put me in mind of those Sydney men \xe2\x80\x9cso much distrusted by our whaling captains.\xe2\x80\x9d And then we disembarked ourselves, while Ishmael vanished into the soft California light.'b' 'b''b''b'LORD knows there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of bad news in the world today to get you down, but there is one big thing happening that leaves me incredibly hopeful about the future, and that is the budding revolution in global online higher education. Nothing has more potential to lift more people out of poverty \xe2\x80\x94 by providing them an affordable education to get a job or improve in the job they have. Nothing has more potential to unlock a billion more brains to solve the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest problems. And nothing has more potential to enable us to reimagine higher education than the massive open online course, or MOOC, platforms that are being developed by the likes of Stanford and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and companies like Coursera and Udacity.'b'Last May 'b'I wrote about Coursera'b' \xe2\x80\x94 co-founded by the Stanford computer scientists Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng \xe2\x80\x94 just after it opened. Two weeks ago, I went back out to Palo Alto to check in on them. When I visited last May, about 300,000 people were taking 38 courses taught by Stanford professors and a few other elite universities. Today, they have 2.4 million students, taking 214 courses from 33 universities, including eight international ones.'b'Anant Agarwal, the former director of M.I.T.\xe2\x80\x99s artificial intelligence lab, is now president of edX, a nonprofit MOOC that M.I.T. and Harvard are jointly building. Agarwal told me that since May, some 155,000 students from around the world have taken edX\xe2\x80\x99s first course: an M.I.T. intro class on circuits. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is greater than the total number of M.I.T. alumni in its 150-year history,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Yes, only a small percentage complete all the work, and even they still tend to be from the middle and upper classes of their societies, but I am convinced that within five years these platforms will reach a much broader demographic. Imagine how this might change U.S. foreign aid. For relatively little money, the U.S. could rent space in an Egyptian village, install two dozen computers and high-speed satellite Internet access, hire a local teacher as a facilitator, and invite in any Egyptian who wanted to take online courses with the best professors in the world, subtitled in Arabic.'b'YOU just have to hear the stories told by the pioneers in this industry to appreciate its revolutionary potential. One of Koller\xe2\x80\x99s favorites is about \xe2\x80\x9cDaniel,\xe2\x80\x9d a 17-year-old with autism who communicates mainly by computer. He took an online modern poetry class from Penn. He and his parents wrote that the combination of rigorous academic curriculum, which requires Daniel to stay on task, and the online learning system that does not strain his social skills, attention deficits or force him to look anyone in the eye, enable him to better manage his autism. Koller shared a letter from Daniel, in which he wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cPlease tell Coursera and Penn my story. I am a 17-year-old boy emerging from autism. I can\xe2\x80\x99t yet sit still in a classroom so [your course] was my first real course ever. During the course, I\xc2\xa0had to keep pace with the class, which is unheard-of in special ed.\xc2\xa0Now I know I can benefit from having to work hard and enjoy being in sync with the world.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'One member of the Coursera team who recently took a Coursera course on sustainability told me that it was so much more interesting than a similar course he had taken as an undergrad. The online course included students from all over the world, from different climates, incomes levels and geographies, and, as a result, \xe2\x80\x9cthe discussions that happened in that course were so much more valuable and interesting than with people of similar geography and income level\xe2\x80\x9d in a typical American college.'b'Mitch Duneier, a Princeton sociology professor, wrote an essay in The Chronicle of Higher Education in the fall about his experience teaching a class through Coursera: \xe2\x80\x9cA few months ago, just as the campus of Princeton University had grown nearly silent after commencement, 40,000 students from 113 countries arrived here via the Internet to take a free course in introductory sociology. ... My opening discussion of C. Wright Mills\xe2\x80\x99s classic 1959 book, \xe2\x80\x98The Sociological Imagination,\xe2\x80\x99 was a close reading of the text, in which I reviewed a key chapter line by line. I asked students to follow along in their own copies, as I do in the lecture hall. When I give this lecture on the Princeton campus, I usually receive a few penetrating questions. In this case, however, within a few hours of posting the online version, the course forums came alive with hundreds of comments and questions. Several days later there were thousands. ... Within three weeks I had received more feedback on my sociological ideas than I had in a career of teaching, which significantly influenced each of my subsequent lectures and seminars.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Agarwal of edX tells of a student in Cairo who was taking the circuits course and was having difficulty. In the class\xe2\x80\x99s online forum, where students help each other with homework, he posted that he was dropping out. In response, other students in Cairo in the same class invited him to meet at a teahouse, where they offered to help him stay in the course. A 15-year-old student in Mongolia, who took the same class as part of a blended course and received a perfect score on the final exam, added Agarwal, is now applying to M.I.T. and the University of California, Berkeley.'b'As we look to the future of higher education, said the M.I.T. president, L. Rafael Reif, something that we now call a \xe2\x80\x9cdegree\xe2\x80\x9d will be a concept \xe2\x80\x9cconnected with bricks and mortar\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and traditional on-campus experiences that will increasingly leverage technology and the Internet to enhance classroom and laboratory work. Alongside that, though, said Reif, many universities will offer online courses to students anywhere in the world, in which they will earn \xe2\x80\x9ccredentials\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 certificates that testify that they have done the work and passed all the exams. The process of developing credible credentials that verify that the student has adequately mastered the subject \xe2\x80\x94 and did not cheat \xe2\x80\x94 and can be counted on by employers is still being perfected by all the MOOCs. But once it is, this phenomenon will really scale.'b'I can see a day soon where you\xe2\x80\x99ll create your own college degree by taking the best online courses from the best professors from around the world \xe2\x80\x94 some computing from Stanford, some entrepreneurship from Wharton, some ethics from Brandeis, some literature from Edinburgh \xe2\x80\x94 paying only the nominal fee for the certificates of completion. It will change teaching, learning and the pathway to employment. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a new world unfolding,\xe2\x80\x9d said Reif, \xe2\x80\x9cand everyone will have to adapt.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'IN 1942, 71 years before last week\xe2\x80\x99s Pentagon decision allowing women on the front lines of combat, the United States government established the Women\xe2\x80\x99s Army Corps, with Athena as its insignia, and welcomed our country\xe2\x80\x99s first female military recruits.'b'One of these pioneering women was a corporal from Big Spring, Tex., named 'b'Nellie Gray'b'. After the war ended, Gray finished college (with an assist from the G.I. Bill) and moved to Washington, D.C., where she worked for decades at the State Department and the Department of Labor, earning a law degree at night from Georgetown University along the way. Then the social upheavals of the 1970s arrived, the soldier-turned-bureaucrat-turned-lawyer helped found one of America\xe2\x80\x99s most enduring mass movements, establishing an annual protest march that continues to the present day.'b'That protest is the March for Life, the annual rally against Roe v. Wade.'b'When she organized the first march, in January 1974, it drew 20,000 anti-abortion marchers to the capital. On Friday, 40 years after Roe and six months after Gray\xe2\x80\x99s death at the age of 88, the marchers numbered in the tens or even hundreds of thousands.'b'If she had chosen a different political cause, Gray\xe2\x80\x99s trajectory \xe2\x80\x94 from soldier to working woman to professional activist \xe2\x80\x94 would be a case study for students of second-wave feminism. But the cause she did choose \xe2\x80\x94 and in whose service she issued strident attacks on \xe2\x80\x9cfeminist abortionists\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 has endured precisely because it has had a more complicated relationship to female advancement than some cultural stereotypes would suggest.'b'Those stereotypes link the anti-abortion cause to traditionalist ideas about gender roles \xe2\x80\x94 to the belief that a woman\xe2\x80\x99s place is in the home, or at least that her primary identity should be maternal rather than professional. Writing in the Reagan era, the sociologist Kristin Luker argued that this dimension of the debate trumped the question of whether unborn human life has rights: \xe2\x80\x9cWhile on the surface it is the embryo\xe2\x80\x99s fate that seems to be at stake, the abortion debate is actually about the meaning of 'b'women\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'lives.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This remains a dominant pro-choice understanding of the abortion conflict \xe2\x80\x94 and not without reason, since it finds vindication to this day in the idiot \xe2\x80\x9cmansplaining\xe2\x80\x9d of amateur gynecologists like Todd Akin.'b'But such an understanding was too simplistic when Nellie Gray founded the March for Life, and it\xe2\x80\x99s grown steadily less compelling with time. As 'b'Jon Shields'b' of Claremont McKenna College pointed out last year, pro-life sentiment has been steady over the last four decades even as opposition to women in the work force (or the military, or the White House) has largely collapsed. Most anti-abortion Americans today are also gender egalitarians: indeed, Shields notes, pro-life attitudes toward women\xe2\x80\x99s professional advancement have converged so quickly with pro-choice attitudes that \xe2\x80\x9cthe average moderately pro-life citizen is a stronger supporter of gender equality than even the typical strongly pro-choice citizen was in the early 1980s.\xe2\x80\x9d Among the younger generation, any \xe2\x80\x9cdivide over women\xe2\x80\x99s roles nearly disappears entirely.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The pro-life cause has proved unexpectedly resilient, in other words, not because millions of Americans are nostalgists for a world of stricter gender norms, but because they have convinced themselves that the opportunities the feminist revolution won for women can be sustained 'b'without'b' unrestricted access to abortion.'b'This conviction is crucial to understanding why opinion on abortion has been a persistent exception to the liberalizing cultural trends that have brought us gay marriage, medical marijuana and now women in combat. It helps explain, too, why public opinion on the issue doesn\xe2\x80\x99t break down along the gendered lines that many liberals expect \xe2\x80\x94 why more women than men, for instance, told the latest 'b'Pew survey'b' that abortion was \xe2\x80\x9cmorally wrong\xe2\x80\x9d and (in smaller numbers) that Roe should be overturned.'b'It also has long-term implications for how the abortion debate plays out. The best way to argue with a Todd Akin is to dismiss him as a chauvinist, a creep and the enemy of a more enlightened future. But the best pro-choice rebuttal to the young idealists at the March for Life or the 'b'professional women'b' who 'b'lead today\xe2\x80\x99s anti-abortion groups'b' isn\xe2\x80\x99t that they\xe2\x80\x99re too reactionary \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s that they\xe2\x80\x99re too utopian, too radical, too na\xc3\xafve.'b'This means that the abortion rights movement, once utopian in its own fashion, is now at its most effective when it speaks the language of necessary evils, warning Americans that while it might be pretty to think so, the equality they take for granted simply can\xe2\x80\x99t be separated from a practice they find troubling.'b'For its part, if the pro-life movement wants not only to endure but to triumph, then it needs an answer to this argument. That means something more than just a defense of a universal right to life. It means a realist\xe2\x80\x99s explanation of how, in policy and culture, the feminist revolution could be reformed without being repealed.'b'MEETING Simon for the first time was one of the most sublime experiences I\xe2\x80\x99ve had. With every coy head nod, casual hand wave and deep eye gaze, I felt he already knew me.'b'Simon is a humanoid robot being developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology for the purposes of exploring intuitive ways for people and machines to live and work alongside one another. I had designed the robot\xe2\x80\x99s shell \xe2\x80\x94 its outward appearance \xe2\x80\x94 so I knew exactly what to expect, but interacting with it as a programmed and somewhat sentient creature surprised me in ways I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t expected.'b'Simon understood spoken sentences and used social skills to respond appropriately. If it didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand a certain request, it raised its arms in an apparent plea for forgiveness or tilted its head to express confusion. Its ears lit up when it recognized a color, and it spoke back to me when I was finished talking.'b'Simon, a research effort and not meant to be sold, is part of a growing collection of social robots that can essentially see, hear, feel and react through humanlike sound and movement. Our future may not match our sci-fi fantasies of androids with limbs, torsos and expressive faces meandering around our rooms to pick up clothes and mix cocktails, but robots are entering our homes in subtle ways, through countertop appliances, hand-held tools and wearable gadgets that display specialized and isolated robotic behaviors.'b'YOUR coffee maker or camera may already have some of these elements, responding automatically to shut themselves off or follow a sequence of timed commands (wait 30 seconds, take a picture; at 6 a.m. start brewing, etc.) and the next generation of products will be only more sophisticated in this regard.'b'Whereas designers typically use form, color and materials to make an object express some human element (a drill handle may have a pattern that looks aggressive, a toaster might have knobs and dials that seem friendly), we\xe2\x80\x99re entering a time when sound, light and movement are equally important parts of the creative palette. Everyday objects whose expressive elements have long been static will now glow, sing, vibrate and change position at the drop of a hat.'b'The behaviors of these future robotic objects may be utilitarian, like a lamp that bends to follow the items you reposition on a desk, or they may provide feedback, like'b' a fork that vibrates 'b'when you\xe2\x80\x99re eating too fast. They won\xe2\x80\x99t require you to press a sequence of buttons to make things happen, but they will work alongside you in unobtrusive ways, responding to caresses, waves or verbal commands. Some might just sit back and observe you to understand what you need.'b'A robotic cutting board might guide you while you cook and offer helpful tips when your knife skills aren\xe2\x80\x99t up to par. Many products will be connected to the Internet, with access to what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the larger world. A raincoat might glow or whistle when it knows you\xe2\x80\x99ll need it on your commute. Many webcams used for video conferencing already raise their heads to let you know when someone is ready on the other side of a conversation and soon during a chat they will mimic your body\xe2\x80\x99s movements to help express your point to a friend across the globe. A medicine bottle might open its lid to offer you a precise dose or automatically call your pharmacist when it\xe2\x80\x99s empty.'b'Washing machines will text or call you when your laundry is done. Robotic appliances will become ever more energy-conscious \xe2\x80\x94 many automated thermostats already adjust themselves appropriately, combining knowledge of their users\xe2\x80\x99 patterns with information about how to conserve energy.'b'As products become smarter, their behaviors will mean they essentially have continuing conversations with us, whether they include verbal exchanges or not. Just like we read subtle cues from our pets (we see a dog\xe2\x80\x99s ears and believe that he feels sad, guilty or excited), we\xe2\x80\x99ll read emotion from our products, perceiving nuances of dialogue and a sense that the object is \xe2\x80\x9calive.\xe2\x80\x9d For example, colored lights on a robotic vacuum cleaner will tell us what\xe2\x80\x99s going on inside: green, slow pulsing indicates \xe2\x80\x9cAll systems go!\xe2\x80\x9d; rapid red flashing pleads \xe2\x80\x9cHelp! Something is amiss here.\xe2\x80\x9d A jubilant melody at the end of a washing machine cycle says, \xe2\x80\x9cEverything went well and your clothes are ready!\xe2\x80\x9d When a video conferencing webcam in an office lowers its head, it\xe2\x80\x99s saying: \xe2\x80\x9cBye! Going to sleep now.\xe2\x80\x9d These animated behaviors blend together and it\xe2\x80\x99s human nature to read them as emanating from a living entity.'b'Through their personalities, these objects will offer us emotional value along with other features. Siri, the iPhone speech recognition search engine, has already won the hearts of many by displaying a consistent, witty personality with which people can converse. 'b'Autom'b', a new countertop weight-loss product, was created by researchers who learned that a robotic coach with expressive eyes and face was more effective at keeping dieters eating better and exercising more because the emotional bond was created.'b'Even robots with minimal expressions, like the 'b'Roomba'b' floor cleaner, have led people to treat them as living entities, bestowing names on them and perceiving moments of celebration and even guilt. Researchers at Georgia Tech have found that this emotional connection leads people to feel empathy for the product, making them much more accepting of mechanical flaws that would otherwise be seen as a nuisance.'b'Browsing Amazon.com reviews of the Roomba reveals just how compelling this sense of life is: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have named our new Roomba Rosie. She is my new best friend. I vacuumed with my 15-year-old Kirby before letting Rosie do her thing...She is wonderful. Most of my furniture is too heavy to move each week. She cleaned under those pieces and I was amazed at what she picked up.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When working for the firm Smart Design, designing a floor-cleaning robot for a company called Neato Robotics, I studied research that had been conducted around the Roomba and knew that shaping the vacuum\xe2\x80\x99s personality would be as important in building a positive relationship between product and owner as any other element. To do that, my team and I dissected typical service personalities, like the hotel maid you never see, the chatty bartender and the proper nanny. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich of these should this vacuum be?\xe2\x80\x9d we wondered.'b'I also asked the team to break down the product\xe2\x80\x99s behavior into critical \xe2\x80\x9cmoments\xe2\x80\x9d for personality definition. With people, we know that a person\xe2\x80\x99s true character is revealed during moments of extremes \xe2\x80\x94 both negative (stress, anger, fear) and positive (pride, jubilation, satisfaction). To define the robot\xe2\x80\x99s character, we identified the extremes and then created a language of expression that combined light patterns, a sound palette and choreographed movements.'b'For example, getting stuck under the couch would be a moment of distress, as would its batteries running low. Completely cleaning a room\xe2\x80\x99s carpet might be a moment of jubilation. We wanted to define exactly what the robot would do at these moments. What sounds should it make? How should it move? Just as we might work with a color or material specialist in a traditional product, here we worked with a music composer to create a palette of sounds.'b'While the idea of charming entities all around us, guiding us through everyday tasks and reminding us to do things throughout the day may seem benign, some experts raise concerns about the implications of robots in our daily lives. Once designers can perfect the art of manipulation, manufacturers can use this power to entice people to adopt behaviors that may not be in their best interest. There could be, for instance, a robot that tempts you to buy more unhealthy food or buy a lottery ticket.'b'In addition, there are many security concerns around robotic objects, especially when they are mobile and in the intimate space of the home. For example, what happens when your products get hacked in a nefarious scheme to allow a criminal to see inside your house or, worse, when they are hacked to manipulate a person to behave in a way that he otherwise wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have?'b'Despite the potential risks, the future will be rich with sensor-based, animated objects using expressive sound, light, motion and screens to praise, encourage, advise and comfort us. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have fun with TVs and music players that reposition themselves in response to our dance moves, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be relieved of chores by robots that pick up our crumbs and scrub the floors, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll stay fit with robotic parasites that curl around our wrists to take health stats and exhort us to get off the couch.'b'With this throng of sentient objects in our lives, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to negotiate a whole new set of relationships. Will we adore our new products as if they were pets, doting on them and anticipating their greetings? Or will all this lively communication create an annoying cacophony of gadgets? My hope is for the former, but it will depend on the designers\xe2\x80\x99 ability to devise interactions that consider emotional value as important as any other product attribute. If designed well, these mechanical creatures, like my robotic pal Simon, can tug at our heartstrings in a new way.'b'SAN DIEGO'b'IN November I quit my job as the editor of Wired to run 3D Robotics, the San Diego-based drone company I started with a partner as a side project three years ago. We make autopilot technology and small aircraft \xe2\x80\x94 both planes and multirotor copters \xe2\x80\x94 that can fly by themselves. The drones, which sell for a few hundred bucks, are for civilians: they don\xe2\x80\x99t shoot anything but photographs and videos. And they\xe2\x80\x99re incredibly fun to build (which we do with the ample help of robots). It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a hard decision to give up publishing for this.'b'But my company, like many manufacturers, is faced with a familiar challenge: its main competitors are Chinese companies that have the dual advantages of cheap labor and top-notch engineering. So, naturally, when we were raising a round of investment financing last year, venture capitalists demanded a plausible explanation for how our little start-up could beat its Chinese rivals. The answer was as much a surprise to the investors as it had been to me a few years earlier: 'b'Mexico'b'. In particular, Tijuana.'b'Like many Americans, until recently, when I heard \xe2\x80\x9cTijuana\xe2\x80\x9d I thought only of drug cartels and cheap tequila. \xe2\x80\x9cTJ,\xe2\x80\x9d though, is a city of more than two million people (larger than neighboring San Diego), and it has become North America\xe2\x80\x99s electronics assembly hot spot: most of the flat-screen TVs sold in the United States, from companies like Samsung and Sony, are made there, along with everything from medical devices to aerospace parts. Jordi Mu\xc3\xb1oz, the smart young guy who had taught me about drones and then started 3D Robotics with me, is from TJ \xe2\x80\x94 and he persuaded me to build a second factory there to supplement the work we were doing in San Diego.'b'Shuttling between the two factories \xe2\x80\x94 in San Diego, where we engineer our drones, and in TJ, where we assemble them \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99m reminded of a similar experience I had a decade earlier. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, I lived in Hong Kong (working for The Economist) and saw how that city was paired with the \xe2\x80\x9cspecial economic zone\xe2\x80\x9d of Shenzhen across the border on the Chinese mainland in Guangdong Province. Together, the two created a world-beating manufacturing hub: business, design and finance in Hong Kong, manufacturing in Shenzhen. The clear division of labor between the two became a model for modern China.'b'Today, what Shenzhen is to Hong Kong, Tijuana is becoming to San Diego. You can drive from our San Diego engineering center to our Tijuana factory in 20 minutes, no passport required. (A passport is needed to come back, but there are fast-track lanes for business people.) Some of our employees commute across the border each day; good doctors are cheaper and easier to find in TJ, as are private schools, although it\xe2\x80\x99s generally nicer to live in San Diego. In some ways, the border feels more like the notional borders of the European Union than a divide between the developed and developing worlds.'b'And it\xe2\x80\x99s not just TJ. To the east, in Ju\xc3\xa1rez, Dell computers are built by 'b'Foxconn'b', the company that manufactures more than 40 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s electronics (including Apple\xe2\x80\x99s iPhone and iPad). To the south, in Quer\xc3\xa9taro, a factory builds the transmissions that General Motors installs in its Corvettes. The design of General Electric\xe2\x80\x99s GEnx turbine jet engine and the production of interior elements of Boeing\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'787 Dreamliner'b' also happen in Mexico. Manufactured goods are the country\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'chief export'b', with private investment in this sector among the highest in the world.'b'The notion that Mexico offers only cheap labor is just plain off the mark. Mexico graduates some 'b'115,000 engineering students'b' per year \xe2\x80\x94 roughly three times as many as the U.S. on a per-capita basis. One result is that some machine specialists are typically easier to find in TJ than in many big American cities. So, for that matter, are accountants experienced in production economics and other highly skilled workers.'b'What all these pieces add up to is a model \xe2\x80\x94 one that might hold the long-sought answer for how American manufacturers can compete with those in China, India and the next generation of economic powerhouses. That\xe2\x80\x99s because the TJ template isn\xe2\x80\x99t so much about outsourcing as it is quicksourcing. And that\xe2\x80\x99s also the way to create thousands of good jobs in the United States.'b'As any entrepreneur can tell you, the shorter and more nimble a supply chain is, the better.'b'First, a shorter supply chain means that a company can make things when it wants to, instead of solely when it has to. Strange as it may seem, many small manufacturers don\xe2\x80\x99t have that option. When we started 3D, we produced everything in China and needed to order in units of thousands to get good pricing. That meant that we had to write big checks to make big batches of goods \xe2\x80\x94 money we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see again until all those products sold, sometimes a year or more later. Now that we carry out our production locally, we\xe2\x80\x99re able to make only what we need that week.'b'Second, there\xe2\x80\x99s less risk. If we make an error in a design, we\xe2\x80\x99ve wasted at most a few days\xe2\x80\x99 worth of production. If there\xe2\x80\x99s something wrong in the production process itself, we can spot it fast. We control the component inventory, so we can see what\xe2\x80\x99s going into our goods and know that we\xe2\x80\x99re not being ripped off with used or pirated parts. And if we want to protect our intellectual property, we can do so without having to trust that other companies will uphold our interests above all others. And that\xe2\x80\x99s saying nothing about political risk, environmental risk or P.R. risk, all of which companies like Apple and Walmart have learned about in China the hard way.'b'Third, it\xe2\x80\x99s simply faster. We still order some parts from China, and even though we use FedEx, it always seems to take weeks, and sometimes months, longer than we\xe2\x80\x99d planned. That\xe2\x80\x99s not a criticism of China; it\xe2\x80\x99s merely intrinsic to any arm\xe2\x80\x99s-length relationship between small buyers and big makers. If we were Apple, we\xe2\x80\x99d get overnight service. But we\xe2\x80\x99re not, so we wait.'b'Finally, a short supply chain is an incentive to innovate. If you\xe2\x80\x99re outsourcing the manufacturing of huge parcels of a product, you can\xe2\x80\x99t change that product until you\xe2\x80\x99ve sold all the ones you\xe2\x80\x99ve already made (at least not if you want to stay in business). So that often means sitting on your hands, waiting for Version 1 to sell out before starting to make Version 2. But when you\xe2\x80\x99re doing just-in-time manufacturing, you can change the product every day if you want \xe2\x80\x94 whether to take advantage of some better or cheaper component or to improve the design.'b'In the land of the long supply chain, meanwhile, things are changing, too. Inflation-adjusted labor costs in China have more than tripled in the past decade. Wages in China\xe2\x80\x99s southern cities are approaching $6 an hour, roughly what they are'b' in Mexico'b'.'b'Whether factors like these are enough to turn American businesses from outsourcers to quicksourcers remains an open question. But I\xe2\x80\x99m betting my money that they will. The sense of possibility I felt when I first crossed from Hong Kong to Shenzhen in 1997 is what I now feel when I cross from San Diego to Tijuana. The trade routes of the 21st century don\xe2\x80\x99t have to follow Marco Polo from West to East. Indeed, in the new manufacturing landscape, the routes don\xe2\x80\x99t have to take you far at all.'b'In the face of sanctions, North Korea has threatened \xe2\x80\x9call-out\xe2\x80\x9d action on its \xe2\x80\x9csworn enemy\xe2\x80\x9d the United States.'b'BELLAIRE, Tex.'b'I AM a New England liberal, born and bred. I have lived most of my life in the Northeast \xe2\x80\x94 Boston, New York and Philadelphia \xe2\x80\x94 and my politics are devoutly Democratic. In three decades, I have voted for a Republican exactly once, holding my nose, in a mayoral election in which the Democratic candidate seemed mentally unbalanced.'b'I am also a Texas resident and a gun owner. I have half a dozen pistols in my safe, all semiautomatics, the largest capable of holding 20 rounds. I go to the range at least once a week, have applied for a concealed carry license and am planning to take a tactical training course in the spring. I\xe2\x80\x99m currently shopping for a shotgun, either a Remington 'b'870 Express Tactical'b' or a 'b'Mossberg 500 Flex'b' with a pistol grip and adjustable stock.'b'Except for shotguns (firing one feels like being punched by a prizefighter), I enjoy shooting. At the range where I practice, most of the staff knows me by sight if not by name. I\xe2\x80\x99m the guy in the metrosexual eyeglasses and Ralph Lauren polo, and I ask a lot of questions: What\xe2\x80\x99s the best way to maintain my sight picture with both eyes open? How do I clear a stove-piped round?'b'There is pleasure to be had in exercising one\xe2\x80\x99s rights, learning something new in midlife and mastering the operation of a complex tool, which is one thing a gun is. But I won\xe2\x80\x99t deny the seductive psychological power that firearms possess. I grew up playing shooting games, pretending to be Starsky or Hutch or one of the patrolmen on \xe2\x80\x9cAdam-12,\xe2\x80\x9d the two most boring TV cops in history.'b'A prevailing theory holds that boys are simultaneously aware of their own physical powerlessness and society\xe2\x80\x99s mandate that they serve as protectors of the innocent. Pretending to shoot a bad guy assuages this anxiety, which never goes away completely. This explanation makes sense to me. Another word for it is catharsis, and you could say that, as a novelist, I\xe2\x80\x99ve made my living from it.'b'There are a lot of reasons that a gun feels right in my hand, but I also own firearms to protect my family. I hope I never have to use one for this purpose, and I doubt I ever will. But I am my family\xe2\x80\x99s last line of defense. I have chosen to meet this responsibility, in part, by being armed. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a choice I made lightly. I am aware that, statistically speaking, a gun in the home represents a far greater danger to its inhabitants than to an intruder. But not every choice we make is data-driven. A lot comes from the gut.'b'Apart from the ones in policemen\xe2\x80\x99s holsters, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I saw a working firearm until the year after college, when a friend\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend, after four cosmopolitans, decided to show off the .38 revolver she kept in her purse. (Half the party guests dived for cover, including me.)'b'It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until my mid-40s that my education in guns began, in the course of writing a novel in which pistols, shotguns and rifles, but also heavy weaponry like the AR-15 and its military analogue, the M-16, were widely used. I suspected that much of the gunplay I\xe2\x80\x99d witnessed in movies and television was completely wrong (it is) and hired an instructor for a daylong private lesson \xe2\x80\x9cto shoot everything in the store.\xe2\x80\x9d The gentleman who met me at the range was someone whom I would have called \xe2\x80\x9ca gun nut.\xe2\x80\x9d A former New Yorker, he had relocated to Texas because of its lax gun laws and claimed to keep a pistol within arm\xe2\x80\x99s reach even when he showered. He was perfect, in other words, for my purpose.'b'My relationship to firearms might have ended there, if not for a coincidence of weather. Everybody remembers Hurricane Katrina; fewer recall Hurricane Rita, an even more intense storm that headed straight for Houston less than a month later. My wife and I arranged to stay at a friend\xe2\x80\x99s house in Austin, packed up the kids and dog, and headed out of town \xe2\x80\x94 or tried to. As many as 3.7 million people had the same idea, making Rita one of the largest evacuations in history, with predictable results.'b'By 2 in the morning, after six hours on the road, we had made it all of 50 miles. The scene was like a snapshot from the Apocalypse: crowds milling restlessly, gas stations and mini-marts picked clean and heaped with trash, families sleeping by the side of the road. The situation had the hopped-up feel of barely bottled chaos. After Katrina, nobody had any illusions that help was on its way. It also occurred to me that there were probably a lot of guns out there \xe2\x80\x94 this was Texas, after all. Here I was with two tiny children, a couple of thousand dollars in cash, a late-model S.U.V. with half a tank of gas and not so much as a heavy book to throw. When my wife wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me get out of the car so the dog could do his business, that was it for me. We jumped the median, turned around, and were home in under an hour.'b'As it happened, Rita made a last-minute turn away from Houston. But what if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t? I believe people are basically good, but not all of them and not all the time. Like most citizens of our modern, technological world, I am wholly reliant upon a fragile web of services to meet my most basic needs. What would happen if those services collapsed? Chaos, that\xe2\x80\x99s what.'b'IT didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen overnight, but before too long my Northeastern liberal sensibilities, while intact on other issues, had shifted on the question of gun ownership. For my first pistol I selected a little Walther .380. I shot it enough to decide it was junk, upgraded to a full-size Springfield 9-millimeter, liked it but wanted something with a thumb safety, found a nice Smith &amp; Wesson subcompact that fit the bill, but along the way got a little bit of a gun-crush on the Beretta M-9 \xe2\x80\x94 and so on.'b'Lots of people on both sides of the aisle own firearms, or don\xe2\x80\x99t, for reasons that supersede their broader political and cultural affiliations. Let me be clear: my personal armory notwithstanding, I think guns are woefully under-regulated. It\xe2\x80\x99s far too easy to buy a gun \xe2\x80\x94 I once bought one in a parking lot \xe2\x80\x94 and I loathe the National Rifle Association. Some of the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s proposals strike me as more symbolic than effective, with some 300 million firearms on the loose. But the White House\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations seem like a good starting point and nothing that would prevent me from protecting my family in a crisis. The AR-15 is a fascinating weapon, and, frankly, a gas to shoot. So is a tank, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to own a tank.'b'Alas, the days of \xc3\xa0 la carte politics like mine seem over, if they ever even existed. The bigger culprit is the far right and the lunatic pronouncements of those like Rush Limbaugh. But in the weeks since Newtown, I\xe2\x80\x99ve watched my Facebook feed, which is dominated by my coastal friends, fill up with anti-gun dispatches that seemed divorced from reality. I agree it would be nice if the world had exactly zero guns in it. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t see that happening, and calling gun owners \xe2\x80\x9ca bunch of inbred rednecks\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do much to advance rational discussion.'b'Thus, my secret life \xe2\x80\x94 though I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s not such a secret anymore. My wife is afraid of my guns (though she also says she\xe2\x80\x99s glad I have them). My 16-year-old daughter is a different story. The week before her fall semester exams, we allowed her to skip school for a day, a tradition in our house. The rule is, she gets to do whatever she wants. This time, she asked to take a pistol lesson. She\xe2\x80\x99s an NPR listener like me, but she\xe2\x80\x99s also grown up in Texas, and the fact that one in five American women is a victim of sexual assault is not lost on her. In the windowless classroom off the range, the instructor ran her through the basics, demonstrating with a Glock 9-millimeter: how to hold it, load it, pull back the slide.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll probably have trouble with that part,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of the women do.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh really?\xe2\x80\x9d my daughter replied, and with a cagey smile proceeded to rack her weapon with such authority you could have heard it in the parking lot.'b'A proud-papa moment? I confess it was.'b'Republicans have a problem. For years they could shout down any attempt to point out the extent to which their policies favored the elite over the poor and the middle class; all they had to do was yell \xe2\x80\x9cClass warfare!\xe2\x80\x9d and Democrats scurried away. In the 2012 election, however, that didn\xe2\x80\x99t work: the picture of the G.O.P. as the party of sneering plutocrats stuck, even as Democrats became more openly populist than they have been in decades.'b'As a result, prominent Republicans have begun acknowledging that their party needs to improve its image. But here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing: Their proposals for a makeover all involve changing the sales pitch rather than the product. When it comes to substance, the G.O.P. is more committed than ever to policies that take from most Americans and give to a wealthy handful.'b'Consider, as a case in point, how a widely reported 'b'recent speech by Bobby Jindal'b' the governor of Louisiana, compares with his actual policies.'b'Mr. Jindal posed the problem in a way that would, I believe, have been unthinkable for a leading Republican even a year ago. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must not,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared, \xe2\x80\x9cbe the party that simply protects the well off so they can keep their toys. We have to be the party that shows all Americans how they can thrive.\xe2\x80\x9d After a campaign in which Mitt Romney denounced any attempt to talk about class divisions as an 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cattack on success,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' this represents a major rhetorical shift.'b'But Mr. Jindal didn\xe2\x80\x99t offer any suggestions about how Republicans might demonstrate that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t just about letting the rich keep their toys, other than claiming even more loudly that their policies are good for everyone.'b'Meanwhile, back in Louisiana Mr. Jindal is pushing 'b'a plan to eliminate the state\xe2\x80\x99s income tax'b', which falls most heavily on the affluent, and make up for the lost revenue by raising sales taxes, which fall much more heavily on the poor and the middle class. The result would be big gains for the top 1 percent, substantial losses for the bottom 60 percent. Similar plans are being pushed by a number of 'b'other Republican governors'b' as well.'b'Like the new acknowledgment that the perception of being the party of the rich is a problem, this represents a departure for the G.O.P. \xe2\x80\x94 but in the opposite direction. In the past, Republicans would justify tax cuts for the rich either by claiming that they would pay for themselves or by claiming that they could make up for lost revenue by cutting wasteful spending. But what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing now is open, explicit reverse Robin Hoodism: taking from ordinary families and giving to the rich. That is, even as Republicans look for a way to sound more sympathetic and less extreme, their actual policies are taking another sharp right turn.'b'Why is this happening? In particular, why is it happening now, just after an election in which the G.O.P. paid a price for its anti-populist stand?'b'Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a full answer, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand the extent to which leading Republicans live in an intellectual bubble. They get their news from Fox and other captive media, they get their policy analysis from billionaire-financed right-wing think tanks, and they\xe2\x80\x99re often blissfully unaware both of contrary evidence and of how their positions sound to outsiders.'b'So when Mr. Romney made his infamous \xe2\x80\x9c47 percent\xe2\x80\x9d remarks, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, in his own mind, saying anything outrageous or even controversial. He was just repeating a view that has become increasingly dominant inside the right-wing bubble, namely that a large and ever-growing proportion of Americans won\xe2\x80\x99t take responsibility for their own lives and are mooching off the hard-working wealthy. Rising unemployment claims demonstrate laziness, not lack of jobs; rising disability claims represent malingering, not the real health problems of an aging work force.'b'And given that worldview, Republicans see it as entirely appropriate to cut taxes on the rich while making everyone else pay more.'b'Now, national politicians learned last year that this kind of talk plays badly with the public, so they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to obscure their positions. Paul Ryan, for example, has lately made a transparently dishonest attempt to claim that when he spoke 'b'about \xe2\x80\x9ctakers\xe2\x80\x9d'b' living off the efforts of the \xe2\x80\x9cmakers\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 at one point he assigned 60 percent of Americans to the taker category \xe2\x80\x94 he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t talking about people receiving Social Security and Medicare. (He was.)'b'But in deep red states like Louisiana or Kansas, Republicans are much freer to act on their beliefs \xe2\x80\x94 which means moving strongly to comfort the comfortable while afflicting the afflicted.'b'Which brings me back to Mr. Jindal, who declared in his speech that \xe2\x80\x9cwe are a populist party.\xe2\x80\x9d No, you aren\xe2\x80\x99t. You\xe2\x80\x99re a party that holds a large proportion of Americans in contempt. And the public may have figured that out.'b'WITH its 'b'ambitious proposal'b' to pay doctors in public hospitals based on the quality of their work \xe2\x80\x94 not the number of tests they order, pills they prescribe or procedures they perform \xe2\x80\x94 New York City has hopped aboard the biggest bandwagon in health care. Pay for performance, or P4P in the jargon, is embraced by right and left. It has long been the favorite egghead prescription for our absurdly overpriced, underperforming health care system. The logic seems unassailable: Reward quality, and you will get quality. Stop rewarding waste, and you will get less waste. QED! P4P!'b'If only it worked.'b'For if you spend a little time with the P4P skeptics \xe2\x80\x94 a data-bearing minority among physicians and health economists \xe2\x80\x94 you will come away full of doubts. In practice, pay for performance does little to improve outcomes or to control costs. But if you look hard enough at why this common-sense approach doesn\xe2\x80\x99t deliver, you find some clues to what might.'b'The New York plan would give hospitals bonuses to distribute to their doctors based on such indicators as patient satisfaction, speeding the flow of cases through the system and administering specific therapies. It is an attempt to get ahead of the federal law we all know as Obamacare, which includes rewards for hospitals that peg pay to a list of quality metrics. I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before that I consider 'b'Obamacare an important leap forward'b', mainly for extending the basic safety net to millions of Americans. And there are aspects of the law, notably the Medicare Independent Payment Advisory Board, that may help bring down costs, if Congress can resist the temptation to interfere. But the pay-for-performance provisions are a triumph of theory over experience.'b'The first problem with P4P is that it does not address the biggest problem. 'b'Americans spend more'b' than twice as much per capita as other developed countries on health care \xe2\x80\x94 a crippling 18 percent of the country\xe2\x80\x99s economic output, and growing. Before studying the statistics, I assumed the root of the problem was doctors who, paid piecemeal for the services they provide, load up patients with marginal tests and treatments. In fact, America\xe2\x80\x99s health care system is not much different from other developed countries in the volume of service. Our doctors prescribe more or less the same number of pills and X-rays, perform similar numbers of blood tests and surgeries, as doctors in the best European countries. While there are undoubtedly savings to be had by cutting unnecessary services (shortening hospital stays, for example), the main problem is that our system charges far more for each service \xe2\x80\x94 each office visit, each hip replacement, each day in a hospital bed, each dose of antibiotic. \xe2\x80\x9cThe facile explanation is that doctors do too much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter Bach, a doctor at Memorial Sloan-Kettering who studies quality of cancer care. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if you compare us to other countries on volume, we\xe2\x80\x99re not leading in any category. The flip side is, we pay double for a lot of stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d (Actually, we lead in tonsillectomies and knee replacements, but his point is generally right.)'b'Doctors cite a number of reasons our medical treatments cost more \xe2\x80\x94 the high price of malpractice insurance being a favorite, and genuine, culprit. But the main reason everything costs less in other countries is that other countries tend to have one big payer \xe2\x80\x94 usually the government \xe2\x80\x94 with the clout to bargain down prices. A single-payer system has, so far, proven politically unpalatable in this country. And even Medicare, which has the power of scale and uses it to drive down prices, wields its power sparingly, because doctors threaten to stop serving Medicare patients if the reimbursements fall too low. As hospitals merge into mightier megachains, they may be able to bargain down the payments to doctors and drug companies and device-makers, and create economies of scale by standardizing treatments. (The physician and New Yorker writer 'b'Atul Gawande proposed'b' in a provocative August article that hospitals could drastically improve productivity by studying the example of restaurant chains like the Cheesecake Factory.) But that\xe2\x80\x99s not what P4P is about.'b'Instead of leverage, P4P employs incentives. Reduce the length of stay for acute-care patients, cut the rate of readmission for pneumonia cases, make sure heart-attack victims get a talk about diet before they are discharged, and you stand to find a little windfall in your paycheck.'b'Critics, who have evidence from a host of pilot programs, say that the bonuses are typically too small to change behavior; New York\xe2\x80\x99s would be a maximum of 2.5 percent of a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s salary, and most P4P programs pay less than that. Often the performance indicators measure things that are not within the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s control. Luis Marcos, a former president of the agency that runs New York\xe2\x80\x99s public hospitals, plucked several examples from the list of 13 metrics proposed for New York. Reducing waits in the emergency room (No. 4) is a worthy goal, he said, but it depends on a whole cast of people, from the clerk who greets the patient to the orderly who makes the bed ready. Shortening hospital stays (No. 13) requires having someone in the community \xe2\x80\x94 family, a social worker \xe2\x80\x94 to receive the patient; that\xe2\x80\x99s an especially hard requirement for hospitals that treat a lot of low-income or homeless people.'b'Another problem with P4P is that providers learn how to manipulate the results. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce you define performance, people manage toward those metrics and neglect other things that don\xe2\x80\x99t get counted,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Princeton health economist Uwe Reinhardt, who writes for The Times\xe2\x80\x99s Economix blog. New York doctors have a favorite, possibly apocryphal, story of medical providers gaming the system: Miami hospitals that use patient feedback as a performance measure wait until spring to do their surveys, because that\xe2\x80\x99s when the cranky, hard-to-please New Yorkers go home from their winter refuge.'b'Ashish Jha, a doctor at the Harvard School of Public Health, argues that P4P might get results if the incentive payments to hospitals were substantially bigger, the formulas were simplified and the performance indicators were kept to a few, clear measures that doctors and patients agree matter: mortality rates, infection rates, recurrence of heart attacks. \xe2\x80\x9cIf hospitals achieve great outcomes, it matters little how they did so,\xe2\x80\x9d Jha wrote in the latest Journal of the American Medical Association. And death rates are harder to game than administrative procedures.'b'Jha also proposes a little experiment in behavioral psychology: give hospitals 100 percent of the bonus at the beginning of the year, but require them to send a refund at the end of the year to pay for any shortcomings. Givebacks really focus the mind.'b'PETER PRONOVOST, a physician and professor at Johns Hopkins, says that rather than bribe doctors to adopt better practices, we should play to doctors\xe2\x80\x99 professionalism. Pronovost is famous for a scheme that drastically reduced infections associated with catheters by disseminating to doctors and nurses a simple, five-point operating-room checklist of reminders: Wash your hands, wear a sterile mask, etc. No pay incentives were involved, just an appeal to professional pride \xe2\x80\x94 and, later, public reporting of the results. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out economic incentives,\xe2\x80\x9d Pronovost told me. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you can do a lot just working with professional norms.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Pronovost has a more radical piece of common sense to offer. He proposes that the United States create an agency that would do for medicine what the Securities and Exchange Commission does for securities markets: compile and audit information about the performance of hospitals, and make it public. Rankings of hospitals now come either from news organizations or consumer groups working with untested and inconsistent data, or they are propaganda produced by medical providers themselves. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are stronger regulations about what a company can say about toothpaste than what a hospital can claim about quality,\xe2\x80\x9d Pronovost said.'b'For image-conscious doctors and hospitals, pride and shame might be the most effective kind of carrots and sticks.'b'Gov. Andrew Cuomo negotiated a package of criminal justice changes with the Legislature 'b'last winter'b' that broadly expanded New York State\xe2\x80\x99s DNA database by requiring all convicts to submit a DNA sample. Disappointingly, the measure did not include other important fixes that would further strengthen law enforcement\xe2\x80\x99s ability to exonerate the innocent and convict the guilty.'b'Mr. Cuomo pledged to revisit the issue and is now doing so. In his 'b'State of the State'b' speech, he said he would press the Assembly and the Senate this year to address two of the biggest causes of wrongful convictions: false confessions and witness misidentification.'b'Building on recommendations by the Innocence Project and a special task force created by the state\xe2\x80\x99s chief judge, Jonathan Lippman, Mr. Cuomo would require the police to videotape interrogations of people charged with serious crimes, including homicides, kidnapping and violent sex offenses \xe2\x80\x94 a step that would bring New York in line with 18 states and the District of Columbia.'b'New York City\xe2\x80\x99s police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, has begun to put such a policy in place. This is a positive step, but it does not relieve Albany of the responsibility to establish uniform and enforceable statewide standards.'b'Mr. Cuomo is also calling for improvements in eyewitness identification. The goal is to make lineups and photographs of suspects less susceptible to the subjective judgment of the enforcement personnel involved.'b'A lot will depend on how hard Mr. Cuomo fights for these ideas. But he is heading in the right direction.'b'By including gay rights in the arc of the struggle for civil rights \xe2\x80\x94 the road \xe2\x80\x9cthrough Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 President Obama linked his presidency to ending antigay discrimination and underscored the legal wrong of denying gay people the freedom to marry.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOur journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama famously said in 'b'his second Inaugural Address'b', \xe2\x80\x9cfor if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Now that Mr. Obama has declared that he believes denying gay people the right to wed is not only unfair and morally wrong but also legally unsupportable, the urgent question is how he will translate his words into action. To start, he should have his solicitor general file a brief 'b'in the Proposition 8 case being argued before the Supreme Court'b' in March, saying that California\xe2\x80\x99s voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional.'b'Just a day after the inauguration, Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman, Jay Carney, said that while Mr. Obama supports same-sex marriage as a policy matter, the president still believes it is an issue for individual states to decide. That was Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s formulation when 'b'he first announced his support for same-sex marriage'b' in May, and even then it made no sense, except perhaps as political cover approaching the general election campaign.'b'Marriage is traditionally regulated by the states, but there are constitutional limits on what states may do. The Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s 1967 ruling in Loving v. Virginia prevented states from forbidding marriages between interracial couples like Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s own parents.'b'Furthermore, the day after the Proposition 8 case is argued, the Justice Department will be asking the Supreme Court to invalidate the Defense of Marriage Act, the atrocious 1996 statute that denies federal benefits to lawfully married same-sex couples. The government will be arguing that discrimination against gay people, a vulnerable minority group, is presumptively unconstitutional. It is hard to see how the marriage act\xe2\x80\x99s discrimination is presumptively invalid but not California\xe2\x80\x99s wiping out of existing marriage rights for gay people that were mandated by the state\xe2\x80\x99s top court.'b'The outcome of the Proposition 8 case is likely to affect the lives of gay, lesbian and bisexual Americans for years to come, even if the final disposition is not sweeping enough to wipe out all state laws currently banning same-sex marriage. A strong filing by the Justice Department, forthrightly declaring that denying the freedom to marry violates the Constitution, would put the full weight of the federal government on the side of justice and could influence the shape of the ruling.'b'For the administration to be missing in action in this showdown risks conveying a message to the justices that it lacks confidence in the constitutional claims for ending gay people\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion from marriage or that it believes Americans are not ready for a high court ruling making marriage equality the law of the land \xe2\x80\x94 impressions strikingly contradicted by legal precedent, the lessons of history and by the president\xe2\x80\x99s own very powerful words.'b'Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Inaugural Address appeared to reflect a deepened understanding that the right to marry the person of one\xe2\x80\x99s choice is a fundamental right \xe2\x80\x9cunder the law.\xe2\x80\x9d He needs to make sure his solicitor general conveys that sound legal view loud and clear in the Proposition 8 case.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'Where Is the Taking?'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 20):'b'There is nothing \xe2\x80\x9cradical\xe2\x80\x9d about the Koontz family\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'argument to the Supreme Court'b' that government can\xe2\x80\x99t impose unrelated, unjustified burdens on people seeking land-use permits.'b'When the Koontzes sought a development permit for a few acres in Orange County, Fla., they were told that they must finance extensive wetlands mitigation on government land \xe2\x80\x94 costing up to $150,000.

In New York, students can complete only the first year of law school, take the bar and follow it by three years of work (clerkship) in a law firm. This approach is very practical and underused.'b'Allowing students to take the bar after two years without the work requirement is a good idea, but the one-year plus work requirement is better: it minimizes law school debt while ensuring that students get legal experience working in a law firm, and the bonus is that presumably their jobs will be waiting for them at those law firms after they pass the bar.'b'This solves both problems in legal education, onerous debt and the lack of practical, real-world experience of new law school graduates.'b'I do not place the blame squarely on law schools. Potential law students need to take responsibility for taking on debilitating loans as well. More students should take advantage of the work-study rule, as I did.'b'SARAH HOWLAND'b'\nHuntington, N.Y., Jan. 22, 2013'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Last Calendar'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Jan. 23):'b'I appreciated Olivia Judson\xe2\x80\x99s article about the calendar of notes she and her brother kept as their father declined.

Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t their authors labor mightily over the flaunting of an invented wisdom, the flashing of a borrowed wit? Beth Bailey, a historian at Temple University, told me that during the 19th century, when such missives were considered \xe2\x80\x9can essential way to get to know people,\xe2\x80\x9d there were how-to books that provided not only letter-writing templates but also \xe2\x80\x9cphrases for how to communicate your true self.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Until the dawn of cars and greater mobility, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t dating as we came to understand it; there were visits on porches and in parlors, often under the intrusive gazes of nattering relatives. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was very limiting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew Cherlin, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University.'b'And there weren\xe2\x80\x99t all that many visits, either.

Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions on sugary soda caught many Americans by surprise. But it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t: though the organization argues it is standing up for consumer choice and minority business owners, who it claims would be hurt, this is also a favor for a stalwart ally \xe2\x80\x94 Coca-Cola alone has given generously to support N.A.A.C.P. initiatives over the years.'b'This is more than a story of mutual back-scratching, though. It is the latest episode in the long and often fractious history of soft drinks, prohibition laws and race.'b'While it is widely known that John Pemberton, an Atlanta pharmacist, invented Coke as a kind of patent medicine, it was in fact his second drink. His first, an 1884 invention called French Wine Coca, was a copy of a popular French wine that contained cocaine. But in November 1885, just as the product began to sell, Atlanta outlawed alcohol sales.'b'Across the nation, support for prohibition was often tied to the desire by native whites to control European Catholics, American Indians, Asian-Americans and, especially in the South, African-Americans. It gave police officers an excuse to arrest African-Americans on the pretext of intoxication.'b'Pemberton went to work on a \xe2\x80\x9ctemperance drink\xe2\x80\x9d with the same \xe2\x80\x9cmedicinal\xe2\x80\x9d effects, and he introduced Coca-Cola in 1886. At the time, the soda fountains of Atlanta pharmacies had become fashionable gathering places for middle-class whites as an alternative to bars. Mixed with soda water, the drink quickly caught on as an \xe2\x80\x9cintellectual beverage\xe2\x80\x9d among well-off whites.'b'Eliminating alcohol granted only a temporary reprieve. Though Asa G. Candler, who had taken over the business, kept the formula secret, an Atlanta paper revealed in 1891 what many consumers \xe2\x80\x94 who called the soda \xe2\x80\x9cdope\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 already knew: Coca-Cola contained cocaine.'b'Candler began marketing the drink as \xe2\x80\x9crefreshing\xe2\x80\x9d rather than medicinal, and managed to survive the controversy. But concerns exploded again after the company pioneered its distinctive glass bottles in 1899, which moved Coke out of the segregated spaces of the soda fountain. Anyone with a nickel, black or white, could now drink the cocaine-infused beverage. Middle-class whites worried that soft drinks were contributing to what they saw as exploding cocaine use among African-Americans. Southern newspapers reported that \xe2\x80\x9cnegro cocaine fiends\xe2\x80\x9d were raping white women, the police powerless to stop them. By 1903, Candler had bowed to white fears (and a wave of anti-narcotics legislation), removing the cocaine and adding more sugar and caffeine.'b'Coke\xe2\x80\x99s recipe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only thing influenced by white supremacy: through the 1920s and \xe2\x80\x9930s, it studiously ignored the African-American market. Promotional material appeared in segregated locations that served both races, but rarely in those that catered to African-Americans alone.'b'Meanwhile Pepsi, the country\xe2\x80\x99s second largest soft drink company, had tried to fight Coke by selling its sweeter product in a larger bottle for the same price. Still behind in 1940, Pepsi\xe2\x80\x99s liberal chief executive, Walter S. Mack, tried a new approach: he hired a team of 12 African-American men to create a \xe2\x80\x9cnegro markets\xe2\x80\x9d department.'b'By the late 1940s, black sales representatives worked the Southern Black Belt and Northern black urban areas, black fashion models appeared in Pepsi ads in black publications, and special point-of-purchase displays appeared in stores patronized by African-Americans. The company hired Duke Ellington as a spokesman. Some employees even circulated racist public statements by Robert W. Woodruff, Coke\xe2\x80\x99s president.'b'The campaign was so successful that many Americans began using a racial epithet to describe Pepsi. By 1950, fearing a backlash by white consumers, Pepsi had killed the program, but the image of Coke and Pepsi as \xe2\x80\x9cwhite\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cblack\xe2\x80\x9d drinks lingered.'b'Not long after, perhaps seeing the business error of its ways, Coke quietly began to market to African-Americans. Eventually, part of Coke\xe2\x80\x99s strategy was to support African-American organizations, forming the basis of its relationship with the N.A.A.C.P.'b'The historical weight of that relationship came to the surface after a 1999 discrimination case brought by black Coke employees, which created bad press for the company around the world. In 2000, Coke agreed to a settlement for $156 million and made a $50 million donation to the Coca-Cola Foundation to support community programs.'b'It took time, but the new tack worked: today the racial line between the soda companies, even in the South, is a dim memory, and the soft-drink industry is on good terms with one of its largest demographic markets: African-Americans.'b'Of course, the New York State N.A.A.C.P. may have a legitimate complaint against the soda restriction as a threat to minority business. And it may be fair to see the proposal, as some observers have intimated, as an instance of middle-class whites trying to control the behavior of working-class minorities \xe2\x80\x94 just as they did under Prohibition. But to understand the real story behind this unexpected alliance, we first have to understand its tangled history.'b'On the surface, Republicans are already doing a good job of beginning to change their party. Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana gave a speech to the Republican National Committee calling on Republicans to stop being the stupid party, to stop insulting the intelligence of the American people.'b'Representative Paul Ryan gave a fine speech to the National Review Institute calling for prudence instead of spasmodic protest. The new senator for Texas, Ted Cruz, gave a speech to the same gathering saying the Republicans should be focusing on the least fortunate 47 percent of Americans.'b'But, so far, there have been more calls for change than actual evidence of change. In his speech, for example, Jindal spanked his party for its stale clich\xc3\xa9s but then repeated the same Republican themes that have earned his party its 33 percent approval ratings: Government bad. Entrepreneurs good.'b'In this reinvention process, Republicans seem to have spent no time talking to people who didn\xe2\x80\x99t already vote for them.'b'Change is hard because people don\xe2\x80\x99t only think on the surface level. Deep down people have mental maps of reality \xe2\x80\x94 embedded sets of assumptions, narratives and terms that organize thinking. Since Barry Goldwater, the central Republican narrative has been what you might call the Encroachment Story: the core problem of American life is that voracious government has been steadily encroaching upon individuals and local communities. The core American conflict, in this view, is between Big Government and Personal Freedom.'b'While losing the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections, the flaws of this mentality have become apparent. First, if opposing government is your primary objective, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to have a positive governing program.'b'As Bill Kristol pointed out at the National Review event, the G.O.P. fiercely opposed the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law but never offered an alternative. The party opposed Obamacare but never offered a replacement. John Podhoretz of Commentary added that as soon as Republicans start talking about what kind of regulations and programs government should promote, they get accused by colleagues of being Big Government conservatives.'b'The next problem with this mentality is that it makes it hard for Republicans to analyze social and economic problems that don\xe2\x80\x99t flow directly from big government. For example, we are now at the end of the era in which a rising tide lifts all boats. Republicans like Mitt Romney can talk about improving the overall business climate with lower taxes and lighter regulation, but regular voters sense that that won\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily help them because wages no longer keep pace with productivity gains.'b'Americans are still skeptical of Washington. If you shove a big government program down their throats they will recoil. But many of their immediate problems flow from globalization, the turmoil of technological change and social decay, and they\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a bit of help. Moreover, given all the antigovernment rhetoric, they will never trust these Republicans to reform cherished programs like Social Security and Medicare. You can\xe2\x80\x99t be for entitlement reform and today\xe2\x80\x99s G.O.P., because politically the two will never go together.'b'Can current Republicans change their underlying mentality to adapt to these realities? Intellectual history says no. People almost never change their underlying narratives or unconscious frameworks. Moreover, in the South and rural West, where most Republicans are from, the Encroachment Story has deep historic and psychological roots. Anti-Washington, anti-urban sentiment has characterized those cultures for decades.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s probably futile to try to change current Republicans. It\xe2\x80\x99s smarter to build a new wing of the Republican Party, one that can compete in the Northeast, the mid-Atlantic states, in the upper Midwest and along the West Coast. It\xe2\x80\x99s smarter to build a new division that is different the way the Westin is different than the Sheraton.'b'The second G.O.P. wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be based on the Encroachment Story. It would be based on the idea that America is being hit simultaneously by two crises, which you might call the Mancur Olson crisis and the Charles Murray crisis.'b'Olson argued that nations decline because their aging institutions get bloated and sclerotic and retard national dynamism. Murray argues that America is coming apart, dividing into two nations \xe2\x80\x94 one with high education levels, stable families and good opportunities and the other with low education levels, unstable families and bad opportunities.'b'The second G.O.P. would tackle both problems at once. It would be filled with people who recoiled at President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s second Inaugural Address because of its excessive faith in centralized power, but who don\xe2\x80\x99t share the absolute antigovernment story of the current G.O.P.'b'Would a coastal and Midwestern G.O.P. sit easily with the Southern and Western one? No, but majority parties are usually coalitions of the incompatible. This is really the only chance Republicans have. The question is: Who\xe2\x80\x99s going to build a second G.O.P.?'b'The thousand-mile journey to comprehensive immigration reform has begun, as you might expect for Washington, with a single 'b'memo'b'. Eight senators, four from each party, 'b'released it on Monday'b': a statement of principles behind a deal to overhaul the system in one big bill. It calls for more border and workplace enforcement, more visas for needed workers and legalization \xe2\x80\x94 with a path to citizenship \xe2\x80\x94 for 11 million undocumented immigrants.'b'The statement lacks specifics and leaves a lot of room for disappointment and retreat. But what\xe2\x80\x99s encouraging is that it exists at all. No longer does the immigration debate consist of two groups yelling across a void. No longer is the discussion hopelessly immobilized by Republicans who have categorically rejected any deal that includes any hint of \xe2\x80\x9camnesty.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Now senior Republicans have come forward to declare that 11 million people deserve a chance at full membership in American society. For a party whose presidential candidate less than three months ago was in full denial, wedded to a fantasy-based strategy of deporting a population equal to that of Ohio, this marks a welcome reacquaintance with reality. It puts the Republican Party closer to alignment with the moderate, pragmatic approach to immigration that most Americans accept.'b'The citizenship path, as outlined in the memo, won\xe2\x80\x99t be easy or short. The plan creates a new \xe2\x80\x9cprobationary legal status\xe2\x80\x9d (not citizenship or permanent residency) for the undocumented, which would allow them to live and work legally in this country, provided they pass criminal background checks and pay back taxes and fines. The road to citizenship, however, will stay closed until all proposed enforcement measures are completed, the borders are pronounced secure and all existing immigration backlogs are cleared.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to be skeptical, because the list of conditions is long. Legal immigrants have been languishing for decades in the existing system; without a concerted effort to clear backlogs, many of the 11 million may not have enough lifetimes to complete the citizenship path.'b'The senators\xe2\x80\x99 memo calls for a new national entry-exit system to make sure that all foreign visitors leave when they are supposed to. It seeks a national employment-verification system and the deployment of ever more border patrol officers \xe2\x80\x94 and more unmanned drones \xe2\x80\x94 to the southern border. It would establish a commission of border-state officials, including governors and attorneys general, to monitor progress and declare when the enforcement measures are complete.'b'But demanding an airtight 2,000-mile border before making citizenship possible for the undocumented basically means the path will never be open. The immigration system needs sensible, solid layers of enforcement to end the illegal border flow and illegal hiring. But the other part of reform \xe2\x80\x94 moving to make citizens of the shadow population \xe2\x80\x94 cannot be held hostage to an impossible standard. Undocumented immigrants, many of whom have lived here for decades, have waited too long for a chance to get right with the law. People like Jan Brewer of Arizona, a hard-line governor of the most radicalized anti-immigrant state, cannot be given a veto over their future.'b'There is the real possibility that this road to reform will be illusory, stacked with obstacles, detours, dead ends and quick exits. While the senators\xe2\x80\x99 memo envisions faster citizenship paths for immigrants with advanced degrees, farm workers and the young students known as Dreamers, it is vague about the rest of the 11 million. The requirements for green cards and citizenship could be made so extreme, disqualification so easy, and delays so long, that too few would have any real hope of qualifying.'b'President Obama plans to speak on immigration on Tuesday. We hope he stands firm on a realistic hope for citizenship, and acknowledges the unnecessary toll that overbroad enforcement \xe2\x80\x94 including his own \xe2\x80\x94 has taken on those whose legalization he has lately been championing. There is a moral, not just practical, case to make for bringing the failed immigration system in line with American ideals. Millions of immigrants, unshackled from fear, could be fully participating in the life and prosperity of the United States. Mr. Obama should make the case for them and see their path through to the end.'b'Turning to a critical piece of unfinished business, Patrick Leahy, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, 'b'joined last week'b' with a Republican colleague, Michael Crapo of Idaho, to reintroduce legislation to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, the 1994 law central to the nation\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to fight domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking.'b'Their bill 'b'cleared the Senate last April'b' in a 68-to-31 vote, but it was blocked in the Republican-led House largely over provisions that would expand protections against abuse for gay and immigrant victims.'b'The reintroduced Senate bill would provide services, like shelters and legal help, for victims of abuse regardless of their sexual orientation or immigration status. But it omits the original bill\xe2\x80\x99s modest increase in the number of special visas, known as U-visas, available to undocumented immigrants who are victims of domestic violence and sexual assaults.'b'House Republicans opposed any increase in that number and sought to end the current ability of U-visa holders to apply for permanent residency after three years, a move that would have eliminated an important incentive for frightened victims to contact law enforcement and assist in prosecutions. (They also noted that there was a procedural problem with having a U-visa fee in the original Senate bill.) The new bill also incorporates steps to reduce the inexcusable national backlog of untested rape kits. These changes might make it easier to push this legislation through the House.'b'In the meantime, the Senate needs to take up the bill as soon as possible before its schedule and attention is fully focused on other big legislative priorities, like gun violence, immigration reform and debt reduction.'b'There is no need for another set of hearings or another Judiciary Committee vote. The Senate\xe2\x80\x99s majority leader, Harry Reid, should use the window before Congress breaks for its Presidents\xe2\x80\x99 Day recess in February to secure Senate passage of the latest version of the Leahy-Crapo bill. That move would help put pressure on Speaker John Boehner and other Republican leaders in the House to stop playing ideological games and reach agreement with the Senate on extending this lifesaving law.'b''b'Monday, Jan. 21:'b''b'Eleaquin Temblador had plans.

The ruling, which greatly influenced fair-housing policy across the nation, limited the use of exclusionary zoning as a means of preventing the construction of affordable housing in wealthy communities.'b'The result was to encourage the construction of low- and moderate-income housing in the suburbs, giving less-well-off families access to starter homes, crime-free neighborhoods, good schools and solid jobs that are beyond the reach of people in the inner cities. Yet despite its clear benefits, Gov. Chris Christie and some wealthy communities have sought to weaken the law in two cases now before the court. The court should strongly reaffirm it.'b'The case dates back to the late-1960s, when a group of low-income African-Americans found themselves priced out of the increasingly expensive suburb of Mount Laurel, not far from Philadelphia. They sued after local authorities barred the construction of a small affordable-housing project. The court ruling, known as the Mount Laurel doctrine, not only barred localities from excluding affordable housing but said they had an affirmative obligation to provide zoning that allows a \xe2\x80\x9cfair share\xe2\x80\x9d of such housing based on growth, employment opportunities and income. \xe2\x80\x9cIf sound planning of an area allows the rich and middle class to live there, it must also realistically and practically allow the poor,\xe2\x80\x9d the court said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if the area will accommodate factories, it must also find space for workers.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'According to 'b'Douglas Massey'b', a sociologist at Princeton University, the Mount Laurel approach has led to the creation of 60,000 homes for low- and moderate-income working families, with another 40,000 units in the pipeline. He and his colleagues compared current and former residents of the Ethel Lawrence Homes, a Mount Laurel development that opened in 2000, with similar families who had applied for housing but wound up elsewhere.'b'The study found that the development\xe2\x80\x99s residents had higher rates of employment and family income and significantly lower rates of welfare dependency. They were also more closely involved in educating their children, who did well academically, even though they had moved to more competitive schools. Surrounding property values did not go down, and taxes did not go up. The development blended in so well with the surrounding area that many people were not aware that it existed.'b'On Monday, Mr. Christie asked the court for permission to dismantle the independent state agency that oversees the Mount Laurel process and move its functions into the executive branch. This would defeat the will of the State Legislature, which intended the agency to be exempt from tampering and political pressure exerted by the executive.'b'Another case argued before the court in November focuses on a new approach to the \xe2\x80\x9cfair share\xe2\x80\x9d calculation favored by the governor and wealthy towns that would essentially allow localities to decide for themselves how much affordable housing would be built. The Fair Share Housing Center, an advocacy group, noted in a brief that the proposal would free hostile municipalities to build \xe2\x80\x9cvery few homes, or no homes at all.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This would turn back to the clock to a time when communities could openly discriminate against poor and working-class residents. The court should reaffirm its 1983 decision, which held that municipalities had an obligation, through zoning, to help meet their region\xe2\x80\x99s need for affordable housing.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Swarming a Book Online'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Business Day, Jan. 21): As the recipient of a nasty personal attack disguised as a bona fide review of one of my novels on Amazon, I share Randall Sullivan\xe2\x80\x99s frustration and anger at having his book about Michael Jackson trashed unfairly.'b'There doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be any easy answer to this sort of abuse, short of requiring a \xe2\x80\x9creviewer\xe2\x80\x9d to reveal his or her name and particular relationship to the book or the author in question.'b'ANNE BERNAYS'b'\nCambridge, Mass., Jan. 21, 2013'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Archdiocese to Shut Down 24 Schools'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (news article, Jan. 23):'b'As a retired New York City public-school teacher, I view with great alarm the Archdiocese of New York\xe2\x80\x99s decision to close so many schools and wonder what the effect will be not only on the dispossessed students but also on the city schools, to which they will gravitate.'b'The arrival of so many students new to the city system will further increase overcrowding, increase class size, strain school facilities and cause the city to hire more teachers.'b'Though I do not believe that public money should be used for private education purposes, perhaps the New York City Department of Education could offer some assistance in the form of low-cost loans, the sharing of some services like the superior purchasing power of the city or other cost-saving ideas.'b'Since the city already provides many services to parochial school students like transportation, special education services and home instruction, just to name a few, it would seem that further city assistance would benefit both the parochial and public-school students.'b'PAUL APFEL'b'\nLong Beach, N.Y., Jan. 23, 2013'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Thomas L.

Some people \xe2\x80\x94 I, for one \xe2\x80\x94 consider this link dangerously stigmatizing. People with mental illness are far more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators. Moreover, psychiatrists have limited capacity to reliably predict violence. Nonetheless, these events increase pressure to identify people who might conceivably commit violent acts, and to mandate treatment with antipsychotic medications.'b'For a tiny minority of patients who have committed serious crimes, mandated treatment can be effective, particularly as an alternative to incarceration. But for most patients experiencing psychotic states, mandated treatment may create more problems than it solves.'b'For many medical conditions, better outcomes occur when patients share in treatment design and disease management. Imposed treatments tend to engender resistance and resentment. This is also true for psychiatric conditions.'b'Patients with psychotic symptoms often feel that their own experience is dismissed as meaningless, like the ravings of an intoxicated or delirious person. Decisions to decline antipsychotic medications are often regarded mainly as a manifestation of illness \xe2\x80\x94 an illness the person is too sick to recognize \xe2\x80\x94 even though many people might reject antipsychotics because of metabolic and other toxicities.'b'When a clearly troubled person firmly believes that he or she needs no help, there are no simple answers. These situations are particularly agonizing for families. Safety is paramount \xe2\x80\x94 and at times can be elusive. Still, if psychiatrists humbly try to understand the person on his or her own terms, do not dismiss the person\xe2\x80\x99s experience as meaningless and truly respect the person\xe2\x80\x99s choices about treatment, sometimes this opens the way to an effective treatment relationship. For some suffering and alienated people \xe2\x80\x94 certainly not all \xe2\x80\x94 feeling respectfully understood can be a critical step toward recovery.'b'Mandated treatment is a blunt instrument that may drive more people away from seeking care than it compels into care.'b'CHRISTOPHER GORDON'b'\nFramingham, Mass., Jan. 28, 2013'b''b''b'The writer is a psychiatrist and an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.'b''b''b'\n'b'Editors\xe2\x80\x99 Note: 'b''b''b'We invite readers to respond by Thursday for the Sunday Dialogue.

E-mail: 'b'letters@nytimes.com'b''b''b'President Obama hit the right notes 'b'when he made the case'b' for overhauling the immigration system 'b'in a speech in Las Vegas on Tuesday'b'. He spoke one day after 'b'a bipartisan group of eight senators released their own blueprint'b' for a comprehensive reform bill, and the back-to-back events gave the odd sensation \xe2\x80\x94 rare during the Obama administration \xe2\x80\x94 of seeing Congress and the White House moving in more or less the same direction.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow is the time,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'Mr. Obama said'b', noting that Washington was having a bipartisan moment on immigration not seen since George W. Bush was president and Senator Edward Kennedy was leading the push for reform. The president restated the familiar and still-sound principles behind an immigration overhaul: a more secure border and workplace; legalization for 11 million undocumented immigrants; and a modernized system of legal immigration that eliminates backlogs, reunites families and has enough visas for valued workers and entrepreneurs. He also gave a helpful reminder that it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong to cast immigration as a battle of \xe2\x80\x9cthem\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cus.\xe2\x80\x9d A false distinction, he said, because most of us used to be \xe2\x80\x9cthem.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The fiercest point of debate and the biggest obstacle to a bill, of course, is whether and how to get \xe2\x80\x9cthem\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 that is, 11 million undocumented immigrants \xe2\x80\x94 out of the shadows, free to live and work here legally and to become citizens if they wish. \xe2\x80\x9cIt should be clear at the outset that there is a pathway to citizenship,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama said, stressing the \xe2\x80\x9cis.\xe2\x80\x9d An objectionable part of the senators\xe2\x80\x99 blueprint is that it refuses to put undocumented immigrants on a path to permanent residency and citizenship until a host of border-enforcement actions is completed first.'b'Given existing immigration backlogs and the possibility of other administrative hurdles being placed in the way, any future path to citizenship could be so long and burdensome as to be all but imaginary. Mr. Obama, to his credit, made the citizenship path a central part of his plan and did not make it contingent on adding still more troops, border fencing and aerial drones.'b'Mr. Obama released his own 'b'list of immigration-reform principles'b' separately on Tuesday, and it is far better than the plan put forward by the senators. Besides the forceful language on citizenship, it offers ways to end backlogs in family-sponsored immigration, urges more staffing and improvements in immigration courts and added protections for immigrants who assert their labor rights. It also declares that members of same-sex couples should have the same opportunities to sponsor their partners for visas that others do.'b'Mr. Obama noted in his speech that the coming debate will be heated, and he warned of \xe2\x80\x9cfolks trying to pull this thing apart,\xe2\x80\x9d as immigration reform opponents have reliably done in the past. The Senate Judiciary Committee will be holding hearings next month, and then the battle will begin in earnest.'b'Mr. Obama said on Tuesday that if Congress gets bogged down, he will be ready to offer his own bill and \xe2\x80\x9cinsist that they vote on it right away.\xe2\x80\x9d We hope that won\xe2\x80\x99t be necessary and that Congress gets the message, adopts the best of his stated principles and keeps the process moving, on the rails, in the right direction.'b'WE are as different as North and South. One of us, John Dingell, is a liberal Michigan Democrat and the other, Jim Baker, is a conservative Texas Republican. We met during the Reagan administration and have often found ourselves on opposite sides of political battles. We have the bruises to show for them.'b'We do, however, share some beliefs. One is a strong love of guns and the outdoors and, just as important, a respect for both. Since we were boys, some of our best times have come with rifles or shotguns in our hands, especially when hunting with our fathers. Jim hunted ducks in the wetlands of southeast Texas and elk in the Rocky Mountains. John hunted small game along the banks of the Detroit River and Lake Erie. As adults, we have hunted together, using our common bond to bridge our differences.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re also united by outrage over the rampage killings in an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., and other despicable episodes of gun violence. At the same time, we believe the Second Amendment provides Americans with an important freedom that makes our country special.'b'But the harsh truth is that too many Americans are dying from gun-related shootings \xe2\x80\x94 more than 30,000 each year and more than one million since 1960. Gun violence now rivals traffic accidents as the leading cause of death by injury in the United States. Quite simply, gun violence threatens to overwhelm us.'b'Americans are grappling for strategies to make sure that the horror that occurred in Newtown isn\xe2\x80\x99t repeated. The White House has made suggestions, and many governors have offered theirs. The National Rifle Association has spelled out its proposals.'b'With the Senate Judiciary Committee scheduled today to hold the first congressional hearings on gun violence since the Newtown tragedy, we offer four general guidelines for a national dialogue on sensible solutions to this deadly malady.'b'First, any legislation that is suggested should be broad-gauged. There is no one single cause of gun violence and no single solution. That will mean determining if there is any reason for weapons to have magazines that hold 30 rounds or more. It will mean assessing whether armor-piercing bullets \xe2\x80\x94 opposed by police chiefs around the country \xe2\x80\x94 should be legal. And it will mean considering strengthening background checks.'b'Gun advocates will say that guns don\xe2\x80\x99t kill people, people kill people. And of course we must examine the long-term effects on our children of violent movies, television shows and video games. We must address gaps in our mental health system that leave potential killers unidentified and untreated, and this will require more financial resources. And we must strive to make our schools and public gathering places safer, perhaps through federal financing so local police forces can hire additional officers, as was done when the 1994 assault weapons ban was passed.'b'Second, any approach demands bipartisan support. This is not important just because of our divided government. Absent wide support, any laws passed now might well be rescinded once the partisan balance of power inevitably shifts. A broad-based approach could also help guarantee that any legislation would survive a constitutional challenge. That means that both gun-rights activists and the entertainment industry will have to moderate their positions.'b'Third, common sense should prevail. We must get away from a mind-set that has owners of firearms worried that \xe2\x80\x9cthey are going to take our guns away.\xe2\x80\x9d The Second Amendment guarantees that won\xe2\x80\x99t happen. Our nation has regulated various kinds of arms throughout history, and done so without violating the Second Amendment. We have, for example, restricted ownership of fully automatic weapons and grenade launchers.'b'Finally, each of us should look into our own heart to consider what type of nation we want to be. From members of the National Rifle Association to the most passionate gun-control advocates, no one wants to live in a country where innocent children are killed indiscriminately. This is a problem for all Americans \xe2\x80\x94 not just the government \xe2\x80\x94 and we all must be part of the solution.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why we think parents should spend less time leaving their children alone playing shoot-\xe2\x80\x99em-up video games and more time with them doing activities they both enjoy. This includes taking children into the country to hunt and to gain, as we did as boys, a love for the abundance and beauty of nature as well as a respect for the responsible and legitimate use of guns.'b'ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia'b'WHEN the 'b'International Criminal Court'b' 'b'made public an arrest warrant'b' in November for Simone Gbagbo, a former first lady of Ivory Coast, on charges of crimes against humanity, it set two precedents. For the first time, it had indicted a woman \xe2\x80\x94 and someone who had held no formal public office. The previous year, Mrs. Gbagbo\xe2\x80\x99s husband, Laurent, became the first former head of state to face trial before the I.C.C. He is charged with thousands of murders and \xe2\x80\x9cother inhuman acts\xe2\x80\x9d after refusing to accept defeat in a presidential election that was held in November 2010.'b'The indictments of the Gbagbos are welcome, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t bring the court any closer to confronting the fundamental causes of the violence that has plagued Ivory Coast \xe2\x80\x94 and most of sub-Saharan African \xe2\x80\x94 for centuries. Colonial rule, and the military takeovers and suppression of democratic movements that followed it, have contributed enormously to the misery. But even those legacies are not the root cause.'b'Violence in Africa begins with greed \xe2\x80\x94 the discovery and extraction of natural resources like 'b'oil'b', diamonds and gas \xe2\x80\x94 and continues to be fed by struggles for control of energy, minerals, food and other commodities. The court needs the power to punish those who profit from those struggles. So do other judicial forums. At a summit meeting here last week, leaders of the African Union proposed expanding the criminal jurisdiction of the 'b'African Court on Human and Peoples\xe2\x80\x99 Rights'b' to include corporate criminal liability for the illicit exploitation of natural resources, trafficking in hazardous wastes and other offenses.'b'Africa\xe2\x80\x99s so-called \xe2\x80\x9cresource curse\xe2\x80\x9d is legendary. Take Nigeria. It experienced 10 successive military coups beginning in 1966, just a few years after independence from Britain and the subsequent discovery of large oil reserves. The struggle to control its government was in large part a struggle to control oil. The pattern repeated in many countries \xe2\x80\x94 including the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), Somalia, Liberia, Uganda, Sierra Leone and the Republic of Congo \xe2\x80\x94 where rebels, political parties and international corporations have competed to control extraction industries.'b'Ivory Coast, which produces about 40 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s cocoa beans, is a case in point. Cocoa accounts for a fifth of its economy. Nestl\xc3\xa9, Hershey and Cadbury play central roles in buying and trading it, and they benefit from the exploitative labor practices in the agricultural sector. According to a 2008 government survey, 88 percent of a sample of children between 6 and 17 years old in Ivorian agricultural districts reported that they participated in cocoa production.'b'Practices like 'b'child labor'b' reproduce exploitation, but the I.C.C. holds neither the rural farmers nor the international corporations that depend on such practices responsible. Claimants have had to sue, instead, in the courts of sovereign nations. For example, Grant &amp; Eisenhofer, a law firm representing a Louisiana public employees\xe2\x80\x99 pension fund, asked the Delaware Chancery Court in November to order Hershey to open its books so that the fund could verify shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 claims that the chocolate maker had worked with suppliers who used illegal child labor in Ghana and Ivory Coast.'b'Another example: in August 2006, the commodities trader Trafigura hired a ship, the Probo Koala, to dump toxic waste in locations in Abidjan, the commercial capital of Ivory Coast. Fifteen people died and more than 100,000 were treated for disorders relating to exposure to the waste. After six years of prosecutions and appeals, a Dutch court found Trafigura guilty of illegally exporting waste, but in Ivory Coast the company was granted immunity from further prosecution in exchange for a financial settlement.'b'In Sudan, the Chinese National Petroleum Corporation has been assailed for supplying the military with resources and oil revenues that were used to support the mass displacement and killings of civilians, but it operates with impunity.'b'The I.C.C. should be empowered to prosecute corporate crimes \xe2\x80\x94 and not be restricted to genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and crimes of aggression, as it is now under the Rome Statute. That may be difficult. It would require agreement among the signatories to the statute, which do not include some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest countries, like India, China and the United States. (The Obama administration, unlike its predecessor, has cooperated with the court, although it does not have the political support to rejoin the statute or obtain Senate ratification.)'b'For all its deficiencies, the I.C.C. \xe2\x80\x94 which in 10 years has achieved just a single conviction, that of a Congolese warlord last year \xe2\x80\x94 has a global reach and responsibility as the world\xe2\x80\x99s first permanent war-crimes tribunal. Holding government officials and their inner circles accountable is a step toward justice, but the pursuit cannot end there. The Gbagbos, however heinous their alleged crimes, were ultimately figureheads in a vast and unregulated system of extractive capitalism.'b'If it is to be relevant to Africa, the I.C.C. must have the power to prosecute corporate involvement in illicit extraction of resources. Expanding the powers of the African court would also help. True international justice means not only investigating heads of state, but also the multinational companies that are part of the ecosystem of Africa\xe2\x80\x99s violence.'b'SAN FRANCISCO'b'LAST week, the 'b'Palestinian'b' foreign minister, Riad Malki, declared that if 'b'Israel'b' persisted in its plans to build settlements in the currently vacant area known as E-1, which lies between Palestinian East Jerusalem and the Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will be going to the I.C.C.,\xe2\x80\x9d referring to the 'b'International Criminal Court'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have no choice,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.'b'The Palestinians\xe2\x80\x99 first attempt to join the I.C.C. was thwarted last April when the court\xe2\x80\x99s chief prosecutor at the time, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, declined the request on the grounds that Palestine was not a state. That ambiguity has since diminished with the United Nations\xe2\x80\x99 conferral of nonmember state status on Palestine in November. Israel\xe2\x80\x99s frantic opposition to the elevation of Palestine\xe2\x80\x99s status at the United Nations was motivated precisely by the fear that it would soon lead to I.C.C. jurisdiction over Palestinian claims of war crimes.'b'Israeli leaders are unnerved for good reason. The I.C.C. could prosecute major international crimes committed on Palestinian soil anytime after the court\xe2\x80\x99s founding on July 1, 2002.'b'Since the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada in 2000, the Israel Defense Forces, guided by its military lawyers, have attempted to remake the laws of war by consciously violating them and then creating new legal concepts to provide juridical cover for their misdeeds. For example, in 2002, an 'b'Israeli F-16 dropped a one-ton bomb'b' on an apartment building in a densely populated 'b'Gaza'b' neighborhood, killing a Hamas military leader, Salah Shehadeh, and 14 others, including his wife and seven children under the age of 15. In 2009, Israeli artillery 'b'killed more than 20'b' members of the Samouni family, who had sought shelter in a structure in the Zeitoun district of Gaza City at the bidding of Israeli soldiers. Last year, Israeli missiles 'b'killed two Palestinian cameramen'b' working for Al Aksa television. Each of these acts, and many more, could lead to I.C.C. investigations.'b'The former head of the Israeli military\xe2\x80\x99s international law division, 'b'Daniel Reisner, asserted'b' in 2009: \xe2\x80\x9cInternational law progresses through violations. We invented the targeted assassination thesis and we had to push it. At first there were protrusions that made it hard to insert easily into the legal molds. Eight years later it is in the center of the bounds of legitimacy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Colonel Reisner is right that customary international law is formed by the actual practice of states that other states accept as lawful. But targeted assassinations are not widely accepted as legal. Nor are Israel\xe2\x80\x99s other attempted legal innovations.'b'Israel has categorized military clashes with the Palestinians as \xe2\x80\x9carmed conflict short of war,\xe2\x80\x9d instead of the police actions of an occupying state \xe2\x80\x94 thus freeing the Israeli military to use F-16 fighter jets and other powerful weaponry against barely defended Palestinian populations in the 'b'West Bank'b' and Gaza Strip.'b'It has designated individuals who fail to leave a targeted area after a warning as \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntary human shields\xe2\x80\x9d who are therefore subject to lawful attack, despite the fact that warnings may not be effective and escape routes not clear to the victims.'b'And it has treated civilian employees of Hamas \xe2\x80\x94 including police officers, judges, clerks, journalists and others \xe2\x80\x94 as combatants because they allegedly support a \xe2\x80\x9cterrorist infrastructure.\xe2\x80\x9d Never mind that contemporary international law deems civilians \xe2\x80\x9ccombatants\xe2\x80\x9d only when they actually take up arms.'b'All of these practices could expose Israeli political and military officials to prosecutions for war crimes. To be clear, the prosecutions would be for particular acts, not for general practices, but statements by Israeli officials explaining their policies could well provide evidence that the acts were intentional and not mere accidents of war.'b'No doubt, Israel is most worried about the possibility of criminal prosecutions for its settlements policy. Israeli bluster notwithstanding, there is no doubt that Jewish settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, are illegal. Israeli officials have known this since 1967, when Theodor Meron, then legal counsel to the Israeli Foreign Ministry and later president of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, wrote to one of Prime Minister Levi Eshkol\xe2\x80\x99s aides: \xe2\x80\x9cMy conclusion is that civilian settlement in the administered territories contravenes the explicit provisions of the Fourth 'b'Geneva Convention'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Under the founding statute of the I.C.C., grave violations of the Geneva Conventions, including civilian settlements in occupied territories, are considered war crimes.'b'The next step for the Palestinians is to renew a certificate of accession to the I.C.C. with the United Nations secretary general. Assuming that I.C.C. jurisdiction is accepted, investigations of alleged Israeli war crimes would still not begin automatically, because the I.C.C. must next find that Israel\xe2\x80\x99s own courts are failing to adequately review those charges. Palestinians, by inviting I.C.C. investigations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, also run the risk that their own possible violations \xe2\x80\x94 such as deliberate attacks on Israeli civilians \xe2\x80\x94 could come under I.C.C. scrutiny.'b'If Palestinians succeed in getting the I.C.C. to examine their grievances, Israel\xe2\x80\x99s campaign to bend international law to its advantage would finally be subjected to international judicial review and, one hopes, curbed. Israel\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous legal innovations, if accepted, would expand the scope of permissible violence to previously protected persons and places, and turn international humanitarian law on its head. We do not want a world in which journalists become fair game because of their employers\xe2\x80\x99 ideas.'b'If the choice is between a Palestinian legal intifada, in which arguments are hashed out in court, and an actual intifada, in which blood flows in the streets, the global community should encourage the former.'b'Indeed, Palestinians would be doing themselves, Israelis and the global community a favor by invoking I.C.C. jurisdiction. Ending Israel\xe2\x80\x99s impunity for its clear violations of legal norms would both promote peace in the Middle East and help uphold the integrity of international law.'b'IN Las Vegas yesterday, President Obama made it clear that an overhaul of America\xe2\x80\x99s immigration laws was his top domestic priority. He expressed cautious support for a bipartisan plan by eight senators that would create a pathway to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants in exchange for tougher border enforcement, employment checks and temporary work visas for farmworkers and highly skilled engineers and scientists.'b'Many critical details are still missing, but the general framework is notable for its familiarity. Variations on all of these measures have been tried before, with mixed results. Legalization of the undocumented is humane and practical, but the proposals for controlling future immigration are almost certain to fail.'b'The promise to \xe2\x80\x9csecure the border\xe2\x80\x9d made for good politics even before 1986, when Congress passed the last comprehensive immigration reform bill. In the last quarter-century we have spent approximately $187 billion on enforcement, mostly along the United States-Mexico border. This included a ninefold increase in the size of the Border Patrol since 1980; nearly 700 miles of fencing; and the deployment of surveillance drones and motion sensors. These efforts reduced but did not stop unauthorized entries (only the Great Recession was able to reduce the net flow of Mexican illegal immigration to effectively zero). In fact, the hazards of crossing an increasingly militarized border led many Mexican workers to settle permanently in the United States.'b'Similarly, proposals for a new guest worker program, which were scuttled from the 1986 legislation because of opposition from labor and immigrant advocates, should again give us pause. From the agricultural \xe2\x80\x9cBracero Program\xe2\x80\x9d of the 1940s and \xe2\x80\x9950s to the current H-2 visa for temporary unskilled labor, these programs are notorious for employer abuse.'b'If we really want to tackle unauthorized migration, we need to understand why it exists in the first place. The most important cause is our system of allocating green cards, or visas for permanent residency, which stipulates that no country may have more than 7 percent of the total each year. With an annual ceiling of 366,000 family- and employer-sponsored visas, the per-country limit is 25,620.'b'In practice, this means it is easy to immigrate here from, say, Belgium or New Zealand, but there are long waits \xe2\x80\x94 sometimes decades \xe2\x80\x94 for applicants from China, India, Mexico and the Philippines. These four max out on the limit every year. When critics admonish prospective immigrants \xe2\x80\x94 as well as the 11 million plus undocumented migrants currently in America \xe2\x80\x94 to \xe2\x80\x9cgo to the back of the line,\xe2\x80\x9d they should realize that for many people the line is a cruel joke.'b'The United States has followed this one-size-fits-all rule since 1965. It was, admittedly, a vast improvement over the blatantly discriminatory national-origins quota system, which since the 1920s had favored migration from Northern and Western Europe and excluded Asians altogether. But we can do better.'b'One alternative might be a plan introduced by Senator 'b'Philip A. Hart'b', a Michigan Democrat, in the early 1960s. Senator Hart, who died in 1976, gave his name to the 1965 immigration law, along with Representative 'b'Emanuel Celler'b', a New York Democrat. But before that, he proposed a system that would have given 20 percent of the visas to refugees; 32 percent to countries in proportion to the size of their populations (recognizing need); and 48 percent to countries in proportion to their amount of emigration in the last 15 years (supporting family unification and existing ties in immigrant communities in the United States).'b'To keep the immigration stream diverse, he proposed maximum and minimum per-country limits. The overall ceiling and the distribution would be revisited every five years to reflect changing conditions. Finally, Senator Hart recommended continuing the policy of pan-Americanism, which had long exempted countries in the Western Hemisphere from quota restrictions.'b'The proposal had broad support, but the Kennedy administration pressured Senator Hart to sponsor the bill that created our current system instead \xe2\x80\x94 allocating visas in equal number to all countries, a principle inspired by the civil-rights-era ethos of formal equality. And it has been at the root of our \xe2\x80\x9cillegal immigration problem\xe2\x80\x9d ever since.'b'The federal government continues to pour billions of dollars into border control and to impose punitive sanctions on undocumented workers, and the immigration-detention system has swelled. These approaches are not only inhumane but misguided; the labor market, more than anything, determines migration\xe2\x80\x99s ebbs and flows.'b'The 1986 reform regularized the status of nearly three million undocumented immigrants, but did nothing to change the system that encourages, even guarantees, future unauthorized entries. This time, we need more than half measures. We need not mimic the exact structure of Senator Hart\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, but we should push for a similar system, with the same principles of flexibility and fairness. Comprehensive immigration reform must mean a return to the tradition of welcoming immigrants who come here to work, and giving them the opportunity to become Americans.'b'President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s first term was absorbed by dealing with the Great Recession. I hope that in his second term he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to devote more attention to the Great Inflection.'b'Dealing with the Great Recession was largely about \xe2\x80\x9cYes 'b'We'b' Can\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 about government, about what we can and must do \xe2\x80\x9ctogether\xe2\x80\x9d to shore up the safety nets and institutions that undergird our society and economy. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Inaugural Address was a full-throated defense of that \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d side of the unique public-private partnership that makes America great. But, if we\xe2\x80\x99re to sustain the kind of public institutions and safety nets that we\xe2\x80\x99re used to, it will require a lot more growth by the private side (not just more taxes), a lot more entrepreneurship, a lot more start-ups and a lot more individual risk-taking \xe2\x80\x94 things the president rarely speaks about. And it will all have to happen in the context of the Great Inflection.'b'What do I mean by the Great Inflection? I mean something very big happened in the last decade. The world went from connected to hyperconnected in a way that is impacting every job, industry and school, but was largely disguised by post-9/11 and the Great Recession. In 2004, I wrote a book, called \xe2\x80\x9cThe World Is Flat,\xe2\x80\x9d about how the world was getting digitally connected so more people could compete, connect and collaborate from anywhere. When I wrote that book, Facebook, Twitter, cloud computing, LinkedIn, 4G wireless, ultra-high-speed bandwidth, big data, Skype, system-on-a-chip (SOC) circuits, iPhones, iPods, iPads and cellphone apps didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist, or were in their infancy.'b'Today, not only do all these things exist, but, in combination, they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken us from connected to hyperconnected. Now, notes Craig Mundie, one of Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s top technologists, not just elites, but virtually everyone everywhere has, or will have soon, access to a hand-held computer/cellphone, which can be activated by voice or touch, connected via the cloud to infinite applications and storage, so they can work, invent, entertain, collaborate and learn for less money than ever before. Alas, though, every boss now also has cheaper, easier, faster access to more above-average software, automation, robotics, cheap labor and cheap genius than ever before. That means the old average is over. Everyone who wants a job now must demonstrate how they can add value better than the new alternatives.'b'When the world gets this hyperconnected, adds Mundie, the speed with which every job and industry changes also goes into hypermode. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the old days,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit was assumed that your educational foundation would last your whole lifetime. That is no longer true.\xe2\x80\x9d Because of the way every industry \xe2\x80\x94 from health care to manufacturing to education \xe2\x80\x94 is now being transformed by cheap, fast, connected computing power, the skill required for every decent job is rising as is the necessity of lifelong learning. More and more things you know and tools you use \xe2\x80\x9care being made obsolete faster,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mundie. It\xe2\x80\x99s as if every aspect of our lives is now being driven by Moore\xe2\x80\x99s Law. This is exacerbating our unemployment problem.'b'In their terrific book, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Race Against the Machine'b': How the Digital Revolution Is Accelerating Innovation, Driving Productivity, and Irreversibly Transforming Employment and the Economy,\xe2\x80\x9d Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology note that for the last two centuries it happened that productivity, median income and employment all tracked each other nicely. \xe2\x80\x9cSo most economists have had this feeling that if you just boost productivity, the pie grows, and, in the long run, everything else takes care of itself,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Brynjolfsson in an interview. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there is no economic law that says technological progress has to benefit everyone. It\xe2\x80\x99s entirely possible for the pie to get bigger and some people to get a smaller slice.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed, when the digital revolution gets so cheap, fast, connected and ubiquitous you see this in three ways, Brynjolfsson added: those with more education start to earn much more than those without it, those with the capital to buy and operate machines earn much more than those who can just offer their labor, and those with superstar skills, who can reach global markets, earn much more than those with just slightly less talent.'b'Put it all together, he added, and you can understand, why the Great Recession took the biggest bite out of employment but is not the only thing affecting job loss today: why we have record productivity, wealth and innovation, yet median incomes are falling, inequality is rising and high unemployment remains persistent.'b'How to adapt? It will require more individual initiative. We know that it will be vital to have more of the \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d education than less, that you will need to develop skills that are complementary to technology rather than ones that can be easily replaced by it and that we need everyone to be innovating new products and services to employ the people who are being liberated from routine work by automation and software. The winners won\xe2\x80\x99t just be those with more I.Q. It will also be those with more P.Q. (passion quotient) and C.Q. (curiosity quotient) to leverage all the new digital tools to not just find a job, but to invent one or reinvent one, and to not just learn but to relearn for a lifetime. Government can and must help, but the president needs to explain that this won\xe2\x80\x99t just be an era of \xe2\x80\x9cYes 'b'We'b' Can.\xe2\x80\x9d It will also be an era of \xe2\x80\x9cYes 'b'You'b' Can\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cYes 'b'You'b' Must.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Just a week after President Obama made ending antigay discrimination a central message of 'b'his Inaugural Address'b', the Boy Scouts of America provided more evidence that greater acceptance and inclusion is becoming a social norm.'b'In a surprise move on Monday, the organization said it 'b'is considering ending its policy of barring gay boys from membership'b' and gay and lesbian adults from serving as leaders. In July, 'b'it had reaffirmed its retrograde policy'b' as reflecting its \xe2\x80\x9cbeliefs and perspectives.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Sadly, though, the change the organization is contemplating falls far short of the clear and strong renunciation of antigay bigotry that is called for. It said it would no longer \xe2\x80\x9cdictate\xe2\x80\x9d an antigay policy to local scouting groups, but would let them decide whether to permit participation by openly gay people.'b'In other words, whether to persist in barring gay youngsters and their families would become a local option: an unprincipled position that would continue to send a message that discrimination is perfectly acceptable even if it is no longer mandatory under national Boy Scouts rules.'b'Such a partial move should hardly satisfy former donors who have been repelled by the Scouts\xe2\x80\x99 discriminatory ways. And such a stance will not resolve the quandary faced by parents who want the positive experiences that scouting offers but are appalled by antigay bigotry.'b'The new policy would, however, undermine the rationale the Supreme Court voiced in 2000 when 'b'it affirmed the right of the Scouts to discriminate against gay people'b'. The 5-to-4 ruling turned on the court\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of the Scouts\xe2\x80\x99 claim that being antigay was a \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d part of its mission and that its freedom of association right trumped any state nondiscrimination rules. Of course, much has changed since that decision \xe2\x80\x94 including the growing acceptance of same-sex marriage and the ability of gay people to serve openly in the military.'b'Now that the group is on the verge of making discrimination optional, it can no longer claim that discrimination is a \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d purpose \xe2\x80\x94 and therefore state nondiscrimination rules should apply to the Scouts. The halfway policy change would inevitably invite litigation.'b'The national executive board of the Boy Scouts will be considering the proposed change next week. Board members should reject the idea of allowing local chapters to continue to exclude gay scouts and troop leaders. Instead, the board should establish a firm anti-discrimination policy and make clear its determination to see that the principle is followed at the local level.'b'If the Boy Scouts of America is serious about repairing its bigoted image and serving all boys and their families, further discrimination cannot be an option.'b'Senate hearings on stronger gun controls are scheduled to begin on Wednesday before a divided Congress and a nation agonizing over how to prevent more of the carnage that killed 20 schoolchildren and six adults last month at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school. The gun lobby\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to reasonable controls is already fierce, and political courage is, as ever, wavering in Congress. But this singular opportunity to curb the gun violence must not be wasted in more of the posturing in Washington that tolerates 30,000 gun deaths a year.'b'The 'b'Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hear'b' a raft of proposals, including a vitally needed ban on fast-firing semiautomatic weapons, like the military-style Bushmaster assault rifle the Newtown gunman used in his killing spree at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The measure would also ban ammunition magazines that can hold more than 10 bullets, which have facilitated battlefield-scale killing of the innocent in the Newtown school, the movie theater in Aurora, Colo., and dozens of similar tragedies.'b'Making federal background checks universal, instead of limiting them to sales by licensed gun dealers, is no less vital, closing a loophole that lets 40 percent of firearm sales take place with no oversight. This proposal is the chief goal of many gun-control groups and has a different aim than the assault weapons ban: the proliferation of handguns that are used in most gun violence, particularly in cities.'b'Another measure would create a separate criminal offense for gun trafficking and toughen penalties on those involved, including the \xe2\x80\x9cstraw buyers\xe2\x80\x9d who purchase weapons later funneled into criminal hands. This should be accompanied by tighter restrictions on high-risk gun dealers who sell a disproportionate number of the guns traced to crimes, as well as new resources for more frequent inspection of all gun stores. Congressional corridors and committee evasions are not the way to advance these bills. They should be debated and voted on in public view so each lawmaker can be tallied on these major issues. The Second Amendment is nowhere at stake.'b'The fight will not be easy. 'b'A bill introduced by Senator Dianne Feinstein'b' of California would, for example, ban 157 of the worst assault weapons while leaving 2,200 guns untouched in the sportsmen\xe2\x80\x99s marketplace. \xe2\x80\x9cI understand how difficult this is,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Feinstein said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t try.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The reform effort will require an unprecedented outpouring of public support and pressure on Congress \xe2\x80\x94 a national drive that President Obama needs to make unrelenting and well-organized. 'b'The sponsor of the assault weapons ban in the House'b', Representative Carolyn McCarthy of New York, wisely says nothing will come of the reform effort unless the president is \xe2\x80\x9cout there selling it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Obama is supposed to follow Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. in leaving Washington for drumbeating rounds with community leaders. Mr. Biden is already emphasizing his mantra for audiences: \xe2\x80\x9cTell your congressman.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Republicans and wobbly Democrats in the House are waiting on results from the Senate, where the Democratic majority leader, Harry Reid, will play a crucial role. He is skeptical of an assault weapons ban and wary of losing Senate Democrats in next year\xe2\x80\x99s elections. But he admits, \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to accept the reality that we are not doing enough to protect our citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Reid aims to have legislation shaped by the Judiciary Committee for floor debate that will be freely open to amendment. This unusual process has the virtue of putting senators on the record for each major proposal, but could weaken a measure as much as strengthen it.'b'Nothing is settled in Congress. The outcome depends to a great degree on how demanding the public is for credible action against the gun violence ravaging the nation.'b'\xc2\x95'b''b'This is part of a continuing series on the epidemic of gun violence and possible solutions.

FELDMAN'b'\nPort Washington, N.Y., Jan. 28, 2013'b''b'PORTO ALEGRE, 'b'Brazil'b''b'THERE\xe2\x80\x99S a special sort of melancholy that arises from reflecting upon the death of young people who just wanted to have fun. The calamity in Santa Maria, a college town in southern Brazil, where a nightclub caught on fire and killed at least 235 people on Sunday (the number has been changing daily), has, like other tragedies, revealed the best and the worst of Brazilian society.'b'Offers to donate blood to the victims in Santa Maria, about 180 miles from here in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, have poured in from all over Brazil and protesters have taken to the streets demanding justice. Our neighbors have helped, too. Argentina \xe2\x80\x94 which suffered a deadly nightclub fire in 2004 that killed close to 200 people \xe2\x80\x94 quickly sent over a shipment of skin grafts for burn victims.'b'But the fire also revealed the country at its worst. Tasteless Facebook users engaged in a perverse relativism to say that hundreds of people die every day in Africa because of poverty. Fools joked that the nightclub fire was a kind of divine retribution, since the students at the nightclub were attending a \xe2\x80\x9csertanejo\xe2\x80\x9d concert \xe2\x80\x94 a sort of melodramatic form of country music that is considered corny. I suppose that, for some, dark and twisted humor can be a coping mechanism.'b'Our national media\xe2\x80\x99s sensationalist coverage has been even worse. It\xe2\x80\x99s possible to tell heart-wrenching stories carefully and tactfully, like the accounts I\xe2\x80\x99ve read about how the victims\xe2\x80\x99 cellphones, which rescue workers had placed on their dead bodies, continued to ring, as frantic parents sought to find out if their children were still alive.'b'What shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be happening is a crowd of journalists pointing cameras in the face of a mother who just lost her son and demanding to know how she feels. Freud once said that mourning is an intimate process. But Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s media is making a reality show out of this tragedy.'b'The Internet coverage has been appalling: a major news Web site posted a picture of a handsome young man and invited readers to view a slide show to \xe2\x80\x9csee the faces of the young people who died in Santa Maria\xe2\x80\x9d in the same way it has presented slide shows like \xe2\x80\x9ccheck out the hotties at Ipanema beach.\xe2\x80\x9d The day after the fire, the largest newspaper in the state published a comic that presented boys and girls entering the club from one side, drinking beer and having fun, and leaving on the other side, escorted by death with a scythe.'b'Intense media coverage can certainly have a positive effect. Everyone is awaiting the government\xe2\x80\x99s response and is eager to see that justice is served. Unlike the many politicians involved in corruption scandals \xe2\x80\x94 a frequent occurrence in Brazil \xe2\x80\x94 the band members whose pyrotechnics caused the fire and the security personnel who blocked clubgoers from leaving will almost certainly be punished swiftly, if only because of universal public outrage. \xc2\xa0'b'But the fire is likely to be exploited in every possible way by conservative-minded politicians to persuade \xe2\x80\x9cthe good citizen\xe2\x80\x9d (a mythical character that our politicians love to invoke) that youthful fun is dangerous. In search of a scapegoat, overcrowding will be blamed, as well as irregularities in the construction of the nightclub.'b'These criticisms are valid, but if you have ever been young and have been to a nightclub, you know that they are crowded and will always be crowded, and that your favorite nightclub is probably a small spot with only one exit.'b'Of course pyrotechnics should be banned in closed spaces. Of course nightclubs should have fire exits. Of course there should be laws and rules regarding the construction of such spaces. However, it is pretty clear that politicians, just like journalists, are going to use this tragedy for their own ends.'b'Porto Alegre, the capital of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, has in recent years been suffering from a witch hunt targeting bars, nightclubs and parties. The city government is shutting down many places because of complaints from older, conservative, religious and often homophobic voters who object to the noise and don\xe2\x80\x99t like seeing same-sex couples kissing in the street. Strict new regulations on night life are watering down the city\xe2\x80\x99s bohemian culture. And it\xe2\x80\x99s not the only Brazilian city facing draconian laws. Other politicians have come up with similar regulations: one seeks to ban alcohol consumption in public places.'b'But Brazil is a country known for its parties and laid-back attitude; in S\xc3\xa3o Paulo, most bars have tables laid out on the streets, and throughout Brazil tourists and locals alike take great pleasure in having a beer while walking on the beach. Puritanical new restrictions will no doubt be proposed to please the mythical \xe2\x80\x9cgood citizen,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Santa Maria disaster will be used as a pretext to needlessly crack down on young people\xe2\x80\x99s having fun.'b'Somewhere inside this political and media circus are 235 dead people and a huge number of parents and siblings who are stuck in a nightmare. Tasteless cartoons, exploitative journalism and puritanical politicians won\xe2\x80\x99t end it. The victims\xe2\x80\x99 families deserve justice, and they also deserve a measure of respectful silence from the media as they struggle to carry on after their irreplaceable loss.'b'YORK, England'b'THE fate of New England\xe2\x80\x99s fishing industry could be determined soon as federal regulators decide whether to open up thousands of square miles of ocean that were closed to commercial fishing so 'b'cod'b', haddock and other species could recover from decades of over-exploitation. The government should hold firm and keep those areas closed.'b'Twenty years ago, New England\xe2\x80\x99s fishing industry \xe2\x80\x94 whose annual catch is now second in value behind only Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 was on its knees. A region that had once supported some of the most productive fisheries in the world had succumbed to the might of a modern fleet bristling with new technology.'b'Cape Cod was named in the 17th century for the near-miraculous shoals of enormous cod that seethed around it. Generations of sailors marveled at cod so plentiful they could catch fish as fast as they could bait and haul in lines yet never seem to dent the teeming numbers.'b'The early 20th century saw hook and line give way to draggers that cut ever larger swaths across the seabed as they scooped fish into their nets. The passing years sharpened this lethal edge. Boats grew bigger and engines more powerful, dragging larger and stronger nets. Although fish numbers began to decline, the boats still found plenty to catch by using echo finders, later enhanced by computers and satellite positioning. That is, until there were so few fish left that even with the best technology, it became nearly impossible for fishermen to make a decent living.'b'Where were the regulators through all of this? Always one step behind and perennially ineffective. Federal law delegated to the New England Fishery Management Council authority to manage the fishery from 3 miles to 200 miles off the coast, but the council didn\xe2\x80\x99t see its job as speaking up for fish. This body was dominated by fishing interests, so when faced with a choice of fishing now or cutting back the catch to assure the fishery\xe2\x80\x99s future, the council\xe2\x80\x99s decisions often favored the short term. With such decisions, collapse of the fishery was inevitable. When it happened in the late 1980s, it was brutal and swift. By the early 1990s, all agreed that something had to be done. The council reinvented its approach to fishery management.'b'Nobody should underestimate the challenges the council had to overcome when it began working with scientists to form a management plan to rebuild stocks of fish like cod, haddock, flounder and halibut and to recover the prosperity and pride of New England\xe2\x80\x99s fishing communities. The cost of recovery was bitter medicine, involving reducing fishing by half. In a first for United States waters, regulators closed an approximately 8,000-square-mile network of areas to draggers and scallop dredgers in the mid-1990s. It paid off.'b'Scallop stocks were the first to rebound, soaring as the animals matured and multiplied in the millions across the closed areas, sending their offspring on ocean currents into surrounding fishing grounds. Today, scallops help New Bedford, Mass., bring in more revenue than any fishing port in the nation. Cod have stubbornly resisted recovery, for reasons not well understood, but other fish, like haddock, flourished as the habitats within closed areas recovered from a century of damage by trawl and dredge. As was the case with scallops, these larger, healthier populations helped to replenish the fishery.'b'But the seas are subject to upswings and downturns, the result of shifting environmental conditions. After more than 15 years of protection, New England today faces a decline in the fortunes of its fish stocks and fisheries. When times are tough and recession bites, it can be hard to resist the temptation to cash in your reserves.'b'This is exactly what many in the commercial fishing industry are calling for in New England, demanding that closed areas be reopened. Sadly, the fishery council voted Dec. 20 to recommend ending protection for more than half of the area originally closed, a total of about 5,000 square miles. Now officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must decide whether or not to allow such a shortsighted measure to take effect.'b'The pressure to do so will be intense. Yesterday, the fishery council voted to recommend that NOAA substantially reduce quotas for Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank cod to allow the stocks to recover. Fisherman say these reductions will destroy their industry. But opening up the protected zones would be disastrous. They have been the linchpin of fishery recovery. It has taken years of fishing restraint for nature to rebuild stocks and repair habitats. Such gains, while slowly won, could be wiped out in less than a season\xe2\x80\x99s fishing and return the region to the destitution of the early 1990s. Such a rash move would also establish a bad model for fishery managers around the country.'b'The present downswing represents a tough test for New Englanders\xe2\x80\x99 resolve. They must resist the temptation to squander their resources in a splurge that would empty the sea and impoverish the industry once again.'b'Friday is Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s final day at the State Department. As we\xe2\x80\x99ve all been reminded, over the past four years she\xe2\x80\x99s traveled 956,733 miles to 112 different countries in order to conduct 1,700 meetings with world leaders. While consuming 570 airplane meals.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what you would have expected her to do. This is the woman who ended her career as a U.S. senator by announcing: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of fun. Eight state fairs, 45 parades, 62 counties, more than 4,600 events across the state.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And then, of course, there was the race for president, in which she campaigned through 54 primaries and caucuses. After she lost, she urged her followers to take a break and \xe2\x80\x9cgo to the beach.\xe2\x80\x9d But she went out and campaigned for Barack Obama. And then to the cabinet and the 112 countries.'b'So it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable that people are questioning how long the resting part of her future will last. There is already a Hillary-in-2016 PAC. Although Clinton has nothing to do with it, she could certainly stop it, as she could end all the presidential speculation by simply saying that she would not, under any circumstances, accept a nomination. She hasn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'But we really ought to get through the first year of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s second term before we declare him a lame duck and start discussing a replacement.'b'Meanwhile, if the last several decades are any indication, whatever Clinton does will involve extraordinarily diligent-but-unglamorous work, coupled with occasional hair-raising disasters, which she will overcome with a steely resolve that will make the world swoon.'b'Her departure from the current job has been of the pattern. There was the virus, followed by fainting, fall and blood clot. Followed by high-decibel Senate hearings in which the administration\xe2\x80\x99s failings during the run-up to the tragedy at Benghazi were overshadowed by clips of the secretary swatting back snarling Republican senators, while wearing large new eyeglasses to control her concussion-related double vision.'b'And there was the inauguration, when Bill and Hillary Clinton were photographed chatting with the former vice-presidential candidate and current White House scourge, Paul Ryan. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were just kind of chumming it up,\xe2\x80\x9d Ryan told \xe2\x80\x9cMeet the Press.\xe2\x80\x9d He then went on to say that if only the country were under a \xe2\x80\x9cClinton presidency,\xe2\x80\x9d the fiscal crisis would be fixed. It was not entirely clear which Clinton he was talking about. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t entirely matter.'b'All this was followed by the joint interview with the president on \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d in which Obama effused that \xe2\x80\x9cHillary will go down as one of the finest secretaries of state we\xe2\x80\x99ve had.\xe2\x80\x9d Take that, John Quincy Adams!'b'He called her \xe2\x80\x9ca strong friend.\xe2\x80\x9d She called him \xe2\x80\x9ca partner and friend.\xe2\x80\x9d (In the outside world, they get along fine. But, as Clinton once said in an interview, \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t hang out.\xe2\x80\x9d) Then on to a seemingly endless set of farewell appearances, including a global town hall, in which she answered a question about \xe2\x80\x9cthe future of the mineral resources in Antarctica.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Meanwhile, Tim Geithner retired as Treasury secretary. Did you notice?'b'Even though she\xe2\x80\x99s probably not going to go home and rest on her laurels, she really does deserve a chance to nap on them. Clinton is 65, and she\xe2\x80\x99s spent the last section of her life working with and competing against people who are generally much younger than she is.'b'Once, during the presidential race, she told me that she liked seeing me on the campaign plane because it was the only time there was somebody her own age on board. \xe2\x80\x9cI just had to tell people what Sputnik was,\xe2\x80\x9d she reported.'b'Women of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s generation have a special bond with her because she encapsulates their story. She spoke for their rebel youth at her Wellesley graduation, demanding \xe2\x80\x9ca more immediate, ecstatic, and penetrating mode of living\xe2\x80\x9d than the older generation ever knew. (Was she imagining that it would include 570 airplane meals? The Idaho caucus? Eight state fairs?)'b'Then Hillary Rodham became Hillary Clinton, the wife who worked to support the family and her husband\xe2\x80\x99s dreams. But somehow, thanks to her talents and terrifying work ethic, she wound up getting a much more spectacular professional life than she could ever have achieved with a normal career trajectory. When she campaigned for the Senate, you could see crowds of middle-aged women cheering like kids at a rock concert for one of their own, who had confirmed their private yearnings for a second, or maybe third, act.'b'And then there was the first-woman-president dream, which didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen. But she turned the failure into something so positive that it felt like a success. Now her diplomatic period is over. Being Hillary Clinton, she\xe2\x80\x99ll never look back and wonder how many of those 1,700 meetings she could have skipped without endangering the stability of the planet.'b'No regrets. Onward and upward.'b'Sometimes common sense isn\xe2\x80\x99t a common trait.'b'Wayne LaPierre, the National Rifle Association\xe2\x80\x99s executive vice president, is a shining example of this. He continues to voice resistance to even the most basic kinds of changes in existing gun policy, changes that almost all Americans support, changes that would have little impact on the rights and ability of sane, law-abiding citizens to purchase legal weapons.'b'First, some background.'b'The 'b'White House released its plan'b' to reduce gun violence two weeks ago, a month after the horrific school shooting in Newtown, Conn.'b'The plan covered closing loopholes in the background check system, banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as improving school safety and mental health services.'b''b'Public opinion polls'b' suggested that people generally supported the president\xe2\x80\x99s plan.'b'A Gallup poll conducted the day after the president presented his plan found that 53 percent of Americans would want their representatives in Congress to vote for it.'b'An ABC/Washington Post poll last week found that 53 percent of Americans favored it.'b'And a Pew Research Center poll last week found that a majority of Americans thought the plan was about right or didn\xe2\x80\x99t go far enough. Only 31 percent thought that it went too far.'b'In fact, one of the greatest points of agreement among Americans is the need for universal background checks, as the president proposed.'b'A Gallup poll released last week found that 91 percent of Americans would vote to \xe2\x80\x9crequire criminal background checks for all gun sales\xe2\x80\x9d if they could.'b'From a public relations perspective, trying to find some common ground on this issue with the public would seem a no-brainer. Not so for the No Brain-ers.'b'On Wednesday, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun violence, LaPierre, as is his wont, gave a rambling, twisted argument against, that\xe2\x80\x99s right, universal background checks.'b''b'LaPierre said during the hearings'b':'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy problem with background checks is you are never going to get criminals to go through universal background checks. All the law-abiding people, you\xe2\x80\x99ll create an enormous federal bureaucracy, unfunded, hitting all the little people in the country, will have to go through it, pay the fees, pay the taxes."'b'He continued:'b'"We don\xe2\x80\x99t even prosecute anybody right now that goes through the system we have. So, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make all those law-abiding people go through the system and then we aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to prosecute any of the bad guys if they do catch one. \xe2\x80\x9d'b'So LaPierre\xe2\x80\x99s argument, if I can follow this spiral of spuriousness, is that if we don\xe2\x80\x99t prosecute \xe2\x80\x9cbad guys,\xe2\x80\x9d then there is no use in checking buyers in the first place so that \xe2\x80\x9cbad guys\xe2\x80\x9d could be identified and prevented from making the purchases. As best I can tell that seems to be it, and if that is it then I say: you can\xe2\x80\x99t be serious.'b'Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, shot back:'b'"Mr. LaPierre, that\xe2\x80\x99s the point. The criminals won\xe2\x80\x99t go to purchase the guns because there\xe2\x80\x99ll be a background check. We\xe2\x80\x99ll stop them from original purchase. You missed that point completely. It\xe2\x80\x99s basic."'b'The room erupted in applause.'b'Universal background checks would seem a basic and exceedingly reasonable proposal. I would add that there should also be universal prosecutions for being intentionally misleading during those checks. But LaPierre is a different kind of person. His interests are not the same as most Americans\xe2\x80\x99. His organization and the majority of so-called \xe2\x80\x9cpro gun rights\xe2\x80\x9d groups are in the business of unfettered gun proliferation as a means of increasing gun industry profit.'b'This is about money, pure and simple.'b'Wednesday morning, before LaPierre\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, the Republican 'b'Joe Scarborough of MSNBC'b' said on his show:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what the greatest danger to that Second Amendment right and that guarantee is right now? Extremism from the survivalist wing of the N.R.A. that impacts Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 policies nationwide and moves the Republican Party so far away from mainstream America that they lose the House, they lose the Senate again in \xe2\x80\x9914, and they lose the presidency again. And the next president will be Democratic.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I would have to agree with that.'b'LaPierre is fanning paranoia because it helps grow the N.R.A.\xe2\x80\x99s membership rolls and helps the N.R.A.\xe2\x80\x99s friends and benefactors in the gun industry. And the N.R.A. uses its war chest to scare cowering politicians into taking unreasonable positions.'b'But extreme resistance to change is no longer acceptable with most of the public. People want action. They\xe2\x80\x99re demanding it. Extreme resistance in this climate could prove more politically poisonous, particularly to some Republicans, than upsetting the N.R.A.'b'At this moment you have an outraged public against the gun profiteers and the gutless politicians. I believe in the end the people will win.'b'Wal-Mart Stores'b' last week adopted 'b'a \xe2\x80\x9czero tolerance\xe2\x80\x9d policy for weak fire safety standards at foreign factories that make clothes sold by the company. The new policy, following 'b'a devastating fire in November'b' that killed 112 workers at a Bangladesh factory, includes some positive changes like periodic safety audits, but it does not go far enough in imposing strict standards or in helping factory owners pay for improvements to protect laborers.'b''b' Wal-Mart buys more 'b'than $1 billion in garments a year from Bangladesh alone, accounting for more than 5 percent of the country\xe2\x80\x99s $19 billion in 'b'clothing exports'b'. That gives it the power to demand reforms as well as the duty to ensure that they are carried out. 'b'The company says'b' it will require all suppliers to disclose every factory they use and will cut them off if they use plants that do not meet updated standards, like having unobstructed exits that are not barred or locked and routine safety training and fire drills.'b'But Wal-Mart needs to do much more. It should require fireproof exits or external fire escapes, which are the most effective way to get people out of a burning building safely. The company also needs to make some financial commitments. So far, it has not promised to help pay for improvements or offer higher prices for the clothes it buys to make it possible for factory owners to renovate. A Wal-Mart spokeswoman said that it is considering providing loans to suppliers, but that won\xe2\x80\x99t help much unless those vendors make enough money to repay those debts.'b'Wal-Mart and other Western companies have tried voluntary auditing and inspections to keep vendors honest about workplace conditions. But recent fires in Bangladesh, including one 'b'last weekend'b' that killed seven women, show that this approach is not working.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s needed is an independent and robust inspection system that is legally enforceable and run by safety professionals. In an ideal world, that responsibility would fall to governments, but it\xe2\x80\x99s unrealistic to expect developing countries like Bangladesh to build that capacity quickly. That is why major multinational clothing retailers need to take the lead.'b'Israel has increasingly isolated itself from the world with its hard-line policies on West Bank settlements, the Gaza embargo and other issues. This week, it unwisely set itself further apart with a decision to 'b'withhold cooperation from a United Nations Human Rights Council review'b' of its human rights practices.'b'When the first reviews began in 2008, every country in the world, including the United States and Israel, participated in the process, which is supposed to examine each country\xe2\x80\x99s human rights record every four years. But when the council met on Tuesday in Geneva for its second review cycle, Israel was a no-show.'b'In May, Israel said it planned to stop participating because the council was a \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical tool\xe2\x80\x9d for those who wanted to \xe2\x80\x9cbash and demonize\xe2\x80\x9d Israel. The council, whose 47 members are elected by the United Nations General Assembly, is clearly not without faults. More than half of the resolutions passed by the council since it started work in 2006 have focused on Israel and its treatment of Palestinians, and Israel is the only country that is a standing item on the agenda for the council\xe2\x80\x99s biannual meetings.'b'The council hasn\xe2\x80\x99t always been an effective human rights champion. But its record, including naming human rights rapporteurs for Iran and Sudan and supporting gay and lesbian rights, has improved since President Obama, reversing policy of the George W. Bush administration, had the United States join the council in 2009.'b'Human rights reviews are an important tool for judging all countries by universal standards and nudging them to make positive changes. By opting out, Israel shows not only an unwillingness to undergo the same scrutiny as all other countries, but it deprives itself of an opportunity to defend against abuse charges. The decision could also undermine the entire review process by providing an excuse for states with terrible human rights records \xe2\x80\x94 like North Korea, Iran and Zimbabwe \xe2\x80\x94 to withdraw as well. It certainly will make it harder for Washington to argue for reviews when an ally rejects the process.'b'If the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hoped to avoid criticism by this move, it failed. Fortunately, there is still a chance to make the right decision. In an extraordinary move, the council agreed to give Israel until November to reverse course. Any new governing coalition that emerges from Israel\xe2\x80\x99s recent elections should realize that there\xe2\x80\x99s a cost to standing apart.'b'If ever there were a moment for Democrats to press their political advantage, this is it. Their message on many of the biggest national issues \xe2\x80\x94 taxes, guns, education spending, financial regulation \xe2\x80\x94 has widespread support, and they have increased their numbers in both houses of Congress. But after years of being out-yelled by strident right-wing ideologues, too many in the Democratic Party still have a case of nerves, afraid of bold action and forthright principles.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s particularly evident in the Senate, which the party controls. Last week, Democrats had 'b'a rare opportunity to change the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s rules by majority vote'b' and reduce the routine abuse of the filibuster by Republicans, which has allowed a minority to slow progress to a crawl. But there weren\xe2\x80\x99t enough Democrats to support real reform, so a disappointing half-measure was approved. The reason was fear: Fear that they might return to the minority one day, fear that a weakened filibuster might hurt them, fear that Republicans might change the rules to the disadvantage of Democrats if they regain a majority.'b'Similarly, fear is preventing many Democrats from fully embracing President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s sensible and long-overdue proposals on curbing gun violence. A proposal to require background checks on all gun buyers \xe2\x80\x94 the top priority of most gun-control groups because of its effect on handgun proliferation \xe2\x80\x94 is beginning to win strong bipartisan support. But Democrats from swing states \xe2\x80\x94 including Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader \xe2\x80\x94 are 'b'backing away from a bill'b' to ban semiautomatic assault weapons, and it is not clear if the Senate will vote to prohibit high-capacity ammunition magazines.'b'Senate Democrats'b' are not even united 'b' on the obvious need to raise additional tax revenues as part of budget agreements to reduce the deficit. Though Senator Charles Schumer of New York is pushing to raise more revenue through tax reform, Max Baucus of Montana, who leads the tax-writing Finance Committee, has resisted the idea.'b'Mr. Baucus, who has also expressed skepticism about an assault-weapons ban, comes from a state that supported Mitt Romney last year, as do most of the other nervous Democrats. It\xe2\x80\x99s true that the growing support for gun-control measures and for higher taxes on the rich is not spread evenly across the country, and that the party\xe2\x80\x99s majority in the Senate is precarious.'b'But senators have an obligation to lead public opinion, not to follow it blindly. Hunters in red states know full well that a semiautomatic weapon bristling with military features is unnecessary to bring down a deer or a duck. If Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, who just won re-election comfortably, were to make that case, he might change a few minds, given his unquestionable support for Second Amendment rights.'b'If Mr. Manchin explained that such a ban was anything but a \xe2\x80\x9cgun grab,\xe2\x80\x9d people would pay attention. Instead, though he supports background checks, 'b'he will not endorse anything further'b'.'b'After four years of timidity, Senate Democrats say they will finally vote on a budget this year, no longer afraid to stand up for higher tax revenues and targeted spending increases. That is a sign of progress, but it remains to be seen how strong a budget will pass and how many Democrats will back it.'b'Politicians play in a rugged arena and are understandably obsessed about losing power. But that power needs to be used for something other than perpetual re-election. The next two years will challenge lawmakers of both parties to demonstrate that they came to Washington for a purpose.'b'You see America and its education system in all their glorious, exhilarating, crushing, infuriating contradictions in our national high school chess champion team.'b'Chess tends to be the domain of privileged schools whose star players have had their own personal chess coaches since elementary school. Yet the national champion team comes from a high-poverty, inner-city school, and four-fifths of its members are black or Hispanic.'b'More astounding, these aren\xe2\x80\x99t even high school kids yet. In April, New York\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Intermediate School 318'b' in Brooklyn, where 70 percent of students qualify for free or reduced-price lunches, 'b'became the first middle school team ever'b' to defeat kids about four years older and win the national high school championship.'b'The champs are kids like Carlos Tapia, a Mexican-American in the eighth grade, whose dad is a house painter and mom a maid. The parents can\xe2\x80\x99t play chess and can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to give Carlos his own room, but they proudly make space for his 18 chess trophies.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cChess teaches me self-control\xe2\x80\x9d that spills over into other schoolwork, Carlos said in the I.S. 318 chess room, as a rainbow of students hunched over their boards, brows furrowed.'b'This will be my last column for a number of months, as I\xe2\x80\x99m taking a leave to work on a new book with my wife.

The truth is that covering inequality, injustice and poverty can actually be inspiring and uplifting because of kids like Carlos. Just sprinkle opportunity around, and dazzling talents turn up.'b'This isn\xe2\x80\x99t about chess. It\xe2\x80\x99s about investing in kids in ways that transform their trajectories forever. The returns on capital would make Wall Street jealous.'b'Take Rochelle Ballantyne, who was raised by a single mom from Trinidad and soared on the I.S. 318 chess team. Rochelle, now 17 and aiming to become the first African-American woman to become a chess master, has won a full scholarship to Stanford University. She\xe2\x80\x99s planning to attend even though she has never visited the campus.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe were meant to break stereotypes,\xe2\x80\x9d Rochelle told me. \xe2\x80\x9cChess isn\xe2\x80\x99t something people are good at because of the color of their skin. We just really work very hard at it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That seems to be the secret. A part-time chess tutor named Elizabeth Spiegel arrived at I.S. 318 in 1999 and parlayed a tiny budget into a team that drills tirelessly. A dynamic, passionate teacher who volunteered much of her time, she nurtured a team that since 2000 has won more middle school championships than any other in the country.'b'One way of assessing what she has accomplished: Based on estimated chess ratings, Albert Einstein would rank third on the I.S. 318 team.'b'I wish the column could end on this triumphant note. But if these extraordinary kids are a reminder of what can happen when we invest in creating opportunity, they are also a reminder that budget cuts fall disproportionately on the needy.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFunding for extracurricular activities has dried up,\xe2\x80\x9d said John Galvin, an assistant principal who oversees the 95-member chess team. The kids run bake sales, candy sales and walkathons to raise the $50,000 needed to attend tournaments each year, but on trips they sometimes survive on peanut butter.'b'Galvin has tried approaching corporations and hedge funds for donations but has had little luck. Budget cuts have already trimmed the after-school chess club to three days a week from five.'b'A moving documentary about the team, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Brooklyn Castle'b',\xe2\x80\x9d is scheduled to air on PBS later this year, and that may help with fund-raising.'b'But similar cutbacks are playing out all across America. In 35 states, inflation-adjusted school financing is below 2008 levels, 'b'according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities'b'. As of July, school districts have slashed 328,000 jobs since 2008, and budget cuts have devastated early childhood education that lays the foundation for children\xe2\x80\x99s lives.'b'Affluent kids continue to enjoy nursery school and chess tutors, even as programs for poor kids are eliminated. Education is the best escalator out of poverty, but for too many kids it\xe2\x80\x99s creaking to a standstill.'b'As we make historic fiscal decisions in the coming months, let\xe2\x80\x99s not balance budgets by slashing investments in our future. That would be like economizing on heating bills by feeding the front door into the fire.'b'While on leave, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be rooting for kids like Carlos to soar to another national championship \xe2\x80\x94 and far beyond. Given the returns, the question isn\xe2\x80\x99t whether we can afford to invest in opportunities for kids but how we can possibly afford not to.'b'You may not think of your cat as an invasive species. 'b'But it is'b', in fact, a kind of superpredator, camouflaged by its affinity for humans, its playfulness, its ingratiating independence. Anywhere outdoors, the domestic cat occupies a dominant and unthreatened niche; its few natural enemies, like coyotes, are no match for tens of millions of free-roaming cats, including beloved pets and feral cats.'b''b'A new report'b' by the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service presents a staggering picture of the damage cats can do \xe2\x80\x94 some 2.4 billion birds and 12.3 billion mammals killed a year as a median range. The prey are not just noxious rodents like rats, but small native mammals of every description. In fact, cats kill more wild creatures in the United States than any other human-linked cause \xe2\x80\x94 including automobiles, pesticides and buildings that migratory birds collide into.'b'Most of the killing is done by stray or feral cats, and there is no easy way to reduce that population. Programs that trap and neuter feral cats and then release them may actually encourage more people to abandon cats to the wild.
