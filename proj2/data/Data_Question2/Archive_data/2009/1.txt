b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cCall Off the Immigrant Hunt,\xe2\x80\x9d by Jorge G. Casta\xc3\xb1eda (Op-Ed, Dec. 28):'b'Without disagreeing with Professor Casta\xc3\xb1eda\xe2\x80\x99s plea for more humane treatment of illegal immigrants, I would like to ask what he did while he was a member of the Mexican cabinet to improve the economic lot of his people and so stem the tide of illegal immigration into the United States. Human rights organizations rightly monitor and condemn abuses like censorship and persecution of political opponents. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t a government\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide its citizens with sanitation, basic education and the means of feeding their families also an abuse of human rights?'b'The United States is good at putting pressure on Iran, India, Pakistan and Korea on various issues, and at calling to account nations where coca and opium poppies are grown. Why does the United States not engage countries that compel their citizens to leave or die?'b'It seems to me that illegal immigration is not principally an enforcement failure. It is a foreign policy failure.'b'Alma Suzin Flesch'b'New York, Dec. 28, 2008'b'\xc2\x95'b'To the Editor:'b'We must support our government\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to finally enforce our immigration laws. At a time of rising unemployment and financial uncertainty, we must protect United States workers from the wage competition brought on by mass immigration.'b'With state and local budgets stretched beyond repair, we cannot continue to provide benefits for anyone who wants to sneak into the country. If we want to create a sustainable society, we must recognize that there are limits to the number of people we can employ, house, feed and provide health care for.'b'Current legal immigration levels are far higher than our historical average  and are causing dramatic long-term problems for our basic infrastructure, resources and environment. Think of the impact if we add an unlimited number of illegal immigrants.'b'As a nation we must get serious about enforcing our immigration laws and returning to historical immigration rates.

Casta\xc3\xb1eda, the former foreign minister of Mexico, should worry more about the mess in his own country than about United States policy toward illegal immigrants.'b'Mexico is actually relatively wealthy by world standards and used to have a substantial middle class, but corruption has changed that. In fact, our crackdown on illegal immigrants, which Mr. Casta\xc3\xb1eda opposes, might help Mexico deal with these problems.'b'Why? Because those who are willing to risk so much to sneak across the border are the same people who would be most likely to push for change in their own country should we continue to eliminate the incentives for them to come here.'b'By functioning as a safety valve, we are enabling our southern neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s bad policies.

Along the edge of the road there is still a steep mound covered with gravel, a snowplow moraine. But the yard and pastures are suddenly bare. To the dogs, this snowy farm was, I think, a relatively scentless place. They stood on the drifts snuffing the air around them, sometimes digging at a vole track under the surface. Now they walk in the old way, noses down, questioning the soil.'b'The melt came swiftly, with temperatures pushing 60. Soon, the dry stream west of the barn \xe2\x80\x94 a staircase of bare rock much of the year \xe2\x80\x94 was running hard. For an hour or two that afternoon, even the bees came out, and that evening, to my surprise, I saw a bat swooping low under the porch lights. Yet this did not feel like a false start, a premature spring as disheartening as it was warm. It felt like getting back to the bare foundation so that winter can begin all over again.'b'The new year is always a kind of chronological trope, an imaginary point of debarkation. We are so deeply knotted to time past and time future that come Jan. 1, we are hardly shoving off for parts unknown. Still, the change implicit in the new year can be a mental leap forward, a recasting of the imagination. Entering the new year also can be an act of conscience, and more so this year than in many years past.'b'Somehow it\xe2\x80\x99s fitting to come into the new year on bare ground, even as the snow is gathering again. It makes it so much easier to take account of the work to be done, the decisions to be made and, for that matter, unmade. Some years it is just a gray transition from one calendar to the next, the resumption of a postponed meeting and an old agenda. But that is not how this new year feels. Time for the rotting fence posts to be replaced, the sagging gates to be rehung.'b'The freeze will come again, and the stream at the back of the property will recede into dryness. Snow will fall, and when the wind picks up, as it nearly always does, the snow will drift into a whole new landscape, bearing only an oblique relation to the past.   'b'VERLYN KLINKENBORG'b''b'PHNOM PENH, Cambodia'b'Western men who visit red-light districts in poor countries often find themselves surrounded by coquettish teenage girls laughingly tugging them toward the brothels. The men assume that the girls are there voluntarily, and in some cases they are right.'b'But anyone inclined to take the girls\xe2\x80\x99 smiles at face value should talk to Sina Vann, who was once one of those smiling girls.'b'Sina is Vietnamese but was kidnapped at the age of 13 and taken to Cambodia, where she was drugged. She said she woke up naked and bloody on a bed with a white man \xe2\x80\x94 she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know his nationality \xe2\x80\x94 who had purchased her virginity.'b'After that, she was locked on the upper floors of a nice hotel and offered to Western men and wealthy Cambodians. She said she was beaten ferociously to force her to smile and act seductive.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy first phrase in Khmer,\xe2\x80\x9d the Cambodian language, \xe2\x80\x9cwas, \xe2\x80\x98I want to sleep with you,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy first phrase in English was\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 well, it\xe2\x80\x99s unprintable.'b'Sina mostly followed instructions and smiled alluringly at men because she would have been beaten if men didn\xe2\x80\x99t choose her. But sometimes she was in such pain that she resisted, and then she said she would be dragged down to a torture chamber in the basement.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMany of the brothels have these torture chambers,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are underground because then the girls\xe2\x80\x99 screams are muffled.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As in many brothels, the torture of choice was electric shocks. Sina would be tied down, doused in water and then prodded with wires running from the 220-volt wall outlet. The jolt causes intense pain, sometimes evacuation of the bladder and bowel \xe2\x80\x94 and even unconsciousness.'b'Shocks fit well into the brothel business model because they cause agonizing pain and terrify the girls without damaging their looks or undermining their market value.'b'After the beatings and shocks, Sina said she would be locked naked in a wooden coffin full of biting ants. The coffin was dark, suffocating and so tight that she could not move her hands up to her face to brush off the ants. Her tears washed the ants out of her eyes.'b'She was locked in the coffin for a day or two at a time, and she said this happened many, many times.'b'Finally, Sina was freed in a police raid, and found herself blinded by the first daylight she had seen in years. The raid was organized by Somaly Mam, a Cambodian woman who herself had been sold into the brothels but managed to escape, educate herself and now heads a foundation fighting forced prostitution.'b'After being freed, Sina began studying and eventually became one of Somaly\xe2\x80\x99s trusted lieutenants. They now work together, in defiance of death threats from brothel owners, to free other girls. To get at Somaly, the brothel owners kidnapped and brutalized her 14-year-old daughter. And six months ago, the daughter of another anti-trafficking activist (my interpreter when I interviewed Sina) went missing.'b'I had heard about torture chambers under the brothels but had never seen one, so a few days ago Sina took me to the red-light district here where she once was imprisoned. A brothel had been torn down, revealing a warren of dungeons underneath.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was in a room just like those,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pointing. \xe2\x80\x9cThere must be many girls who died in those rooms.\xe2\x80\x9d She grew distressed and added: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m cold and afraid. Tonight I won\xe2\x80\x99t sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPhotograph quickly,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, and pointed to brothels lining the street. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not safe to stay here long.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Sina and Somaly sustain themselves with a wicked sense of humor. They tease each other mercilessly, with Sina, who is single, mock-scolding Somaly: \xe2\x80\x9cAt least I had plenty of men until you had to come along and rescue me!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Sex trafficking is truly the 21st century\xe2\x80\x99s version of slavery. One of the differences from 19th-century slavery is that many of these modern slaves will die of AIDS by their late 20s.'b'Whenever I report on sex trafficking, I come away less depressed by the atrocities than inspired by the courage of modern abolitionists like Somaly and Sina. They are risking their lives to help others still locked up in the brothels, and they have the credibility and experience to lead this fight. In my next column, I\xe2\x80\x99ll introduce a girl that Sina is now helping to recover from mind-boggling torture in a brothel \xe2\x80\x94 and Sina\xe2\x80\x99s own story gives hope to the girl in a way that an army of psychologists couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'I hope that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton will recognize slavery as unfinished business on the foreign policy agenda. The abolitionist cause simply hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been completed as long as 14-year-old girls are being jolted with electric shocks \xe2\x80\x94 right now, as you read this \xe2\x80\x94 to make them smile before oblivious tourists.'b'This country puts too many people behind bars for too long. Most elected officials, afraid of being tarred as soft on crime, ignore these problems. Sen. Jim Webb, a Democrat of Virginia, is now courageously stepping into the void, calling for a national commission to re-assess criminal justice policy. Other members of Congress should show the same courage and rally to the cause.'b'The United States has the world\xe2\x80\x99s highest reported incarceration rate. Although it has less than 5 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s population, it has almost one-quarter of the world\xe2\x80\x99s prisoners. And for the first time in history, more than 1 in 100 American adults are behind bars.'b'Many inmates are serving long sentences for nonviolent crimes, including minor drug offenses. It also is extraordinarily expensive. Billions of dollars now being spent on prisons each year could be used in far more socially productive ways.'b'Senator Webb \xe2\x80\x94 a former Marine and secretary of the Navy in the Reagan administration \xe2\x80\x94 is in many ways an unlikely person to champion criminal justice reform. But his background makes him an especially effective advocate for a cause that has often been associated with liberals and academics.'b'In his two years in the Senate, Mr. Webb has held hearings on the cost of mass incarceration and on the criminal justice system\xe2\x80\x99s response to the problems of illegal drugs. He also has called attention to the challenges of prisoner re-entry and of the need to provide released inmates, who have paid their debts to society, more help getting jobs and resuming productive lives.'b'Mr. Webb says he intends to introduce legislation to create a national commission to investigate these issues. With Barack Obama in the White House, and strong Democratic majorities in Congress, the political climate should be more favorable than it has been in years. And the economic downturn should make both federal and state lawmakers receptive to the idea of reforming a prison system that is as wasteful as it is inhumane.'b'This winter day begins a new year of the mortgage crisis. Nothing is certain about the miseries ahead except that they are growing. It is, for example, a freezing morning on Long Island \xe2\x80\x94  a national symbol of the single-family suburb. Its two counties, Nassau and Suffolk, boast well-run governments, an educated work force and a long history of stability and affluence. Comfort and consumption are the twin strands of their DNA. But the struggle there is acute.'b'In Nassau County, New York State\xe2\x80\x99s richest one, the foreclosure whirlwind hit hard. Shelters are filling up and food pantries are emptying. More than 500 people sought emergency housing from the county in a recent December week. Most were families with children.'b'Connie Lassandro, Nassau\xe2\x80\x99s director of housing and homeless services, said the need had risen 30 percent to 40 percent over 2007, as the face of poverty changed. More overburdened homeowners and the elderly are coming forward now \xe2\x80\x94 often bewildered and ashamed.'b'Private outreach organizations, too, are buried under an avalanche of need. Alric Kennedy, director of community resources for the Long Island Council of Churches, said the council used to be able to help some clients with a month\xe2\x80\x99s rent or mortgage but the money ran out last October. It referred people to other agencies until those funds dried up, too. More people than ever are coming to its emergency food centers \xe2\x80\x94 40 to 60 on a typical day in Freeport, in Nassau; 100 or more seek help in Riverhead, in eastern Suffolk. They are desperate for food, diapers, cooking oil and baby formula.'b'These are not the chronic homeless. \xe2\x80\x9cOur donors are now our clients,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kennedy said. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople who gave us food are now asking us to help them.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As people lose not only homes but also jobs, pain is cascading to the bottom rungs of the economy. The Workplace Project, a longstanding defender of immigrant workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights in Hempstead, has seen an alarming rise in reports of unpaid wages, said Nadia Marin-Molina, its executive director. Contractors are cutting costs by missing payrolls and are counting on an undocumented work force not to complain.'b'Domestic workers are seeing wages cut in half, Ms. Marin-Molina said, as their bosses tell them to come back to clean house every other week.'b'When the undocumented lose their jobs and homes, there is no government agency they can turn to. Some of that need is being met by charitable organizations. The Huntington Interfaith Homeless Initiative is a network of church volunteers who give homeless men, mostly Latino immigrants, an alternative to sleeping \xe2\x80\x94 and freezing \xe2\x80\x94 in the woods. In cold months, they take them into church halls and basements, offering meals, winter coats and hot showers. They do this into the spring. But this economic chill won\xe2\x80\x99t be gone by then.'b'Nassau County\xe2\x80\x99s comptroller announced this week that sales taxes \xe2\x80\x94 a mainstay of county revenue \xe2\x80\x94 could fall for the first time in nearly 20 years, which would blow a $24 million hole in the 2008 budget. Other local governments and nonprofits are looking to the federal government for help and for billions that might refill empty coffers and loosen tightened belts. But there are no assurances that the aid will be enough \xe2\x80\x94 only uncertainty in a place that has been shaken to the core.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing this for over 30 years, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen it like this,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Lassandro of Nassau County said. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody\xe2\x80\x99s exempt from it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ms. Marin-Molina was astounded by the turnout for The Workplace Project\xe2\x80\x99s annual Christmas party. \xe2\x80\x9cAn incredible number of people came,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least a hundred.\xe2\x80\x9d Most were men who needed help and were grateful to go home after a hot meal with donated sweatshirts, hats and gloves.'b'The Republican Party paid a steep price for race-baiting in the presidential campaign. Remember the ferocious backlash against the California Republican group that produced a racist newsletter depicting Barack Obama on a food stamp, surrounded by images of fried chicken and watermelon?'b'Then there were those two congressmen who were rightly excoriated for condemning Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy in the language of the Jim Crow South \xe2\x80\x94 one describing him as a \xe2\x80\x9cboy\xe2\x80\x9d and the other as \xe2\x80\x9cuppity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We thought after all that \xe2\x80\x94 and, oh yes, losing the election \xe2\x80\x94 everyone in the Republican Party leadership would have figured out that race-baiting alienates young, minority and all reasonable voters.'b'Clearly, not everyone has.'b'Chip Saltsman, a veteran political operative, is pushing his candidacy for chairman of the Republican National Committee.

One faction thinks the parody is just fine and seems prepared to defend it to the death. The other is condemning it and shuddering at its political consequences.'b'Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, warned his party against using \xe2\x80\x9cracist descriptions\xe2\x80\x9d and said that the parody should \xe2\x80\x9cdisqualify any Republican National Committee candidate who would use it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Saltsman, who was Mike Huckabee\xe2\x80\x99s campaign manager during the primaries, could still be vaulted into the chairman\xe2\x80\x99s seat by hard-core committee members who resent the explosion of criticism and have learned nothing from the last election.'b'Maybe they like the hole their party is standing in and want to dig it even deeper.

If not, why is the mullah-led government trying to shut down the operations of Shirin Ebadi?'b'Ms. Ebadi, a lawyer and her country\xe2\x80\x99s leading human rights activist, is the first Muslim woman to win a Nobel Peace Prize. On Monday, the authorities stormed her private office, seizing her computers and her clients\xe2\x80\x99 documents. A week earlier, they closed her Center for Defenders of Human Rights, a coalition of human rights groups and other activists whose members had planned to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the United Nations\xe2\x80\x99 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.'b'When she was awarded the peace prize in 2003, the Nobel committee called Ms. Ebadi \xe2\x80\x9ca courageous person\xe2\x80\x9d for standing up against Iran\xe2\x80\x99s bullying government. In the years since, she has endured repeated death threats from radical groups and regular government intimidation. That courage has never faltered.'b'With presidential elections scheduled for June, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his allies apparently decided they could not risk letting Ms. Ebadi continue the work she has done with distinction (and without pay) for the past 15 years \xe2\x80\x94 exposing government violations of human rights and defending human rights and democracy activists.'b'No doubt the authorities were unhappy with a report produced by her center that was cited recently by the United Nations\xe2\x80\x99 secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, when the General Assembly approved a nonbinding resolution condemning Iran\xe2\x80\x99s human rights record. But we suspect their ambitions go far beyond trying to suppress one report. They are clearly hoping to intimidate Ms. Ebadi and all other independent voices in Iran.

David Paterson\xe2\x80\x99s $121 billion doomsday budget has the virtue, at least, of matching scarce dollars against harsh reality. We have commended him for trying to spread the pain, and urged him to stand firm against the interest groups that would put their needs above the stability and solvency of New York State.'b'Dollars will be restored here and cut there in the negotiations to come. When they are, there is one interest group, quieter and far less powerful than most, that always needs a voice. That is the poor, among whose setbacks in this budget is the zeroing-out of noncriminal legal services \xe2\x80\x94 a chronically underfunded need for which, in this budget, there is no funding at all.'b'In the real world \xe2\x80\x94 unlike courtroom TV \xe2\x80\x94 people usually get the justice they can pay for, and those who cannot afford lawyers end up bearing an unfair burden. People need decent representation when doing battle with bad landlords and employers, callous health maintenance organizations and government agencies, disgruntled business partners and grasping relatives. And in an era of predatory home loans, the legal needs of distressed homeowners are urgent and steadily rising.'b'Advocates for the poor argue, persuasively, that outlays for civil legal services are budgetary pennies that save many dollars. A foreclosure prevented is an eviction avoided, a family kept from homelessness \xe2\x80\x94 and a considerable burden lifted from the government\xe2\x80\x99s social-service safety net. With legal help, poor people can avoid litigation, easing the load on judges and courtrooms. They can get food stamps, leveraging federal dollars in an underused program. If they avoid the poorhouse they will have, by definition, more money to spend, increasing sales tax revenues and benefiting local businesses.'b'Gov. Eliot Spitzer once thought he had a painless way to increase the financing stream for civil legal services. It was to raise the interest rate on the funds that law firms hold for clients in escrow accounts. The Interest on Lawyer Account Fund is a mainstay for financing civil legal services, and when it rose, it helped state spending reach a high of nearly $16 million last year.'b'But the fund has plunged in the economic downturn, and subsequent budget cuts have taken big bites out of civil legal services. The funding cuts have come at the worst possible time. The Legislature and Mr. Paterson must take care to save money by spending a little more in the right places, like civil legal services.'b'Everything becomes a shorter version of itself.

In a time of economic crisis, common sense tells you to hunker down and save money. But this is the exact moment when a central bank has to lend freely and spend profligately.'b'As individuals, we hope to be honest and transparent, but financial regulators often work best being opaque and capricious. That way they can serve as lenders of last resort while still keeping firms nervous and cautious.'b'Fundamentally, Caldwell is asking an uncomfortable question about the morality of capitalism. The system is not just based on hard work. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be blunt, credit is successfully re-established when financial elites say, \xe2\x80\x98When.\xe2\x80\x99 Credit is close to a synonym for the mood of the ruling class. To say an economy is based on credit is to say it is based on animal mysteries.

I envision the lot of us driving home, solitary scholars in our cars, growing sadder by the mile.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the 'b'March 12 issue'b' of The New Republic, John Judis gave us an early, brilliant explanation of the Barack Obama phenomenon. America has always had an Adamic tradition, Judis noted, a desire to begin anew. As D. H. Lawrence wrote, America \xe2\x80\x9cstarts old, old, wrinkled and writhing in an old skin. And there is a gradual sloughing of the old skin, towards a new youth.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Judis showed how this desire has played out in American literature, from Melville\xe2\x80\x99s Billy Budd to Fitzgerald\xe2\x80\x99s Gatsby, and in politics, from Jackson to Kennedy to Obama. He showed how Obama unconsciously played on the Adamic chords. He concluded on a hopeful but nervous note: \xe2\x80\x9cThe American instinct to continuously remake ourselves in the image of Adam \xe2\x80\x94 to achieve a decisive and final break with history \xe2\x80\x94 has periodically proven seductive to voters. And, sometimes, this instinct can produce important, transformative results. Yet the past \xe2\x80\x94 in the form of race or war or deeply held partisan animosities \xe2\x80\x94 has a way of lingering around.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is a nation of suburbs, so why should it not also be a nation of suburban political bosses?'b'The old-time city bosses, their powerful political machines and their attraction for reform-minded prosecutors are all icons of American history. Almost everyone has heard of William Tweed, the Boss Tweed of 19th-century New York; James Michael Curley of Boston, fictionalized in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Last Hurrah\xe2\x80\x9d; and Frank Hague of Jersey City, known for his declaration, \xe2\x80\x9cI am the law.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'More recently, but without much notice, bosses (and their organizations) have begun to flourish among suburbia\xe2\x80\x99s manicured lawns and megamansions, where jobs, not Christmas turkeys, are the coin of the realm.'b'Joseph Margiotta, who died  last month, ruled the Nassau County Republican Party in the 1960s and \xe2\x80\x9970s as a personal fief. Even lifeguards, it was said, had to go through Mr. Margiotta to get their jobs, and figures like former Senator Alfonse D\xe2\x80\x99Amato and Joseph Mondello, the current state Republican chairman, owed their starts to him.'b'Mr. Margiotta\xe2\x80\x99s reign might have continued longer were it not for those pesky prosecutors, who in his case obtained a conviction related to the payment of insurance commissions to party stalwarts who did little work.'b'New Jersey, where influence-peddling is a way of life, has produced its fair share of machines. A vibrant example is the apparatus, still very much in business, assembled in recent years  by Joseph Ferriero, a Democrat in Bergen County.'b'The county \xe2\x80\x94 which lies just over the George Washington Bridge and includes several of the state\xe2\x80\x99s wealthiest towns \xe2\x80\x94 was solidly Republican until Mr. Ferriero took hold of a moribund Democratic organization 10 years ago. His organizing skills are impressive, his ability to raise campaign money extraordinary. He is particularly adept at connecting government contracts and campaign donors.'b'In a few short years, Mr. Ferriero turned the seven-member freeholder board, the county\xe2\x80\x99s legislative body, from all Republican to all Democratic. A Ferriero loyalist was elected county executive in 2002 and re-elected in 2006.'b'Like the bosses of old, Mr. Ferriero has also found himself in trouble with the authorities. In September, he was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges that he arranged for municipal governments to channel work to a consulting firm he was associated with. The trial is scheduled for late in 2009, and he has taken a leave of absence as the county\xe2\x80\x99s party chairman.'b'But his influence apparently remains undiminished. This is a man, after all, who  handpicked candidates in most of the county\xe2\x80\x99s legislative districts and helped Gov. Jon Corzine get his start in politics. As is  true of bosses, stories about him abound. At his peak, he frequented expensive restaurants and, according to those who dined with him, ordered exotic items not on the menu. At lunches, he would answer one cellphone call after another while his dining partners cooled their heels.'b'Such was his power that Republicans believed he could change the outcome of even Republican primaries. One prominent Republican insists that in 2006 Mr. Ferriero persuaded so many of his friends to vote in a local primary that the weaker candidate ended up winning.'b'Some important Democrats, including Mr. Corzine and Representative Steven Rothman, have had enough, and are trying to oust Mr. Ferriero as party chairman.'b'But only the party\xe2\x80\x99s county committee can boot him out. And Mr. Ferriero, like any self-respecting political boss \xe2\x80\x94 past, present and future \xe2\x80\x94 has taken the precaution of packing the committee with people who owe him everything.

Did Rush Limbaugh really suggest that the financial crisis was the result of a conspiracy, masterminded by that evil genius Chuck Schumer?'b'But most of the whining takes the form of claims that the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s failure was simply a matter of bad luck \xe2\x80\x94 either the bad luck of President Bush himself, who just happened to have disasters happen on his watch, or the bad luck of the G.O.P., which just happened to send the wrong man to the White House.'b'The fault, however, lies not in Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 stars but in themselves. Forty years ago the G.O.P. decided, in effect, to make itself the party of racial backlash. And everything that has happened in recent years, from the choice of Mr. Bush as the party\xe2\x80\x99s champion, to the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s pervasive incompetence, to the party\xe2\x80\x99s shrinking base, is a consequence of that decision.'b'If the Bush administration became a byword for policy bungles, for government by the unqualified, well, it was just following the advice of leading conservative think tanks: after the 2000 election the Heritage Foundation specifically urged the new team to \xe2\x80\x9cmake appointments based on loyalty first and expertise second.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Contempt for expertise, in turn, rested on contempt for government in general. \xe2\x80\x9cGovernment is not the solution to our problem,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Ronald Reagan. \xe2\x80\x9cGovernment is the problem.\xe2\x80\x9d So why worry about governing well?'b'Where did this hostility to government come from? In 1981 Lee Atwater, the famed Republican political consultant, explained the evolution of the G.O.P.\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSouthern strategy,\xe2\x80\x9d which originally focused on opposition to the Voting Rights Act but eventually took a more coded form: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re getting so abstract now you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is blacks get hurt worse than whites.\xe2\x80\x9d In other words, government is the problem because it takes your money and gives it to Those People.'b'Oh, and the racial element isn\xe2\x80\x99t all that abstract, even now: Chip Saltsman, currently a candidate for the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee, sent committee members a CD including a song titled \xe2\x80\x9cBarack the Magic Negro\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x94 and according to some reports, the controversy over his action has actually helped his chances.'b'So the reign of George W. Bush, the first true Southern Republican president since Reconstruction, was the culmination of a long process. And despite the claims of some on the right that Mr. Bush betrayed conservatism, the truth is that he faithfully carried out both his party\xe2\x80\x99s divisive tactics \xe2\x80\x94 long before Sarah Palin, Mr. Bush declared that he visited his ranch to \xe2\x80\x9cstay in touch with real Americans\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x94  and its governing philosophy.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why the soon-to-be-gone administration\xe2\x80\x99s failure is bigger than Mr. Bush himself: it represents the end of the line for a political strategy that dominated the scene for more than a generation.'b'The reality of this strategy\xe2\x80\x99s collapse has not, I believe, fully sunk in with some observers. Thus, some commentators warning President-elect Barack Obama against bold action have held up Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s political failures in his first two years as a cautionary tale.'b'But America in 1993 was a very different country  \xe2\x80\x94 not just a country that had yet to see what happens when conservatives control all three branches of government, but also a country in which Democratic control of Congress depended on the votes of Southern conservatives. Today, Republicans have taken away almost all those Southern votes   \xe2\x80\x94 and lost the rest of the country. It was a grand ride for a while, but in the end the Southern strategy led the G.O.P. into a cul-de-sac.'b'Mr. Obama therefore has room to be bold. If Republicans try a 1993-style strategy of attacking him for promoting big government, they\xe2\x80\x99ll learn two things: not only has the financial crisis discredited their economic theories, the racial subtext of anti-government rhetoric doesn\xe2\x80\x99t play the way it used to.'b'Will the Republicans eventually stage a comeback? Yes, of course. But barring some huge missteps by Mr. Obama, that will not happen until they stop whining and look at what really went wrong. And when they do, they will discover that they need to get in touch with the real \xe2\x80\x9creal America,\xe2\x80\x9d a country that is more diverse, more tolerant, and more demanding of effective government than is dreamt of in their political philosophy.'b'San Francisco'b'I  AM not adopted; I have mysterious origins.'b'I have said that sentence many times in the course of my life as an adopted person. I like it so much I put it into the mouth of a character in the novel I\xe2\x80\x99m writing. The character and I are both fond of the idea. We can think of ourselves as living in the dense pages of 19th-century fiction, where one\xe2\x80\x99s origins \xe2\x80\x94 the exact mother and father \xe2\x80\x94 are not nearly as important as one\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some might say I came to this rationalization because, until recently, everything surrounding my adoption was kept secret from me.

One might be gestated in an unknown womb while having genes from some combination of one\xe2\x80\x99s mother and  father and a stranger; from a mother\xe2\x80\x99s womb with some combination of known and unknown genes \xe2\x80\x94 not to mention the complication of untold numbers of half-siblings who might be out there from the  sperm donations of one man. There are adoptive parents and biological parents, surrogates and donors \xe2\x80\x94 adults of all sorts claiming parenthood by right of blood, genes, birth, law and affection.'b'Does one have the right to know all of these people? If so, do they have a reciprocal right to find the child in whose birth they participated?'b'I won\xe2\x80\x99t even try to answer these questions. It seems we must have a social conversation about this subject that will last for many years. The trend, certainly, is toward openness, a growing \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d to know. I am not against this trend. I simply want to give not-knowing its due.'b'I like mysteries. I like the sense of uniqueness that comes from having unknown origins (however false that sense may be). I have a dear friend who is also adopted. We spoke as we were considering whether we should enter our names into the New York State Adoption Registry, where we might learn something about our history.'b'My friend grew up in a small  town upstate near a university. She had constructed for herself a satisfying fantasy in which her mother and father were in town on fellowships from the World Bank, had the occupations \xe2\x80\x9cking\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cqueen,\xe2\x80\x9d had ruled in a remote region where everyone was fit, ate a diet centered upon yak yogurt and lived 110 years. She decided not to register. \xe2\x80\x9cOne family is quite enough for me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'My own fantasies were more vague: an evolving set of parents including actresses, folk singers, writers and intellectuals. I am certain that none were like the computer scientists and mathematicians who run up and down the bloodlines of my adoptive father\xe2\x80\x99s family. I think it is because of them, the example of those engineers and math professors, that I went into software engineering, a field for which I do not have native talent. (I was good enough, but I had to work at it.) If I had been raised by the word-eaters \xe2\x80\x94 writers, readers and long-letter-writers \xe2\x80\x94 who I\xe2\x80\x99m certain were my \xe2\x80\x9cnatural\xe2\x80\x9d parents, I never would have spent 20 years as a computer programmer.'b'Which is exactly my point. I could just see my  birth mother looking up from George Eliot\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cDaniel Deronda\xe2\x80\x9d (Book V, \xe2\x80\x9cMordecai\xe2\x80\x9d) to say, \xe2\x80\x9cDarling, why struggle so on those cold programs when you haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet read \xe2\x80\x98Middlemarch\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d And so I might have put aside my sweaty attempt to write a bubble-sort algorithm \xe2\x80\x94 and thereby missed the defining profession of my time.'b'No one is a genetic match to his or her parents. Nature has gone to a great deal of trouble to see that we are not like them (a strong argument against adding cloning to the human parental mix). Through the miracle of natural genetic recombination, each child, with the sole exception of an identical twin, is conceived as a unique being. Even the atmosphere of the womb works its subtle changes, and by the time we emerge into the light, we are our own persons. Knowing every single ancestor, therefore, will never solve the deeper mystery, which of course is the dreadful question of who we become.'b'New Delhi'b'CHINA and India are in a struggle for a top rung on the ladder of world power, but their approaches to the state and to power could not be more different.'b'Two days after last month\xe2\x80\x99s terrorist attack on Mumbai, I met with a Chinese friend who was visiting India on business. He was shocked as much by the transparent and competitive minute-by-minute reporting of the attack by India\xe2\x80\x99s dozens of news channels as by the ineffectual response of the government. He had seen a middle-class housewife on national television tell a reporter that the Indian commandos delayed in engaging the terrorists because they were too busy guarding political big shots. He asked how the woman could get away with such a statement.'b'I explained sarcasm resonates in a nation that is angry and disappointed with its politicians. My friend switched the subject to the poor condition of India\xe2\x80\x99s roads, its dilapidated cities and the constant blackouts. Suddenly, he stopped and asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWith all this, how did you become the second-fastest growing economy in the world? China\xe2\x80\x99s leaders fear the day when India\xe2\x80\x99s government will get its act together.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The answer to his question may lie in a common saying among Indians that \xe2\x80\x9cour economy grows at night when the government is asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d As if to illustrate this, the Mumbai stock market rose in the period after the terrorist attacks. Two weeks later, in several  state elections, incumbents were ousted over economic issues, not security.'b'All this baffled my Chinese friend, and undoubtedly many of his countrymen, whose own success story has been scripted by an efficient state. They are uneasy because their chief ally, Pakistan, is consistently linked to terrorism while across the border India\xe2\x80\x99s economy keeps rising disdainfully. It puzzles them that the anger in India over the Mumbai attacks is directed against Indian politicians rather than Muslims or Pakistan.'b'The global financial crisis has definitely affected India\xe2\x80\x99s growth, and it will be down to perhaps 7 percent this year from 8.7 percent in 2007. According to my friend, China is hurting even more. What really perplexes the Chinese, he said, is that scores of nations  have engaged in the same sorts of economic reforms as India, so why is it that it\xe2\x80\x99s  the Indian economy that has become the developing world\xe2\x80\x99s second best? The speed with which India is creating world-class companies is also a shock to the Chinese, whose corporate structure is based on state-owned and foreign companies.'b'I have no  satisfactory explanation for all this, but I think it may have something to do with India\xe2\x80\x99s much-reviled caste system. Vaishyas, members of the merchant caste, who have learned over generations how to accumulate capital, give  the nation a competitive advantage. Classical liberals may be right in thinking that commerce is a natural trait, but it helps if there is a devoted group of risk-taking entrepreneurs around to take advantage of the opportunity. Not surprisingly, Vaishyas still dominate the Forbes list of Indian billionaires.'b'In a much-discussed magazine article last year, Lee Kwan Yew, the former prime minister  of Singapore, raised an important question: Why does the rest of the world view China\xe2\x80\x99s rise as a threat but India\xe2\x80\x99s as a wonderful success story? The answer is that India is a vast, unwieldy, open democracy ruled by a coalition of 20 parties. It is evolving through a daily flow of ideas among  the conservative forces of caste and religion, the liberals who dominate intellectual life, and the new forces of global capitalism.'b'The idea of becoming a military power in the 21st century embarrasses many Indians. This ambivalence goes beyond Mahatma Gandhi\xe2\x80\x99s nonviolent struggle for India\xe2\x80\x99s freedom, or even the Buddha\xe2\x80\x99s message of peace. The skeptical Indian temper goes back to the 3,500-year-old \xe2\x80\x9cNasadiya\xe2\x80\x9d verse of the Rig Veda, which meditates on the creation of the universe: \xe2\x80\x9cWho knows and who can say, whence it was born and whence came this creation? The gods are later than this world\xe2\x80\x99s creation. Who knows then whence it first came into being?\xe2\x80\x9d When you have millions of gods, you cannot afford to be theologically narcissistic. It also makes you suspect power.'b'Both the Chinese and the Indians are convinced that their prosperity will only increase in the 21st century. In China it will be induced by the state; in India\xe2\x80\x99s case, it may well happen despite the state. Indians expect to continue their relentless march toward a modern, democratic, market-based future. In this, terrorist attacks are a noisy, tragic, but ultimately futile sideshow.'b'However, Indians are painfully aware that they must reform their government bureaucracy, police and judiciary \xe2\x80\x94 institutions, paradoxically, they were so proud of a generation ago. When that happens, India may become formidable, a thought that undoubtedly worries China\xe2\x80\x99s leaders.'b'Despite all the carping, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot that is good to say about 2008. The presidential election was great. Britney seems to be improving. George W. Bush is leaving. Eventually. That collider in Switzerland didn\xe2\x80\x99t create a universe-gobbling black hole.

We were pleased that Congress has now authorized even more money than Mr. Bush proposed: almost $50 billion to fight AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis around the world over the next five years. But there is little doubt that the president has played a key role in providing drug treatments or supportive care to millions of patients who would otherwise have gone untended.'b'It is a remarkable record for the leader of a party that had been reluctant in the Reagan era to deal with a disease whose victims at the time in this country were primarily gay men and injection drug users.'b'Equally remarkable was Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s decision to push through a costly new prescription drug benefit under the Medicare program for older Americans despite stout opposition in his party to government-run health care. It was the largest expansion of Medicare in decades and it dragged the program, at long last, into the modern medical era, in which drugs are a cornerstone of treatment.'b'We have objected to many features of the program \xe2\x80\x94 the refusal to allow the government to negotiate with manufacturers for lower prices, shortfalls in providing subsidies to low-income Americans, a failure to protect many patients from high out-of-pocket costs. Still, it has achieved its main goal by reducing the percentage of older Americans who lack drug coverage, from 33 percent before the program started to only 8 percent in 2006.'b'Less heralded was the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to grant Massachusetts a Medicaid waiver to redeploy federal funds to help start a universal health insurance program. The program took the controversial step of requiring all citizens to obtain health insurance or pay a penalty, precisely the sort of government mandate that drives many conservatives wild. By many measures it is off to a promising start and could become a model for other states or the federal government.'b'Another substantial health achievement came in the form of bricks and mortar, through the president\xe2\x80\x99s vigorous support of community health clinics. As Kevin Sack reported in The Times last week, Mr. Bush has doubled direct federal financing for community health centers, enabling the expansion or creation of almost 1,300 clinics in areas short of other medical resources. For many residents of poor urban neighborhoods and isolated rural areas, this is the only source of care other than possibly a costly hospital emergency room.'b'The program has its blemishes. It still falls far short of its goal of doubling the number of patients served. Almost half of the country\xe2\x80\x99s medically underserved areas still lack a health center site. Many clinics are short of staff members and do poorly at managing chronic diseases. And they typically find it difficult or impossible to refer uninsured patients, a large part of their clientele, to other health care providers for diagnostic tests like mammograms and colonoscopies or visits to cardiologists and other specialists.'b'And Mr. Bush has done almost nothing to shore up the public insurance programs, notably Medicaid and the State Children\xe2\x80\x99s Health Insurance Program, that provide the bulk of the clinics\xe2\x80\x99 funding through the patients they cover.'b'That is another reminder that despite these solid achievements, the country needs to do a lot more. It needs full-fledged health care reform that will improve the quality of medical care, reduce its overall cost and provide insurance for everyone, at affordable prices.'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it much, but I have been touched by the supernatural. I have personally felt the hot breath of the devil. I am a Jets fan.'b'If there were a cure, I would take it. I would go to the meetings, do whatever. But there is no cure for a curse, and the New York Jets football franchise is cursed.'b'Just ask its latest coach, a fine young man named Eric Mangini. Two years ago he was heralded as a genius and favored with a cameo appearance on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Sopranos.\xe2\x80\x9d He spent the second half of this season staring in disbelief as his team collapsed before his eyes for no apparent reason. On Monday he was summarily fired.'b'Just ask Brett Favre, one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever play the game. The Jets signed him in August, expecting great things, maybe even a championship. By the end of the season Favre, who is 39 and well past his prime, looked like a man in shock. Forget a championship; the team hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even made the playoffs.'b'You may scoff, but this is not a mere fan\xe2\x80\x99s lament. This is about a Faustian bargain on a football field. Trust me. Demons lurk.'b'January 12th, eight days before the inauguration of Barack Obama, will  be the 40th anniversary of the most glorious day in Jets history. On that date in 1969 a young Joe Namath and his upstart teammates pulled off the greatest upset in pro football history, defeating the mighty Baltimore Colts in the Super Bowl, 16-7.'b'As an obsessive and peculiarly sensitive fan, I knew during the course of that season that something odd was happening. A sense of unreality accompanied the Jets\xe2\x80\x99 march toward glory. Unseen forces were tipping footballs this way and that. Fortuitous gusts of wind would erupt inexplicably on the calmest of Sunday afternoons.'b'What I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know was that an adjustment had been made to the ordinary course of existence. A shift had taken place. Namath and his coach, the wily, grandfatherly Weeb Ewbank, had made a pact with the devil.'b'This is fairly widely known now. I bring it up for the following reasons: Because the anniversary is approaching and events this season so clearly showed that the unspeakable terms of the agreement remain rigidly in force; and because young Jets fans may not understand the source of their inevitable and unending pain.'b'How long has it been since the Jets went to the Super Bowl? Lyndon Johnson was president. Jacqueline Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis were newlyweds. Barack Obama was just 7 years old. And Favre hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even been born.'b'The first public hint that Namath and Ewbank had sold the soul of the franchise came at a Miami awards banquet, a few days before the Super Bowl, when Namath famously guaranteed a victory. But a Namath biographer, Mark Kriegel, tells us of a conversation that Joe had with a Long Island bartender named Tank Passuello before the team headed to Miami for the game.'b'Passuello told Namath that the Colts were roughly seven-to-one favorites. Namath told Passuello to \xe2\x80\x9cbet the ranch\xe2\x80\x9d on the Jets.'b'Passuello asked if he was sure.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPositive,\xe2\x80\x9d said Namath.'b'The game was one of the most famous in all of sports, and there is an iconic video image of Namath leaving the field at the Orange Bowl, his right arm raised and his index finger pointed skyward, as in, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re number one!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But I saw another sight that most fans missed. Ewbank\xe2\x80\x99s normally mild face was wild with demonic glee. He cackled like a madman. The devil had come through. The Jets had won the Super Bowl.'b'The payback  \xe2\x80\x94 unrelieved futility   \xe2\x80\x94 would last an eternity.'b'The Jets have had 13 coaches since Ewbank, including his unfortunately named son-in-law, Charley Winner. When Lou Holtz took over as coach in 1976, he seemed to know that weirdness was in the air. He made no grand pronouncements, promising fans only that the team would \xe2\x80\x9cmove the ball.\xe2\x80\x9d He then hedged even that modest bet by adding, \xe2\x80\x9cI just hope to God it\xe2\x80\x99s forward.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Holtz fled before the season ended, shrieking hysterically as he left town that \xe2\x80\x9cGod did not put Lou Holtz on this earth to coach pro football.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The devil could be heard roaring with laughter.'b'The great Bill Belichick was hired as head coach in January 2000, but he got wind of the curse and resigned after just one day.'b'The Jets have brief periods when they do well, but that only serves to make it more delightful for the devil when the raised hopes are dashed.'b'Hopes are rising again as the franchise searches for yet another coach. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you hear the laughter?'b'There is no cure.'b'Jerry and Eileen Bogin just celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re like two peas in a pod, except I\xe2\x80\x99m big and he\xe2\x80\x99s little,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bogin said with a chuckle.

Last month, the California Supreme Court gave its state law a disturbingly narrow interpretation that could discourage future good Samaritans from providing help out of fear of being sued.'b'The ruling came after the victim of a car crash sued her would-be rescuer for negligence. On Halloween night in 2004 the car in which Alexandra Van Horn was riding crashed into a light pole. When her co-worker, Lisa Torti, who was in another car, saw the accident, she rushed over to help. Worried that the wrecked car would catch fire or blow up, Ms. Torti lifted Ms. Van Horn out of the front passenger seat. Ms. Van Horn, who ended up being paralyzed, sued, contending that Ms. Torti\xe2\x80\x99s negligence in moving her caused her paralysis.'b'In her defense, Ms. Torti invoked California\xe2\x80\x99s good Samaritan law. All 50 states have laws of this kind, but the protection they offer varies. By a 4-to-3 vote, the California Supreme Court ruled that the state\xe2\x80\x99s law did not give Ms. Torti immunity from liability because it applies only to people who offer medical help.'b'The justices in the majority relied heavily on the fact that the California good Samaritan law is included in the part of the state\xe2\x80\x99s laws that covers emergency medical services. The dissenters, however, had the better argument. As they noted, by its plain language, the California law \xe2\x80\x94 which speaks generally of \xe2\x80\x9cemergency care\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 should apply to both medical and nonmedical help.'b'The implications of the ruling are disturbing. When people see an accident, the law should not discourage them from offering the best help they can. Now, however, Californians will have reason to hesitate. If they offer nonmedical help \xe2\x80\x94 like pulling someone out of a burning house, or rescuing a drowning person \xe2\x80\x94 they may be putting their life savings at risk.'b'California\xe2\x80\x99s Legislature should rewrite the law to make clear that anyone who makes a good-faith effort to help in an emergency, and acts reasonably, is protected. Other states should examine their own good Samaritan laws and see that they do not discourage well-meaning bystanders from aiding people in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way.'b'More than three years have gone by since the New Jersey Legislature required the state to install modern voting machines that provide printouts of each vote \xe2\x80\x94 the paper trail that experts regard as essential to fair and accurate elections. The machines are still nowhere in sight.'b'Deadlines have been imposed and proved meaningless. The latest deadline was New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, which of course has passed. Technically, the state is in violation of its own law, but nobody seems to care. Gov. Jon Corzine has said he will do something without specifying what.'b'New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s main problem is that for technical reasons it is virtually impossible to hook up a reliable printer to the Sequoia voting machines used in most of the state\xe2\x80\x99s voting precincts. One assemblywoman has called the printer attachment a \xe2\x80\x9cRube Goldberg\xe2\x80\x9d contraption that could cause more problems than it solves. A public interest lawsuit to prohibit further use of the Sequoia machines on grounds they are easily tampered with is scheduled for trial this month.'b'Governor Corzine and the state\xe2\x80\x99s election officials must now face reality: New Jersey needs new machines altogether, preferably an optical scan system that allows voters to mark paper ballots \xe2\x80\x94 much as students mark standardized tests in schools \xe2\x80\x94 and then feed the ballots into the scanners.'b'Mr. Corzine has argued that such a system, which he says could cost $80 million, is too expensive in view of the deep financial crisis and the state\xe2\x80\x99s huge deficit.

They watched our investment bankers and emulated them: for a long time now half the planet\xe2\x80\x99s college graduates seemed to want nothing more out of life than a job on Wall Street.'b'This is one reason the collapse of our financial system has inspired not merely a national but a global crisis of confidence. 'b'Good God'b', the world seems to be saying, 'b'if they don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they are doing with money, who does'b'?'b'Incredibly, intelligent people the world over remain willing to lend us money and even listen to our advice; they appear not to have realized the full extent of our madness. We have at least a brief chance to cure ourselves. But first we need to ask: of what?'b'To that end consider the strange story of Harry Markopolos. Mr. Markopolos is the former investment officer with Rampart Investment Management in Boston who, for nine years, tried to explain to the Securities and Exchange Commission that Bernard L. Madoff couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be anything other than a fraud. Mr. Madoff\xe2\x80\x99s investment performance, given his stated strategy, was not merely improbable but mathematically impossible. And so, Mr. Markopolos reasoned, Bernard Madoff must be doing something other than what he said he was doing.'b'In his devastatingly persuasive 17-page letter to the S.E.C., Mr. Markopolos saw two possible scenarios. In the \xe2\x80\x9cUnlikely\xe2\x80\x9d scenario: Mr. Madoff, who acted as a broker as well as an investor, was \xe2\x80\x9cfront-running\xe2\x80\x9d his brokerage customers. A customer might submit an order to Madoff Securities to buy shares in I.B.M. at a certain price, for example, and Madoff Securities instantly would buy I.B.M. shares for its own portfolio ahead of the customer order. If I.B.M.\xe2\x80\x99s shares rose, Mr. Madoff kept them; if they fell he fobbed them off onto the poor customer.'b'In the \xe2\x80\x9cHighly Likely\xe2\x80\x9d scenario, wrote Mr. Markopolos, \xe2\x80\x9cMadoff Securities is the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest Ponzi Scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d Which, as we now know, it was.'b'Harry Markopolos sent his report to the S.E.C. on Nov. 7, 2005 \xe2\x80\x94 more than three years before Mr. Madoff was finally exposed \xe2\x80\x94 but he had been trying to explain the fraud to them since 1999. He had no direct financial interest in exposing Mr. Madoff \xe2\x80\x94 he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an unhappy investor or a disgruntled employee. There was no way to short shares in Madoff Securities, and so Mr. Markopolos could not have made money directly from Mr. Madoff\xe2\x80\x99s failure. To judge from his letter, Harry Markopolos anticipated mainly downsides for himself: he declined to put his name on it for fear of what might happen to him and his family if anyone found out he had written it. And yet the S.E.C.\xe2\x80\x99s cursory investigation of Mr. Madoff pronounced him free of fraud.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s interesting about the Madoff scandal, in retrospect, is how little interest 'b'anyone'b' inside the financial system had in exposing it. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just Harry Markopolos who smelled a rat. As Mr. Markopolos explained in his letter, Goldman Sachs was refusing to do business with Mr. Madoff; many others doubted Mr. Madoff\xe2\x80\x99s profits or assumed he was front-running his customers and steered clear of him. Between the lines, Mr. Markopolos hinted that even some of Mr. Madoff\xe2\x80\x99s investors may have suspected that they were the beneficiaries of a scam. After all, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all that hard to see that the profits were too good to be true. Some of Mr. Madoff\xe2\x80\x99s investors may have reasoned that the worst that could happen to them, if the authorities put a stop to the front-running, was that a good thing would come to an end.'b'The Madoff scandal echoes a deeper absence inside our financial system, which has been undermined not merely by bad behavior but by the lack of checks and balances to discourage it. \xe2\x80\x9cGreed\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cut it as a satisfying explanation for the current financial crisis. Greed was necessary but insufficient; in any case, we are as likely to eliminate greed from our national character as we are lust and envy. The fixable problem isn\xe2\x80\x99t the greed of the few but the misaligned interests of the many.'b'A lot has been said and written, for instance, about the corrupting effects on Wall Street of gigantic bonuses. What happened inside the major Wall Street firms, though, was more deeply unsettling than greedy people lusting for big checks: leaders of public corporations, especially financial corporations, are as good as required to lead for the short term.'b'Richard Fuld, the former chief executive of Lehman Brothers, E. Stanley O\xe2\x80\x99Neal, the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch, and Charles O. Prince III, Citigroup\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive, may have paid themselves humongous sums of money at the end of each year, as a result of the bond market bonanza. But if any one of them had set himself up as a whistleblower \xe2\x80\x94 had stood up and said \xe2\x80\x9cthis business is irresponsible and we are not going to participate in it\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 he would probably have been fired. Not immediately, perhaps. But a few quarters of earnings that lagged behind those of every other Wall Street firm would invite outrage from subordinates, who would flee for other, less responsible firms, and from shareholders, who would call for his resignation. Eventually he\xe2\x80\x99d be replaced by someone willing to make money from the credit bubble.'b'OUR financial catastrophe, like Bernard Madoff\xe2\x80\x99s pyramid scheme, required all sorts of important, plugged-in people to sacrifice our collective long-term interests for short-term gain. The pressure to do this in today\xe2\x80\x99s financial markets is immense. Obviously the greater the market pressure to excel in the short term, the greater the need for pressure from outside the market to consider the longer term. But that\xe2\x80\x99s the problem: there is no longer any serious pressure from outside the market. The tyranny of the short term has extended itself with frightening ease into the entities that were meant to, one way or another, discipline Wall Street, and force it to consider its enlightened self-interest.'b'The credit-rating agencies, for instance.'b'Everyone now knows that Moody\xe2\x80\x99s and Standard &amp; Poor\xe2\x80\x99s botched their analyses of bonds backed by home mortgages. But their most costly mistake \xe2\x80\x94 one that deserves a lot more attention than it has received \xe2\x80\x94 lies in their area of putative expertise: measuring corporate risk.'b'Over the last 20 years American financial institutions have taken on more and more risk, with the blessing of regulators, with hardly a word from the rating agencies, which, incidentally, are paid by the issuers of the bonds they rate. Seldom if ever did Moody\xe2\x80\x99s or Standard &amp; Poor\xe2\x80\x99s say, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you put one more risky asset on your balance sheet, you will face a serious downgrade.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The American International Group, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, General Electric and the municipal bond guarantors Ambac Financial and MBIA all had triple-A ratings. (G.E. still does!) Large investment banks like Lehman and Merrill Lynch all had solid investment grade ratings. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost as if the higher the rating of a financial institution, the more likely it was to contribute to financial catastrophe. But of course all these big financial companies fueled the creation of the credit products that in turn fueled the revenues of Moody\xe2\x80\x99s and Standard &amp; Poor\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'These oligopolies, which are actually sanctioned by the S.E.C., didn\xe2\x80\x99t merely do their jobs badly. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t simply miss a few calls here and there. In pursuit of their own short-term earnings, they did exactly the opposite of what they were meant to do: rather than expose financial risk they systematically disguised it.'b'This is a subject that might be profitably explored in Washington. There are many questions an enterprising United States senator might want to ask the credit-rating agencies. Here is one: Why did you allow MBIA to keep its triple-A rating for so long? In 1990 MBIA was in the relatively simple business of insuring municipal bonds. It had $931 million in equity and only $200 million of debt \xe2\x80\x94 and a plausible triple-A rating.'b'By 2006 MBIA had plunged into the much riskier business of guaranteeing collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.\xe2\x80\x99s. But by then it had $7.2 billion in equity against an astounding $26.2 billion in debt. That is, even as it insured ever-greater risks in its business, it also took greater risks on its balance sheet.'b'Yet the rating agencies didn\xe2\x80\x99t so much as blink. On Wall Street the problem was hardly a secret: many people understood that MBIA didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve to be rated triple-A. As far back as 2002, a hedge fund called Gotham Partners published a persuasive report, widely circulated, entitled: \xe2\x80\x9cIs MBIA Triple A?\xe2\x80\x9d (The answer was obviously no.)'b'At the same time, almost everyone believed that the rating agencies would never downgrade MBIA, because doing so was not in their short-term financial interest. A downgrade of MBIA would force the rating agencies to go through the costly and cumbersome process of re-rating tens of thousands of credits that bore triple-A ratings simply by virtue of MBIA\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee. It would stick a wrench in the machine that enriched them. (In June, finally, the rating agencies downgraded MBIA, after MBIA\xe2\x80\x99s failure became such an open secret that nobody any longer cared about its formal credit rating.)'b'The S.E.C. now promises modest new measures to contain the damage that the rating agencies can do \xe2\x80\x94 measures that fail to address the central problem: that the raters are paid by the issuers.'b'But this should come as no surprise, for the S.E.C. itself is plagued by similarly wacky incentives. Indeed, one of the great social benefits of the Madoff scandal may be to finally reveal the S.E.C. for what it has become.'b'Created to protect investors from financial predators, the commission has somehow evolved into a mechanism for protecting financial predators with political clout from investors. (The task it has performed most diligently during this crisis has been to question, intimidate and impose rules on short-sellers \xe2\x80\x94 the only market players who have a financial incentive to expose fraud and abuse.)'b'The instinct to avoid short-term political heat is part of the problem; anything the S.E.C. does to roil the markets, or reduce the share price of any given company, also roils the careers of the people who run the S.E.C. Thus it seldom penalizes serious corporate and management malfeasance \xe2\x80\x94 out of some misguided notion that to do so would cause stock prices to fall, shareholders to suffer and confidence to be undermined. Preserving confidence, even when that confidence is false, has been near the top of the S.E.C.\xe2\x80\x99s agenda.'b'IT\xe2\x80\x99S not hard to see why the S.E.C. behaves as it does. If you work for the enforcement division of the S.E.C. you probably know in the back of your mind, and in the front too, that if you maintain good relations with Wall Street you might soon be paid huge sums of money to be employed by it.'b'The commission\xe2\x80\x99s most recent director of enforcement is the general counsel at JPMorgan Chase; the enforcement chief before him became general counsel at Deutsche Bank; and one of his predecessors became a managing director for Credit Suisse before moving on to Morgan Stanley. A casual observer could be forgiven for thinking that the whole point of landing the job as the S.E.C.\xe2\x80\x99s director of enforcement is to position oneself for the better paying one on Wall Street.'b'At the back of the version of Harry Markopolos\xe2\x80\x99s brave paper currently making the rounds is a copy of an e-mail message, dated April 2, 2008, from Mr. Markopolos to Jonathan S. Sokobin. Mr. Sokobin was then the new head of the commission\xe2\x80\x99s office of risk assessment, a job that had been vacant for more than a year after its previous occupant had left to \xe2\x80\x94 you guessed it \xe2\x80\x94 take a higher-paying job on Wall Street.'b'At any rate, Mr. Markopolos clearly hoped that a new face might mean a new ear \xe2\x80\x94 one that might be receptive to the truth. He phoned Mr. Sokobin and then sent him his paper. \xe2\x80\x9cAttached is a submission I\xe2\x80\x99ve made to the S.E.C. three times in Boston,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cEach time Boston sent this to New York. Meagan Cheung, branch chief, in New York actually investigated this but with no result that I am aware of. In my conversations with her, I did not believe that she had the derivatives or mathematical background to understand the violations.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'How does this happen? How can the person in charge of assessing Wall Street firms not have the tools to understand them? Is the S.E.C. that inept? Perhaps, but the problem inside the commission is far worse \xe2\x80\x94 because inept people can be replaced. The problem is systemic. The new director of risk assessment was no more likely to grasp the risk of Bernard Madoff than the old director of risk assessment because the new guy\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts and beliefs were guided by the same incentives: the need to curry favor with the politically influential and the desire to keep sweet the Wall Street elite.'b'And here\xe2\x80\x99s the most incredible thing of all: 18 months into the most spectacular man-made financial calamity in modern experience, nothing has been done to change that, or any of the other bad incentives that led us here in the first place.'b'SAY what you will about our government\xe2\x80\x99s approach to the financial crisis, you cannot accuse it of wasting its energy being consistent or trying to win over the masses. In the past year there have been at least seven different bailouts, and six different strategies. And none of them seem to have pleased anyone except a handful of financiers.'b'When Bear Stearns failed, the government induced JPMorgan Chase to buy it by offering a knockdown price and guaranteeing Bear Stearns\xe2\x80\x99s shakiest assets. Bear Stearns bondholders were made whole and its stockholders lost most of their money.'b'Then came the collapse of the government-sponsored entities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both promptly nationalized. Management was replaced, shareholders badly diluted, creditors left intact but with some uncertainty. Next came Lehman Brothers, which was, of course, allowed to go bankrupt. At first, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve claimed they had allowed Lehman to fail in order to signal that recklessly managed Wall Street firms did not all come with government guarantees; but then, when chaos ensued, and people started saying that letting Lehman fail was a dumb thing to have done, they changed their story and claimed they lacked the legal authority to rescue the firm.'b'But then a few days later A.I.G. failed, or tried to, yet was given the gift of life with enormous government loans. Washington Mutual and Wachovia promptly followed: the first was unceremoniously seized by the Treasury, wiping out both its creditors and shareholders; the second was batted around for a bit. Initially, the Treasury tried to persuade Citigroup to buy it \xe2\x80\x94 again at a knockdown price and with a guarantee of the bad assets. (The Bear Stearns model.) Eventually, Wachovia went to Wells Fargo, after the Internal Revenue Service jumped in and sweetened the pot with a tax subsidy.'b'In the middle of all this, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. persuaded Congress that he needed $700 billion to buy distressed assets from banks \xe2\x80\x94 telling the senators and representatives that if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t give him the money the stock market would collapse. Once handed the money, he abandoned his promised strategy, and instead of buying assets at market prices, began to overpay for preferred stocks in the banks themselves. Which is to say that he essentially began giving away billions of dollars to Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and a few others unnaturally selected for survival. The stock market fell anyway.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know what Mr. Paulson was thinking as he never really had to explain himself, at least not in public. But the general idea appears to be that if you give the banks capital they will in turn use it to make loans in order to stimulate the economy. Never mind that if you want banks to make smart, prudent loans, you probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give money to bankers who sunk themselves by making a lot of stupid, imprudent ones. If you want banks to re-lend the money, you need to provide them not with preferred stock, which is essentially a loan, but with tangible common equity \xe2\x80\x94 so that they might write off their losses, resolve their troubled assets and then begin to make new loans, something they won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to do until they\xe2\x80\x99re confident in their own balance sheets. But as it happened, the banks took the taxpayer money and just sat on it.'b''b'Continued at 'b'"How to Repair a Broken Financial World."'b' 'b''b''b'Continued from 'b'"The End of the Financial World As We Know It"'b''b''b'Mr. Paulson must have had some reason for doing what he did. No doubt he still believes that without all this frantic activity we\xe2\x80\x99d be far worse off than we are now. All we know for sure, however, is that the Treasury\xe2\x80\x99s heroic deal-making has had little effect on what it claims is the problem at hand: the collapse of confidence in the companies atop our financial system.'b'Weeks after receiving its first $25 billion taxpayer investment, Citigroup returned to the Treasury to confess that \xe2\x80\x94 lo! \xe2\x80\x94 the markets still didn\xe2\x80\x99t trust Citigroup to survive. In response, on Nov. 24, the Treasury handed Citigroup another $20 billion from the Troubled Assets Relief Program, and then simply guaranteed $306 billion of Citigroup\xe2\x80\x99s assets. The Treasury didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask for its fair share of the action, or management changes, or for that matter anything much at all beyond a teaspoon of warrants and a sliver of preferred stock. The $306 billion guarantee was an undisguised gift. The Treasury didn\xe2\x80\x99t even bother to explain what the crisis was, just that the action was taken in response to Citigroup\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdeclining stock price.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Three hundred billion dollars is still a lot of money. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost 2 percent of gross domestic product, and about what we spend annually on the departments of Agriculture, Education, Energy, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development and Transportation combined. Had Mr. Paulson executed his initial plan, and bought Citigroup\xe2\x80\x99s pile of troubled assets at market prices, there would have been a limit to our exposure, as the money would have counted against the $700 billion Mr. Paulson had been given to dispense. Instead, he in effect granted himself the power to dispense unlimited sums of money without Congressional oversight. Now we don\xe2\x80\x99t even know the nature of the assets that the Treasury is standing behind. Under TARP, these would have been disclosed.'b'THERE are other things the Treasury might do when a major financial firm assumed to be \xe2\x80\x9ctoo big to fail\xe2\x80\x9d comes knocking, asking for free money. Here\xe2\x80\x99s one: Let it fail.'b'Not as chaotically as Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail. If a failing firm is deemed \xe2\x80\x9ctoo big\xe2\x80\x9d for that honor, then it should be explicitly nationalized, both to limit its effect on other firms and to protect the guts of the system. Its shareholders should be wiped out, and its management replaced. Its valuable parts should be sold off as functioning businesses to the highest bidders \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps to some bank that was not swept up in the credit bubble. The rest should be liquidated, in calm markets. Do this and, for everyone except the firms that invented the mess, the pain will likely subside.'b'This is more plausible than it may sound. Sweden, of all places, did it successfully in 1992. And remember, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury have already accepted, on behalf of the taxpayer, just about all of the downside risk of owning the bigger financial firms. The Treasury and the Federal Reserve would both no doubt argue that if you don\xe2\x80\x99t prop up these banks you risk an enormous credit contraction \xe2\x80\x94 if they aren\xe2\x80\x99t in business who will be left to lend money? But something like the reverse seems more true: propping up failed banks and extending them huge amounts of credit has made business more difficult for the people and companies that had nothing to do with creating the mess. Perfectly solvent companies are being squeezed out of business by their creditors precisely because they are not in the Treasury\xe2\x80\x99s fold. With so much lending effectively federally guaranteed, lenders are fleeing anything that is not.'b'Rather than tackle the source of the problem, the people running the bailout desperately want to reinflate the credit bubble, prop up the stock market and head off a recession. Their efforts are clearly failing: 2008 was a historically bad year for the stock market, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in recession for some time to come. Our leaders have framed the problem as a \xe2\x80\x9ccrisis of confidence\xe2\x80\x9d but what they actually seem to mean is \xe2\x80\x9cplease pay no attention to the problems we are failing to address.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In its latest push to compel confidence, for instance, the authorities are placing enormous pressure on the Financial Accounting Standards Board to suspend \xe2\x80\x9cmark-to-market\xe2\x80\x9d accounting. Basically, this means that the banks will not have to account for the actual value of the assets on their books but can claim instead that they are worth whatever they paid for them.'b'This will have the double effect of reducing transparency and increasing self-delusion (gorge yourself for months, but refuse to step on a scale, and maybe no one will realize you gained weight). And it will fool no one. When you shout at people \xe2\x80\x9cbe confident,\xe2\x80\x9d you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect them to be anything but terrified.'b'If we are going to spend trillions of dollars of taxpayer money, it makes more sense to focus less on the failed institutions at the top of the financial system and more on the individuals at the bottom. Instead of buying dodgy assets and guaranteeing deals that should never have been made in the first place, we should use our money to A) repair the social safety net, now badly rent in ways that cause perfectly rational people to be terrified; and B) transform the bailout of the banks into a rescue of homeowners.'b'We should begin by breaking the cycle of deteriorating housing values and resulting foreclosures. Many homeowners realize that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense to make payments on a mortgage that exceeds the value of their house. As many as 20 million families face the decision of whether to make the payments or turn in the keys. Congress seems to have understood this problem, which is why last year it created a program under the Federal Housing Authority to issue homeowners new government loans based on the current appraised value of their homes.'b'And yet the program, called Hope Now, seems to have become one more excellent example of the unhappy political influence of Wall Street. As it now stands, banks must initiate any new loan; and they are loath to do so because it requires them to recognize an immediate loss. They prefer to \xe2\x80\x9cwork with borrowers\xe2\x80\x9d through loan modifications and payment plans that present fewer accounting and earnings problems but fail to resolve and, thereby, prolong the underlying issues. It appears that the banking lobby also somehow inserted into the law the dubious requirement that troubled homeowners repay all home equity loans before qualifying. The result: very few loans will be issued through this program.'b'THIS could be fixed. Congress might grant qualifying homeowners the ability to get new government loans based on the current appraised values without requiring their bank\xe2\x80\x99s consent. When a corporation gets into trouble, its lenders often accept a partial payment in return for some share in any future recovery. Similarly, homeowners should be permitted to satisfy current first mortgages with a combination of the proceeds of the new government loan and a share in any future recovery from the future sale or refinancing of their homes. Lenders who issued second mortgages should be forced to release their claims on property. The important point is that homeowners, not lenders, be granted the right to obtain new government loans. To work, the program needs to be universal and should not require homeowners to file for bankruptcy.'b'There are also a handful of other perfectly obvious changes in the financial system to be made, to prevent some version of what has happened from happening all over again. A short list:'b''b'Stop making big regulatory decisions with long-term consequences based on their short-term effect on stock prices'b'. Stock prices go up and down: let them. An absurd number of the official crises have been negotiated and resolved over weekends so that they may be presented as a fait accompli \xe2\x80\x9cbefore the Asian markets open.\xe2\x80\x9d The hasty crisis-to-crisis policy decision-making lacks coherence for the obvious reason that it is more or less driven by a desire to please the stock market. The Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the S.E.C. all seem to view propping up stock prices as a critical part of their mission \xe2\x80\x94 indeed, the Federal Reserve sometimes seems more concerned than the average Wall Street trader with the market\xe2\x80\x99s day-to-day movements. If the policies are sound, the stock market will eventually learn to take care of itself.'b''b'End the official status of the rating agencies'b'. Given their performance it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe credit rating agencies are still around. There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the world is worse off for the existence of companies like Moody\xe2\x80\x99s and Standard &amp; Poor\xe2\x80\x99s. There should be a rule against issuers paying for ratings. Either investors should pay for them privately or, if public ratings are deemed essential, they should be publicly provided.'b''b' Regulate credit-default swap'b''b's'b'. There are now tens of trillions of dollars in these contracts between big financial firms. An awful lot of the bad stuff that has happened to our financial system has happened because it was never explained in plain, simple language. Financial innovators were able to create new products and markets without anyone thinking too much about their broader financial consequences \xe2\x80\x94 and without regulators knowing very much about them at all. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter how transparent financial markets are if no one can understand what\xe2\x80\x99s inside them. Until very recently, companies haven\xe2\x80\x99t had to provide even cursory disclosure of credit-default swaps in their financial statements.'b'Credit-default swaps may not be Exhibit No. 1 in the case against financial complexity, but they are useful evidence. Whatever credit defaults are in theory, in practice they have become mainly side bets on whether some company, or some subprime mortgage-backed bond, some municipality, or even the United States government will go bust. In the extreme case, subprime mortgage bonds were created so that smart investors, using credit-default swaps, could bet against them. Call it insurance if you like, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not the insurance most people know. It\xe2\x80\x99s more like buying fire insurance on your neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s house, possibly for many times the value of that house \xe2\x80\x94 from a company that probably doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any real ability to pay you if someone sets fire to the whole neighborhood. The most critical role for regulation is to make sure that the sellers of risk have the capital to support their bets.'b''b'Impose new capital requirements on banks.'b' The new international standard now being adopted by American banks is known in the trade as Basel II. Basel II is premised on the belief that banks do a better job than regulators of measuring their own risks \xe2\x80\x94 because the banks have the greater interest in not failing. Back in 2004, the S.E.C. put in place its own version of this standard for investment banks. We know how that turned out. A better idea would be to require banks to hold less capital in bad times and more capital in good times. Now that we have seen how too-big-to-fail financial institutions behave, it is clear that relieving them of stringent requirements is not the way to go.'b'Another good solution to the too-big-to-fail problem is to break up any institution that becomes too big to fail.'b''b'Close the revolving door between the S.E.C. and Wall Street.'b' At every turn we keep coming back to an enormous barrier to reform: Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s political influence. Its influence over the S.E.C. is further compromised by its ability to enrich the people who work for it. Realistically, there is only so much that can be done to fix the problem, but one measure is obvious: forbid regulators, for some meaningful amount of time after they have left the S.E.C., from accepting high-paying jobs with Wall Street firms.'b''b'But keep the door open the other way.'b' If the S.E.C. is to restore its credibility as an investor protection agency, it should have some experienced, respected investors (which is not the same thing as investment bankers) as commissioners. President-elect Barack Obama should nominate at least one with a notable career investing capital, and another with experience uncovering corporate misconduct. As it happens, the most critical job, chief of enforcement, now has a perfect candidate, a civic-minded former investor with firsthand experience of the S.E.C.\xe2\x80\x99s ineptitude: Harry Markopolos.'b'The funny thing is, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing all that radical about most of these changes. A disinterested person would probably wonder why many of them had not been made long ago. A committee of people whose financial interests are somehow bound up with Wall Street is a different matter.'b''b" Every week, the Opinion section presents an essay from The Times's archive by a columnist or contributor that we hope sheds light on current news or provides a window on the past."b''b''b"Barack Obama's inauguration is only a few weeks away. Before Bill Clinton was sworn in as president, Edmund Morris looked out his window at the Capitol Dome and back upon a century of inaugurations. "b''b'January 17, 1993'b''b''b'Edmund Morris won a Pulitzer Prize in 1980 for "The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt." He is writing an authorized biography of Ronald Reagan. 'b''b'WASHINGTON'b"I write these words on a winter's evening, looking west through a bay window at the floodlit dome of the Capitol, about 400 yards away. Its shimmering symmetry (rendered ethereal by the window's old glass, which makes it waver as though reflected in water) is to me the most American of shapes. That pale bell first imprinted itself on my mind when, as a boy in Nairobi, I browsed illustrated books in the library of the United States Information Service and dreamed of being able to walk in its environs, along with my bosom buddy Thomas Sawyer of Hannibal, Mo."b'The Capitol imprints itself still whenever I come into my study, never more beautifully than at times like this, when the vast spiraling nation of which it is the center begins to slow down and solidify around it, like some quadrennial nebula gathering energy for fresh circuits and collisions.'b'The floodlights are so white tonight -- I think they\'re testing for Wednesday\'s television exposure -- that I\'m conscious of the dome even as I hunch over my desk. Just now, for example, I was pondering the particles of the word inaugurate and remembered that Shakespeare uses the word augur in his poem "The Phoenix and the Turtle." I got out the text but was distracted in my search by that lingering, translucent image, casting a wholly relevant reflection on his invocatory verses. Of the upcoming ceremony one may indeed pray:'b'From this session interdict'b'Every fowl of tyrant wing'b"Save the eagle, feather'd king:"b'Keep the obsequy so strict.'b'My town house was built in 1905 -- just in time, perhaps, to observe the inauguration of Theodore Roosevelt, who was sworn in on March 4. (In those days transitions were even more ridiculously protracted than they are now.) As a writer living in what amounts to an ivory tower -- or at least an off-white walk-up -- I like to imagine myself seated here then, catching a few of T.R.\'s screechy remarks. It was a windy day, and he had to keep a tight hold of his typescript. Who knows, the phrase "Power invariably means both responsibility and danger" may have blown across the park and buffeted against these curving panes.'b"For reasons I cannot figure out, the window refracts sound as well as light, with equal capriciousness. At times a Presidential motorcade will speed by almost silently, at others I can hear Chief Justice William Rehnquist sneeze as he ambles pigeon-toed along the sidewalk to his chambers. Such selectivity, of course, also characterizes historical memory. Maybe that's why some of the inaugurations this house has witnessed will not replay here. I click my viewfinder, and get only snow."b"In the case of William Howard Taft's ceremony, however, the atmospherics are genuine. A blizzard blanketed Washington that morning, so little could be heard or seen of Big Bill, even though he was our most visible Chief Executive. (His current namesake, after four years of state dinners au sauce bechamel , may well challenge that record.)"b'What other scraps of pomp and circumstance waft this way, through space and time? Massed bands thumping Calvin Coolidge up the Hill in 1925. I\'m sure they were noisy, because Cal was still awake when he got here. Herbert Hoover\'s furious face in 1933 as he reluctantly crested the brow of the Hill in company with Franklin D. Roosevelt. And F.D.R. about half an hour later, cranking himself up to the microphones and plagiarizing Thoreau\'s plagiarism of a line written by Montaigne in 1580: "The thing of which I have most fear is fear itself" (For this scholarly information I am indebted to Ralph Keyes\'s new quotation-corrector, "Nice Guys Finish Seventh.")'b'Whoever lived here on Jan. 22, 1961, and saw John F. Kennedy deliver his inaugural, probably watched it through a rime of ice. I cannot imagine the event in situ, because I so clearly remember being half a world away and listening as that awkward nasal voice promised to "pay any price" and "bear any burden" in behalf of the "survival and success of liberty." One hardly foresaw that these alliterations would ultimately send 55,000 soldiers to death in Vietnam. President Kennedy\'s words should be stenciled around the Oval Office in gilt letters as a warning to future Presidents of the dangers of cute phraseology.'b'Richard Nixon was no slouch in the alliteration department either. He liked to use plosives that drove his massive jowls apart, a la Dizzy Gillespie -- f\'s and double f\'s and p\'s that popped every loudspeaker within earshot. As a result, his 1969 address was the most pneumodynamic since T.R.\'s. How the Capitol pigeons must have risen when he huffed, "In these difficult years America has suffered from a fever of words: from inflated rhetoric that postures instead of persuading." Inflated is right!'b'This window saw nothing of Gerald R. Ford\'s inauguration, but then neither did Jerry Ford. Jimmy Carter\'s oath-taking was the first, and let us hope the last, to be profaned by a nickname -- can anyone imagine the Great Emancipator intoning, "I, Abe Lincoln"?'b"Yet we must give Mr. Carter credit for staging a supreme piece of inaugural choreography: his pas de deux hand-in-hand with Rosalynn, out among the applauding crowd, in open air and sunshine on Pennsylvania Avenue. After the armor-plated claustrophobia of the late 1960's and early 1970's, this was an ecstatic moment. And as moments go, it went."b'For sheer theater, however, nothing eclipsed Ronald Reagan\'s decision, in 1981, to stage his inauguration on the other side of the Capitol. Like Davy Crockett (or was it Fess Parker?) crossing the Appalachian Mountains, like Lincoln and William McKinley returning home, like Grover Cleveland throwing open the great Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago, Mr. Reagan aligned himself toward the West. No matter that the fugitive frontier which "explains American development" had long since dissolved into the Pacific. He wanted to project his cheerful pieties in the same symbolic direction -- and, not incidentally, give Yuri Andropov a view of his back.'b"Alas for this house, the Reagan Realignment means that all future Presidents, unless they are partial to parking lots, will take their oaths facing the same way, over one of the world's great urban spaces. Whoever sits here after me and wishes to experience something of the elation attending the election of President M'Chege Hwange, or President Nguyen Nu, or even President Kathy McLane (my intern of a few summers back, and a cinch for the White House), is going to have to forsake this ivory tower and join the crowd further down the Hill."b"On Wednesday, though, I think I'll stay put. Not that I don't wish Mr. Clinton well -- who, knowing what confronts him, doesn't? When noon approaches I'll stand close to the glass and hope to sense, if not see, something of that most solemn of constitutional moments (too rapid for television, too silent for radio), the transfer of power from one President to another. If the transfer is also from party to party, then so much the better for democracy. Civilized government requires that the bums be thrown out with some regularity."b'This huge chimera floating over the trees (a mist like white samite is now curling up and around) tempts all Americans to pose beneath it, hold up their hands, and hope that a member of the judiciary will happen by. For at least one day in the four years looming, let our mutual hostilities of rich and poor, male against female, majority over minority, and regular versus decaf reconcile themselves under the unity of this dome. Let us temporarily exult, as Shakespeare did at the mutual embrace of Phoenix and Turtle:'b'How true a twain'b'Seemeth this concordant one!'b'Love hath reason, reason none,'b'If what parts can so remain.'b'PHNOM PENH, Cambodia'b'Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s presidency marks a triumph over the legacy of slavery, so it would be particularly meaningful if he led a new abolitionist movement against 21st-century slavery \xe2\x80\x94 like the trafficking of girls into brothels.'b'Anyone who thinks it is hyperbole to describe sex trafficking as slavery should look at the maimed face of a teenage girl, Long Pross.'b'Glance at Pross from her left, and she looks like a normal, fun-loving girl, with a pretty face and a joyous smile. Then move around, and you see where her brothel owner gouged out her right eye.'b'Yes, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to read this. But it\xe2\x80\x99s infinitely more painful for Pross to recount the humiliations she suffered, yet she summoned the strength to do so \xe2\x80\x94 and to appear in a 'b'video'b' posted online with this column \xe2\x80\x94 because she wants people to understand how brutal sex trafficking can be.'b'Pross was 13 and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even had her first period when a young woman kidnapped her and sold her to a brothel in Phnom Penh. The brothel owner, a woman as is typical, beat Pross and tortured her with electric current until finally the girl acquiesced.'b'She was kept locked deep inside the brothel, her hands tied behind her back at all times except when with customers.'b'Brothel owners can charge large sums for sex with a virgin, and like many girls, Pross was painfully stitched up so she could be resold as a virgin. In all, the brothel owner sold her virginity four times.'b'Pross paid savagely each time she let a potential customer slip away after looking her over.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was beaten every day, sometimes two or three times a day,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, adding that she was sometimes also subjected to electric shocks twice in the same day.'b'The business model of forced prostitution is remarkably similar from Pakistan to Vietnam \xe2\x80\x94 and, sometimes, in the United States as well. Pimps use violence, humiliation and narcotics to shatter girls\xe2\x80\x99 self-esteem and terrorize them into unquestioning, instantaneous obedience.'b'One girl working with Pross was beaten to death after she tried to escape. The brothels figure that occasional losses to torture are more than made up by the increased productivity of the remaining inventory.'b'After 'b'my last column'b', I heard from skeptical readers doubting that conditions are truly so abusive. It\xe2\x80\x99s true that prostitutes work voluntarily in many brothels in Cambodia and elsewhere. But there are also many brothels where teenage girls are slave laborers.'b'Young girls and foreigners without legal papers are particularly vulnerable. In Thailand\xe2\x80\x99s brothels, for example, Thai girls usually work voluntarily, while Burmese and Cambodian girls are regularly imprisoned. The career trajectory is often for a girl in her early teens to be trafficked into prostitution by force, but eventually to resign herself and stay in the brothel even when she is given the freedom to leave. In my blog, 'b'www.nytimes.com/ontheground'b', I respond to the skeptics and offer some ideas for readers who want to help.'b'Pross herself was never paid, and she had no right to insist on condoms (she has not yet been tested for HIV, because the results might be too much for her fragile emotional state). Twice she became pregnant and was subjected to crude abortions.'b'The second abortion left Pross in great pain, and she pleaded with her owner for time to recuperate. \xe2\x80\x9cI was begging, hanging on to her feet, and asking for rest,\xe2\x80\x9d Pross remembered. \xe2\x80\x9cShe got mad.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s when the woman gouged out Pross\xe2\x80\x99s right eye with a piece of metal. At that point in telling her story, Pross broke down and we had to suspend the interview.'b'Pross\xe2\x80\x99s eye grew infected and monstrous, spraying blood and pus on customers, she later recounted. The owner discarded her, and she is now recuperating with the help of Sina Vann, the young woman I wrote about in my last column.'b'Sina was herself rescued by Somaly Mam, a trafficking survivor who started the 'b'Somaly Mam Foundation'b' in Cambodia to fight sexual slavery. The foundation is working with Dr. Jim Gollogly of the 'b'Children\xe2\x80\x99s Surgical Center'b' in Cambodia to get Pross a glass eye.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA year from now, she should look pretty good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Gollogly, who is providing her with free medical care.'b'So Somaly saved Sina, and now Sina is saving Pross. Someday, perhaps Pross will help another survivor, if the rest of us can help sustain them.'b'The Obama administration will have a new tool to fight traffickers: the Wilberforce Act, just passed by Congress, which strengthens sanctions on countries that wink at sex slavery. Much will depend on whether Mr. Obama and Hillary Clinton see trafficking as a priority.'b'There would be powerful symbolism in an African-American president reminding the world that the war on slavery isn\xe2\x80\x99t yet over, and helping lead the 21st-century abolitionist movement.'b'WE like our failed presidents to be Shakespearean, or at least large enough to inspire Oscar-worthy performances from magnificent tragedians like Frank Langella. So here, too, George W. Bush has let us down. Even the banality of evil is too grandiose a concept for 43. He is not a memorable villain so much as a sometimes affable second banana whom Josh Brolin and Will Ferrell can nail without breaking a sweat. He\xe2\x80\x99s the reckless Yalie Tom Buchanan, not Gatsby. He is smaller than life.'b'The last 'b'NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll'b' on Bush\xe2\x80\x99s presidency found that 79 percent of Americans will not miss him after he leaves the White House. He is being forgotten already, even if he\xe2\x80\x99s not yet gone. You start to pity him until you remember how vast the wreckage is. It stretches from the Middle East to Wall Street to Main Street and even into the heavens, which have been a safe haven for toxins under his passive stewardship. The discrepancy between the grandeur of the failure and the stature of the man is a puzzlement. We are still trying to compute it.'b'The one indisputable talent of his White House was its ability to create and sell propaganda both to the public and the press. Now that bag of tricks is empty as well. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s first and last photo-ops in Iraq could serve as bookends to his entire tenure. On Thanksgiving weekend 2003, even as the Iraqi insurgency was spiraling, 'b'his secret trip to the war zone'b' was a P.R. slam-dunk. The photo of the beaming commander in chief bearing a 'b'supersized decorative turkey'b' for the troops was designed to make every front page and newscast in the country, and it did. Five years later, in what was intended as a farewell victory lap to show off Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s improved post-surge security, Bush was 'b'reduced to ducking shoes'b'.'b'He tried to spin the ruckus as another victory for his administration\xe2\x80\x99s program of democracy promotion. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what people do in a free society,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He had 'b'made the same claim'b' three years ago after the Palestinian elections, championed by his \xe2\x80\x9cfreedom agenda\xe2\x80\x9d (and almost $500 million of American aid), led to a landslide victory for Hamas. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is something healthy about a system that does that,\xe2\x80\x9d Bush 'b'observed at the time'b', as he congratulated Palestinian voters for rejecting \xe2\x80\x9cthe old guard.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The ruins of his administration\xe2\x80\x99s top policy priority can be found not only in Gaza but in the new \xe2\x80\x9cdemocratic\xe2\x80\x9d Iraq, where the local journalist who tossed the shoes was 'b'jailed without formal charges'b' and may have been tortured. Almost simultaneously, opponents of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki accused him of making 'b'politically motivated arrests'b' 'b'of rival-party government officials'b' in anticipation of this month\xe2\x80\x99s much-postponed provincial elections.'b'Condi Rice 'b'blamed the press'b' for the image that sullied Bush\xe2\x80\x99s Iraq swan song: \xe2\x80\x9cThat someone chose to throw a shoe at the president is what gets reported over and over.\xe2\x80\x9d We are back where we came in. This was the same line Donald Rumsfeld used to deny the significance of the looting in Baghdad during his famous \xe2\x80\x9cStuff happens!\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'press conference of April 2003'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cImages you are seeing on television you are seeing over, and over, and over,\xe2\x80\x9d he said then, referring to the much-recycled video of a man stealing a vase from the Baghdad museum. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that there were that many vases in the whole country?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, playing for laughs.'b'The joke was on us. Iraq burned, New Orleans flooded, and Bush remained oblivious to each and every pratfall on his watch. Americans essentially stopped listening to him after Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, but he still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t grasp the finality of their defection. Lately he\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'promised not to steal the spotlight'b' from Barack Obama once he\xe2\x80\x99s in retirement  \xe2\x80\x94  as if he could do so by any act short of running naked through downtown Dallas. The'b' latest CNN poll 'b'finds that only one-third of his fellow citizens want him to play a post-presidency role in public life.'b'Bush is equally blind to the collapse of his propaganda machinery. Almost poignantly, he keeps trying to hawk his goods in these final days, like a salesman who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been told by the home office that his product has been discontinued. Though no one is listening, he has given 'b'more exit interviews'b' than either Clinton or Reagan did. Along with old cronies like Karl Rove and Karen Hughes, he has also embarked on a Bush \xe2\x80\x9clegacy project,\xe2\x80\x9d as Stephen Hayes of The Weekly Standard 'b'described it on CNN'b'.'b'To this end, Rove has repeated a stunt he 'b'first fed to the press two years ago'b': he is 'b'once again claiming'b' that he and Bush have an annual book-reading contest, with Bush chalking up as many as 95 books a year, by authors as hifalutin as Camus. This hagiographic portrait of Bush the Egghead might be easier to buy were the former national security official Richard Clarke not 'b'quoted in the new Vanity Fair'b' saying that both Rice and her deputy, Stephen Hadley, had instructed him early on to keep his memos short because the president is \xe2\x80\x9cnot a big reader.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Another, far more elaborate example of legacy spin can be 'b'downloaded from the White House Web site'b': a booklet recounting \xe2\x80\x9chighlights\xe2\x80\x9d of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9caccomplishments and results.\xe2\x80\x9d With big type, much white space, children\xe2\x80\x99s-book-like trivia boxes titled \xe2\x80\x9cDid You Know?\xe2\x80\x9d and lots of color photos of the Bushes posing with blacks and troops, its 52 pages require a reading level closer to \xe2\x80\x9cMy Pet Goat\xe2\x80\x9d than \xe2\x80\x9cThe Stranger.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This document is the literary correlative to \xe2\x80\x9cMission Accomplished.\xe2\x80\x9d Bush kept America safe (provided his presidency began Sept. 12, 2001). He gave America record economic growth (provided his presidency ended December 2007). He vanquished all the leading Qaeda terrorists (if you don\xe2\x80\x99t count the leaders bin Laden and al-Zawahri). He gave Afghanistan a thriving \xe2\x80\x9cmarket economy\xe2\x80\x9d (if you count its skyrocketing opium trade) and a \xe2\x80\x9cdemocratically elected president\xe2\x80\x9d (presiding over one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'most corrupt governments'b'). He supported elections in Pakistan (after propping up Pervez Musharraf past the point of no return). He \xe2\x80\x9cled the world in providing food aid and natural disaster relief\xe2\x80\x9d (if you leave out Brownie and Katrina).'b'If this is the best case that even Bush and his handlers can make for his achievements, you wonder why they bothered. Desperate for padding, they devote four risible pages to portraying our dear leader as a zealous environmentalist.'b'But the brazenness of Bush\xe2\x80\x99s alternative-reality history is itself revelatory. The audacity of its hype helps clear up the mystery of how someone so slight could inflict so much damage. So do 'b'his'b' 'b'many'b' 'b'print'b' 'b'and'b' 'b'television'b' 'b'exit'b' 'b'interviews'b'.'b'The man who emerges is a narcissist with no self-awareness whatsoever. It\xe2\x80\x99s that arrogance that allowed him to tune out even the most calamitous of realities, freeing him to compound them without missing a step. The president who famously couldn\xe2\x80\x99t name a single mistake of his presidency 'b'at a press conference'b' in 2004 still can\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'He can, however, blame everyone else. Asked ('b'by Charles Gibson'b') if he feels any responsibility for the economic meltdown, Bush says, \xe2\x80\x9cPeople will realize a lot of the decisions that were made on Wall Street took place over a decade or so, before I arrived.\xe2\x80\x9d Asked if the 2008 election was a repudiation of his administration, he says \xe2\x80\x9cit was a repudiation of Republicans.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe attacks of September the 11th came out of nowhere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said 'b'in another interview'b', as if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t ignored frantic intelligence warnings that summer of a Qaeda attack. But it was an \xe2\x80\x9cintelligence failure,\xe2\x80\x9d not his relentless invocation of patently fictitious \xe2\x80\x9cmushroom clouds,\xe2\x80\x9d that sped us into Iraq. Did he take too long to change course in Iraq? \xe2\x80\x9cWhat seems like an eternity today,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'he says'b', \xe2\x80\x9cmay seem like a moment tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d Try telling that to the families of the thousands killed and maimed during that multiyear \xe2\x80\x9cmoment\xe2\x80\x9d as Bush stubbornly stayed his disastrous course.'b'The crowning personality tic revealed by Bush\xe2\x80\x99s final propaganda push is his bottomless capacity for self-pity. \xe2\x80\x9cI was a wartime president, and war is very exhausting,\xe2\x80\x9d he 'b'told C-Span'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cThe president ends up carrying a lot of people\xe2\x80\x99s grief in his soul,\xe2\x80\x9d he 'b'told Gibson'b'. And so when he visits military hospitals, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s always been a healing experience,\xe2\x80\x9d he 'b'told The Wall Street Journal'b'. But, incredibly enough, it\xe2\x80\x99s his own healing he is concerned about, not that of the grievously wounded men and women he sent to war on false pretenses. It\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cthe comforter in chief\xe2\x80\x9d who \xe2\x80\x9cgets comforted,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, by \xe2\x80\x9cthe character of the American people.\xe2\x80\x9d The American people are surely relieved to hear it.'b'With this level of self-regard, it\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder that Bush could remain undeterred as he drove the country off a cliff. The smugness is reinforced not just by his history as the entitled scion of one of America\xe2\x80\x99s aristocratic dynasties but also by his conviction that his every action is blessed from on high. 'b'Asked last month by an interviewer'b' what he has learned from his time in office, he replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve learned that God is good. All the time.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Once again he is shifting the blame. This presidency was not about Him. Bush failed because in the end it was all about him.'b'A year into the recession, millions of Americans have already lost their jobs, their incomes and their homes. Millions more are having their peace of mind tested daily by the certainty of harder times to come. Yet as the recession deepens, one small group could actually catch a break: the richest Americans, who are likely to see a proposed tax increase postponed.'b'During the campaign, President-elect Barack Obama pledged to raise taxes, starting in 2009, on roughly the top 5 percent of American households, generally defined as those making more than $250,000 a year. The objective was to restore fairness and raise revenue by undoing Bush-era tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefited the rich while worsening the budget deficit.'b'The Obama team has not officially ditched that plan. But it is sounding increasingly reluctant to move soon. A delay is supported by the conventional wisdom   that raising any taxes during a downturn is wrong.'b'That argument starts with the correct premise that a stalled economy needs all the juice it can get, hence the need for the roughly $800 billion recovery package to spur consumption and create jobs, taking shape in Congress and championed by Mr. Obama. But not all tax increases are damaging in a recession. An increase could help if it raised more in revenue than it subtracted in consumption and if that revenue was used for stimulus.'b'That sounds like the very definition of a tax increase for the richest Americans. The wealthy are unlikely to slow their consumption much if their income tax rates return \xe2\x80\x94 as Mr. Obama has proposed \xe2\x80\x94 to their pre-Bush levels (an increase from rates of 33 and 35 percent to 36 and 39.6 percent).'b'We know that higher taxes are never an easy sell politically \xe2\x80\x94 and would be especially difficult now, when Mr. Obama needs support from Republicans in Congress to quickly pass his recovery package.'b'We also acknowledge that a tax increase on the rich, though feasible, could backfire in these tense times. Because it is hard to explain and easy to demagogue, it could foster a confusing debate that might impair confidence just when confidence needs to be revived.'b'But even if he skips the income tax increase this year, Mr. Obama must press for increases in coming years. The fight for tax fairness \xe2\x80\x94 and for the practice of paying for government services rather than borrowing or printing money \xe2\x80\x94 must be a goal in itself, rather than becoming a perennial bargaining chip.'b'To that end, Mr. Obama should move forward in 2009 to close loopholes and make other long overdue changes in tax law. As promised during the campaign, he should push to alter the outmoded provision that has allowed private equity partners to pay about the lowest rate in the tax code on most of their multimillion-dollar earnings. He should also push for freezing the tax on multimillion-dollar estates at current levels, rather than letting the tax expire as scheduled in 2010.'b'Stimulus spending is front and center now, but  over all, the nation needs far more tax revenue, generated more progressively. Mr. Obama needs to establish himself from the start as a proponent of fair and adequate taxation \xe2\x80\x94 just as he promised during the campaign.'b'True to its mania for secrecy, the Bush administration is leaving behind vast gaps in the most sensitive White House e-mail records, and with lawyers and public interest groups in hot pursuit of information that deserves to be part of the permanent historical record.'b'E-mail messages that have gone suspiciously missing are estimated to number in the millions. These could illuminate some of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s darker moments, including the lead-up to the Iraq war, when intelligence was distorted, the destruction of videotapes of C.I.A. torture interrogations, and the vindictive outing of the C.I.A. operative Valerie Plame Wilson.'b'The deep-sixed history also includes improper business conducted by more than 50 White House appointees via e-mail at the Republican Party headquarters. Historians and archivists are suing the administration. We should be grateful for their efforts. Entire days of e-mail records have turned up conveniently blank at the offices of President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney.'b'Mr. Cheney, of course, retreats from sunshine with the wariness of Alucard; he is fighting to the last the transfer of his records to the National Archives, as required by law. He recently argued in court that he \xe2\x80\x9calone may determine what constitutes vice presidential records or personal records.\xe2\x80\x9d As in: L\xe2\x80\x99etat c\xe2\x80\x99est Dick.'b'Modern administrations from Ronald Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s to Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s typically tried to evade at least some disclosure obligations under the public archives law. But the Bush team, from day one, has flouted  the requirement to preserve a truthful record, ignoring repeated warnings from the National Archives. In government agencies, the public\xe2\x80\x99s freedom-of-information rights have been maliciously hobbled.'b'The National Archives is further burdened by the steady and inevitable growth in digital  records \xe2\x80\x94 a mass 50 times larger than that left eight years ago by the Clinton administration. It will take years to ingest before historians can truly get a handle on what is missing.'b'History is truly the poorer for the Bush administration. President-elect Barack Obama must quickly undo the damage by ordering that records be shielded from political interference, by repairing the freedom-of-information process, and by ending the abuse of the classification process to cloak the truths of the presidency.'b'The time has come to give the American consumer a much stronger voice in Washington. President-elect Barack Obama has already named what amounts to an energy and environmental czar in the White House, and America\xe2\x80\x99s beleaguered consumers deserve no less.'b'Mr. Obama should restore the White House Office of Consumer Affairs, which vanished during the Clinton years, and appoint a director who has both the president\xe2\x80\x99s ear and the authority to rebuild the consumer protection agencies that were undercut or hollowed out by the fiercely anti-regulatory Bush administration.'b'There is no shortage of agencies ostensibly designed to protect consumers. But without an emergency like killer spinach or lead in children\xe2\x80\x99s toys, the Bush administration has mostly failed to hear customers\xe2\x80\x99 complaints. The consumer safety net is simply far too weak.'b'The Food and Drug Administration has suffered cutbacks in expert personnel, and still relies too heavily on industry to police itself. Credit-card holders who have been subject to all kinds of Dickensian tricks and traps were finally told by the Federal Reserve that relief is in sight \xe2\x80\x94 in 2011. Not so long ago, there was only one official toy tester at the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and oversight generally was so weak that Congress was forced to step in with new protections, which still could be strengthened.'b'It will be up to the Obama administration to bring these agencies back to life. In part this means restoring the morale of government workers who have too often been stymied by the anti-regulators at the top. It will also mean stronger consumer protection policies and hiring more skilled people. It will mean giving one official responsibility for coordinating the entire apparatus.'b'Presidents Johnson and Carter both recognized the need for a strong person to do that job. Both chose Esther Peterson, who during about eight years in office pushed for then-radical ideas like nutritional labeling on food and truth in advertising.  As the Reagan anti-government era began, the consumer protection job steadily lost clout until it was shuttered in the late 1990s.'b'During his campaign, Mr. Obama promised consumers that he would help them get a fairer deal. As the victims of lead toys and predatory lenders can attest, they certainly need one. Restoring the Office of Consumer Affairs and appointing a director as strong and capable as Mrs. Peterson would be an encouraging first step.'b'The football playoffs begin this weekend with the two worlds of fandom on sadly discordant display. On television, the games play on with balletic grace. It\xe2\x80\x99s another story up in the stands, where drunken louts can be heard vilely abusing and threatening fans of the opposing team, and lewdly harassing women who dare to root for the visitors.'b'For years, season-ticket holders across the league have paid top dollar to put up with the overlay of thuggery at games. The crudeness grows with colder weather and heightened alcohol intake, as bibulous loudmouths celebrate their primacy, pretending to be one with the muscular entertainment down on the field.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s no getting used to this, even by making protective earplugs part of the game-day apparel. Most disheartening is to see families with small children suffering through the vulgarity. Anyone who considers objecting \xe2\x80\x94 by daring to summon a security guard \xe2\x80\x94 runs the risk of facing gang retaliation, for the Alpha male bellowers rarely have the guts to stand alone.'b'But hope is on the way. The National Football League, aware that the stadium experience has soured, has instituted an electronic lifeline. Cellphone texters can privately dial a number displayed at the stadium and complain to security offices without fear of retaliation. The accused disrupter can then be discreetly observed and ejected from the game if guards confirm the abuse.'b'This already has been happening, and some clubs have even stripped offenders of their season tickets. (The league says there has been a minimum of prank texters, and they run the same risks as grandstand rowdies when repeaters are discovered.) The texting alert has been in use at most games and will be in effect at the playoffs and the Super Bowl.'b'Hooray for the side of civility, but don\xe2\x80\x99t leave the earplugs home yet. Predictably, the yammering world of 24/7 sports talk is debating whether a \xe2\x80\x9crat line\xe2\x80\x9d has been invented to abuse the civil rights of the accused. That\xe2\x80\x99s akin to complaining about the traffic cams that catch the plate numbers of lethal hit-and-run drivers. What, you don\xe2\x80\x99t like what I just said? You want a piece of me?

The clause will likely be tested by Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s administration, as the new president and Secretary of State-designate Hillary Clinton, led by the legal academics in whose circles they have long traveled, contemplate binding down American power and interests in a dense web of treaties and international bureaucracies.'b'Like past presidents, Mr. Obama will likely be tempted to avoid the requirement that treaties must be approved by two-thirds of the Senate. The usual methods around this constitutional constraint are executive agreements or a majority vote in the House and Senate to pass a treaty as a simple law (known as a Congressional-executive agreement).'b'Executive agreements have an acknowledged but limited place in our foreign affairs.'b' 'b'Congressional-executive agreements are far more troubling. They have evoked scathing attacks by constitutional experts and have been strongly resisted in the Senate, at least so far.'b'The framers of the Constitution designed the treaty process with a bias against \xe2\x80\x9centangling alliances,\xe2\x80\x9d as Thomas Jefferson described them in his first inaugural address. They designated the Senate as the body responsible to protect the interests of the states from being bargained away by the president in deals with foreign nations. The framers required a supermajority to ensure that treaties would reflect a broad consensus and careful, mature decision-making.'b'America needs to maintain its sovereignty and autonomy, not to subordinate its policies, foreign or domestic, to international control. On a broad variety of issues \xe2\x80\x94 many of which sound more like domestic rather than foreign policy \xe2\x80\x94 the re-emergence of the benignly labeled \xe2\x80\x9cglobal governance\xe2\x80\x9d movement is well under way in the Obama transition.'b'Candidate Obama promised to \xe2\x80\x9cre-engage\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwork constructively within\xe2\x80\x9d the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Will the new president pass a new Kyoto climate accord through Congress by sidestepping the constitutional requirement to persuade two-thirds of the Senate?'b'Draconian restrictions on energy use would follow. A majority of the Congress would be much easier for Mr. Obama to get than a supermajority of the Senate. A scholar at the Brookings Institution has already proposed that a new president overcome objections to this environmentalists\xe2\x80\x99 holy grail by evading the Treaty Clause.'b'President George W. Bush resisted many efforts at global governance. But his administration still sometimes fell into the temptation to flout the constitutional requirement of a two-thirds majority in the Senate.'b'In 2002, the administration considered submitting the Treaty of Moscow, a nuclear arms reduction agreement, for majority approval of Congress. Vice President-elect Joe Biden, who was then the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, privately made clear that he would vigorously oppose such an attempt to evade the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional prerogatives. The administration agreed to submit the agreement as a treaty, and the Moscow agreement cleared the Senate.'b'We hope the new vice president will not reverse his commitment to the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional authority. But an administration determined to tie one hand behind America\xe2\x80\x99s back might use Congressional-executive agreements to push the nation all too easily into quixotic and impractical global governance regimes.'b'President Bill Clinton signed Kyoto, but the Senate in effect rejected it. He also signed the Rome Treaty of 1998 that established an International Criminal Court, which would subject American soldiers and officials to unaccountable international prosecutors and judges for alleged war crimes (including, potentially, the undefined crime of \xe2\x80\x9caggression\xe2\x80\x9d). Mr. Clinton did not even send this agreement to the Senate. Mr. Bush \xe2\x80\x9cunsigned\xe2\x80\x9d it. Mr. Obama might re-sign it and seek approval by only a majority of both houses of Congress.'b'Other international regimes might restrict America\xe2\x80\x99s freedom of action to defend itself. In 1999, the Senate rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which would have undermined America\xe2\x80\x99s ability to verify the reliability and effectiveness of its nuclear deterrent. Mr. Obama has said he supports ratification. The historical precedents are that major arms control agreements must receive the approval of two-thirds of the Senate.'b'President Bush, like President Clinton, did not sign a global agreement that would ban antipersonnel land mines, on the grounds that they are a key component of the American defense of South Korea. But his administration has pressed for ratification of the treaty on the law of the sea, which would subject disputes over the free passage of American naval vessels to the jurisdiction of an international maritime court \xe2\x80\x94 which the Senate has so far refused to ratify.'b'If Mr. Obama were to submit either of these agreements for approval by a simple majority of the House and Senate, his actions would pose a serious challenge to American principles of law and democratic governance. Global governance schemes delegate power to independent international organizations to make and enforce laws that would apply domestically, by international bureaucrats who are unaccountable to Congress, the president, American public opinion or the democratic process.'b'It is true that some multinational economic agreements, like Bretton Woods, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the North American Free Trade Agreement, went into effect after approval by majorities of Congress rather than two-thirds of the Senate. But international agreements that go beyond the rules of international trade and finance \xe2\x80\x94 that involve significant national-security commitments,'b' 'b'or that purport to delegate lawmaking and enforcement functions to international organizations, or that could fundamentally alter the American constitutional system of individual rights \xe2\x80\x94 should receive the intense scrutiny of the treaty process, regardless of their policy merits.'b'By insisting on the proper constitutional process for treaty-making, Republicans can join Mr. Obama in advancing a bipartisan foreign policy. They can also help strike the proper balance between the legislative and executive branches that so many have called for in recent years.'b'I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d begin 2009 with a movie, so on its first freezing afternoon I went to see Gus Van Sant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cMilk,\xe2\x80\x9d starring Sean Penn in a breathtaking performance as a smart, wry gay-rights politician whose whimsical effectiveness arouses murderous ire.'b'Playing Harvey Milk, slain in 1978 after becoming the first openly gay man elected to public office in California, Penn demonstrates why he\xe2\x80\x99s the finest character actor around. He inhabits Milk\xe2\x80\x99s vulnerability as completely as Gielgud inhabited Lear\xe2\x80\x99s folly.'b'Even as he stands before a San Francisco gay community incensed by proposals to bar them from teaching in Californian public schools, Penn imbues Milk less with a bully-pulpit rage than a quivering indignation that speaks of the hurt of closeted sexuality.'b'He quotes the Declaration of Independence to refute anti-gay bigotry: \xe2\x80\x9cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights ... . \xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a powerful moment, one that brought my current obsession with Penn to breaking-point.'b'Was this really the same Sean Penn who\xe2\x80\x99d just penned a fawning tribute to the grim Cuban president, Ra\xc3\xbal Castro, a dictator presiding over a 50-year-old revolution that once dispatched gays to labor camps to correct their \xe2\x80\x9ccounterrevolutionary tendencies?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yes, it was, despite the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cMilk\xe2\x80\x9d is precisely about the sort of grass-roots political movement that would be impossible in the Cuba of the Castro brothers, despite the fact that the \xe2\x80\x9cinalienable rights\xe2\x80\x9d of hundreds of Cuban political prisoners are trampled daily and despite the fact that the pursuit of happiness for most Cubans has been reduced to eking out an existence on $20 a month.'b'(Yes, I know about Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s achievements in education and health care, and gays no longer face outright persecution. But even basic liberties, like the freedom to leave, are denied Cubans in the name of a socialism that allowed an ailing Fidel to hand power to the 77-year-old Ra\xc3\xbal  \xe2\x80\x94  the Castro dynasty\xe2\x80\x99s geriatric version of revolutionary politics.)'b'Penn is a poor writer, as rambling as a journalist as he is disciplined as an actor. A gift for detachment is as important to the journalist as a gift for empathy is to the actor. Penn has only the latter.'b'His awful December cover story in The Nation has been elaborated in still more interminable form this month at 'b'HuffingtonPost.com'b', where Penn accuses the \xe2\x80\x9cmainstream media\xe2\x80\x9d of being \xe2\x80\x9cconscious manufacturers of deception,\xe2\x80\x9d before allowing Ra\xc3\xbal Castro to ramble on for seven hours without a meaningful question about Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s disastrous economic situation or stifling political system.'b'When I read the piece, I\xe2\x80\x99d 'b'just returned from Cuba'b', where among the more prominent of Ra\xc3\xbal\xe2\x80\x99s reforms has been allowing Cubans into hotels for the first time (seriously!) and granting them access to cellphones costing six times their monthly salary.'b'Yet here\xe2\x80\x99s Penn waxing lyrical (and delusional) about how \xe2\x80\x9cRa\xc3\xbalism was on the rise\xe2\x80\x9d and allowing the president to proclaim, without any comeback from our actor-journalist, that:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am the longest standing minister of armed forces in history. Forty-eight-and-a-half years until last October. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m in this uniform.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yes, Mr. President, and that\xe2\x80\x99s precisely why you should take it off and go home.'b'Penn, by the way, traveled to Cuba from Hugo Ch\xc3\xa1vez\xe2\x80\x99s Venezuela on a plane loaned by the Venezuelan Ministry of Energy and Petroleum. But, says Penn, that\xe2\x80\x99s like a \xe2\x80\x9cjournalist flying on Air Force One.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s apparently unaware that journalists on the U.S. presidential plane pay commercial rates.'b'But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to quibble. Penn\xe2\x80\x99s not the first leftist star seduced by revolution despite dictatorship: Simone Signoret and Yves Montand touring Eastern Europe after the Soviet bludgeoning of Hungary in 1956 comes to mind. The French left had a very hard time getting Stalin in focus, just as part of the Euro-American left cannot free itself of Castro worship. Lenin\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cuseful idiots\xe2\x80\x9d still abound.'b'They are dangerous. Penn as Milk gets it. Penn the foreign correspondent flails. Certain rights are indeed inalienable, first among them freedom. No Wall Street excess or U.S. failing changes that.'b'I asked Christopher Hitchens, who accompanied Penn but was snubbed by Castro, why the actor was in the thrall of Castroism. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of people cannot believe there is no alternative to free-market, bourgeois democracy,\xe2\x80\x9d Hitchens said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be too bitter a pill for them to swallow if the Cuban Revolution were nothing but a cruel joke on the Cubans. Sometimes David just has to triumph over the American Goliath.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Romance is treacherous in politics. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t reach Penn, but if I had, I would have said this: \xe2\x80\x9cSean, truth is as elusive for a journalist as it is for an actor. It takes work. You should never have written that this was Ra\xc3\xbal\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98first ever interview to a foreign journalist\xe2\x80\x99 in 50 years. You\xe2\x80\x99re no journalist.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Bush years have taught us the dangers of amateurism and the preciousness of freedom. Your journalism flouts those lessons even as your brilliant acting illuminates them.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf we don\xe2\x80\x99t act swiftly and boldly,\xe2\x80\x9d declared President-elect Barack Obama in his latest weekly address, \xe2\x80\x9cwe could see a much deeper economic downturn that could lead to double-digit unemployment.\xe2\x80\x9d If you ask me, he was understating the case.'b'The fact is that recent economic numbers have been terrifying, not just in the United States but around the world. Manufacturing, in particular, is plunging everywhere. Banks aren\xe2\x80\x99t lending; businesses and consumers aren\xe2\x80\x99t spending. Let\xe2\x80\x99s not mince words: This looks an awful lot like the beginning of a second Great Depression.'b'So will we \xe2\x80\x9cact swiftly and boldly\xe2\x80\x9d enough to stop that from happening? We\xe2\x80\x99ll soon find out.'b'We weren\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to find ourselves in this situation. For many years most economists believed that preventing another Great Depression would be easy. In 2003, Robert Lucas of the University of Chicago, in his presidential address to the American Economic Association, declared that the \xe2\x80\x9ccentral problem of depression-prevention has been solved, for all practical purposes, and has in fact been solved for many decades.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Milton Friedman, in particular, persuaded many economists that the Federal Reserve could have stopped the Depression in its tracks simply by providing banks with more liquidity, which would have prevented a sharp fall in the money supply. Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, famously apologized to Friedman on his institution\xe2\x80\x99s behalf: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re right. We did it. We\xe2\x80\x99re very sorry. But thanks to you, we won\xe2\x80\x99t do it again.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It turns out, however, that preventing depressions isn\xe2\x80\x99t that easy after all. Under Mr. Bernanke\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, the Fed has been supplying liquidity like an engine crew trying to put out a five-alarm fire, and the money supply has been rising rapidly. Yet credit remains scarce, and the economy is still in free fall.'b'Friedman\xe2\x80\x99s claim that monetary policy could have prevented the Great Depression was an attempt to refute the analysis of John Maynard Keynes, who argued that monetary policy is ineffective under depression conditions and that fiscal policy  \xe2\x80\x94  large-scale deficit spending by the government  \xe2\x80\x94 is needed to fight mass unemployment. The failure of monetary policy in the current crisis shows that Keynes had it right the first time. And Keynesian thinking lies behind Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s plans to rescue the economy.'b'But these plans may turn out to be a hard sell.'b'News reports say that Democrats hope to pass an economic plan with broad bipartisan support. Good luck with that.'b'In reality, the political posturing has already started, with Republican leaders setting up roadblocks to stimulus legislation while posing as the champions of careful Congressional deliberation  \xe2\x80\x94  which is pretty rich considering their party\xe2\x80\x99s behavior over the past eight years.'b'More broadly, after decades of declaring that government is the problem, not the solution, not to mention reviling both Keynesian economics and the New Deal, most Republicans aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to accept the need for a big-spending, F.D.R.-type solution to the economic crisis.'b'The biggest problem facing the Obama plan, however, is likely to be the demand of many politicians for proof that the benefits of the proposed public spending justify its costs  \xe2\x80\x94  a burden of proof never imposed on proposals for tax cuts.'b'This is a problem with which Keynes was familiar: giving money away, he pointed out, tends to be met with fewer objections than plans for public investment \xe2\x80\x9cwhich, because they are not wholly wasteful, tend to be judged on strict \xe2\x80\x98business\xe2\x80\x99 principles.\xe2\x80\x9d What gets lost in such discussions is the key argument for economic stimulus  \xe2\x80\x94  namely, that under current conditions, a surge in public spending would employ Americans who would otherwise be unemployed and money that would otherwise be sitting idle, and put both to work producing something useful.'b'All of this leaves me concerned about the prospects for the Obama plan. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that Congress will pass a stimulus plan,  but I worry that the plan may be delayed and/or downsized. And Mr. Obama is right: We really do need swift, bold action.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s my nightmare scenario: It takes Congress months to pass a stimulus plan, and the legislation that actually emerges is too cautious. As a result, the economy plunges for most of 2009, and when the plan finally starts to kick in, it\xe2\x80\x99s only enough to slow the descent, not stop it. Meanwhile, deflation is setting in, while businesses and consumers start to base their spending plans on the expectation of a permanently depressed economy  \xe2\x80\x94  well, you can see where this is going.'b'So this is our moment of truth. Will we in fact do what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to prevent Great Depression II?'b'The Israeli assault on Hamas in Gaza is going to be a replay, we\xe2\x80\x99re told, of the attempt to subdue Hezbollah in southern Lebanon in the summer of 2006. And the outcome, it\xe2\x80\x99s asserted, will be the same: lots of death and destruction, no strategic victory for Israel and a setback for all who seek peace and progress in the Middle East.'b'Obviously, war is an unpredictable business, so I say this with some trepidation: I think the conventional wisdom will be proved wrong. Israel could well succeed in Gaza.'b'For one thing, southern Lebanon is a substantial and hilly area, bordered by northern Lebanon and Syria, through which Hezbollah could be re-supplied, both by Syria itself and by Iran. Gaza is a flat, narrow strip, bordered by Israel, as well as by the sea and by Egypt, no friend to Hamas. By cutting off the northern part of Gaza from the southern, Israel has basically surrounded northern Gaza, creating a military situation very different from that in Lebanon in 2006.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s more, the Israeli leadership seems aware of the mistakes  \xe2\x80\x94 political, strategic and military  \xe2\x80\x94 it made in Lebanon. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it won\xe2\x80\x99t make them all over again. The same prime minister, Ehud Olmert, is in charge, after all. But, today\xe2\x80\x99s defense minister, Ehud Barak, is very different from his predecessor, the weak and unqualified Amir Peretz. So far as one can tell, the Gaza operation seems to have been well-planned and is being methodically executed, in sharp contrast to the Lebanon incursion. Barak has also warned that the operation could be long and difficult, lowering expectations by contrast with the Israeli rhetoric of July 2006.'b'In addition, in Lebanon, Israel proclaimed war goals that it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t achieve  \xe2\x80\x94 such as retrieving its two kidnapped soldiers and disarming Hezbollah. Now the Israeli government says that it seeks to weaken Hamas, lessen its ability to fire rockets from Gaza and secure new arrangements along the Egyptian-Gaza border to prevent Hamas from re-arming. These may well be achievable goals.'b'And, of course, not all military efforts against terror fail. Recall Israel\xe2\x80\x99s incursion into the West Bank in the spring of 2002, when, under the leadership of Ariel Sharon, Israel succeeded in ripping up established terror networks and began the defeat of the second intifada. Israel also was able to avoid a long-term re-occupation, while retaining the ability to go back in on anti-terror missions. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, the 2002 bloodshed didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to do lasting damage to hopes for progress or moderation on the West Bank. After all, it\xe2\x80\x99s Gaza, from which Israel withdrew in 2005, not the West Bank, that became a Hamas stronghold.'b'An Israeli success in Gaza would be a victory in the war on terror \xe2\x80\x94  and in the broader struggle for the future of the Middle East. Hamas is only one manifestation of the rise, over the past few decades, of a terror-friendly and almost death-cult-like form of Islamic extremism. The combination of such terror movements with a terror-sponsoring and nuclear-weapons-seeking Iranian state (aided by its sidekick Syria) has produced a new kind of threat to Israel.'b'But not just to Israel. To everyone in the Middle East \xe2\x80\x94 very much including Muslims  \xe2\x80\x94 who aren\xe2\x80\x99t interested in living under the sway of extremist regimes. And to any nation, like the United States, that is a target of Islamic terror. So there are sound reasons why the United States  \xe2\x80\x94 whether led by George W. Bush or Barack Obama  \xe2\x80\x94 will stand with Israel as it fights.'b'But Israel  \xe2\x80\x94 assuming it succeeds \xe2\x80\x94 is doing the United States a favor by taking on Hamas now.'b'The huge challenge for the Obama administration is going to be Iran. If Israel had yielded to Hamas and refrained from using force to stop terror attacks, it would have been a victory for Iran. If Israel were now to withdraw under pressure without accomplishing the objectives of severely weakening Hamas and preventing the reconstitution of a terror-exporting state in Gaza, it would be a triumph for Iran. In either case, the Iranian regime would be emboldened, and less susceptible to the pressure from the Obama administration to stop its nuclear program.'b'But a defeat of Hamas in Gaza \xe2\x80\x94 following on the heels of our success in Iraq \xe2\x80\x94 would be a real setback for Iran. It would make it easier to assemble regional and international coalitions to pressure Iran. It might positively affect the Iranian elections in June. It might make the Iranian regime more amenable to dealing.'b'With respect to Iran, Obama may well face  \xe2\x80\x94 as the Israeli government did with Hamas  \xe2\x80\x94 a moment when the use of force seems to be the only responsible option. But Israel\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to fight makes it more possible that the United States may not have to.'b'New pharmaceutical industry guidelines should stop most drug companies from distributing a wide range of trinkets and office supplies designed to keep their brand names before doctors as a subliminal inducement to prescribe high-priced drugs.'b'The new code, which kicked in on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, bars the free distribution of everything from pens to coffee mugs and staplers by some 40 drug companies that have agreed to the restrictions. That may seem like small potatoes, but in the aggregate the promotional products probably cost about $1 billion a year, as Natasha Singer reported in The Times.'b'The updated rules are the industry\xe2\x80\x99s latest attempt to restore public confidence that doctors are prescribing medicines in the patient\xe2\x80\x99s interest. The code still has too many loopholes.'b'Although it prohibits company sales representatives from providing restaurant meals to health care professionals, it allows the sales teams to continue providing modest meals in professional offices while pitching their products. It allows companies to continue paying for so-called continuing medical education for physicians while correctly leaving the selection of content, speakers and study materials to conference organizers. There appear to be no loopholes in bans against providing free tickets to the theater, sporting events or resort junkets.'b'None of the steps yet contemplated by industry or professional groups would completely sever the medical profession and many individual doctors from their far more disturbing financial ties to the drug industry.'b'Over the years, prominent physicians have received hefty fees for conducting research, consulting or giving \xe2\x80\x9ceducational\xe2\x80\x9d speeches touting the virtues of drugs to their colleagues. The new industry code would limit consultants\xe2\x80\x99 fees to \xe2\x80\x9cfair market value,\xe2\x80\x9d but critics believe that still leaves far too much room to pay individual doctors handsomely.'b'Two investigations now under way at prominent universities show how much more needs to be done to aerate undisclosed conflicts of interest.'b'A prominent psychiatrist at Emory University is accused of taking large payments from a drug maker \xe2\x80\x94 and misleading his university about the amounts \xe2\x80\x94 while heading a government study of the company\xe2\x80\x99s antidepressant drugs. Three psychiatrists at Harvard whose work fueled an explosion in the use of powerful antipsychotic drugs to treat children are accused of failing to report large payments from the drug makers, most of which they had not disclosed to their institutions.'b'Congress needs to pass legislation that would force all drug and medical-device companies to report a wide range of payments to doctors through a national registry so that all conflicts are known. This is a reform that the industry itself now seems willing to accept. Better yet, the medical profession needs to wean itself almost entirely from its pervasive dependence on industry money.'b'Unlike President Bush, Barack Obama is going to enter office with a clear appreciation of the urgent problems of climate change and America\xe2\x80\x99s growing dependency on foreign oil \xe2\x80\x94  and a strong commitment to address both.'b'One way he can do this is to give mass transit \xe2\x80\x94 trains, buses, commuter rails \xe2\x80\x94 the priority it deserves and the full financial and technological help it needs and has long been denied.'b'Mass transit has always played second fiddle to the automobile, so Mr. Obama will need strong allies. Ray LaHood, Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s choice for transportation secretary, must be not only an ally but a champion for mass transit. Mr. LaHood is a Republican and former member of Congress from rural Illinois, where farmers produce a lot of ethanol and where people mostly drive. His r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 on transportation issues is thin, and we fear he may need some coaxing in this new direction.'b'Another important ally should be \xe2\x80\x94 and almost certainly will be \xe2\x80\x94 James Oberstar, a Minnesota Democrat who is chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.'b'For years, the division of transportation money in Washington has heavily favored cars and trucks \xe2\x80\x94 more than 80 percent of the big transit money from gas taxes goes to highways and bridges, and less than 20 percent to railroads or mass transit. Mr. Oberstar is leading the charge to change that formula and divide this money a little more evenly. This will not be easy. Automobiles will be with us a long time, and old spending habits die hard. But as part of the stimulus package now under discussion for transportation, Mr. Oberstar is proposing $30 billion for highways and bridges and $12 billion for public transit. That is certainly a far healthier mix.'b'The new administration could further help mass transit by shelving the unfair \xe2\x80\x9ccost effectiveness index\xe2\x80\x9d that President Bush put in place several years ago for new transit programs. The net effect of this index was to make it easier to build highways and almost impossible to use federal money for buses, streetcars, light rail, trolleys \xe2\x80\x94 indeed, any commuter-rail projects.'b'For Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s transit agenda and for Mr. LaHood, the next big challenge will be a transit bill that Congress must pass by September. Mr. LaHood is widely praised for his management skills and his ability to work well with others. Those abilities will certainly be needed if he and the Congress are to find and then finance the best, the most-efficient and the most-advanced ways for Americans to move around.'b'More than 17,000 police officers patrol school hallways nationwide, a big increase from even 10 years ago. There is little question that the police have made many schools safer. There also is growing concern that the larger number of police officers, plus zero-tolerance policies at many schools, has led to unnecessary arrests.'b'While some arrests involve serious offenses \xe2\x80\x94 like carrying weapons \xe2\x80\x94 most involve fighting, disrupting a classroom or some similar disturbance that in the past might have led to a trip to the principal\xe2\x80\x99s office or suspension. Often the arrested students suffer from learning disabilities or mental health problems that, if addressed, could alleviate the behavior that got them in trouble in the first place.'b'With this as a backdrop, the American Civil Liberties Union and its Connecticut affiliate examined school-based arrests in Hartford and the suburban districts of West Hartford and East Hartford between 2004 and 2007.'b'It found that in West Hartford and East Hartford, minorities were far more likely to be arrested than white students who committed the same infraction. In Hartford\xe2\x80\x99s overwhelmingly minority school system, police arrested students at disturbingly young ages: 86 primary grade children in a two-year period, including 13 in grades three or below.'b'School-based arrests are not routinely disclosed in Connecticut, and the publicity from the A.C.L.U. report has obviously shaken administrators, many of whom have refused comment or reacted defensively.'b'Connecticut is hardly the only state struggling with these issues. In 2006, a Florida kindergarten student was arrested for throwing a tantrum. Last year, the A.C.L.U. devoted a special report to police behavior in New York City schools and found much to criticize.'b'While most police officers know how to handle adults, dealing with children and teenagers requires special diplomatic and communications skills. Specialists in child development and juvenile justice need to develop standards, and local police departments need to develop training programs.'b'Connecticut and other states also need to issue public reports of school-based arrests and take steps to ensure that they are not racially motivated. Arrests should always be a last resort and not a crutch for frazzled schoolteachers or administrators who bear the primary responsibility for maintaining school discipline.'b'Sometimes on the train north to the country, I catch a glimpse of a heron rookery in a swamp by the tracks. To call it a rookery, now a general term for a breeding colony, is to catch a linguistic glimpse of the great colonies of rooks\xe2\x80\x99 nests \xe2\x80\x94 raucous, brawling places \xe2\x80\x94 that dot the English countryside. What I see from the train should really be called a heronry, a village of well-built heron nests high in the trees. In winter, they stand out against the sky like dense clouds or puffs of dark smoke caught in the uppermost branches.'b'The recent ice storm left a lot of shattered trees behind, including many in the swamp. But as far as I could tell, none of the nest trees had broken. Nor had the high winds pitched any of the heron nests to the ground. I began to wonder about all the intersecting decisions that go into a heronry.'b'It begins with the presence of water, which is where great blue herons feed. It requires a certain height in the trees, which means trees of a certain age and branch structure. But do those qualities also give resistance to wind and severe ice storms? Or do the birds prefer certain species of tall, well-branched trees over others? After all, no respectable heron would nest in a birch.'b'I am used to thinking of evolution doing the selecting \xe2\x80\x94 blind, impassive adaptation over millions of years. That is a dispassionate way of understanding behavior. But a heronry embodies a system of knowledge present in these herons, a complete, successful and highly inventive understanding of this world around them. Grasping how it came to be does not make it any less marvelous.'b'The train rumbles past that swamp a couple dozen times a day. Who knows how many humans have looked up at that heronry? The hard part is learning to see nature as a dense web of interconnected knowledges. We see the dimensions of the landscape, but we miss seeing the fullness of the understandings that inhabit it. I look up at the heronry and the question that stays in my mind is this: What do herons learn from living together?'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cBargain Hunting, and Feeling Sheepish About It\xe2\x80\x9d (Week in Review, Dec. 28):'b'David Streitfeld faces a moral quandary of biblical (or Seinfeldian) proportions when considering whether to buy a book on the Internet at less than face value.'b'To those who have read a letter to an ethics columnist from a wayward tax filer or one paralyzed by the thought of undertipping his barista, it is clear that America has lost its moral compass.'b'For those of us without money to burn (our ranks swell by the hour), finding a book on the Web for less than a buck induces a feeling less like nausea and more like relief!'b'Perhaps Mr. Streitfeld should think of the Internet as one big garage (or stoop) sale, stretching far into the distance.

But even worse damage is done over the long term under normal rainfall \xe2\x80\x94 by the little rills and sheets of erosion on incompletely covered or denuded cropland, and by various degradations resulting from industrial procedures and technologies alien to both agriculture and nature.'b'Soil that is used and abused in this way is as nonrenewable as (and far more valuable than) oil. Unlike oil, it has no technological substitute \xe2\x80\x94 and no powerful friends in the halls of government.'b'Agriculture has too often involved an insupportable abuse and waste of soil, ever since the first farmers took away the soil-saving cover and roots  of perennial plants. Civilizations have destroyed themselves by destroying their farmland. This irremediable loss, never enough noticed, has been made worse by the huge monocultures and continuous soil-exposure of the agriculture we now practice.'b'To the problem of soil loss, the industrialization of agriculture has added pollution by toxic chemicals, now universally present in our farmlands and streams. Some of this toxicity is associated with the widely acclaimed method of minimum tillage. We should not poison our soils to save them.'b'Industrial agricultural has made our food supply entirely dependent on fossil fuels and, by substituting technological \xe2\x80\x9csolutions\xe2\x80\x9d for human work and care, has virtually destroyed the cultures of husbandry (imperfect as they may have been) once indigenous to family farms and farming neighborhoods.'b'Clearly, our present ways of agriculture are not sustainable, and so our food supply is not sustainable. We must restore ecological health to our agricultural landscapes, as well as economic and cultural stability to our rural communities.'b'For 50 or 60 years, we have let ourselves believe that as long as we have money we will have food. That is a mistake. If we continue our offenses against the land and the labor by which we are fed, the food supply will decline, and we will have a problem far more complex than the failure of our paper economy. The government will bring forth no food by providing hundreds of billons of dollars to the agribusiness corporations.'b'Any restorations will require, above all else, a substantial increase in the acreages of perennial plants. The most immediately practicable way of doing this is to go back to crop rotations that include hay, pasture and grazing animals.'b'But a more radical response is necessary if we are to keep eating and preserve our land at the same time. In fact, research in Canada, Australia, China and the United States over the last 30 years suggests that perennialization of the major  grain crops like wheat, rice, sorghum and sunflowers can be developed in the foreseeable future. By increasing the use of mixtures of grain-bearing perennials, we can better protect  the soil and substantially reduce greenhouse gases, fossil-fuel use and toxic pollution.'b'Carbon sequestration would increase, and the husbandry of water and soil nutrients would become much more efficient. And with an increase in the use of perennial plants and grazing animals would come more employment opportunities in agriculture \xe2\x80\x94 provided, of course, that farmers would be paid justly for their work and their goods.'b'Thoughtful farmers and consumers everywhere are already making many necessary changes in the production and marketing of food. But we also need a national agricultural policy that is based upon ecological principles. We need a 50-year farm bill that addresses forthrightly the problems of soil loss and degradation, toxic pollution, fossil-fuel dependency and the destruction of rural communities.'b'This is a political issue, certainly, but it far transcends the farm politics we are used to. It is an issue as close to every one of us as our own stomachs.'b'Former Senator Claiborne Pell, the Rhode Island Democrat who died last week at the age of 90, is best known as the father of Pell Grants, the program giving aid to low-income college students that bears his name. Passed in 1972 and called Basic Educational Opportunity Grants until 1980, Pell Grants have been around so long that few remember how much opposition they had to overcome or how revolutionary they once seemed.'b'I was a freshman in 1975, the first year that all needy undergraduates were eligible to receive a grant. My mother had chronic heart trouble; her alimony and a tiny veteran\xe2\x80\x99s pension amounted to less than $8,000 a year. When I learned that I qualified for close to the maximum annual grant of $1,400, it seemed nothing short of miraculous.'b'Yet were it not for Senator Pell\xe2\x80\x99s stubbornness, passage of the bill would have required a miracle. Colleges and universities are strong supporters of Pell Grants now. But in the early 1970s, they resisted the notion that the money should go directly to students, as Mr. Pell insisted. They wanted the money as a form of institutional aid, which they would disburse to students as they saw fit.'b'The Senate passed Mr. Pell\xe2\x80\x99s bill. The House backed the version the colleges wanted. For two months in the summer of 1972, the conference committee haggled. Mr. Pell, the wealthy New England aristocrat, never wavered in his belief that the program should help poor students, as the postwar G.I. Bill did. Finally, the committee came around to his view, and Congress passed the bill.'b'The senator was so modest that years after the program was renamed for him, he refused to call them Pell Grants, recalled David Evans, the former staff director of the Senate education subcommittee. Mr. Pell simply believed that students who had \xe2\x80\x9cthe moxie\xe2\x80\x9d to attend college, but little money, deserved the backup, he said.'b'The program is far from perfect. The aid hasn\xe2\x80\x99t kept up with the cost of a college education. The money doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help nearly as much now as it did back then.'b'Yet even Mr. Pell probably never realized, in the beginning, all the good the program would do. In more than three decades, the federal government has sent more than 108 million grants, about $250 billion, to needy students, according to the American Council on Education.'b'Those checks were investments in the truest sense of the word. And more than that: those of us with more dreams than dollars knew our government, and a modest and unassuming senator, believed in us.'b'The economy is obviously issue No. 1 as Barack Obama prepares to take over the presidency. He\xe2\x80\x99s charged with no less a task than pulling the country out of a brutal recession. If the worst-case scenarios materialize, his job will be to stave off a depression.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s enough to keep any president pretty well occupied. What Mr. Obama doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need, and what the U.S. cannot under any circumstances afford, is any more unnecessary warfare. And yet, while we haven\xe2\x80\x99t even figured out how to extricate ourselves from the disaster in Iraq, Mr. Obama is planning to commit thousands of additional American troops to the war in Afghanistan, which is already more than seven years old and which long ago turned into a quagmire.'b'Andrew Bacevich, a retired Army colonel who is now a professor of history and international relations at Boston University, wrote an important piece for Newsweek warning against the proposed buildup. \xe2\x80\x9cAfghanistan will be a sinkhole,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cconsuming resources neither the U.S. military nor the U.S. government can afford to waste.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In an analysis in The Times last month, Michael Gordon noted that \xe2\x80\x9cAfghanistan presents a unique set of problems: a rural-based insurgency, an enemy sanctuary in neighboring Pakistan, the chronic weakness of the Afghan government, a thriving narcotics trade, poorly developed infrastructure, and forbidding terrain.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The U.S. military is worn out from years of warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan. The troops are stressed from multiple deployments. Equipment is in disrepair. Budgets are beyond strained. Sending thousands of additional men and women (some to die, some to be horribly wounded) on a fool\xe2\x80\x99s errand in the rural, mountainous guerrilla paradise of Afghanistan would be madness.'b'The time to go all out in Afghanistan was in the immediate aftermath of the 2001 terror attacks. That time has passed.'b'With no personal military background and a reputation as a liberal, President-elect Obama may feel he has to demonstrate his toughness, and that Afghanistan is the place to do it. What would really show toughness would be an assertion by Mr. Obama as commander in chief that the era of mindless military misadventures is over.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI hate war,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dwight Eisenhower, \xe2\x80\x9cas only a soldier who has lived it can, as only one who has seen its brutality, its futility, its stupidity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s the upside to the U.S., a nation in dire economic distress, of an escalation in Afghanistan? If we send 20,000, or 30,000, or however many thousand more troops in there, what will their mission be?'b'In his article for Newsweek, Mr. Bacevich said: \xe2\x80\x9cThe chief effect of military operations in Afghanistan so far has been to push radical Islamists across the Pakistani border. As a result, efforts to stabilize Afghanistan are contributing to the destabilization of Pakistan, with potentially devastating implications.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo country poses a greater potential threat to U.S. national security \xe2\x80\x94 today and for the foreseeable future \xe2\x80\x94 than Pakistan. To risk the stability of that nuclear-armed state in the vain hope of salvaging Afghanistan would be a terrible mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Our interest in Afghanistan is to prevent it from becoming a haven for terrorists bent on attacking us. That does not require the scale of military operations that the incoming administration is contemplating. It does not require a wholesale occupation. It does not require the endless funneling of human treasure and countless billions of taxpayer dollars to the Afghan government at the expense of rebuilding the United States, which is falling apart before our very eyes.'b'The government we are supporting in Afghanistan is a fetid hothouse of corruption, a government of gangsters and weasels whose customary salute is the upturned palm. Listen to this devastating assessment by Dexter Filkins of The Times:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cKept afloat by billions of dollars in American and other foreign aid, the government of Afghanistan is shot through with corruption and graft. From the lowliest traffic policeman to the family of President Hamid Karzai himself, the state built on the ruins of the Taliban government seven years ago now often seems to exist for little more than the enrichment of those who run it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Think about putting your life on the line for that gang.'b'If Mr. Obama does send more troops to Afghanistan, he should go on television and tell the American people, in the clearest possible language, what he is trying to achieve. He should spell out the mission\xe2\x80\x99s goals, and lay out an exit strategy.'b'He will owe that to the public because he will own the conflict at that point. It will be Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s war.'b'For several years, Israelis and Palestinians played the land-for-peace game. Each side engaged in a series of elaborate maneuvers designed to get the best possible deal when it came time to negotiate a final status agreement.'b'But when Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran became leading players in the Middle East struggle, that land-for-peace game was suspended. A different game with different rules was begun. This new game is not oriented toward a final agreement. The extremist groups believe in the eventual extermination of Israel. They\xe2\x80\x99re not interested in a handshake on the White House lawn.'b'In this new game, both sides seek the destruction of the other, but neither has the power to achieve it. They are engaged in a struggle that has no near-term practical end. The extremists\xe2\x80\x99 goal is to kill as many Jews as possible and wait for God (or Iran) to kill the rest. Israel\xe2\x80\x99s goal is to restrain the brazenness of the extremists until their movement somehow burns itself out or is destroyed from within Arab society. Israel\xe2\x80\x99s realistic immediate goal is not to achieve some permanent resolution, but to merely suppress terrorism week by week and month by month.'b'The writer Michael Oakeshott captured Israel\xe2\x80\x99s quandary in this game in a famous passage: \xe2\x80\x9cIn political activity, then, men sail a boundless and bottomless sea; there is neither harbor for shelter nor floor for anchorage, neither starting place nor appointed destination. The enterprise is to keep afloat on an even keel.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'By trial and error, Israel is learning to keep an even keel. For while Hamas and the extremists are dogmatic about ends, they are pragmatic about timing and means. On several occasions, Israelis have managed to temporarily suppress violence. The assassinations of Abdel Aziz Rantisi and Ahmed Yassin in 2004 temporarily suppressed Hamas suicide bombings. The destruction of Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s command and control structure in Beirut\xe2\x80\x99s Dahiya district in 2006 seems to have shocked the leadership and reduced terror activity in the north.'b'In this game, violence doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily beget violence. It sometimes prevents it. The difference between successful Israeli actions and unsuccessful ones is not in the amount of destruction they achieve, but in the psychological messages they send. The attacks on Hamas terror leaders in 2004 demonstrated Israeli prowess. They demonstrated superior intelligence capability and suggested that Israel is always one step ahead. These sorts of accomplishments sapped Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s confidence and created a cycle of recrimination, leading to uncertainty and more risk-averse behavior.'b'Israel\xe2\x80\x99s invasion of Lebanon, on the other hand, created plenty of physical and human destruction, but it also displayed Israeli ineptitude. This time it was Israel\xe2\x80\x99s turn to suffer a crisis of confidence. Radicals on the Arab side gained prestige, while moderates lost it.'b'This new game isn\xe2\x80\x99t a war of attrition. It\xe2\x80\x99s a struggle for confidence, a series of psychological exchanges designed to shift the balance of morale. The material destroyed in an episode can be replaced, but the psychological effects are more lasting. What is really important is how each episode ends, because the ending defines the meaning \xe2\x80\x94 who mastered events and who was mastered by them.'b'Over the past several weeks, Israeli leaders seem to have adjusted to the new game with new rules. The initial incursion into Gaza was an effective display of prowess. According to The Jerusalem Report, in the first wave, 80 Israeli planes hit more than 100 targets and nearly all of the Hamas military compounds within 3 minutes  40 seconds. The I.D.F. has clearly addressed many of the weaknesses exposed by the Winograd Commission, showing the recuperative powers a democracy is capable of.'b'But recently the quotations in the Israeli press have taken on a different tone. Israeli leaders have listed an assortment of vague war aims. The habits of mind from the old wars have resurfaced. Some generals seem to think they are engaged in an old-fashioned war to hold territory for extended periods of time. Some seem to imagine that if they bomb Hamas enough, they will turn it into the more moderate Fatah.'b'Many Israeli leaders seem to have taken the momentum of the past weeks and concluded that they can force through a permanent solution to their quandary. That\xe2\x80\x99s the perfect way to dilute the psychological effect, and to lose control of the endgame.'b'In one scenario, Israel finishes a quick ground assault with a lightning effort to clean out the tunnels in the Philadelphia Corridor. Then it withdraws from Gaza, at a time of its own choosing, to let the psychological reverberations begin. In another scenario, Israel\xe2\x80\x99s assault drags on. The suffering of the innocents in Gaza magnifies. The meaning changes.'b'The architects of the first scenario understand the rules of the new game. The architects of the second miss the core concept: psychology matters most.'b'BARACK OBAMA has assigned a top priority to financial reform when the new Congress assembles today. If history is any guide, legislators can perform a signal service by moving beyond the myriad details of the rescue plans to provide a coherent account of the origins of the current crisis. The moment calls for nothing less than a sweeping inquest into the twin housing and stock market crashes to create both the intellectual context and the political constituency for change.'b'For inspiration, Congress should turn to the electrifying hearings of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, held in the waning months of the Hoover presidency and the early days of the New Deal. In historical shorthand, these hearings have taken their name from the committee counsel, Ferdinand Pecora, a former assistant district attorney from New York who, starting in January 1933, was chief counsel for the investigation. Under Pecora\xe2\x80\x99s expert and often withering questioning, the Senate committee unearthed a secret financial history of the 1920s, demystifying the assorted frauds, scams and abuses that culminated in the 1929 crash.'b'The riveting confrontation between Pecora and the Wall Street grandees was so theatrically apt it might have been concocted by  Hollywood.  The combative Pecora was the perfect foil to the posh bankers who paraded before the microphones. Born in Sicily, the son of an immigrant cobbler, Pecora had campaigned for Teddy Roosevelt and been imbued with the crusading fervor of the Progressive Era. As a prosecutor in the 1920s, he had shut down more than 100 \xe2\x80\x9cbucket shops\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 seamy, fly-by-night brokerage houses \xe2\x80\x94 and this had tutored him in the shady side of Wall Street.'b'With crinkly black hair and flashing eyes, Pecora was an earthy populist who appealed to Depression audiences. He was fond of playing pinochle and was often portrayed with a thick cigar clamped between his teeth. When he was hired for $255 per month by the Senate committee, Pecora was earning less money than most Wall Street mandarins disbursed weekly in pocket change.'b'Pecora was meticulous in preparation and legendary in stamina, mastering reams of material and staying up half the night before interrogations, aided by John T. Flynn, an Irish-American journalist, and Max Lowenthal, a Jewish lawyer. As Flynn wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cI looked with astonishment at this man who, through the intricate mazes of banking, syndicates, market deals, chicanery of all sorts, and in a field new to him, never forgot a name, never made an error in a figure, and never lost his temper.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As Pecora relentlessly grilled the most famous names in finance, the nation relived the 1920s boom in a collective act of national remembrance. The hearings started in a modest committee room, but as the public was swept up in the drama, they shifted to a stately caucus room, illuminated by chandeliers and flashbulbs. As it gained momentum, the inquiry expanded until it shined a searchlight into every murky corner of Wall Street. Pecora exposed a stock market manipulated by speculators to the detriment of small investors who could suddenly attach names and faces to their losses.'b'Bankers had been demigods in the 1920s, their doings followed avidly, their market commentary quoted with reverence. They had inhabited a clubby world of chauffeured limousines and wood-paneled rooms, insulated from ordinary Americans. Now Pecora defrocked these high priests, making them seem small and shabby.'b'On Black Thursday of 1929, the nation had applauded  a seemingly heroic attempt by major bankers, including Albert Wiggin of Chase and Charles Mitchell of National City, to stem the market decline. Pecora showed that  Wiggin had actually shorted Chase shares during the crash, profiting from falling prices. He also revealed that Mitchell and top officers at National City had helped themselves to $2.4 million in interest-free loans from the bank\xe2\x80\x99s coffers to ease them through the crash. National City, it turned out, had also palmed off bad loans to Latin American countries by packing them into securities and selling them to unsuspecting investors. By the time Pecora got through with the bankers, Senator Burton Wheeler of Montana was likening them to Al Capone and the public referred to them as \xe2\x80\x9cbanksters,\xe2\x80\x9d rhyming with gangsters.'b'With a public aching for retribution, Pecora was playing with combustible chemicals, and Wall Street complained that he was destroying confidence. President Franklin Roosevelt retorted that the bankers \xe2\x80\x9cshould have thought of that when they did the things that are being exposed now.\xe2\x80\x9d It was hard for Wall Street to mount a legitimate defense as Pecora pilloried them daily.'b'His prosecutorial methods grew questionable when he turned to the mysterious world of private banking, exemplified by the House of Morgan. In implacable style, Pecora badgered Morgan partners into admitting that they had paid no taxes for 1931 and 1932 \xe2\x80\x94 an incendiary revelation when the country  was undertaking huge public works projects to combat unemployment. That the Morgan men had avoided taxes because of stock market losses was  lost amid the hubbub.'b'No less inflammatory was exposure of Morgan\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpreferred list\xe2\x80\x9d by which the bank\xe2\x80\x99s influential friends participated in stock offerings at steeply discounted rates. The renowned names on the list, including Calvin Coolidge, the former president, and Owen J. Roberts, a Supreme Court justice, shocked the nation with its unseemly association of money and power.'b'One Morgan partner, George Whitney, lamely explained that the intent was to safeguard small investors by preventing them from assuming such risk. To which Pecora responded tartly in his best-selling book, \xe2\x80\x9cWall Street Under Oath,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMany there were who would gladly have helped them share that appalling peril!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Such was the furor over the Morgan testimony that Senator Carter Glass of Virginia shook his head and sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are having a circus, and the only things lacking now are peanuts and colored lemonade.\xe2\x80\x9d Seizing on the comment, a press agent for the Ringling Brothers Circus took advantage of a pause in the hearings to pop Lya Graf, a midget in a blue satin dress, on the lap of the portly and surprised J. P. Morgan Jr. The committee chairman, Senator Duncan Fletcher of Florida, pleaded with newspapers  not to print the pictures, which only made them rush to do so.'b'The photo of Morgan with a circus midget planted on his lap became the signature shot of the hearings, emblematic of Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s fallen state. An embittered J. P. Morgan Jr. said Pecora had \xe2\x80\x9cthe manners of a prosecuting attorney who is trying to convict a horse thief.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Whatever their failings, the Pecora hearings laid the groundwork for financial reform legislation. By the time they ended in May 1934, they had generated 12,000 printed pages of testimony, collected in several thick volumes. These documents have served generations of historians. Our national narrative of stock market mayhem in the 1920s is largely composed of characters and anecdotes gleaned from their pages.'b'Pecora not only documented a litany of abuses, but also paved the way for remedial legislation. The Securities Act of 1933, the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 \xe2\x80\x94 all addressed abuses exposed by Pecora. It was only poetic justice when Roosevelt  tapped him as a commissioner of the newborn Securities and Exchange Commission.'b'Our current stock market slump and housing bust can seem like natural calamities without identifiable culprits, creating free-floating anger in the land. A public deeply disenchanted with our financial leadership is desperately searching for answers. The new Congress has a chance to lead the nation, step by step, through all the machinations that led to the present debacle and to shape wise legislation to prevent a recurrence.'b'A Dec. 20 Op-Ed article about the Indian security services\xe2\x80\x99 response to the Mumbai terrorist attacks misspelled the name of the author. He is Ami Pedahzur, not Pedazhur.'b'With its ground incursion into Gaza, Israel has gambled that it can finally silence the Hamas rockets that have terrorized its people for years. We sympathize with that goal. But we are concerned that short-term success on the battlefield might encourage the Israelis to keep pressing further and longer in an attempt to decimate Hamas and wrest Gaza from its grip.'b'That is also a goal we can sympathize with \xe2\x80\x94 there is no justification for Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s attacks or its virulent rejectionism. But it is highly unlikely, and there is a point of diminishing returns that could be easy to miscalculate.'b'The longer the Israeli incursion, the more casualties mount (550 Palestinians and 5 Israelis have died so far); the more Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s popularity grows among its supporters; the more moderate Arab states, which have correctly blamed Hamas for ending a six-month cease-fire, are alienated; and the more regional instability is fueled.'b'It will also make it harder for President-elect Barack Obama to pick up the pieces of peacemaking when he takes office on Jan. 20.'b'Israel, aided by the United States, Europe and moderate Arab states, must try to end this conflict as soon as possible and in a way that increases the chances for negotiating a broad regional peace.'b'That means ensuring at a minimum that Hamas \xe2\x80\x94 a proxy of Iran \xe2\x80\x94 is not seen as gaining from the war, that the rocket fire is halted permanently and that the terrorist group can no longer restock its arsenal with more deadly weapons via hundreds of tunnels dug under the Egypt-Gaza border.'b'Israel has made it clear that it is in no rush for a diplomatic solution, but there will have to be one. That will require compromises from Israel, including acceptance of international monitoring of a cease-fire and an increased flow of goods and people between Israel and Gaza. Accepting those conditions would help persuade skeptics that Israel\xe2\x80\x99s goals are as narrowly defined as it says they are.'b'Israel must immediately allow foreign journalists access to Gaza, as the Israeli high court ruled on Dec. 31. As in every war zone, reporting by journalists \xe2\x80\x94 and human rights monitors as well \xe2\x80\x94 can discourage abuse and is essential to full public understanding of the conflict.'b'We applaud European and Arab officials for intensifying efforts to try to achieve a meaningful cease-fire. While Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has been in Washington telephoning foreign leaders (wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Middle East peace supposed to be her legacy?), it is Europeans like President Nicolas Sarkozy of France who have traveled to the region for face-to-face talks.'b'We understand Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s decision to leave the current crisis to President Bush. But we hope he and his team are prepared for whatever faces them in this immediate crisis, and that they are working on a broader strategy for the region.'b'There is little chance of restraining Hamas without dealing with its patrons in Syria and Iran. Mr. Obama will also have to move quickly to revive Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza need to see that there is another way out of their misery and that Hamas and its rockets are not the answer.'b'W.H., an infant, was reportedly removed from her parents by Arkansas\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Human Services after she was taken to a hospital with injuries that strongly suggested abuse. Fortunately for W.H., her grandmother, a registered nurse, was eager to take her in. But there was a hitch. Her grandmother lives with another woman, and a ballot initiative recently passed in Arkansas makes it illegal for gay and unmarried heterosexual couples to adopt or become foster parents. Arkansas courts should strike down this offensive new law.'b'Arkansas has a long tradition of allowing child welfare professionals to decide who should become a foster or adoptive parent. Anti-gay forces, however, have campaigned to disqualify gay people. In 2006, the Arkansas Supreme Court struck down a regulation barring gay people from becoming foster parents.'b'Last year anti-gay activists promoted Act 1, a ballot referendum that broadened the ban to include unmarried heterosexual couples. In November, it passed with about 57 percent of the vote. The A.C.L.U. of Arkansas is challenging the new law, on behalf of a group of would-be parents and children, contending that it discriminates against gay and unmarried straight couples and that it makes it impossible to place children in the best homes.'b'The new law is undeniably discriminatory. Under Arkansas law, people convicted of major crimes, including contributing to the delinquency of a minor, remain eligible to adopt children or become foster parents. Single people who have no partner \xe2\x80\x94 or who have a large number of casual sex partners \xe2\x80\x94 are also eligible. Anyone who is in a committed relationship, gay or straight, but is not married is automatically barred.'b'The new law also interferes with the Department of Human Services\xe2\x80\x99 ability to do its job of making individualized assessments of prospective parents and placing children in the homes that are best able to meet their needs. As the W.H. case suggests, an unmarried couple could be the most qualified parents. And because of the shortage of foster parents, the ban is very likely to make children wait substantially longer for a loving home.'b'Arkansas\xe2\x80\x99s new law was a victory for the forces of bigotry and a major setback for the guiding principle of the law in adoption and foster care: the best interests of the child.'b'Ever since the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University declared New York\xe2\x80\x99s Legislature the worst and most dysfunctional in the nation, Albany\xe2\x80\x99s lawmakers have been full of grand promises to change. This week the center issued an update to its 2004 assessment, and the title \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cStill Broken\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 tells it all. New York\xe2\x80\x99s government is still a secretive, boss-driven, anti-democratic disgrace. The only real bright spot this year is that state senators have a rare opportunity to improve the way they and their colleagues do business.'b'As the Brennan analysts noted this year, legislative leaders, especially Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, have had \xe2\x80\x9ca stranglehold on the flow of legislation at all stages of the legislative process.\xe2\x80\x9d Most members have little say. Committees are run like shadow puppet theaters. Details about legislation are hard for the public to get, unless they subscribe to a bill-drafting service for $2,250 a year.'b'After being overly controlled for more than 40 years by Republican leaders, the Senate has now nominally shifted to the Democrats. The narrow Democratic majority is still a little wobbly, with three Democrats threatening to defect. But if they somehow manage to elect Senator Malcolm Smith of Queens as their new majority leader on Tuesday night, as expected, and Mr. Smith is true to his past promises of reform, that should be good news for the Legislature.'b'Two years ago in the last vote on legislative rule changes, Mr. Smith sponsored comprehensive reform similar to the Brennan Center\xe2\x80\x99s excellent ideas. The changes, which were rejected by the Republicans in the majority, would have strengthened committees, requiring lawmakers to be physically present to vote. Recently senators could fax in their yeas or nays to the committee chairman. The proposal would have required tons of transparency and made it easier for bills to come to the floor for debate instead of the usual automatic passage.'b'Many Albany veterans suspect that Mr. Smith and the  Democrats will find some way to avoid reform now that they are in charge. Maybe. But for Senate Democrats, this is their first real test. If they can really change the culture in the Senate \xe2\x80\x94 not try to sell a few tweaks of the rules as reform \xe2\x80\x94 they might embarrass the Assembly to make its  house more democratic as well.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cIsraeli Tanks and Troops Launch Attack on Gaza\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 4):'b'The status quo has failed.

Its defeat of Mahmoud Abbas\xe2\x80\x99s Fatah government would allow Hamas to take over that Palestinian territory and use it as a launching pad for an all-out war against Israel.'b'To win the elections, Hamas needed to unleash the rage of the West Bank population at a time when things were relatively calm (the settlements and settlers problem and the roadblocks notwithstanding). It knew that this anger would automatically target (along with Israel) the Abbas government, which would be perceived as a collaborator and would consequently lose the elections.'b'The tragedy is that the international community did not accurately analyze the situation and push effectively for the renewal of the cease-fire \xe2\x80\x94 and include in it enforcement provisions.

Ask what you, um, can, you know, do for your country.'b'After a lifetime of shying away from the public spotlight, Caroline Kennedy asked herself what she could do for her country.'b'Her soft-spoken answer \xe2\x80\x94 to follow her father and two uncles and serve in the Senate \xe2\x80\x94 got her ripped to shreds in the, you know, press.'b'I know about \xe2\x80\x9cyou knows.\xe2\x80\x9d I use that verbal crutch myself, a bad habit that develops from shyness and reticence about public speaking.'b'I always thought that Caroline and her  brother, John, had special magic capital in America because of their heartbreaking roles in the Kennedy House of Atreus.'b'Joe Kennedy, the wily patriarch of the clan, had pioneered the use of Hollywood glamour in pursuit of Washington power. With his glossy pop-culture political magazine, George, John reversed that equation, using his stature as an American political prince to persuade Salma Hayek to pose on the cover of his magazine.'b'I wrote a column once saying that it seemed like a frivolous use of his time. I thought he should run for office and employ his special clout to make life better for Americans. He died before he had the chance.'b'So I found it bizarre that when Caroline offered to use her magic capital  \xe2\x80\x94  and friendship with Barack Obama  \xe2\x80\x94  to help take care of New York in this time of economic distress, she was blasted by a howl of \xe2\x80\x9cHow dare she?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'People are suddenly awfully choosy about who gets to go to the former home of Jesse Helms, Strom Thurmond and Robert Torricelli.'b'Although Americans still have enough British in their genes to be drawn to dynasties, W. has no doubt soured the country on scions. And the camps of the other two New York dynasties  \xe2\x80\x94  the Clintons (still bitter about Caroline\xe2\x80\x99s endorsement of Obama) and the Cuomos (who\xe2\x80\x99d like that Senate seat for Andrew)  \xe2\x80\x94  have certainly done their best to undermine Caroline.'b'Congress, which abdicated its oversight role as the Bush crew wrecked the globe and the economy, desperately needs fresh faces and new perspectives, an infusion of class, intelligence and guts.'b'People complain that the 51-year-old Harvard and Columbia Law School grad and author is not a glib, professional pol who knows how to artfully market herself, and is someone who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t spent her life glad-handing, backstabbing and logrolling. I say, thank God.'b'The press whines that she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a pat answer about why she wants the job. I\xe2\x80\x99ve interviewed a score of men running for president; not one had a good answer for why he wanted it.'b'Robert Duffy, the mayor of Rochester, complained that when the would-be senator visited the Democratic headquarters there recently, she did not respond to pictures in a conference room of her father, mother, brother and herself as a little girl. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it creepy to expect her to emote on cue? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it more authentic to want to keep some of your most private feelings to yourself?'b'I know Caroline Kennedy. She\xe2\x80\x99s smart, cultivated, serious and unpretentious. The Senate, shamefully sparse on profiles in courage during Dick Cheney\xe2\x80\x99s reign of terror, would be lucky to get her.'b'And believe me, she talks a whole lot better than the former junior senator from New York, Al D\xe2\x80\x99Amato, who once wailed that he was \xe2\x80\x9cup to my earballs\xe2\x80\x9d in some mess, and another time complained to me that those \xe2\x80\x9clittle Jappies\xe2\x80\x9d bring over boats full of cars and then take the boats back empty.'b'Anyhow, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t how you say it. It\xe2\x80\x99s what you say. Hillary Clinton is a great talker, but she never stood up in the Senate to lead a crusade against any Republican horror show, from Terri Schiavo to the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s dishonest push to war.'b'Sitting in the Senate gallery on Tuesday as senators were sworn in by Dick Cheney, I saw plenty of lawmakers who had benefited from family.'b'Two Udalls were being sworn in, under the watchful eye of Stewart Udall. Mark Begich, the new senator from Alaska, is the son of a former Alaska congressman. The classy Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, son of the late Gov. Robert Casey, was there in a festive pink tie. John McCain, whose wife\xe2\x80\x99s money and Arizona pull made his Senate election possible, looked on with a smile. Hillary, whose husband paved the way for her to join this club and run for president, chatted with colleagues. Jay Rockefeller wandered about, as did Chris Dodd, son of Senator Thomas Dodd. And Teddy Kennedy, walking with a cane, worked the room with his old brio.'b'It isn\xe2\x80\x99t what your name is. It\xe2\x80\x99s what you do with it. Or, in the case of W., don\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'The fighting, death and destruction in Gaza is painful to watch. But it\xe2\x80\x99s all too familiar. It\xe2\x80\x99s the latest version of the longest-running play in the modern Middle East, which, if I were to give it a title, would be called: \xe2\x80\x9cWho owns this hotel? Can the Jews have a room? And shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we blow up the bar and replace it with a mosque?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That is, Gaza is a mini-version of three great struggles that have been playing out since 1948: 1) Who is going to be the regional superpower  \xe2\x80\x94  Egypt? Saudi Arabia? Iran? 2) Should there be a Jewish state in the Middle East and, if so, on what Palestinian terms? And 3) Who is going to dominate Arab society  \xe2\x80\x94  Islamists who are intolerant of other faiths and want to choke off modernity or modernists who want to embrace the future, with an Arab-Muslim face? Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at each.'b''b'WHO OWNS THIS HOTEL?'b' The struggle for hegemony over the modern Arab world is as old as Nasser\xe2\x80\x99s Egypt. But what is new today is that non-Arab Iran is now making a bid for primacy  \xe2\x80\x94  challenging Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Iran has deftly used military aid to both Hamas and Hezbollah to create a rocket-armed force on Israel\xe2\x80\x99s northern and western borders. This enables Tehran to stop and start the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at will and to paint itself as the true protector of the Palestinians, as opposed to the weak Arab regimes.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Gaza that Israel left in 2005 was bordering Egypt. The Gaza that Israel just came back to is now bordering Iran,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mamoun Fandy, director of Middle East programs at the International Institute of Strategic Studies. \xe2\x80\x9cIran has become the ultimate confrontation state. I am not sure we can talk just about \xe2\x80\x98Arab-Israeli peace\xe2\x80\x99 or the \xe2\x80\x98Arab peace initiative\xe2\x80\x99 anymore. We may be looking at an \xe2\x80\x98Iranian initiative.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d In short, the whole notion of Arab-Israeli peacemaking likely will have to change.'b''b'CAN THE JEWS HAVE A ROOM HERE?'b' Hamas rejects any recognition of Israel. By contrast, the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority, which controls the West Bank, has recognized Israel  \xe2\x80\x94  and vice versa. If you believe, as I do, that the only stable solution is a two-state one, with the Palestinians getting all of the West Bank, Gaza and Arab sectors of East Jerusalem, then you have to hope for the weakening of Hamas.'b'Why? Because nothing has damaged Palestinians more than the Hamas death-cult strategy of turning Palestinian youths into suicide bombers. Because nothing would set back a peace deal more than if Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s call to replace Israel with an Islamic state became the Palestinian negotiating position. And because Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s attacks on towns in southern Israel is destroying a two-state solution, even more than Israel\xe2\x80\x99s disastrous and reckless West Bank settlements.'b'Israel has proved that it can and will uproot settlements, as it did in Gaza. Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s rocket attacks pose an irreversible threat. They say to Israel: \xe2\x80\x9cFrom Gaza, we can hit southern Israel. If we get the West Bank, we can rocket, and thereby close, Israel\xe2\x80\x99s international airport  \xe2\x80\x94 anytime, any day, from now to eternity.\xe2\x80\x9d How many Israelis will risk relinquishing the West Bank, given this new threat?'b''b'SHOULDN\xe2\x80\x99T WE BLOW UP THE BAR AND REPLACE IT WITH A MOSQUE?'b' Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s overthrow of the more secular Fatah organization in Gaza in 2007 is part of a regionwide civil war between Islamists and modernists. In the week that Israel has been slicing through Gaza, Islamist suicide bombers have killed almost 100 Iraqis  \xe2\x80\x94  first, a group of tribal sheikhs in Yusufiya, who were working on reconciliation between Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds, and, second, mostly women and children gathered at a Shiite shrine. These unprovoked mass murders have not stirred a single protest in Europe or the Middle East.'b'Gaza today is basically ground zero for all three of these struggles, said Martin Indyk, the former Clinton administration\xe2\x80\x99s Middle East adviser whose incisive new book, \xe2\x80\x9cInnocent Abroad: An Intimate Account of American Diplomacy in the Middle East,\xe2\x80\x9d was just published. \xe2\x80\x9cThis tiny little piece of land, Gaza, has the potential to blow all of these issues wide open and present a huge problem for Barack Obama on Day 1.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Obama\xe2\x80\x99s great potential for America, noted Indyk, is also a great threat to Islamist radicals  \xe2\x80\x94  because his narrative holds tremendous appeal for Arabs. For eight years Hamas, Hezbollah and Al Qaeda have been surfing on a wave of anti-U.S. anger generated by George W. Bush. And that wave has greatly expanded their base.'b'No doubt, Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran are hoping that they can use the Gaza conflict to turn Obama into Bush. They know 'b'Barack Hussein Obama must be (am)Bushed'b' \xe2\x80\x94 to keep America and its Arab allies on the defensive. Obama has to keep his eye on the prize. His goal \xe2\x80\x94  America\xe2\x80\x99s goal \xe2\x80\x94  has to be a settlement in Gaza that eliminates the threat of Hamas rockets and opens Gaza economically to the world, under credible international supervision. That\xe2\x80\x99s what will serve U.S. interests, moderate the three great struggles and earn him respect.'b'Try this on a globe sometime, or Google Earth: Looking head-on at the planet, spin it until Hawaii is a little north and east of center. What you\xe2\x80\x99ll see \xe2\x80\x94 besides the barest fringes of America and Asia up there, New Guinea and New Zealand down there, and lots of island dots \xe2\x80\x94 is all blue.'b'This is the vast stage on which President Bush is trying to salvage his environmental legacy.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s strange but true. Mr. Bush, who has been monumentally indifferent to the health of continents and the atmosphere, is going down in history as a protector of the oceans.'b'On Tuesday, he designated three huge areas of the western Pacific as national monuments, declaring that their fish, birds, reefs and other marine life were more important than commercial fishing, drilling and mineral extraction. The protected waters encircle the Northern Mariana Islands (including the Mariana Trench, the deepest canyon on Earth) and parts of a sprawling collection of reefs and atolls known as the Line Islands.'b'They are a dazzling world of undersea volcanoes, pristine reefs, endangered seals, turtles and whales and intact food chains ruled by sharks.'b'In protecting nearly 200,000 square miles of ocean, an area far bigger than California, Mr. Bush has outdone his decision in 2006 to set aside 140,000 square miles in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands.'b'That created a single monument larger than all the country\xe2\x80\x99s national parks combined. If you judge the actions of presidential conservationists solely by the sheer size of planetary surface they protected during their time in office, Mr. Bush would outdo even Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt.'b'This record, though, has enormous asterisks:'b'*The new monuments are not nearly as big as they could have been. Mr. Bush could have set their boundaries anywhere from 3 miles from the shores of the territories they encircle to the full 200 miles under United States jurisdiction. He chose 50 miles, excluding huge expanses of deep ocean.'b'*The protections could have been more stringent. They don\xe2\x80\x99t rule out recreational fishing, for example, and do not include waters above the Mariana Trench.'b'*Big as they are, the monuments are not nearly enough to offset eight years of Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s bad environmental policies, marked by inaction on climate change, the sacrifice of millions of acres of public lands to oil and gas exploration, and indifference bordering on hostility to endangered species and fragile ecosystems.'b'Given that record, why did he create these new ocean monuments over the reported objections of Vice President Dick Cheney and the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council, a notorious enabler of reckless overfishing by commercial fleets?'b'We can take him at his word that it was the right thing to do, but we have to note as well that the areas protected are staggeringly far away and not notably prized by the corporate interests whose priorities the Bush administration has for so long made its own.'b'There was no fight involved. All it took was Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s signature under the Antiquities Act of 1906, which allows presidents to protect public lands by executive order. An environmental trophy was lying on the ground, and Mr. Bush, with just days left in his presidency, simply picked it up.'b'It will be up to President-elect Barack Obama to take it from here. He should expand the monuments to the 200-mile limit and give them full protection against fishing and other exploitation. His administration should also work to create and expand marine protected areas closer to our shores.'b'But those are just the easy lifts in a huge list of environmental tasks ahead, starting with the long-neglected fight against global warming. Melting ice caps and ocean acidification are an urgent threat to the very fish, reefs and islands that Mr. Bush lately has seen fit to protect.'b'President-elect Barack Obama and Democrats in Congress are already signaling a welcome new seriousness in Washington about protecting civil rights after eight years of erosion.'b'They are planning swift action on legislation to overturn an unjust 2007 Supreme Court decision that has made it much harder for people to challenge illegal discrimination in employment, education, housing and other fields.'b'The 5-to-4 ruling in 2007 involved Lilly Ledbetter, a supervisor at a Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company plant in Alabama. She received much smaller raises over several years than men in comparable positions.'b'Tossing aside longstanding legal precedents, government practice and a jury verdict in Ms. Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s favor, the narrow Supreme Court majority decided that she was entitled to nothing. They ruled that Ms. Ledbetter should have filed her claim within 180 days of the very first decision to pay her less. The justices rejected the argument that each subsequent discriminatory paycheck was a new violation of the law.'b'The impact of the Ledbetter decision has been broad injustice. As Robert Pear reported in The Times on Monday, courts around the country have cited the decision hundreds of times as a reason for rejecting lawsuits claiming discrimination based on race, sex, age and disability, without regard to the underlying merits of the individual cases.'b'The House is expected to vote this week on a legislative fix that would restore the law\xe2\x80\x99s original intent. The measure would state that a violation occurs each time a person receives a paycheck resulting from \xe2\x80\x9ca discriminatory compensation decision.\xe2\x80\x9d The Senate is expected to take up the bill soon after. It merits passage, along with a related bill, the Paycheck Fairness Act, which contains other useful steps for combating gender-based wage discrimination.'b'Senate Republicans blocked the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act last spring. They should consider now whether hostility to civil rights and pay equity for women is really the image they want to project for their party after the losses it suffered in November.'b'Like millions of other people around the world, the citizens of Washington are eagerly awaiting President-elect Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s inauguration ceremony later this month. The ceremony carries extra meaning in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital, where voters are counting on Mr. Obama to end the humiliating second-class citizenship that Congress has inflicted on the city for more than 200 years.'b'Washingtonians sometimes refer to their city as \xe2\x80\x9cthe last colony.\xe2\x80\x9d Congress has refused to give their Congressional representative full voting rights. Congress also wields great power over the city\xe2\x80\x99s legislative and budgetary affairs \xe2\x80\x94 even dictating how local tax revenues are spent \xe2\x80\x94 denying its citizens the rights to self-government that the rest of Americans take for granted.'b'Republican Congressional majorities have exploited this authority to score ideological points and inflict narrow policies on an overwhelmingly Democratic city. For nearly a decade, for instance, the House forbid the city from using its own tax dollars to give drug addicts access to clean needles \xe2\x80\x94 even though needle-exchange programs have been shown to slow the spread of AIDS the world over. The needle ban was overturned by a Democratic majority in the House in 2007, but only after lives were needlessly lost and the infection rate had spiraled out of control.'b'Congress also has made efficient government impossible. By insisting on final approval for all local laws, Congress forces the city to rely on temporary measures, creating what Eleanor Holmes Norton, the city\xe2\x80\x99s representative in the House, calls a \xe2\x80\x9clegislative nightmare.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As a senator, Mr. Obama supported a bill that would have given the district\xe2\x80\x99s Congressional representative full voting rights. The bill, which passed the House but succumbed to a Senate filibuster, has been reintroduced. It deserves prompt approval in both houses and Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s swift signature.'b'But it will take more than a single empowered representative to give Washington the self-government it deserves. Congress also must give the city budgetary and legislative autonomy. Only then will the citizens of the \xe2\x80\x9clast colony\xe2\x80\x9d become full-fledged Americans.'b'Until recently, astronomers believed that from where we sit \xe2\x80\x94 some 28,000 light-years out \xe2\x80\x94 we were spinning around the center of the Milky Way at about half a million miles per hour.'b'New observations suggest that we\xe2\x80\x99re traveling much faster \xe2\x80\x94 about 600,000 m.p.h. \xe2\x80\x94 and that the Milky Way is actually broader and has 50 percent more mass than was previously thought. Astronomers also have recently found evidence of a second major arm of stars spiraling outward from the Milky Way\xe2\x80\x99s central disk.'b'This is one of the wonderful things about astronomy. Our understanding of the galaxy around us undergoes a significant shift, and the only real change is the new terrain that opens up inside our heads. We don\xe2\x80\x99t experience a physical lurch, because we\xe2\x80\x99re traveling exactly as fast around the center of the Milky Way as we always were. The lurch we experience is our minds catching up to our actual physical speed. We are so exquisitely attuned to our celestial motions that we seem, to ourselves, to be standing still, no matter how our understanding of the universe changes.'b'These new observations also remind us of a basic problem in understanding the galaxy that we live in. We cannot get a view from outside it. We are essentially blinded to the structure and motions of the Milky Way by the fact that we live within it. We can see how the neighbors live over in Andromeda \xe2\x80\x94 the galaxy with which we\xe2\x80\x99ll one day collide \xe2\x80\x94 because we can see the whole galaxy in the distance, even with the naked eye on a dark, clear night.'b'There is no looking back at the Milky Way from some point beyond, certainly not in the foreseeable future. We can only guess at ourselves by observation, extrapolation and analogy.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cIsrael Deepens Gaza Incursion as Toll Mounts\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 6):'b'Thank you for showing pictures of the madness from both sides.

The wisest course for the Senate is to end the dispute by accepting the appointment.'b'A similar situation arose in 1967, when the House of Representatives refused to seat Adam Clayton Powell Jr., the outspoken congressman from Harlem accused of personal misconduct involving public funds.  I was clerking for Justice Hugo Black two years later when he joined in the Supreme Court decision that the House lacked the power to deal with Powell\xe2\x80\x99s conduct by refusing to seat him.'b'In Justice Black\xe2\x80\x99s view, one of the worst abuses of power in England resulted from  parliamentary majorities wrongly refusing to seat dissident legislators. That  experience makes me very wary about the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s barring a person from taking a seat unless its authority to do so is clear. Here it is not.'b'The Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s text is simple enough: \xe2\x80\x9cEach house shall be the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members.\xe2\x80\x9d Since no one disputes that Mr. Burris, a former Illinois attorney general, possesses the constitutional qualifications of age, residency and citizenship, the remaining issue is whether the Senate can adjudge Mr. Burris not to have been properly appointed. Although federal prosecutors are seeking a corruption indictment of Mr. Blagojevich, he is in fact still the governor. The charges that he sought bribes to appoint certain candidates to the Senate do not automatically render illegal other official acts of his office like signing laws or pardoning criminals. And because there is no evidence that a bribe was solicited from, or proffered by, Mr. Burris, his appointment is presumptively lawful.'b'Nor do the other arguments against Mr. Burris\xe2\x80\x99s appointment hold up. The contention by the Democratic leadership that Mr. Burris can be denied a seat because the Illinois secretary of state refuses to sign his appointment papers is without merit \xe2\x80\x94 it would confer upon secretaries of state absolute veto power over governors\xe2\x80\x99 appointments.'b'Postponing the decision until Mr. Blagojevich\xe2\x80\x99s removal and replacement by the lieutenant governor is not a clean solution either. Mr. Burris will argue that if his appointment was valid, Illinois law entitles  him to the seat until the 2010 election. In his view, there would be no vacancy for the new governor to fill. Having two rivals, one appointed by each governor, disputing who is the rightful senator  might be the worst possible outcome.'b'In the end, the difficult question is whether the Senate can exclude a qualified person who did nothing wrong to obtain his  appointment, and whose selection is itself without taint, because the overall appointment process was alleged to have been tarred  by corruption. This is not an easy question. I can understand how  senators might conclude that the  result of such a distorted process is legally invalid. But on balance the right answer is to seat the appointee.'b'The case for rejecting Mr. Burris is made especially troubling by the cavalier way in which some have suggested that the Senate can reject an appointee for any reason it chooses. That is wrong. The Senate\xe2\x80\x99s power to decide is only the power to decide correctly under the law, not the power to decide however the majority of the Senate prefers to decide.'b'The Supreme Court decision in the Powell case did leave open the possibility that a Congressional decision finding that a member was not properly elected \xe2\x80\x94 in this case, appointed \xe2\x80\x94 might be a \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical question\xe2\x80\x9d immune from judicial review.'b'But that some reasons for denying Mr. Burris this seat might not be subject to review by the courts means that the Senate should take more care, not less. As we emerge from eight years of extravagant executive claims of unreviewable authority, Congress  should be especially scrupulous about having a solid legal basis for controversial actions.'b'Whether or not it was wise for the governor to make an appointment, no one doubts that it would be lawful for the Senate to accept Mr. Burris. It is only a decision to exclude Mr. Burris that would lead to a continuing dispute about whether the Senate had the authority to reject the choice of a sitting governor.'b'The Senate can avoid this constitutional quagmire entirely by agreeing to seat Mr. Burris, a respected public servant no one has accused of any wrongdoing.'b'Chicago'b'IN 2009 four new senators will slip into office \xe2\x80\x94 all in violation of the Constitution, which requires a special election to fill a Senate vacancy. Colorado, Delaware, hapless Illinois and star-struck New York will have senators \xe2\x80\x9celected\xe2\x80\x9d by a single voter, the governors who appoint them.'b'It may have been a while since many of us read the 17th Amendment, which was ratified in 1913.  Its first paragraph replaced the indirect election of senators by state legislatures with \xe2\x80\x9cdirect\xe2\x80\x9d popular election by the voters. The second paragraph, which you may have skipped in school, deals with vacancies. It states that when seats open up unexpectedly,   governors \xe2\x80\x9cshall issue writs of elections to fill such vacancies.\xe2\x80\x9d The plain enough meaning is that the governor will issue an order for a   special election. But for decades now governors have opted not to issue writs directing new or special elections. Why are they ignoring the Constitution? To increase their own power, of course.'b'The pretext being used is a legal \xe2\x80\x9cproviso\xe2\x80\x9d in the amendment that comes later in the second paragraph. It states: \xe2\x80\x9cProvided, that the legislature of any state may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A proviso, one learns in law school, is to be interpreted strictly, and certainly should not cancel out the clause it modifies. In this case, that clause states in plain English that the governor must issue a writ of election. Rather than excusing the immediate issuance of a writ, the proviso simply allows the governor to make a temporary appointment until there is a special election at such time and place that the legislature determines. For example, if the legislature decided that it would take 120 days to hold a special election, it would seem perfectly proper for the governor to send a temporary appointee to vote on a pending budget bill or major treaty.'b'Yet the current practice in virtually every state flips the proviso to override the main clause. Governors don\xe2\x80\x99t issue a writ or start the machinery for a special election as the amendment requires, but instead fill the post for up to two years, until the next general election. This frustrates the whole democratic thrust of the amendment.'b'While this has been happening for decades, the corrupt nature of the practice has finally become too obvious to ignore in Illinois, now that the United States attorney has a court order to have the governor bugged. Yes, the F.B.I. complaint against Gov. Rod Blagojevich paints him as especially corrupt. But the fact is that a certain amount of political horse-trading is inherent if officials, rather than voters, fill Congressional vacancies.'b'This is why the writers of the 17th Amendment required special elections. It is also why governors and legislators have always been eager to stop these elections. They resented having to give up the old system, in which they picked the senators. As Governor Blagojevich allegedly said on tape of his opportunity to fill Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s seat, this \xe2\x80\x9cthing\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cgolden.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Defenders of the current system insist that the case of Valenti v. Rockefeller decided once and for all that governors can lawfully skip special elections. In the case, the plaintiffs had sought to require Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York to hold a vote in November 1968 (as part of that year\xe2\x80\x99s general election) to fill the Senate vacancy created by the murder of Robert F. Kennedy. The governor instead appointed Charles Goodell to fill the term until the next regular election in 1970, on the ground that there could not be the necessary primary election before the November 1968 vote.'b'The suit was taken up by a federal three-judge panel; two judges held that it was a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable exercise of discretion\xe2\x80\x9d for a New York state law to give the governor such power. The third, the widely respected Marvin Frankel, argued that the second clause of the 17th Amendment required special elections as soon as possible. But the matter hardly rests there, as the Supreme Court eventually ducked the question. In 1969 it issued a \xe2\x80\x9cper curiam\xe2\x80\x9d summary affirmance of the panel\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x94 meaning that while it didn\xe2\x80\x99t overturn the judgment, it issued no opinion in favor of it. Such an affirmance is typically not treated as a strong precedent.'b'Virtually any change in circumstance can allow the Supreme Court to look at the issue again and change its mind. And given what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in Illinois, what may have seemed a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable exercise of discretion\xe2\x80\x9d in 1968 no longer seems reasonable today. The 17th Amendment was supposed to stop backroom deals, and the courts should let it do so.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cParking Fine Too Big?

Israel remains a small island of relatively liberal democracy in a repressive Arab sea. But it is ghettoizing itself.'b'The high-tech security fence built to wall off the West Bank and the near-hermetic sealing of Gaza since withdrawal in 2005 are in the end attempts to shut out reality. Palestinians have become a vague abstraction to the vast bulk of Israelis not within the range of Hamas rockets: out of sight, out of mind. Israel, shamefully, has even prevented international journalists getting into Gaza to tell the story as they see it.'b'In this context, the hallucinogenic appeals of the government of caretaker Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to ordinary Palestinians in Gaza, asking them to realize Hamas is their common enemy, become more understandable.'b'Mark Regev, Olmert\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman, has accused Hamas of \xe2\x80\x9cholding hostage\xe2\x80\x9d these Palestinians.

Below are a few essential points that seem to be missing from the conversation, much of which has taken place in the press, about Israel\xe2\x80\x99s attack on the Gaza Strip.'b''b'THE GAZANS 'b'Most of the people living in Gaza are not there by choice. The majority of the 1.5 million people crammed into the roughly 140 square miles of the Gaza Strip belong to families that came from towns and villages outside Gaza like Ashkelon and Beersheba. They were driven to Gaza by the Israeli Army in 1948.'b''b'THE OCCUPATION 'b'The Gazans have lived under Israeli occupation since the Six-Day War in 1967. Israel is still widely considered to be an occupying power, even though it removed its troops and settlers from the strip in 2005. Israel still controls access to the area, imports and exports, and the movement of people in and out. Israel has control over Gaza\xe2\x80\x99s air space and sea coast, and its forces enter the area at will. As the occupying power, Israel has the responsibility under the Fourth Geneva Convention to see to the welfare of the civilian population of the Gaza Strip.'b''b'THE BLOCKADE 'b'Israel\xe2\x80\x99s blockade of the strip, with the support of the United States and the European Union, has grown increasingly stringent since Hamas won the Palestinian Legislative Council elections in January 2006. Fuel, electricity, imports, exports and the movement of people in and out of the Strip have been slowly choked off, leading to life-threatening problems of sanitation, health, water supply and transportation.'b'The blockade has subjected many to unemployment, penury and malnutrition. This amounts to the collective punishment \xe2\x80\x94 with the tacit support of the United States \xe2\x80\x94  of a civilian population for exercising its democratic rights.'b''b'THE CEASE-FIRE 'b'Lifting the blockade, along with a cessation of rocket fire, was one of the key terms of the June cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. This accord led to a reduction  in rockets fired from Gaza from hundreds in  May and June to a total of less than 20   in the subsequent four months (according to Israeli government figures). The cease-fire broke down when Israeli forces launched major air and ground attacks in early November; six Hamas operatives were reported killed.'b''b'WAR CRIMES'b' The targeting of civilians, whether by Hamas or by Israel, is potentially a war crime. Every human life is precious. But the numbers speak for themselves: Nearly 700 Palestinians, most of them civilians, have been killed since the conflict broke out at the end of last year. In contrast, there have been around a dozen Israelis killed, many of them soldiers. Negotiation is a much more effective way to deal with rockets and other forms of violence. This might have been able to happen had Israel fulfilled the terms of the June cease-fire and lifted its blockade of the Gaza Strip.'b'This war on the people of Gaza isn\xe2\x80\x99t really about rockets.  Nor is it about \xe2\x80\x9crestoring Israel\xe2\x80\x99s deterrence,\xe2\x80\x9d as the Israeli press might have you believe.'b'Tel Aviv'b'SUPPOSE Israel manages to prevent its campaign in Gaza from turning into a repeat of its disastrous war against Hezbollah in Lebanon in 2006. Suppose the army does not get bogged down fighting in the narrow streets of Gaza\xe2\x80\x99s refugee camps and international outrage at the spiraling death toll does not force it to pull out with rockets still falling on Israeli towns. Suppose no soldiers are taken hostage and Hamas suffers enough damage to force it to accept a cease-fire on Israel\xe2\x80\x99s terms. Then what?'b'Israeli leaders say often that the result will be to \xe2\x80\x9cre-establish deterrence\xe2\x80\x9d against Hamas, and by extension against Hezbollah and others. This harks back to the glory days when Israel defeated three Arab armies in 1967 and fought off surprise attacks from Egypt and Syria in 1973. The trouble is that \xe2\x80\x9cdeterrence\xe2\x80\x9d does not exist.'b'The effect of deterring conventional military attacks, as Israel did back then, was that aggression found other channels. For more than three decades the main threat to Israel has been not from conventional armies but from guerrilla movements like Hamas and Hezbollah. And these groups cannot be deterred.'b'During the 2006 war, the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said that merely surviving an Israeli onslaught would equal victory for his movement. The same is true of Hamas \xe2\x80\x94 even more so, in fact, since it is the only real power in Gaza, whereas Hezbollah is in finely balanced competition with other Lebanese parties. (Indeed, though some Israelis say that Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s current silence is proof that deterrence works, the real reason it has not intervened on behalf of Hamas is probably that it does not want to upset the political balance just ahead of the Lebanese elections a few months away.) Deterrence has to be equal to the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s fear of defeat; when the only defeat is annihilation, there is no deterrence unless Israel is prepared to reduce all of Gaza to rubble.'b'Even if Israel now manages to impose a cease-fire on its terms, the calm will be short-lived unless it is willing to reoccupy much of the Gaza Strip indefinitely. Moreover, as long as Israel plays the role of aggressor in Palestinian eyes, Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s support remains high. And each attack has weakened the relative moderates within Hamas and strengthened its most extremist leaders.'b'Israel needs instead to abandon its military concept of deterrence in favor of a more pragmatic political one. What could deter Hamas is the fear that by using violence it will lose support among its people.'b'How to create this? It is worth remembering that Israel launched its operation after the breakdown of a cease-fire that had held, reasonably well, for several months. Each side accused the other of breaching it, both with some justification. Instead of trying to re-establish the cease-fire, Israel\xe2\x80\x99s leaders, driven by the need to bolster their ratings ahead of an election in February, decided to try to strike a decisive blow against Hamas.'b'What Israel should do now is work for a cease-fire on terms that allow both sides to save some face. It should then do something it has done far too little of in the past: improve Gazans\xe2\x80\x99 living conditions significantly. The aim should be to construct a long-lived state of calm in which Hamas has more to lose by breaching the cease-fire than by sticking to it.'b'In the longer term Israel will have to accept that Hamas is no fringe movement that can be rooted out and destroyed, but a central part of Palestinian society. This will be the hard part, not least because of the opposition from Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s secularist Palestinian rivals, Fatah.'b'But even though Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s stated goal is Israel\xe2\x80\x99s destruction, it has said many times that it would accept a truce extending decades. Some former Israeli security chiefs argue that such an accommodation \xe2\x80\x94 a peace treaty in all but name \xe2\x80\x94 would eventually oblige Hamas to accept Israel\xe2\x80\x99s existence, or else lose its own base of support. It is a gamble, certainly. But the alternative is more innocent lives lost, more extremism and ultimately more trouble for Israel.'b'At a time when Israel is bombing Gaza to try to smash Hamas, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth remembering that Israel itself helped nurture Hamas.'b'When Hamas was founded in 1987, Israel was mostly concerned with Yasser Arafat\xe2\x80\x99s Fatah movement and figured that a religious Palestinian organization would help undermine Fatah. Israel calculated that all those Muslim fundamentalists would spend their time praying in the mosques, so it cracked down on Fatah and allowed Hamas to rise as a counterforce.'b'What we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in the Middle East is the Boomerang Syndrome. Arab terrorism built support for right-wing Israeli politicians, who took harsh actions against Palestinians, who responded with more terrorism, and so on. Extremists on each side sustain the other, and the excessive Israeli ground assault in Gaza is likely to create more terrorists in the long run.'b'If this pattern continues, we may eventually see Hamas-style Palestinians facing off against hard-line Israelis, with each side making the others\xe2\x80\x99 lives wretched  \xe2\x80\x94  and political moderates in the Middle East politically eviscerated.'b''b'I visited Gaza last summer'b' and found many Palestinians ambivalent in a way that Americans and Israelis often don\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate. Many Gazans scorn Fatah as corrupt and incompetent, and they dislike Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s overzealousness and repression.  But when they are suffering and humiliated, they find it emotionally satisfying to see Hamas fighting back.'b'Granted, Israel was profoundly provoked in this case. Israel sought an extension of its cease-fire with Hamas, and Egypt offered to mediate one  \xe2\x80\x94  but Hamas refused. When it is shelled by its neighbor, Israel has to do something.'b'But Israel\xe2\x80\x99s right to do 'b'something'b' doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it has the right to do 'b'anything'b'. Since the shelling from Gaza started in 2001, 20 Israeli civilians have been killed by rockets or mortars, according to a tabulation by Israeli human rights groups. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t justify an all-out ground invasion that has killed more than 660 people (it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to know how many are militants and how many are civilians).'b'So what could Israel have reasonably done? Bombing the tunnels through which Gazans smuggle weapons would have been a proportionate response, if Israel had stopped there, and the same is true of airstrikes on certain Hamas targets. An even better approach would have been to ease the siege in Gaza, perhaps creating an environment in which Hamas would have extended the cease-fire. It was certainly worth trying  \xe2\x80\x94  and almost anything would be better than lashing out in a way that would create more boomerangs.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis policy is not strengthening Israel,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Sari Bashi, the executive director of 'b'Gisha'b',  an Israeli human rights group that works on Gaza issues. \xe2\x80\x9cThe trauma that 1.5 million people have been undergoing in Gaza is going to have long-term effects for our ability to live together.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy colleague in Gaza works for an Israeli organization. She\xe2\x80\x99s learning Hebrew, and she\xe2\x80\x99s just the kind of person we can build a future with. And her 6-year-old nephew, every time a bomb drops from the air, is at first scared and then says  \xe2\x80\x94  hopefully  \xe2\x80\x94  maybe the Qassam Brigades will now fire rockets at the Israelis.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Israel\xe2\x80\x99s strategy has been to make ordinary Palestinians suffer in hopes of creating ill will toward Hamas. That\xe2\x80\x99s why, beginning in 2007, Israel cut back fuel shipments for Gaza utilities \xe2\x80\x94 and why today, in the aftermath of the bombings, 800,000 Gaza residents lack running water, Ms. Bashi said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Israeli policy on Gaza has been marketed as a policy against Hamas, but in reality it\xe2\x80\x99s a policy against a million-and-a-half people in Gaza,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'We all know that the most plausible solution to the Middle East mess is a two-state solution along the lines that former President Bill Clinton has proposed. It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to tell how we get there from here, but a crucial step is to strengthen President Mahmoud Abbas and his Palestinian Authority.'b'Instead, initial reports are that the assault on Gaza is focusing Arab anger on Mr. Abbas and moderate neighbors like Jordan, undermining the peacemakers.'b'My courageous Times colleague in Gaza, Taghreed el-Khodary, quoted a 37-year-old father 'b'weeping over the corpse'b' of his 11-year-old daughter: \xe2\x80\x9cFrom now on, I am Hamas. I choose resistance.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Barack Obama has said relatively little about Gaza. At first, given the provocations by Hamas, that was understandable. But as the ground invasion costs more lives, he needs to join European leaders in calling for a new cease-fire on all sides  \xe2\x80\x94  and after he assumes the presidency, he must provide real leadership that the world craves.'b'Aaron David Miller, a longtime Middle East peace negotiator for the United States, suggests in his excellent new book, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Much Too Promised Land,\xe2\x80\x9d that presidents should offer Israel \xe2\x80\x9clove, but tough love.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'So, Mr. Obama, find your voice. Fall in tough love with Israel.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy state, the state of Illinois, has gone through quite a beating since our governor was arrested,\xe2\x80\x9d said Senator Dick Durbin on Wednesday. Given the long roll call of gubernatorial incarcerations there, this could well be the unofficial state motto.'b'The topic was the endlessly developing story of who is going to sit in Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s former Senate seat. Was the selection of Roland Burris by the Rogue Governor Rod Blagojevich \xe2\x80\x9ctainted,\xe2\x80\x9d in the words of the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, or \xe2\x80\x9cwhat the Lord has ordained,\xe2\x80\x9d in the words of Burris?'b'Reid was heavy of heart. A new Democratic president  \xe2\x80\x94  from Illinois!  \xe2\x80\x94  was about to be sworn in. But instead of celebrations, the days were devoted to Burris developments. It was ruining everything. Durbin could not even hold a party without worrying about what he would do if Burris crashed it.'b'On Tuesday, when Obama was warning about \xe2\x80\x9ctrillion-dollar deficits,\xe2\x80\x9d it was Burris, standing in a puddle outside the Capitol, who created an absolute media riot, a collision of cameras of Anna-Nicole-Smith-autopsy proportions. He then made his way to the office of the secretary of the Senate, a veritable walking clog of tape recorders.'b'There, as Reid explained later, Burris had \xe2\x80\x9can extremely gracious meeting\xe2\x80\x9d that ended with a gracious eviction.'b'Last week, the majority leader had sternly decreed that nobody selected by Blagojevich was ever going to be seated in the Senate. But his spirit seems broken. Clearly, he had underestimated Burris\xe2\x80\x99s determination. And the entire debate has been complicated by arguments that the seat should go to someone who, like Burris, is an African-American. You know you\xe2\x80\x99re having a bad week when you\xe2\x80\x99re being called a racist by Rush Limbaugh. (\xe2\x80\x9cRemember, all these great segregationists of the past are Democrats.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'By midweek, Reid was restricting himself to arguing that at least for the time being, Burris cannot be seated because the Illinois secretary of state has refused to sign off on the paperwork. That signature was a tradition since 1884! \xe2\x80\x9cPeople ask a lot of times why we have to do things procedurally in the Senate,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, arguing for Rules Committee hearings. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s because we\xe2\x80\x99re the Senate.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And how do we feel about this matter, people? According to federal prosecutors, Blagojevich only decided to appoint Burris after the governor failed in earlier attempts to auction the seat off. But nobody has accused Burris of being one of the bidders. In fact, if we were making a list of the pros and cons of putting this guy in the Senate, \xe2\x80\x9cnoncorrupt\xe2\x80\x9d would be No. 1 on the plus side.'b'On the negative side, you might want to include the fact that Burris has already constructed a mausoleum for himself that is topped by Illinois\xe2\x80\x99s state seal and the legend \xe2\x80\x9cTrail Blazer.\xe2\x80\x9d Those are followed by a list of his historic firsts, ranging from the impressive (first African-American elected to a statewide office in Illinois) to some stuff you would really try to refrain from bragging about except at parties in which there had been a great deal of drinking (first African-American exchange student from Southern Illinois University to Hamburg). There also is a sidebar granite slab for \xe2\x80\x9cOther Major Accomplishments.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As the mausoleum illustrates, even in an occupation in which oversized egos are practically a career requirement, Burris can be a little alarming. The fact that he made Illinois history by being elected state comptroller in 1979 is something you would feel like admiring a lot more if Burris had not told The Associated Press in 2008: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d say if there hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been a Roland Burris, that there would not have been a Carol Braun or a Barack Obama.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Legally, the secretary-of-state-signature argument seems kind of shaky. You may be stunned to learn that it does not appear to be the true basis of Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 objections. The party wants somebody who can win election to a full term in 2010. At 71, Burris has been out of office for 14 years, and although he had successful races for comptroller and attorney general, he lost bids to become a senator, the mayor of Chicago and governor (three times).'b'Burris told CNN that he had originally been open to the idea of agreeing to serve the two years and retire but that his \xe2\x80\x9cfriends and supporters\xe2\x80\x9d had protested.'b'So where does that leave us? To summarize  \xe2\x80\x94'b'Pros:'b'1) Not corrupt.'b'2) Rod Blagojevich is smarter than he looks.'b'3) Make Rush Limbaugh stop calling Harry Reid a racist.'b'Cons:'b'1) Mausoleum syndrome.'b'2) Secretary of state signature thing.'b'3) Excessive reliance on the political advice of loved ones.'b'Personally, I say give the guy the seat. Worst-case scenario, Illinois gets an overly self-involved lawmaker who seems, at this point in his life, to have a tendency to say things that sound somewhat silly. If that was a disqualification, the Senate could never meet a quorum call again.'b'The financial crisis is now more than a year old. It intensified through an entire presidential campaign and has persisted during the postelection transition. And yet, less than two weeks from Inauguration Day, it is still unclear what President-elect Barack Obama has in mind when he promises \xe2\x80\x9ca 21st-century regulatory framework.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The outlines of the challenge are clear. The decades-old ways \xe2\x80\x94 in which the Treasury and other federal regulators have relied less on rules and enforcement and more on faith in market discipline to limit risk to the system \xe2\x80\x94 have been a manifest failure. Anything less than a new rules-based regime would be inadequate to the task of restoring confidence and, eventually, reviving the economy. Even more basic, any new regime must be founded on a declared desire and willingness to regulate.'b'Will Mr. Obama deliver? Without a clear signal from the president-to-be, the early signs are not terribly encouraging. There are no prominent consumer or investor advocates among his top economic advisers. Except for Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, there are no officials or regulators, past or present, who have distinguished themselves by giving early warning of the impending catastrophe or taking strong action against the excesses that were fueling it.'b'Mary Schapiro, Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s choice to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, has served ably in government and industry regulatory positions, but is best known for her support of self-regulation and a greater role for principles-based regulation \xe2\x80\x94 basically, the opposite of clear rules. The choice of Gary Gensler to lead the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates futures contracts, is more troubling.'b'Mr. Gensler, a former investment banker from Goldman Sachs, one the biggest brokers of commodities, was an assistant Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton. In 2000, he oversaw the drafting of legislation that exempted derivatives from oversight by the federal commodity regulator, including the viral credit default swaps that have amplified the current crisis. Swaps and other derivatives must be regulated. The country needs an exchange where they are openly traded and subject to the full range of regulatory scrutiny.'b'Ultimately, new laws for trading derivatives must be enacted by Congress, but the input of the main regulator of the commodity exchange will be important in writing and implementing the laws. Where does Mr. Gensler stand? How do his close ties to Wall Street affect his choices, his sense of what is right and what is needed? Those are among the questions that senators have to ask him at his confirmation hearing.'b'They will need to ask similar questions of Timothy Geithner, Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s choice for Treasury secretary. As the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank since November 2003, Mr. Geithner was the closest regulator to Wall Street during the years when many of the excesses that led to the crisis proliferated in plain sight.'b'One early sign of how serious the Obama administration is about regulatory reform will be whether officials try to couch it primarily in terms of revamping the structure of regulation. There are too many regulators with overlapping demands and authority, but a new structure must derive from new rules, not vice versa.'b'In addition to explicit regulation of derivatives, those rules must include limits on the amount of money that financial institutions can borrow in order to boost returns \xe2\x80\x94 and higher requirements for the amount of capital they must hold to support their activities and cushion their losses. A wise regulatory regime would require institutions to build up capital in good years so that they can husband their resources in lean years.'b'And in addition to regulating previously unregulated investment instruments, Washington must impose regulations on equally unregulated hedge funds. There was a time when institutions that were too big to fail posed the greatest danger to the financial system and economy. This crisis has shown us that financial institutions can become so interconnected that allowing them to fail is just as dangerous. The solution is to regulate financial participants outside the formal banking system.'b'All that would only be a start. There is an important false assumption that must be laid to rest: that protecting consumers and individual investors unduly limits corporate profits and financial innovation. The establishment of what advocates call a Consumer Credit Safety Agency is long overdue. If a process had been in place to determine the effect on consumers of financial products and practices, the current crisis may well never have happened. Consumer advocates have long been aware of the lurking dangers in the subprime lending that sparked the debacle.'b'It could be that the people whose actions contributed to the mess are best equipped to clean it up. That remains to be seen. But it would be tragic if Wall Street concludes from Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s choices that it need not worry about the world changing in ways that would fundamentally alter its pursuit of profits. You will know the new rules are working when Wall Street starts worrying.'b'Over the last few months, Gov. David Paterson of New York has been handing out gloomier and gloomier news. Confronted with a huge budget deficit and an  economy  getting shakier by the day, he has announced plans to slash or at least defer almost everybody\xe2\x80\x99s favorite state program. But on Wednesday, in his first State of the State address since taking over in March from Eliot Spitzer, Governor Paterson talked about things he wanted to do, not undo.'b'Though the state of the state is \xe2\x80\x9cperilous,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, this is exactly the wrong time to hunker down and accomplish nothing. He pointedly reminded his audience of fellow lawmakers that New York had done great things in hard times. Construction on the Empire State Building, he noted, began as the nation was sliding into the Great Depression.'b'Mr. Paterson\xe2\x80\x99s low-budget wish list is full of compelling new ideas on energy, health care, obesity and other difficult issues. In the past, we would have warned that his biggest problem might be pushing New York\xe2\x80\x99s notoriously difficult Legislature to go along. But this year, both legislative chambers are dominated by his fellow Democrats. That should make progress vastly easier, but it also should make it impossible for Democrats to blame Republicans if something does not get done.'b'Like his two immediate predecessors, Mr. Paterson chose to emphasize energy. The most ambitious item on his agenda may be a plan he calls \xe2\x80\x9c45 by 15.\xe2\x80\x9d The state would produce 30 percent of its energy from renewable sources like wind, solar and hydropower by 2015, while achieving a 15 percent reduction in energy consumption in the same time frame by investing in efficiency.'b'These are worthy goals, especially since the plan includes innovative proposals to reward energy companies for saving energy instead of selling more of it. And as part of his plan to revive a sagging economy, Mr. Paterson proposed turning upstate New York\xe2\x80\x99s old industrial belt into a national center for creating and producing new hybrid automobile batteries. Today\xe2\x80\x99s batteries have limited range and are a stumbling block to widespread acceptance of hybrid cars.'b'Mr. Paterson also spoke at length about health care. One important proposal would allow employees to expand private health care coverage to dependents up to age 29, a quick way of providing health coverage for an age group that is notoriously underinsured.'b'Given the power of the food and soft-drink lobbies in Albany, Mr. Paterson set himself a daunting challenge by pledging to fight the alarming rate of diabetes, especially among the young. To combat obesity, he would expand statewide some of most successful changes made by Mayor Michael Bloomberg in New York City, including a ban on trans fats and the requirement that chain restaurants post calorie counts. The governor also wants a surcharge on sugary drinks, a statewide ban on junk foods in schools and a better way of getting healthier foods or green markets in poorer areas.'b'Mr. Paterson promised to reform the outdated, counterproductive Rockefeller drug laws and provide more loans for college-bound students. Both proposals should be easier to pass in a Democratic-led Legislature. Less easy will be his proposal to cap property taxes, which many lawmakers understandably regard as a popular but flawed idea.'b'The most glaring omission was any plan for real political reform. He did not mention the need to change the campaign finance system or the scandalous way legislators draw their own districts. This was a missed opportunity in an otherwise promising summons to confront New York\xe2\x80\x99s historic challenges.'b'Spending on health care in the United States grew in 2007 at the lowest rate in nine years, according to government analysts \xe2\x80\x94 a sliver of good news for those worried about the relentless rise in health care costs. But buried within the overall statistics was sobering evidence that health costs continue to be a pressing concern that can only be remedied through deep-seated reform in the delivery of health services.'b'The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported this week that total health care spending rose 6.1 percent in 2007, slightly less than the growth of 6.7 percent in 2006. Even so, it continued to expand faster than the overall economy, reaching a total of $2.2 trillion in 2007, or 16.2 percent of the gross domestic product, a record.'b'The chief reason for the overall slowdown was much slower growth in spending on prescription drugs. Retail spending on prescription drugs rose only 4.9 percent in 2007. That was the lowest rate in more than four decades, well below the 8.6 percent growth the previous year and the average of 9.4 percent a year from 2001 to 2006.'b'Government analysts attributed the deceleration to increased use of generic drugs as many brand-name blockbusters lost patent protection, as well as to slower growth in prescription drug prices and safety concerns that depressed sales of some drugs. The big uncertainty is whether the slowdown will continue or is a temporary phenomenon.'b'In contrast to prescription drugs, spending for most other health care services, including payments to hospitals, clinics, nursing homes and home health services, grew at about the same rate or faster in 2007 as in 2006. Only the growth rate in spending for physician services declined, partly because Congress reduced Medicare payments to doctors for imaging services that many experts believe are widely overused.'b'Given that prescription drugs make up a relatively small slice of total  spending on health care \xe2\x80\x94 some 10 percent  \xe2\x80\x94 it will be imperative to reduce the growth rates in spending on hospital care, nursing care and other medical services if health care is to become more affordable.'b'Christina Romer is Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s choice to lead his Council of Economic Advisers. In 1994, Romer and her husband, David, wrote an essay entitled \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Ends Recessions?\xe2\x80\x9d In the first paragraph, the Romers noted that \xe2\x80\x9ceconomists seem strangely unsure about what to tell policy makers to do to end recessions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Romers surveyed the recessions of the previous 50 years to try to reach some conclusions about what works. \xe2\x80\x9cOur central conclusion is that monetary policy alone is a sufficiently powerful and flexible tool to end recessions,\xe2\x80\x9d they wrote. Automatic spending policies like unemployment insurance have sometimes helped. Discretionary policies, like tax cuts and stimulus plans, have not been of much use. As they put it: \xe2\x80\x9cDiscretionary fiscal policy, in contrast, does not appear to have had an important role in generating recoveries.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Romers briefly described how different administrations responded to recessions. All the administrations, Democratic and Republican, resisted large-scale fiscal stimulus plans. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe they could time a stimulus correctly. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t trust Congress to pass the bills quickly or cleanly. They decided they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be making policy in what Kennedy administration economists called \xe2\x80\x9can atmosphere of haste and panic brought on by recession.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Romers\xe2\x80\x99 essay exemplifies the economic doctrine that reigned up until a few months ago: fiscal stimulus plans that try to time a recession are dangerous, unproven and unnecessary.'b'That doctrine has suddenly vanished. But not because we suddenly know how to create effective stimulus plans. Last year, the Congress passed a $165 billion plan that seems to have done almost nothing for the economy. The doctrine has vanished because this recession is deeper than the others and we\xe2\x80\x99ve run out of other stuff to do.'b'Today there is wide support for fiscal stimulus. It\xe2\x80\x99s just that there is no historical experience to tell us how to do it, and there is no agreement on how to make it work. The economists\xe2\x80\x99 prescriptions are all over the map.'b'Obama is compelled to jump into uncharted territory, with no compass or guide. He could have chosen to spend the big money that is apparently required in cautious ways. He could have chosen to pick out a few easily implemented policies that could be enacted in a way that is targeted, temporary and timely. He could have chosen to merely cut the payroll tax, boost aid to the states and do infrastructure projects.'b'But the Obama presidency is going to be defined by his audacious self-confidence. In Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s speech, he vowed to do everything at once. He vowed to throw the big things into the stimulus soup \xe2\x80\x94 tax cuts, state aid, road and bridge repair \xe2\x80\x94 but also the rest of the pantry. He proposes broadband projects, special education programs, a new power grid, new scientific research, teacher training projects and new libraries.'b'This will be the most complex piece of legislation in American history, and as if the policy content wasn\xe2\x80\x99t complicated enough, Obama also promised to pass it via Immaculate Conception \xe2\x80\x94 through a new legislative process that will transform politics. The process, he said, will be totally transparent. There will be no earmarks, no special-interest pleading. In a direct rebuttal to Federalist No. 10, he called on lawmakers to put aside their parochial concerns and pass the measure in weeks.'b'And as if that isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough, he promised next month to make repairing Social Security and Medicare a \xe2\x80\x9ccentral part\xe2\x80\x9d of his budget. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not out to increase the size of government long-term,\xe2\x80\x9d he told John Harwood of The Times.'b'This is daring and impressive stuff. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s team has clearly thought through every piece of this plan. There\xe2\x80\x99s no plank that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously wasteful or that reeks of special-interest pleading. The tax cut is big and bipartisan. Obama is properly worried about runaway deficits, but he\xe2\x80\x99s spending money on things one would want to do anyway. This is not an attempt to use the crisis to build a European-style welfare state.'b'The problem is overload. Four months ago, no one knew how to put together a stimulus package. Now Obama wants to use it to rush through instant special-ed programs and pre-Ks. Repairing the power grid means clearing complex regulatory hurdles. How is he going to do that in time to employ workers in May?'b'His staff will be searching for the White House restrooms, and they will have to make billion-dollar decisions by the hour. He is asking Congress to behave and submit in a way it never has. He has picked policies that are phenomenally hard to implement, let alone in weeks. The conventional advice for presidents is: focus your energies on a few big things. Obama just blew the doors off that one.'b'Maybe Obama can pull this off, but I have my worries. By this time next year, he\xe2\x80\x99ll either be a great president or a broken one.'b'The main thing we learned from Tom Daschle\xe2\x80\x99s confirmation hearing in the Senate on Thursday was that President-elect Barack Obama sure picked the right man to stage manage his health care reforms as secretary of health and human services and as health czar at the White House. The hearing before a Senate health committee was mostly a love-fest as senators from both parties expressed admiration for their former Senate colleague and signaled a willingness to work collaboratively with him on the daunting task of improving the costly, dysfunctional health care system.'b'Unfortunately, the hearing did not tell us much at all about how the incoming Obama administration intends to pay for its emerging health care programs or how, for all of his smoothness at the hearing, Mr. Daschle will deal with the very real and very big differences his team has with Republicans on this and other vital issues.'b'Instead, the senators avoided asking such tough questions, and Mr. Daschle bent over backward to reassure Republicans that he would not try to ram anything too unpalatable down their throats. He pledged to cooperate with Congress on an aggressive, open reform effort that would be guided by evidence, not ideology.'b'When Senator Mike Enzi, the ranking Republican on the committee, asked if Mr. Daschle would share information with members of both parties and respond rapidly to their requests (something the Bush administration rarely did), Mr. Daschle answered unequivocally, \xe2\x80\x9cyes.\xe2\x80\x9d More telling, when Mr. Enzi asked if Mr. Daschle would discourage the use of budget reconciliation, a process that prevents filibusters and would allow a simple majority to approve health reform legislation, Mr. Daschle again said, \xe2\x80\x9cyes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That seemed to indicate that the Democrats will be pushing for reforms that can command support from large bipartisan majorities in Congress. Yet the seeds of partisan conflict are already being planted. Mr. Enzi issued a press release warning against expanding insurance coverage through government-run bureaucracies like Medicaid and asserting that any new coverage must come through private health insurance plans.'b'If he meant that literally, he would have to oppose major elements of the Obama health plans, which envisage expanding existing public programs and probably adding a new public program to compete with private plans. Of course, if the Republicans become too obstinate in blocking major elements they don\xe2\x80\x99t like, Democratic leaders in the Senate could choose to close off debate no matter what Mr. Daschle has recommended.'b'There were few if any surprises in Mr. Daschle\xe2\x80\x99s broad-brush statements on policy. He wants wider insurance coverage, lower costs, higher quality care, more preventive care, an emphasis on keeping people well, greater use of information technology, more money for community health centers, a stronger Food and Drug Administration and speedier approval of low-cost generic drugs, among other issues.'b'He gave no indication of how to pay for all this or how to rein in the escalating costs of entitlement programs, and he was not asked such probing questions by a committee that seems certain to recommend his confirmation. Mr. Daschle may face tougher questions at a second confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicare and Medicaid, but the real struggles will begin when a detailed plan is put forward by the Obama administration.'b'Three years ago, the Europeans were jolted when a gas-pricing dispute between Russia and Ukraine briefly cut gas supplies to Europe. That led to a lot of talk about the need for a unified stance toward Moscow \xe2\x80\x94 and a rush by a few members to cut separate deals. Now that it has happened again, and with far greater disruptions, the only surprise is that anyone in Europe is surprised.'b'In this case, it\xe2\x80\x99s debatable as to who is chiefly responsible for this week\xe2\x80\x99s  sharp cut in Russian gas flowing through Ukraine. Russia is feeling the pain of falling energy prices and is anxious to get closer to the market price from Ukraine. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin also has no compunctions about using energy to promote his imperial ambitions. But Ukraine is by no means an innocent victim. Its president and prime minister are locked in a fierce power struggle, and its energy industry is mired in shady political and business dealings.'b'All this was known in 2006. Since then, neither Russia nor Ukraine has made any effort to stabilize their gas trade \xe2\x80\x94 nor have they felt any outside pressure to do so. The Bush administration deemed it far more important to try to get Ukraine into NATO than to press it to reform its energy industry. Germany, France and other European nations spent all their time currying favor with Mr. Putin, while the European Union stood on the sidelines.'b'On Thursday night, the European Union announced a deal with Russia on supervising the flow of gas through Ukraine.  That would only be a temporary fix.  Europe and the United States must press both countries to come up with a rational schedule for raising gas prices closer to market rates \xe2\x80\x94 one that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bankrupt Ukraine overnight but also guarantees Moscow a fairer deal.'b'Europe and Washington have leverage. Gazprom, the Russian gas monopoly, badly needs investment capital, and Russia needs the income. Ukraine wants closer ties to the West. Wielding these levers, however, requires Europe to speak to Russia with one voice. The incoming American administration will have to come up with a clear-eyed approach to Mr. Putin \xe2\x80\x94 something President Bush never managed.'b'This week\xe2\x80\x99s big chill is yet another reminder of why Europe needs to reduce its dependence on Russian gas \xe2\x80\x94 building more storage facilities and finding alternative energy sources. The 100 billion cubic meters of gas that now flow through Ukraine are roughly 40 percent of the European Union\xe2\x80\x99s gas imports.'b'Along with the United States, the Europeans also must come up with a strategy for moderating or containing Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s bullying ways. Last month, Russia\xe2\x80\x99s Parliament extended the Russian presidency to six years. Most everyone \xe2\x80\x94 inside Russia and out \xe2\x80\x94 is now betting that Mr. Putin will soon be back in that office.'b'President-elect Barack Obama has pledged to quickly nominate a commerce secretary after his first choice, Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, withdrew this week. Frankly, the far more pressing task at the Commerce Department is to name a new director of the Census Bureau.'b'With only a year to go before the nationwide count in 2010, Mr. Obama needs to nominate a strong new director who can move swiftly to counteract years of political meddling and neglect that have left the bureau ill prepared to conduct the next census.'b'This page has issued many warnings about the bureau\xe2\x80\x99s state of unreadiness, as have members of Congress and advocates for groups that tend to be undercounted in a less-than-robust census, especially racial and ethnic minorities, immigrants, the poor and the disabled. In November, Congressional investigators named the 2010 census as one of 13 issues requiring Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s immediate attention.'b'Any further delay increases the chances, which are already too high, of a botched census in 2010. That would be a very expensive failure of a constitutionally mandated duty on Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s watch. The damage would be compounded in 2012, when the new census data will be used by state governments to redraw electoral districts. If the census is not accurate, the electoral map also would not be \xe2\x80\x94 for years to come.'b'If Mr. Obama and his team need any more reasons to act now to rescue the census, they should note that the party most likely to benefit from a faulty count is certainly not their own. That\xe2\x80\x99s because an inaccurate census generally overcounts people who tend to fit the Republican profile \xe2\x80\x94 white, English-speaking and suburban \xe2\x80\x94 and to undercount diverse, mobile urban populations.'b'The census also is used to allocate federal aid to states \xe2\x80\x94 an increasingly important issue in the midst of the country\xe2\x80\x99s deep economic troubles.'b'More than a month ago, this page noted that the director of the acclaimed 2000 census, Kenneth Prewitt, would be the obvious choice to pull the 2010 census out of the hat. If the Obama team has a better candidate, it\xe2\x80\x99s past time to put his or her name forward.'b'In 2007, Steve Jobs, the chief executive of Apple, wrote a letter to customers called \xe2\x80\x9cThoughts on Music.\xe2\x80\x9d The letter was really his thoughts on copyright protection, otherwise called digital rights management, or  D.R.M. He pointed out some of the inherent contradictions that most music buyers have noticed \xe2\x80\x94 most CDs come with no copy protection, unlike music sold online \xe2\x80\x94 and he concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cD.R.M.\xe2\x80\x99s haven\xe2\x80\x99t worked, and may never work, to halt music piracy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Now Apple has followed up on Jobs\xe2\x80\x99s thinking. As of this week, it will begin selling music online without copy protection. Of course, because of its format, music sold through the company\xe2\x80\x99s iTunes Store is playable only on certain types of portable music players, notably the iPod. Buyers also will have to pay more for newer songs than older ones. And Apple will charge a fee to convert old copy-protected music files, en masse, into new, unrestricted files.'b'Still, this change \xe2\x80\x94 like the recording industry\xe2\x80\x99s recent decision to stop prosecuting individual music file-sharers \xe2\x80\x94 acknowledges the sea change across the entire music industry. Sales of CDs have dropped by nearly half since their peak in 2000. The sales of albums in any form \xe2\x80\x94 collections of songs \xe2\x80\x94 have dropped, too, because consumers are buying individual songs instead, which online music stores allow them to do with ease.'b'We applaud Apple\xe2\x80\x99s decision to do away with the digital rights management software. Apple is acknowledging the failure of the restrictive copyright protections championed by the Recording Industry Association of America.'b'It also is recognizing something fundamental about music lovers that restriction-free online vendors know. Most of us will buy, not steal, digital music, even if it lacks copyright protection. Shared music is the best advertisement for the music we will eventually purchase.'b'To the Editor:'b'The Jan. 8 Op-Ed column and articles about the Gaza conflict by Nicholas D.

The notion, espoused in these articles, that Israeli military action is the source of the problems and counterproductive because it brings Hamas more support misses the crux of the problem.'b'Hamas took over in Gaza not in response to Israeli military actions but after Israel unilaterally left Gaza in 2005, a moment that offered hope for a new life for Palestinians.

In other words, Israeli concessions led to greater Palestinian extremism.'b'Therefore, to blame Israel\xe2\x80\x99s military for the problems of the Palestinians in Gaza is absurd and provides no solace for Israelis living under years of rocket attacks out of Gaza.'b'Any solution to the problems created by Hamas rejectionist positions that relies solely on Israeli action without true partners in the region and beyond places an onus on Israel that is simply not sustainable.'b'Abraham H.

This is the most dangerous economic crisis since the Great Depression, and it could all too easily turn into a prolonged slump.'b'But Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s prescription doesn\xe2\x80\x99t live up to his diagnosis. The economic plan he\xe2\x80\x99s offering isn\xe2\x80\x99t as strong as his language about the economic threat. In fact, it falls well short of what\xe2\x80\x99s needed.'b'Bear in mind just how big the U.S. economy is. Given sufficient demand for its output, America would produce more than $30 trillion worth of goods and services over the next two years. But with both consumer spending and business investment plunging, a huge gap is opening up between what the American economy can produce and what it\xe2\x80\x99s able to sell.'b'And the Obama plan is nowhere near big enough to fill this \xe2\x80\x9coutput gap.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Earlier this week, the Congressional Budget Office came out with its latest analysis of the budget and economic outlook. The budget office says that in the absence of a stimulus plan, the unemployment rate would rise above 9 percent by early 2010, and stay high for years to come.'b'Grim as this projection is, by the way, it\xe2\x80\x99s actually optimistic compared with some independent forecasts. Mr. Obama himself has been saying that without a stimulus plan, the unemployment rate could go into double digits.'b'Even the C.B.O. says, however, that \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic output over the next two years will average 6.8 percent below its potential.\xe2\x80\x9d This translates into $2.1 trillion of lost production. \xe2\x80\x9cOur economy could fall $1 trillion short of its full capacity,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Mr. Obama on Thursday. Well, he was actually understating things.'b'To close a gap of more than $2 trillion  \xe2\x80\x94  possibly a lot more, if the budget office projections turn out to be too optimistic  \xe2\x80\x94  Mr. Obama offers a $775 billion plan. And that\xe2\x80\x99s not enough.'b'Now, fiscal stimulus can sometimes have a \xe2\x80\x9cmultiplier\xe2\x80\x9d effect: In addition to the direct effects of, say, investment in infrastructure on demand, there can be a further indirect effect as higher incomes lead to higher consumer spending. Standard estimates suggest that a dollar of public spending raises G.D.P. by around $1.50.'b'But only about 60 percent of the Obama plan consists of public spending. The rest consists of tax cuts  \xe2\x80\x94  and many economists are skeptical about how much these tax cuts, especially the tax breaks for business, will actually do to boost spending. (A number of Senate Democrats apparently share these doubts.) Howard Gleckman of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center summed it up in the title of a recent blog posting: \xe2\x80\x9clots of buck, not much bang.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The bottom line is that the Obama plan is unlikely to close more than half of the looming output gap, and could easily end up doing less than a third of the job.'b'Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t Mr. Obama trying to do more?'b'Is the plan being limited by fear of debt? There are dangers associated with large-scale government borrowing  \xe2\x80\x94  and this week\xe2\x80\x99s C.B.O. report projected a $1.2 trillion deficit for this year. But it would be even more dangerous to fall short in rescuing the economy. The president-elect spoke eloquently and accurately on Thursday about the consequences of failing to act  \xe2\x80\x94  there\xe2\x80\x99s a real risk that we\xe2\x80\x99ll slide into a prolonged, Japanese-style deflationary trap  \xe2\x80\x94  but the consequences of failing to act adequately aren\xe2\x80\x99t much better.'b'Is the plan being limited by a lack of spending opportunities? There are only a limited number of \xe2\x80\x9cshovel-ready\xe2\x80\x9d public investment projects \xe2\x80\x94  that is, projects that can be started quickly enough to help the economy in the near term. But there are other forms of public spending, especially on health care, that could do good while aiding the economy in its hour of need.'b'Or is the plan being limited by political caution? Press reports last month indicated that Obama aides were anxious to keep the final price tag on the plan below the politically sensitive trillion-dollar mark. There also have been suggestions that the plan\xe2\x80\x99s inclusion of large business tax cuts, which add to its cost but will do little for the economy, is an attempt to win Republican votes in Congress.'b'Whatever the explanation, the Obama plan just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look adequate to the economy\xe2\x80\x99s need. To be sure, a third of a loaf is better than none. But right now we seem to be facing two major economic gaps: the gap between the economy\xe2\x80\x99s potential and its likely performance, and the gap between Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s stern economic rhetoric and his somewhat disappointing economic plan.'b'THE countdown clock is ticking on the digital television transition and it is becoming increasingly clear that the nation will not be ready. Analog television broadcasts are scheduled to stop on Feb. 17 and, after that, only digital signals are to be available. Then millions of Americans who rely on analog TV sets and antennas must start using converter boxes that will allow them to receive digital signals, or see only a black screen.'b'In 2005, Congress devised  a program meant to ensure that this transition would be smooth. But with 40 days to go, it is now clear that we are heading for a train wreck \xe2\x80\x94 unless Congress delays the transition for a few months to allow more time to prepare.'b'People who subscribe to cable or satellite services or have a newer television with a digital tuner are not at risk of losing their programming. But as many as 19 million American households still rely solely on over-the-air analog television, and perhaps another 19 million use over-the-air in combination with cable or satellite. This  population is disproportionately made up of poorer households, the elderly and members of minority groups.'b'To ease the burden of buying a converter box, Congress appropriated $1.34 billion for 33.5 million $40 coupons that can be redeemed at stores where the boxes are sold. (Boxes cost $40 to $80.) People who want these coupons must apply for them from the Commerce Department\xe2\x80\x99s National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and then it takes about four to six weeks for them to arrive in the mail. After 90 days, the coupons expire and no one is allowed to request a second one.'b'Demand for the coupons has been much greater than expected. More than 46 million requests have come in. And there aren\xe2\x80\x99t enough coupons to go around. Starting this week, all new requests are being put on a waiting list. No additional coupons can be issued until those already issued expire.'b'Of course, it is already too late to apply for a coupon and receive it before Feb. 17.'b'And coupons or no coupons, there is a real danger that there will not be enough converter boxes on store shelves to meet demand. So far 18 million boxes have been purchased using coupons, and an estimated 11 million are in inventory. But total demand is estimated to be 33 million to 60 million units. So there could easily be a shortage of 4 million to 31 million.'b'The government is also unprepared to handle the volume of  calls from baffled television viewers once the switch to digital occurs. Nearly 1.5 million calls are expected to come into a special Federal Communications Commission call center on each of the two days following the transition, but this center will be able to handle only about 350,000 calls a day.'b'Moreover, many people will need help hooking up their converter boxes and setting up their antennas. (Picking up the digital signal may require reorienting or moving an antenna, or buying a more powerful digital antenna.) The government should train community groups to give assistance to those who need it.'b'By delaying the switch to digital by just a few months, and spending more money on the program \xe2\x80\x94 which the Obama transition team hinted on Thursday that it might favor \xe2\x80\x94 we could provide enough  coupons and establish a stronger call center. There would be time for manufacturers to put more converter boxes in the pipeline. And we\xe2\x80\x99d have enough time to work with community groups to provide technical assistance and support to the people who need it.'b'If the transition to digital TV goes badly, it will inconvenience millions. There is no reason to rush toward a fiasco when we can just as well take the time to make sure the change happens smoothly.'b'WASHINGTON'b'A  CASE sitting quietly in the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s in-basket promises to tell us more than almost any other about John G. Roberts Jr. and his evolution from spear carrier in the Reagan revolution to chief justice of the United States \xe2\x80\x94 and in the process set the direction of the debate over race and politics for years to come.'b'The question is whether Congress acted within its constitutional authority two years ago when it extended a central provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 for 25 years. An appeal challenging the act\xe2\x80\x99s reauthorized Section 5, a provision that requires certain states and localities to receive federal permission before making any change in election procedures, awaits the justices when they return today  from a holiday recess.'b'On the surface, this case appears an unlikely judicial bellwether. Extending the life of the \xe2\x80\x9cpreclearance\xe2\x80\x9d provision, considered one of the civil rights movement\xe2\x80\x99s crowning legislative accomplishments, is hardly novel. This was the fourth extension, in fact, and the second for a 25-year duration; the Supreme Court, which upheld the original Voting Rights Act in 1966, approved an earlier extension of Section 5 in 1980.'b'Nor does the issue appear fueled by the partisanship or ideological divisions that the current Supreme Court so often mirrors. The latest extension passed the Republican-controlled Congress overwhelmingly in 2006. President Bush promptly signed it into law, and a special panel of three federal judges 'b'upheld'b' it last May.'b'Given all that, what about this case makes it a potentially defining moment for Chief Justice Roberts?'b'To answer that question requires seeing the appeal, Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Mukasey, for the politically charged case it really is. The seeming unanimity that greeted the extension of Section 5 in 2006 was a facade, masking deep divisions over whether to continue requiring all or parts of 16 states, most in the South,  to receive Justice Department or federal court permission before moving a polling place or changing a registration deadline. Was a measure approved 40 years ago as a remedy for the suppression of minority votes still appropriate?'b'Many Republicans, most notably some Southern senators, thought not. But they allowed the extension to pass on the assumption that the Supreme Court would eventually answer the question, relieving them of the political cost of dismantling an iconic statute. Days after the extension became law, the anticipated legal challenge was filed by a well-connected Texas Republican lawyer representing what is surely one of the most obscure jurisdictions to be covered by Section 5, a sewer district that serves 3,500 residents of Travis County, Tex.'b'The Republicans understood recent trends at the court to be working in their favor, and they may be right. The case serves up to the court a fascinating brew of two of the most freighted issues in constitutional law, race and federalism \xe2\x80\x94 or, to put it another way, individual rights and constitutional structure.'b'The Roberts court has yet to come to rest on either, but this case will force it to do so: Voting Rights Act cases have a special provision that requires the Supreme Court to decide them. The court can\xe2\x80\x99t do what it does with 99 percent of the cases that reach it and simply deny review without comment. The chief justice will have to show his hand.'b'In cases dealing with race, he already has. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race,\xe2\x80\x9d he complained in a Texas redistricting case in 2006. The next year, he wrote an opinion rejecting a plan by which the school system in Louisville, Ky., sought to preserve the hard-won gains of integration by assigning students to schools based on race.'b'Because the Louisville schools had been released seven years earlier from decades of federal court supervision, the chief justice said the district no longer had the \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling interest\xe2\x80\x9d that justified any use of race to keep the schools integrated. It was a position so extreme that Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who is skeptical of all race-conscious government policies and agreed that the Louisville plan was unconstitutional, refused to sign the opinion.'b'The federalism issue at the core of the new case grows out of a series of cases from 1997 to 2003 in which the Rehnquist court applied a new level of scrutiny to Congressional action enforcing the guarantees of the Reconstruction amendments.'b'While previously Congress could do almost anything in the name of protecting individual rights, the new doctrine requires it to demonstrate a \xe2\x80\x9ccongruence and proportionality\xe2\x80\x9d between violation and remedy. The appeal now before the court 'b'argues'b' that the extension fails that test, given \xe2\x80\x9cthe utter absence of any present-day pattern of unconstitutional voting-rights deprivations of the type Section 5 was originally designed to address.\xe2\x80\x9d  The measure\xe2\x80\x99s defenders argue in response that because the law serves to deter just such violations, the Texas sewer district is trying to blame Section 5 for its own success.'b'The Roberts court has not resumed the Rehnquist court\xe2\x80\x99s federalism battles, and the chief justice\xe2\x80\x99s own views are unclear. But he does not come as a novice to the debate over the Voting Rights Act. As a young lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department, he wrote sharply worded memos on behalf of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s failed effort to block expansion of the act in 1982. Confronted with his paper trail during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing in 2005, he explained that he was simply expressing the administration\xe2\x80\x99s views.'b'Perhaps. But equally telling may be words written by his predecessor as chief justice. William H. Rehnquist, then an associate justice, dissented from a decision that upheld an earlier extension of Section 5. The law \xe2\x80\x9crequires state and local governments to cede far more of their powers to the federal government than the Civil War amendments ever envisioned,\xe2\x80\x9d Rehnquist 'b'wrote'b' in April 1980. Months later, the 25-year-old John Roberts arrived at his chambers as a law clerk. A 25-year relationship as mentor and prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 ended only with Rehnquist\xe2\x80\x99s death days before his former law clerk was named to succeed him.'b'The new case, in other words, arrives at the intersection of John Roberts\xe2\x80\x99s past and the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s future.'b'Last month, President Bush touted the results of a government-sponsored study by the University of Michigan called Monitoring the Future. It reported a broad decline in drug use among young people since 2001. This included a 24 percent drop in the overall use of illicit drugs. There was one exception he said: abuse of painkillers. But, one important metric that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t mentioned, and that stubbornly resisted the downturn, was the use of cocaine.'b'According to data from the group that produced the report, the percentage of both black and white 12th graders who confessed to using cocaine in the past 30 days has essentially stayed flat since 2001. The major difference is that white usage outweighs black usage 4 to 1. (If you take a longer view back to 1991, when cocaine usage bottomed out following the outrageous \xe2\x80\x9980s, usage among white 12th graders since then has nearly doubled, while usage among black 12th graders has fallen a bit.)'b'While we turned our attention to pills being swiped from parents\xe2\x80\x99 medicine cabinets, the number of  youngsters snorting white lines continued virtually unabated, producing a striking consequence.'b'According to the most recent data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, admissions of white teenagers to drug treatment centers for crack and cocaine abuse soared 76 percent from 2001 to 2006. Crack and cocaine was the only illicit drug category in which the number of admissions for white teens grew over this period, and in 2006 the number was at its highest level since these data have been kept. By contrast, admissions among black teens for crack and cocaine over the same period held steady. By 2006, white admissions outnumbered those for blacks by more than 10 to 1. (It should be noted that admissions for white youths abusing painkillers in 2006, while growing, was still less than half the number of admissions for those abusing cocaine that year.)'b'And there are ominous signs. According to the Monitoring the Future study, the risk of using crack and cocaine, as perceived by teenagers, is going down. The newly released 2009 National Drug Threat Assessment puts it this way: \xe2\x80\x9cThe decrease in perceived risk suggests that adolescents are becoming less wary of trying cocaine, which may sustain demand for the drug in the near future.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But, in a phone interview, David Murray, chief scientist in the White House\xe2\x80\x99s Office of National Drug Control Policy, insisted that there was good news: a sharp rise in the price of cocaine and a drop in its purity since 2006, among other things, have cut into overall usage.'b'So, I thought, until policy makers put more of a focus on this issue and figure out how to reach these students, should we just hope that teens are too broke for this weak coke? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. We need a real strategy, right now.'b'There has been some grousing in Washington (and a lot more across the river in Langley) about how Leon Panetta, President-elect Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s choice to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, is not an intelligence insider. As far as we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned, that\xe2\x80\x99s not Mr. Panetta\xe2\x80\x99s only qualification for the job, but it is certainly on the list.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen what some top company men have been willing to go along with during the Bush-Cheney years: secret prisons beyond the reach of American law and all conscience; torture, abuse and degradation of prisoners; renditions for torture on an outsource basis; made-for-the-Sunday-news-shows intelligence reports.'b'Mr. Obama has pledged to end all of that. On Friday, he declared that \xe2\x80\x9cunder my administration, the United States does not torture.\xe2\x80\x9d Earlier in the week, as he defended his choice of Mr. Panetta, he pointedly said his new team would ensure that he is told the truth rather than \xe2\x80\x9cwhat they think the president wants to hear.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For any intelligence professional committed to his craft, and the nation\xe2\x80\x99s security, that should be a relief. Instead, the reaction from at least some to the choice of Mr. Panetta \xe2\x80\x94 a longtime Washington player who has criticized President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s counterterrorism tactics \xe2\x80\x94 was, sadly, predictably defensive.'b'On Capitol Hill, the loudest complaints seemed driven by the failure of the usually smooth Obama team to consult Senator Dianne Feinstein, the new chairwoman of the intelligence committee. Ms. Feinstein has since been apologized to and changed her mind. But now that the Democrats have made the \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s not a professional\xe2\x80\x9d criticism fair game, it is likely to become cover for hard-liners whose real agenda is to continue the Bush policies.'b'The C.I.A. needs a director strong enough to demand a full accounting of the misdeeds of the last eight years. Such an accounting, which should be as public as possible, is the only way to ensure that abuses stop. The agency needs a director who can make clear that banning torture and other abusive practices \xe2\x80\x94 which simply don\xe2\x80\x99t work \xe2\x80\x94 are essential for keeping the nation safe and restoring its reputation.'b'Mr. Obama will have to do more than say that he has banned the torture and abuse of prisoners. He and his administration will have to locate and override all of the policy memos, directives and executive orders that have redefined and condoned such practices.'b'President Bush said he did not allow torture, and what we now know is that he had simply redefined torture to exclude anything he authorized, including waterboarding, prolonged isolation, threatening prisoners with dogs, the use of stress positions and forced nudity \xe2\x80\x94 all forms of degrading treatment that are outlawed by civilian law, military statutes and international treaties.'b'Congress, for its part, must repeal the law specifically exempting the intelligence agencies from the rules requiring humane treatment of prisoners.'b'To continue to do its essential work, the C.I.A. will also need a director with the president\xe2\x80\x99s complete support, who knows Congress and is prepared to staunchly defend the many honest and courageous professionals who have simmered and suffered for the last eight years.'b'Is Mr. Panetta the right man? His r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 suggests that he is smart, and smart in the ways of Washington.  Eight terms as a Democratic congressman. Head of the Office of Management and Budget. A strong-minded chief of staff in Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s famously chaotic White House. Member of the sensible Iraq Study Group.'b'In a column last year for The Monterey County Herald, Mr. Panetta wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cTorture is illegal, immoral, dangerous, and counterproductive. And yet, the president is using fear to trump the law.\xe2\x80\x9d He also rejected Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s illegal, warrantless eavesdropping on Americans.'b'We do not minimize the challenges Mr. Panetta will face if he is confirmed. He will have to master a bureaucracy where secrecy is truly the coin of the realm \xe2\x80\x94 all at a very dangerous time for this country. Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s decision to ask Stephen Kappes, the C.I.A.\xe2\x80\x99s second in command, to stay on should make that easier \xe2\x80\x94 although we have some misgivings since Mr. Kappes had direct oversight of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s secret prisons.'b'Mr. Panetta and Admiral Dennis Blair \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s pick to be director of national intelligence \xe2\x80\x94 will have to decide whether the post-9/11 reorganization makes sense or has just added another layer of bureaucracy. Mr. Panetta may not be an intelligence professional, but he is honest and sensible and not easily cowed. Those sound like good credentials for a very hard job.'b'People who care about the Everglades have had little to cheer about over the last eight years. An $11 billion federal-state plan signed by President Bill Clinton in 2000 to rescue this once vibrant ecosystem has made almost no progress, not least because Washington has failed to keep its part of what was supposed to be a 50-50 deal.'b'Even so, those attending this week\xe2\x80\x99s annual meeting in Miami of the Everglades Coalition \xe2\x80\x94 the group of activists and political leaders who have led the restoration fight for the last quarter-century \xe2\x80\x94 found two very good reasons for optimism. A Florida state agency has approved Gov. Charlie Crist\xe2\x80\x99s audacious plan to buy and retire from production 180,000 acres of sugar cane fields near Lake Okeechobee. The $1.34 billion deal would eliminate a major source of phosphorous pollution and provide room for huge reservoirs to store water that could later be released to the Everglades during the dry season \xe2\x80\x94 a critical point in any ecosystem\xe2\x80\x99s lifecycle.'b'The bigger reason for optimism \xe2\x80\x94 bigger than any single project or group of projects could ever be \xe2\x80\x94 is the change in leadership in Washington.  President-elect Barack Obama pledged to help the Everglades during his campaign, and his top adviser on environmental matters, Carol Browner, has long been a fierce advocate for the Everglades.'b'Ms. Browner grew up in Florida and \xe2\x80\x94 first as a state official, later as administrator of the federal Environmental Protection Agency \xe2\x80\x94 she fought the sugar barons and developers whose thirst for water and land has impoverished Florida\xe2\x80\x99s natural environment. She also has experience dealing with the notoriously dysfunctional Army Corps of Engineers, which is charged with reconstructing the spider web of canals and levees that impede freshwater flows into the Everglades.'b'Everglades restoration is a project that does not get done unless somebody powerful wants it done. Former Vice President Al Gore wanted it done, as did the former interior secretary, Bruce Babbitt. Mr. Bush and his team did not champion it. As a result, Congress has contributed only about $500 million to a project on which Florida, with far fewer resources, has contributed $2.5 billion.'b'Ms. Browner has a lot on her mind these days, but reviving this noble initiative should remain on her radar. It deserves Washington\xe2\x80\x99s full support.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s time to remind President Bush as he leaves office that his White House records are not his personal property. They belong to the nation. The Presidential Records Act made that the law of the land after the Watergate scandal. Showing disturbing forethought, Mr. Bush signed an executive order in his first year, effectively decreeing that a sitting or former president can withhold his papers indefinitely.'b'Congress is moving to strike down the Bush order. The House has overwhelmingly approved a corrective measure that has a good chance in the Senate. If there\xe2\x80\x99s any delay, we urge President-elect Barack Obama to issue his own executive order restoring the Presidential Records Act as soon as he enters the White House.'b'When Mr. Bush signed his order, the speculation was that he was hoping to spare the disclosure of some inner-sanctum embarrassments committed by his father\xe2\x80\x99s administration or perhaps Ronald Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s. Now, with so much of the latest Bush history needing to be plumbed from Baghdad to Wall Street, a robust public records law is ever more crucial for robust democracy.'b'The law already provides former presidents reasonable protection, letting them withhold sensitive records, including advice from aides, for up to 12 years. While the the Bush White House claimed that the order merely put an organized process in place, the result was to gut the presumption of public access.'b'Under the current rules, requests for records require the concurrence of a concerned former president or his descendants plus the current president. They have unlimited time to judge the issue. Beyond that, historians must resort to litigation. This is a pathetic way to cheat history. As the poet Robert Lowell wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cAll\xe2\x80\x99s misalliance. Yet why not say what happened?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Unless someone quickly rides to the rescue, millions of consumers will find that their television screens go black on Feb. 17. That is when broadcasters must switch entirely from analog signals to digital signals that make more efficient use of the broadcasting spectrum.'b'This may not sound like one of the more vital issues facing Congress and the incoming Obama administration. But television is a vital form of communication. And the people most likely to be cut off \xe2\x80\x94 because of government and industry miscalculations \xe2\x80\x94 are low-income, rural and elderly Americans who rely on TV for news, entertainment, educational programs and safety alerts.'b'Consumers who own digital TV sets or who get their television through cable, satellite or fiber-optic services won\xe2\x80\x99t be affected. The change will only disable analog sets that receive free TV broadcasts through a rooftop or indoor antenna. These viewers will find themselves in the dark unless they buy a special signal converter box.'b'The government was supposed to help consumers by issuing $40 coupons to help defray much of the cost of a converter, which typically cost $40 to $80. But the National Telecommunications and Information Administration announced this week that it had used up its allocated $1.34 billion for coupons and was now putting people on a wait list. There also seem to be shortages of converter boxes, technical support and education services.'b'Two former chairmen of the Federal Communications Commission, the Obama transition team and the Consumers Union are urging Congress to delay the switch and spend more money to smooth the transition. Ordinarily, we\xe2\x80\x99d be inclined to say that procrastinators have only themselves to blame. But miscalculations by government and industry have added to this problem.'b'Congress needs, at a minimum, to pump in more money to finance coupons and support services so that many more people can meet the deadline. If that won\xe2\x80\x99t suffice, Congress should postpone the deadline by a few months to allow more time for an easier transition.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cThe Afghan Quagmire\xe2\x80\x9d (column, Jan. 6):'b'Bob Herbert states that President-elect Barack Obama would need to articulate clearly the goals for any additional commitment of troops by the United States in Afghanistan.'b'Before doing so, Mr. Obama can learn much from the past.

The share of women with jobs has fallen almost two percentage points from the peak it reached in 2000. At no other point in the past 50 years has the share of employed women fallen so much from its peak.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is an emergency. There is one overriding mission for the incoming Obama administration when it comes to dealing with the economy, and that\xe2\x80\x99s putting Americans back to work. Forget the G.O.P.\xe2\x80\x99s mania for tax cuts. Forget, for the time being (but not forever), the ballooning budget deficits. Forget the feel-good but doomed-to-fail effort to play nice-nice with the rabid partisans of the right who were the ones most responsible for ruining the economy in the first place.'b'Put the people back to work!'b'To do that, Democrats will have to overcome their natural timidity. They will have to fend off the Republican opposition in Congress and set in motion an enormous surge of public spending aimed at creating jobs, jobs, jobs.'b'Each new surge of job losses is an additional violent assault on the already profoundly damaged economy. Idle workers do not pay taxes and that ratchets up budget deficits at the federal, state and local levels. They draw down unemployment benefits and further strain the Medicaid rolls. In many cases, they are forced to turn to food stamps for their families\xe2\x80\x99 daily bread. And, of course, they stop purchasing cars and homes, goods and services.'b'The economy will not be saved by putting a pitiful $500 into the hands of the average taxpayer. And it won\xe2\x80\x99t be saved by gift-wrapped concessions to the G.O.P. in the form of business tax cuts that the president-elect is said to be considering.'b'With credit tight, savings depleted, the stock market in the tank and home prices in a state of collapse, the only way to get real money into the hands of ordinary Americans (and thus back into the economy) is through employment. The way to truly stimulate the economy and save the jobs of anxiety-ridden workers who are still employed is to get the unemployed back to work as soon as possible.'b'And the way to create jobs is through infrastructure investments (building and repairing roads, bridges, tunnels and water and sewer systems); and by investing in 21st-century clean energy initiatives, in public transportation systems, and in school construction; and by providing access to health care for the millions who don\xe2\x80\x99t have it.'b'In other words, by investing in the people and the enormous productive capacity of the United States.'b'Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa was blunt this week after he and other Senate Democrats met with Obama aides to discuss the president-elect\xe2\x80\x99s stimulus package. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is only one thing we have got to do in the stimulus, and that is how can we create jobs,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Referring to Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s national economic adviser, Lawrence Summers, Mr. Harkin added: \xe2\x80\x9cI am a little concerned by the way that Mr. Summers and others are going at this in that, to me, it still looks like a little more of this trickle down. If we just put it in at the top, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to trickle down.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Been there. Done that. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t work.'b'The madness of trickle down and its corollaries ruined the economy and millions of Americans with it. President-elect Obama ran to the mantra of change. One hopes he is not too timid to deliver.'b'Notes from the Age of Obama:'b'Members of the 'b'still'b'-not-in-power administration traveled to the Capitol this week to allow Senate Democrats to complain about the upcoming stimulus package. The Obama-ites were extremely eager to listen. After all, senators have feelings, too.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThese folks are not potted plants,\xe2\x80\x9d said the senior adviser David Axelrod.'b'Already we have a big break with the past. The Bush White House so totally regarded senators as potted plants that it was a wonder that senior aides didn\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to water them. Democrats believed that Dick Cheney had a large chart in which legislators were identified by which type of household foliage they most resembled. (Harry Reid was a ficus.) But no more.'b'Barack Obama is going to change the tone of Washington politics. He promised. Of course George W. Bush promised that, too. But once his administration ran into resistance in Congress, the Era of Good Feeling was out the door and the potted-plant index was in. (John Kerry was a begonia.)'b'The endless transition period is giving us a little clearer picture of how the next president is going to govern. He is going to be civil, and if somebody forgets to tell the chairman of the intelligence committee who the next C.I.A. director is going to be, he will apologize. He does not want to let side issues get in the way of his big priorities, whether said issue is as large as the Gaza crisis (only one president at a time) or as small as Roland Burris, the successor to Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Senate seat who was chosen by the eminently impeachable governor of Illinois.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe have an economy on the ropes; we need to move forward,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick Durbin, the senior senator from Illinois when  \xe2\x80\x94  after some pressure from the White House  \xe2\x80\x94  he and Reid, the majority leader, reversed course and appeared ready to eventually welcome Burris into the fold.'b'We are rooting for Burris to make it into office, since any Roland who names his kids Roland II and Rolanda is bound to provide a welcome diversion in the gloomy months ahead. And if the Obama administration ever goes to the Dark Side, we have definitely got an early front-runner for their philodendron designation.'b'But in all deference to Durbin, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to put an end to people banning topics of conversation on the grounds that we are living in a time of financial peril. Last month, the artistic director of a Manhattan theater company suggested to The Times\xe2\x80\x99s Patrick Healy that it was inappropriate to ask him to discuss sudden changes in the \xe2\x80\x9cPal Joey\xe2\x80\x9d cast when \xe2\x80\x9cthe entire world economy is falling apart.\xe2\x80\x9d Next thing you know, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be barred from saying anything negative about the Super Bowl in deference to the unemployment rate.'b'We also really need to clarify the limits to proper political civility. Everyone agrees that even if Mitch McConnell does resemble a large, root-bound sansevieria trifasciata, the Democrats will keep it to themselves. But there\xe2\x80\x99s such a thing as getting carried away with bipartisanship.'b'Obama has made no secret that he wants whopping Republican support for his stimulus plan to send a message to the country that we are all on the same page when it comes to fixing the economy. That\xe2\x80\x99s apparently the impetus for all the business tax cuts that appeared in the mix this week. And at a Senate confirmation hearing, Tom Daschle, the secretary of health and human services nominee, assured Republicans that they were right in believing the administration wanted to craft a health care policy that was not \xe2\x80\x9ca 51-vote solution, but rather a 70-, 80-  or a 90-vote solution.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There are some things on which parties can work together very nicely. For instance, it was very clear from the committee hearing that nobody in the Senate supports childhood obesity and that Daschle, a popular former majority leader, would be confirmed even if he had showed up to testify in the nude. Maybe, if everybody in the House tries very hard to get along, the chamber will not find it impossible to reach accord on a resolution commemorating Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Day, as happened last year.'b'But there are some things about which the two parties are supposed to disagree. During the presidential campaign, Obama talked constantly about creating a national health insurance program while John McCain said the government should just give people tax breaks for buying their own policies. Obama won, and the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 job now is to figure out how to make sure the current economic crisis is solved in a way that allows him to deliver on his promise to do something big and ambitious about health care \xe2\x80\x94  and his other signature issue, energy/global warming. The Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 job is to try to limit the big spending to tax cuts and short-term building projects. If the final bill passes by 80 or 90 votes, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably going to be because it\xe2\x80\x99s a watered-down mess.'b'Which is the sort of thing that nobody wants. Unless they live in a pot.'b'London'b'THE crystal and ceramics company Waterford Wedgwood, whose roots go back 250 years, has been placed in administration, or what is called bankruptcy protection in the United States. While high manufacturing costs, declining demand for luxury goods and a weak dollar may have precipitated matters, this is not a credit-crunch story \xe2\x80\x94 it is a history lesson.'b'The company is in trouble because it has long forgotten the lessons of one of its founders: Josiah Wedgwood, among the greatest and most innovative retailers the world has ever seen. If the modern operators of Wedgwood, which was merged with Waterford Glass in 1986, had shown a tenth of Josiah\xe2\x80\x99s intuitive grasp, his flair, his zest for selling, it would not now be dying.'b'Today when most people think of Wedgwood, they think of bridal registries and those dusty-looking blue-and-white jasperware plates that no one knows what to do with. But things were once very different.'b'Josiah was an unlikely hero. He was the 13th child of an impoverished potter; a childhood case of smallpox left Josiah with a bad leg that was later amputated, making it impossible for him to turn a potter\xe2\x80\x99s wheel. But if he could not physically throw a pot, he could \xe2\x80\x94 and did \xe2\x80\x94 find new ways to get goods to market. He threw himself into various schemes to improve roads and canals. And, more fundamentally, he developed new ways of selling. Most, if not all, of the common techniques in 20th-century sales \xe2\x80\x94 direct mail, money-back guarantees, traveling salesmen, self-service, free delivery, buy one get one free, illustrated catalogues \xe2\x80\x94 came from Josiah Wedgwood.'b'First, of course, came the product. In 1759, Josiah set up a small company in Stoke-on-Trent, in west-central England, to produce earthenware, a cheap, everyday material that was dull, porous and broke easily. But by the 1760s, he made a technical breakthrough and produced \xe2\x80\x9ccreamware,\xe2\x80\x9d a rich, creamy-looking glazed pottery that looked like porcelain but was able to withstand temperature changes. Soon Josiah had even worked out how to print designs on it \xe2\x80\x94 all this, at a relatively inexpensive price.'b'Its worth was quickly recognized: in 1765, Queen Charlotte, the wife of George III, ordered a creamware tea set. For most people, that would be the pinnacle; for Josiah, it was the start. He now called himself \xe2\x80\x9cPotter to Her Majesty\xe2\x80\x9d and renamed creamware \xe2\x80\x9cQueen\xe2\x80\x99s Ware.\xe2\x80\x9d In a letter to his business partner, he marveled at \xe2\x80\x9chow rapidly the use of it has spread\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chow universally it is liked,\xe2\x80\x9d and tried to balance how much this had to do with its royal \xe2\x80\x9cintroduction\xe2\x80\x9d versus \xe2\x80\x9cits utility and beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That is the true Wedgwood. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t pleasure at past achievement, but instead determination to understand 'b'why'b' success had come about, so he could build on it. Selling was an intellectual pleasure, an art form.'b'No fad was too small. In 1772, when women started bleaching their hands with arsenic to make their skin a fashionable porcelain tone, Wedgwood immediately advertised black teapots: against this background, hands looked even whiter. No cause was too great, either: the company produced emancipation medallions asking, \xe2\x80\x9cAm I not a man and a brother?\xe2\x80\x9d that were worn as buttons and bracelets.'b'Until Wedgwood came along, most companies had seen royal commissions as nothing but grief: they were one-offs and, therefore, profits were negligible. When Catherine the Great ordered a 925-piece dinner service in 1773, Wedgwood made perhaps \xc2\xa3200 on an outlay of nearly \xc2\xa33,000. But as a marketing tool, the set was beyond price. Each piece had an image of a stately home, and before the order was dispatched, Josiah exhibited it in his showroom so that visitors could see whose houses were immortalized. Naturally, duplicate pieces were available for purchase.'b'Today, in the Waterford Wedgwood showroom here on Piccadilly the various lines of china are piled up bargain-basement style. While the product is still good, the marketing is dreadful. The company has been both profligate and miserly \xe2\x80\x94 it has hired hot designers,  but then has scrimped by not spending money to change the molds; as a result, contemporary design is crudely imposed on 100-year-old shapes. Indeed, the company has returned to Josiah\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdiffusion\xe2\x80\x9d principle \xe2\x80\x94 offering cheaper lines for different segments of the population \xe2\x80\x94 but has failed to advertise this fact.'b'As the news of the company\xe2\x80\x99s travails broke this week, it was clear from Web chatter that most people think Wedgwood is a \xe2\x80\x9cluxury\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional\xe2\x80\x9d brand, with no inexpensive lines or innovative designers. Neither is true, but perception, as Josiah knew, is the ultimate truth. Twenty-first century Wedgwood has been more old-fashioned than 18th-century Wedgwood, and that has been its undoing.'b'Dublin'b'Once upon a couple of weeks ago ...'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m in a crush in a Dublin pub around New Year\xe2\x80\x99s. Glasses clinking clicking, clashing crashing in Gaelic revelry: swinging doors, sweethearts falling in and out of the season\xe2\x80\x99s blessings, family feuds subsumed or resumed. Malt joy and ginger despair are all in the queue to be served on this, the quarter-of-a-millennium mark since Arthur Guinness first put velvety blackness in a pint glass.'b'Interesting mood. The new Irish money has been gambled and lost; the Celtic Tiger\xe2\x80\x99s tail is between its legs as builders and bankers laugh uneasy and hard at the last year, and swallow uneasy and hard at the new. There\xe2\x80\x99s a voice on the speakers that wakes everyone out of the moment: it\xe2\x80\x99s Frank Sinatra singing \xe2\x80\x9cMy Way.\xe2\x80\x9d His ode to defiance is four decades old this year and everyone sings along for a lifetime of reasons. I am struck by the one quality his voice lacks: Sentimentality.'b'Is this knotted fist of a voice a clue to the next year? In the mist of uncertainty in your business life, your love life, your 'b'life'b' life, why is Sinatra\xe2\x80\x99s voice such a foghorn \xe2\x80\x94 such confidence in nervous times allowing you romance but knocking your rose-tinted glasses off your nose, if you get too carried away.'b'A call to believability.'b'A voice that says, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t lie to me now.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That says, \xe2\x80\x9cBaby, if there\xe2\x80\x99s someone else, tell me now.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Fabulous, not fabulist. Honesty to hang your hat on.'b'As the year rolls over (and with it many carousers), the emotion in the room tussles between hope and fear, expectation and trepidation. Wherever you end up, his voice takes you by the hand.'b'Now I\xe2\x80\x99m back in my own house in Dublin, uncorking some nice wine, ready for the vinegar it can turn to when families and friends overindulge, as I am about to. Right by the hole-in-the-wall cellar, I look up to see a vision in yellow: a painting Frank sent to me after I sang \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve Got You Under My Skin\xe2\x80\x9d with him on the 1993 \xe2\x80\x9cDuets\xe2\x80\x9d album. One from his own hand. A mad yellow canvas of violent concentric circles gyrating across a desert plain. Francis Albert Sinatra, painter, modernista.'b'We had spent some time in his house in Palm Springs, which was a thrill \xe2\x80\x94 looking out onto the desert and hills, no gingham for miles. Plenty of miles, though, Miles Davis. And plenty of talk of jazz. That\xe2\x80\x99s when he showed me the painting. I was thinking the circles were like the diameter of a horn, the bell of a trumpet, so I said so.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe painting is called \xe2\x80\x98Jazz\xe2\x80\x99 and you can have it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I said I had heard he was one of Miles Davis\xe2\x80\x99s biggest influences.'b'Little pithy replies:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t usually hang with men who wear earrings.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMiles Davis never wasted a note, kid \xe2\x80\x94 or a word on a fool.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cJazz is about the moment you\xe2\x80\x99re in. Being modern\xe2\x80\x99s not about the future, it\xe2\x80\x99s about the present.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I think about this now, in this new year. The Big Bang of pop music telling me it\xe2\x80\x99s all about the moment, a fresh canvas and never overworking the paint. I wonder what he would have thought of the time it\xe2\x80\x99s taken me and my bandmates to finish albums, he with his famous impatience for directors, producers \xe2\x80\x94 anyone, really \xe2\x80\x94 fussing about. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99s right. Fully inhabiting the moment during that tiny dot of time after you\xe2\x80\x99ve pressed \xe2\x80\x9crecord\xe2\x80\x9d is what makes it eternal. 'b'If'b', like Frank, you sing it like you\xe2\x80\x99ll never sing it again.

As a communicator, hitting the notes is only part of the story, of course.'b'Singers, more than other musicians, depend on what they know \xe2\x80\x94 as opposed to what they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know about the world. While there is a danger in this \xe2\x80\x94 the loss of na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9, for instance, which holds its own certain power \xe2\x80\x94 interpretive skills generally gain in the course of a life well abused.'b'Want an example? Here\xe2\x80\x99s an example. Take two of the versions of Sinatra singing \xe2\x80\x9cMy Way.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The first was recorded in 1969 when the Chairman of the Board said to Paul Anka, who wrote the song for him: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m quitting the business. I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of it. I\xe2\x80\x99m getting the hell out.\xe2\x80\x9d In this reading, the song is a boast \xe2\x80\x94 more kiss-off than send-off \xe2\x80\x94 embodying all the machismo a man can muster about the mistakes he\xe2\x80\x99s made on the way from here to everywhere.'b'In the later recording, Frank is 78. The Don Costa arrangement is the same, the words and melody are exactly the same, but this time the song has become a heart-stopping, heartbreaking song of defeat. The singer\xe2\x80\x99s hubris is out the door. ('b'This'b' singer, i.e. me, is in a puddle.) The song has become an apology.'b'To what end? Duality, complexity. I was lucky to duet with a man who understood duality, who had the talent to hear two opposing ideas in a single song, and the wisdom to know which side to reveal at which moment.'b'This is our moment. What do we hear?'b'In the pub, on the occasion of this new year, as the room rises in a deafening chorus \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cI did it my way\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 I and this full house of Irish rabble-rousers hear in this staple of the American songbook both sides of the singer and the song, hubris and humility, blue eyes and red.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cA Pitch for Mass Transit\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 5):'b'The current combination of economic and political forces leaves an opening for creative solutions that address several pressing needs.

And we cannot authorize indecency without jeopardizing our survival as a decent society.'b'President-elect Barack Obama understands this, as did Senator John McCain, and we can expect that the practice will stop (if it has not already) in the incoming administration, for the election was a definitive repudiation of the Bush administration and its principal characters.

It is only an exaggeration to see the urge to criminalize our soon-to-be-former leaders, to make into courtroom drama the tragedy of the last eight years, as an extension of this same practice.'b'Of course ours would not be Stalin-type show trials, but they would have a kind of absurdity distinctive to our own over-lawyered culture. Consider what criminal prosecutions would really look like. First, we would have the investigations, the subpoenas, the depositions and grand juries, much of this directed at tripping up the targets, so that they can more handily be prosecuted for the ancillary offenses of making false statements, perjury or obstruction of justice.'b'Then, we would have the trials themselves \xe2\x80\x94 protracted, interspersed with motions and delays, obsessively followed by cable channels filling in the many dull spots with endless commentary from teams of so-called experts, the whole spectacle stupefying rather than edifying the public and doing little to enhance respect for the law. A feast for lawyers and legal junkies, criminal prosecutions would be an embarrassment and distraction for the rest of the society that wants to get on with solving the great problems of the present and the future.'b'But should the high and mighty get off when ordinary people committing the same crimes would go to prison?  The answer is that they are not the same crimes. Administration officials were not thieves lining their own pockets. Theirs were political crimes committed by persons  whose jobs were to exercise the powers of government on our behalf. And the same is even truer of the lower-level officers who followed their orders.'b'And what about Nuremberg and the trial of the Japanese war criminals? Were those a mistake, too? Not at all. Those were crimes against whole populations in wars of aggression. An analogous point holds for the criminal leaders of Rwanda, Serbia and Sudan.'b'If you cannot see the difference between Hitler and Dick Cheney, between Stalin and Donald Rumsfeld, between Mao and Alberto Gonzales, there may be no point in our talking. It is not just a difference of scale, but our leaders were defending their country and people \xe2\x80\x94 albeit with an insufficient sense of moral restraint \xe2\x80\x94 against a terrifying threat by ruthless attackers with no sense of moral restraint at all.'b'Our veneration of the rule of law makes us believe that courts and procedures and judges can put right every wrong. But we must remember: our leaders, ultimately, were chosen by us; their actions were often ratified by our representatives; we chose them again in 2004. Their repudiation this Nov. 4 and the public, historical memory of them is the aptest response to what they did.'b'THREE days after 'b'the world learned'b' that $50 billion may have disappeared in Bernie Madoff\xe2\x80\x99s Ponzi scheme, The Times led its front page of Dec. 14 with the revelation of another $50 billion rip-off. This time the vanished loot belonged to American taxpayers. That was 'b'our collective contribution'b' to the $117 billion spent (as of mid-2008) on Iraq reconstruction  \xe2\x80\x94  a sinkhole of corruption, cronyism, incompetence and outright theft that epitomized Bush management at home and abroad.'b'The source for this news was a near-final draft of an as-yet-unpublished 513-page federal history of this nation-building fiasco. The document was assembled by the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction  \xe2\x80\x94  led by a Bush appointee, no less. It pinpoints, among other transgressions, a governmental Ponzi scheme concocted to bamboozle Americans into believing they were accruing steady dividends on their investment in a \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d Iraq.'b'The report quotes no less an authority than Colin Powell on how the scam worked. Back in 2003, Powell said, the Defense Department just \xe2\x80\x9ckept inventing numbers of Iraqi security forces  \xe2\x80\x94  the number would jump 20,000 a week! \xe2\x80\x98We now have 80,000, we now have 100,000, we now have 120,000.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Those of us who questioned these astonishing numbers were dismissed as fools, much like those who begged in vain to get the Securities and Exchange Commission to challenge Madoff\xe2\x80\x99s math.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s most remarkable about the Times article, however, is how little stir it caused. When, in 1971, The Times  got its hands on the 'b'Pentagon Papers'b', the internal federal history of the Vietnam disaster, the revelations caused a national uproar. But after eight years of battering by Bush, the nation has been rendered half-catatonic. The Iraq Pentagon Papers sank with barely a trace.'b'After all, next to big-ticket administration horrors like Abu Ghraib, Guant\xc3\xa1namo and the politicized hiring and firing at Alberto Gonzales\xe2\x80\x99s Justice Department, the wreckage of Iraq reconstruction is what Ralph Kramden of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Honeymooners\xe2\x80\x9d would 'b'dismiss'b' as \xe2\x80\x9ca mere bag of shells.\xe2\x80\x9d The $50 billion also pales next to other sums that remain unaccounted for in the Bush era, from the $345 billion in lost tax revenue due to unpoliced 'b'offshore corporate tax havens'b' to the 'b'far-from-transparent'b' disposition of some $350 billion in Wall Street bailout money. In the old Pat Moynihan phrase, the Bush years have \xe2\x80\x9cdefined deviancy down\xe2\x80\x9d in terms of how low a standard of ethical behavior we now tolerate as the norm from public officials.'b'Not even a good old-fashioned sex scandal could get our outrage going again. Indeed, a juicy one 'b'erupted last year'b' in the Interior Department, where the inspector general found that officials \xe2\x80\x9chad used cocaine and marijuana, and had sexual relationships with oil and gas company representatives.\xe2\x80\x9d Two officials tasked with marketing oil on behalf of American taxpayers got so blotto at a daytime golf event sponsored by Shell that they became too incapacitated to drive and had to be put up by the oil company.'b'Back in the day, an oil-fueled scandal in that one department alone could mesmerize a nation and earn Warren Harding a permanent ranking among our all-time worst presidents. But while the scandals at Bush\xe2\x80\x99s Interior resemble Teapot Dome  \xe2\x80\x94  and also encompass 'b'millions of dollars'b' in lost federal oil and gas royalties  \xe2\x80\x94  they barely registered beyond the Beltway. Even late-night comics yawned when The Washington Post administered a coup de gr\xc3\xa2ce last week, 'b'reporting'b' that Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne spent $235,000 from taxpayers to redo his office bathroom (monogrammed towels included).'b'It took 110 pages for the Center for Public Integrity, a nonpartisan research organization, to compile the CliffsNotes inventory of the Bush wreckage last month. 'b'It found'b' \xe2\x80\x9c125 systematic failures across the breadth of the federal government.\xe2\x80\x9d That accounting is conservative. There are still too many unanswered questions.'b'Just a short list is staggering. Who put that bogus \xe2\x80\x9c'b'uranium from Africa'b'\xe2\x80\x9d into the crucial prewar State of the Union address after the C.I.A. removed it from previous Bush speeches? How high up were the authorities who ordered and condoned torture and then let the \xe2\x80\x9crotten apples\xe2\x80\x9d at the bottom of the military heap take the fall? Who orchestrated the Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s elaborate P.R. efforts to 'b'cover up'b' Pat Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s death by \xe2\x80\x9cfriendly fire\xe2\x80\x9d in Afghanistan?'b'And, for extra credit, whatever 'b'did'b' happen to Bush\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'records from the Texas Air National Guard'b'?'b'The biggest question hovering over all this history, however, concerns the future more than the past. If we get bogged down in adjudicating every Bush White House wrong, how will we have the energy, time or focus to deal with the all-hands-on-deck crises that this administration\xe2\x80\x99s malfeasance and ineptitude have bequeathed us? The president-elect himself struck this note last spring. \xe2\x80\x9cIf crimes have been committed, they should be investigated,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'Barack Obama said'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cI would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of Republicans as a partisan witch hunt, because I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve got too many problems we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to solve.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Henry Waxman, the California congressman who has been our most tireless inquisitor into Bush scandals, essentially agreed when I spoke to him last week. Though he remains outraged about both the chicanery used to sell the Iraq war and the administration\xe2\x80\x99s overall abuse of power, he adds: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see Congress pursuing it. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to move on to other issues.\xe2\x80\x9d He would rather see any prosecutions augmented by an independent investigation that fills in the historical record. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to depoliticize it,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIf a Democratic Congress or administration pursues it, it will be seen as partisan.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We could certainly do worse than another 9/11 Commission. Among those Americans still enraged about the Bush years, there are also calls for 'b'truth and reconciliation commissions'b', 'b'war crimes trials'b' and, in a petition movement on Obama\xe2\x80\x99s transition Web site, 'b'a special prosecutor'b' in the Patrick Fitzgerald mode. One of the sharpest appointments yet made by the incoming president may support decisive action: Dawn Johnsen, 'b'a law professor and former Clinton administration official'b' who last week was 'b'chosen'b' to run the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of Justice.'b'This is the same office where the Bush apparatchik John Yoo produced his infamous memos justifying torture. Johnsen is  a fierce critic of such constitutional abuses. In articles for Slate last year, she 'b'wondered'b' \xe2\x80\x9cwhere is the outrage, the public outcry\xe2\x80\x9d over a government that has acted lawlessly and that \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not respect the legal and moral bounds of human decency.\xe2\x80\x9d She 'b'asked'b', \xe2\x80\x9cHow do we save our country\xe2\x80\x99s honor, and our own?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The last is not a rhetorical question. While our new president indeed must move on and address the urgent crises that cannot wait, Bush administration malfeasance can\xe2\x80\x99t be merely forgotten or finessed. A new Justice Department must enforce the law; Congress must press  outstanding subpoenas to smoke out potential criminal activity; every legal effort must be made to stop what seems like a wholesale effort by the outgoing White House to 'b'withhold'b', 'b'hide'b' and 'b'possibly destroy'b' huge chunks of its electronic and paper trail. As Johnsen wrote last March, we must also \xe2\x80\x9cresist Bush administration efforts to hide evidence of its wrongdoing through demands for retroactive immunity, assertions of state privilege, and implausible claims that openness will empower terrorists.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As if to anticipate the current debate, she added that \xe2\x80\x9cwe must avoid any temptation simply to move on,\xe2\x80\x9d because the national honor cannot be restored \xe2\x80\x9cwithout full disclosure.\xe2\x80\x9d She was talking about America regaining its international reputation in the aftermath of our government\xe2\x80\x99s descent into the dark side of torture and \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary rendition.\xe2\x80\x9d But I would add that we need full disclosure of the more prosaic governmental corruption of the Bush years, too, for pragmatic domestic reasons. To make the policy decisions ahead of us in the economic meltdown, we must know what went wrong along the way in the executive and legislative branches alike.'b'As the financial historian Ron Chernow 'b'wrote in the Times last week'b', we could desperately use a Ferdinand Pecora, the investigator who illuminated the history of the 1929 meltdown in Senate hearings on the eve of the New Deal. The terrain to be mined would include not just the usual Wall Street suspects and their Congressional and regulatory enablers but also the Department of Housing and Urban Development, a strangely neglected ground zero in the foreclosure meltdown. The department\xe2\x80\x99s secretary, Alphonso Jackson, 'b'resigned in March amid still-unresolved investigations'b' over whether he enriched himself and friends with government contracts.'b'The tentative and amorphous $800 billion stimulus 'b'proposed by Obama last week'b' sounds like a lot, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a drop in the bucket when set against the damage it must help counteract: more than $10 trillion in new debt and new obligations piled up by the Bush administration in  eight years, as 'b'calculated by the economists Linda J. Bilmes and Joseph E. Stiglitz'b' in the current Harper\xe2\x80\x99s Magazine.'b'If Bernie Madoff, at least, can still revive what remains of our deadened capacity for outrage, so can those who pulled off Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Ponzi schemes. The more we learn about where all the bodies and billions were buried on our path to ruin, the easier it may be for our new president to make the case for a bold, whatever-it-takes New Deal.'b''b'Since November, Opinion has been publishing a series of articles on the challenges facing Barack Obama when he takes office. In the latest part of the series, contributors focus on how the incoming administration should deal with the legal legacy of the war on terrorism.'b''b''b''b''b''b'Charlottesville, Va.'b'INSTEAD of looking closely at what high-level officeholders in the Bush administration have done over the past eight years, and recognizing what we have tacitly permitted, we would rather turn our faces forward toward a better future, promising that 2009 and the inauguration of Barack Obama will mean ringing out Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay and ringing in due process; it will bring the end of waterboarding and the reinstatement of the Geneva Conventions.'b'Indeed, the almost universal response to the recent bipartisan report issued by the Senate Armed Services Committee \xe2\x80\x94 finding former Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld and other high-ranking officials directly responsible for detainee abuse that clearly rose to the level of torture \xe2\x80\x94 has been a collective agreement that no one need be punished so long as we solemnly vow that such atrocities never happen again.'b'This hope that the election represents some kind of legal self-cleansing, a constitutional \xe2\x80\x9crebooting\xe2\x80\x9d of the rule of law, is of course not the language of the law. It is the language of recovery, of religion, of political pragmatism.'b'Those who say that there should be no investigation or prosecution of senior officials who authorized torture and warrant-less surveillance rarely even bother offering legal justifications. They argue that the Obama administration has more urgent problems to contend with. They insist that any such process would devolve into partisan backbiting from which this country could never recover. And they insist, as did Attorney General Michael Mukasey in early December, that there is no basis on which to prosecute the architects of torture and wiretapping policies because each was acting to \xe2\x80\x9cprotect the security in the country and in the belief that he or she was doing something lawful.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Others \xe2\x80\x94 including unnamed officials on the Obama transition team \xe2\x80\x94 have already claimed that there is simply no political will for criminal prosecutions, or even a truth commission.'b'Of course all this is not the language of the law either. It is the language of self-fulfilling prophecy. With each successive recitation that there is no political will, the political will dissipates. With each repetition of the mantra that Americans just want to turn the page on the past eight years, Americans feel ever better about turning the page.'b'And why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we? We aren\xe2\x80\x99t merely forgiving Mr. Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney (who admitted in December to approving torture techniques) and others for their actions. We are also forgiving ourselves. We are telling ourselves that what happened at Abu Ghraib is behind us, and that what happened at C.I.A. black sites is over. We are telling ourselves that bad people did bad things under bad circumstances, but that it\xe2\x80\x99s better to forgive and forget, that we are really truly sorry and it won\xe2\x80\x99t happen again. We sound like a nation of drunks after a bender. We are full of good intentions, but unwilling to hold ourselves to account.'b'Nobody is looking for a series of public floggings. The blueprints for government accountability look nothing like witch hunts. They look like legal processes that have served us for centuries. And, as the Armed Services Committee report makes clear, we already know an enormous amount about what happened to take us down the road to torture and eavesdropping. The military has commissioned at least three investigative reports about the descent into abusive interrogation. Michael Ratner, the president of the Center for Constitutional Rights, has compiled what he believes to be sufficient evidence to try senior Bush administration officials for war crimes. More previously secret memos from the Office of Legal Counsel were released just last week.'b'Nevertheless, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the first step will be a thorough determination of what has occurred. To that end, this week the House Judiciary Committee chairman, John Conyers Jr., introduced legislation for a panel to investigate the \xe2\x80\x9cbroad range\xe2\x80\x9d of policies pursued by the Bush administration. Such a commission would not constitute a criminal investigation, but it would not preclude one either.'b'Some commentators have suggested that any such truth commission should promise immunity or a pardon in exchange for truthful testimony, but I believe that if it becomes clear that laws were broken, or that war crimes were committed, a special prosecutor should be appointed to investigate further. The Bush administration made its worst errors in judgment when it determined that the laws simply don\xe2\x80\x99t apply to certain people. If we declare presumptively that there can be no justice for high-level government officials who acted illegally then we exhibit the same contempt for the rule of law.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not a witch hunt simply because political actors are under investigation. The process of investigating and prosecuting crimes makes up the bricks and mortar of our prosecutorial system. We don\xe2\x80\x99t immunize drug dealers, pickpockets or car thieves because holding them to account is uncomfortable, difficult or divisive. We don\xe2\x80\x99t protest that \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s all behind us now\xe2\x80\x9d when a bank robber is brought to trial.'b'And America tends to survive the ugliness of public reckonings, from Nixon to Whitewater to the impeachment hearings, because for all our cheerful optimism, Americans fundamentally understand that nobody should be above the law. As the chief prosecutor for the United States at the Nuremberg trials, Robert Jackson, warned: \xe2\x80\x9cLaw shall not stop with the punishment of petty crimes by little people. It must also reach men who possess themselves of great power.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'New Haven'b'IN the past eight years, our government has tortured people and spied on its own citizens. Administration lawyers created a series of secret laws to justify these activities. The Justice Department has been riddled with scandals alleging corruption, illegality and incompetence. What should the next administration do about these practices? Do we punish wrongdoing or discover the truth?'b'We should opt for the truth, for three reasons. First, we must restore America\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to human rights by exposing and condemning our own abuses. Second, we must counteract the tendency toward secret laws that facilitate these violations. Third, we must create a public record of government misconduct as a lesson to future generations and a caution to future administrations.'b'Criminal prosecutions might serve these functions, but they face enormous obstacles. The administration repeatedly, systematically twisted the law to immunize its criminal conduct, and much of what was done was authorized by executive branch lawyers, particularly in the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Legal Counsel. However mistaken this advice, relying on it provides government officials a strong defense. Moreover, at the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s urging, Congress has given potential defendants legal immunity through the Military Commissions Act of 2006 and other statutes. (And, for now, President Bush still retains the pardon power.)'b'Of course, criminal prosecutions make sense where lawbreaking was not immunized or approved by Congress or the Justice Department, but in the most serious cases \xe2\x80\x94 torture and surveillance \xe2\x80\x94 prosecutions may be least effective.'b'Seeking the truth is the better option. One model is South Africa\xe2\x80\x99s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, led by Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The South African experience, however, is very different from ours. The apartheid regime had directed violence  at its own people; its opponents sometimes used violence in return. The new South African government sought not only to preserve a historical record but also to reconcile and rehabilitate former enemies and unite the country\xe2\x80\x99s diverse populations.'b'In the United States, torture and inhumane treatment was largely directed at non-citizens, many held outside the country, at Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay or in secret locations. We are not trying to coax former adversaries together to build a new nation; rather, we need to renew our commitment to human rights and the rule of law and prevent future abuses. Our aim is not truth and reconciliation; it is truth and repudiation.'b'Instead of the South African model, we should use a two-pronged approach.'b'First, a central cause of human rights violations was the proliferation of secret laws that immunized government conduct, avoided accountability and corroded the foundations of our democracy. The incoming administration should begin by releasing the Justice Department and Office of Legal Counsel memos that justified the surveillance, detention and interrogation practices at issue, and require appropriate and regular disclosure of future opinions.'b'Our new president must also reform the Justice Department, which has lost its ability to give independent legal advice. The Bush administration regularly shut out lawyers it believed would tell the White House what it did not want to hear and short-circuited consultative procedures intended  to produce both wise and lawful policies.'b'Second, both the new administration and Congress should create  presidential commissions and Congressional oversight hearings on various subjects: detention and interrogation practices, extraordinary rendition, reform of military commissions and reform of surveillance practices. These different commissions have different objects and functions; a single truth commission could not begin to address them all.'b'Congress and the president should divide up subjects efficiently to prevent conflicting jurisdictions and turf battles. And both branches should signal the importance of these hearings to the  public, giving them the gravity and attention they deserve.'b'The South African model offered witnesses potential amnesty (which was not always given) to coax testimony (which did not always occur). American commissions and hearings should have the power to bestow immunity to compel testimony, either \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d immunity (the testimony cannot be used in any future prosecution) or \xe2\x80\x9ctransactional\xe2\x80\x9d immunity (no prosecution for acts connected to the subject of the testimony). Sensitive evidence that affects national security could be taken in closed proceedings and summarized or published in redacted form.'b'The goal of these specialized commissions and hearings will not be merely retrospective. They will also be prospective, aimed at specific government reforms. The next administration will still have to detain and try people, and it will still have to gather intelligence. The Military Commissions Act of 2006, which set up rules for terrorism trials, requires a significant overhaul, and Congress should hold hearings on how the incoming president plans to use the vast surveillance powers given him by  the FISA Amendments Act of 2008.'b'Above all, the new president and Congress must work together. If Barack Obama does not cooperate with Congress and help make present and former officials available for testimony, these hearings will not succeed. Once out of office, President Bush will likely invoke executive privilege to prevent members of his administration from testifying, but that privilege is not absolute; it should also depend on the current president\xe2\x80\x99s determination of the national interest. Mr. Obama must use the powers of his office to uncover past wrongdoing and to make sure that past misdeeds do not occur again.'b'We do not need a one-size-fits-all truth commission. But we do need the truth. Our democracy depends on it.'b'In what his aides billed as a major economic speech on Thursday, President-elect Barack Obama said that 2009 would \xe2\x80\x9cmark a clean break from a troubled past and set a new course for our nation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The \xe2\x80\x9cclean break\xe2\x80\x9d part of the statement seems an apt description for the spending part of Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s emerging, roughly $800 billion recovery package. He has outlined some $500 billion for bolstered unemployment benefits, aid to states and investment in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s crumbling and outdated infrastructure.'b'But the tax-cut components of the package are hardly a clean break with the Bush years, presuming that is what Mr. Obama meant by the troubled past. To win the support of Republican lawmakers, the package is shaping up to include roughly $150 billion in business tax breaks, even though such breaks are widely recognized as packing very little bang for the buck when it comes to economic stimulus.'b'And to make good on one of his own (misguided) campaign promises, Mr. Obama is proposing to provide tax cuts to people who make up to $200,000 a year.'b'The proposed tax break \xe2\x80\x94 up to $500 for individuals and $1,000 for families \xe2\x80\x94 makes good sense for low- and middle-income Americans, because the money is likely to be spent quickly, thus boosting demand in a contracting economy. But higher up the income ladder \xe2\x80\x94 a couple making $200,000 a year is in the top 9 percent of households \xe2\x80\x94 tax cuts are likelier to be saved than spent, providing relatively little stimulus.'b'The Obama team clearly views the tax giveaways as good politics, helping to win support for the overall package. But the severity of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal and economic situation should make it think twice.'b'The day before Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s speech, the Congressional Budget Office projected a 2009 deficit of $1.2 trillion, nearly a threefold increase from 2008. The federal budget \xe2\x80\x94 already deep in deficit after years of tax cutting while waging two wars \xe2\x80\x94 is being pushed further into the red by a recession that is now more than a year old and has no end in sight.'b'Concern over swelling deficits should not stop Congress from taking steps to revive the economy. But rising deficits \xe2\x80\x94 coupled with long-term budget problems driven mostly by the rising cost of health care \xe2\x80\x94 make it imperative to get the most from every dollar that is spent on stimulus. That means spending less money for tax cuts for business and high-income Americans, and more for government programs like, say, unemployment relief and aid to states.'b'The day after Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s speech, the Labor Department released the employment report for December, showing that employers had shed more jobs in 2008 than in any year since 1945. Worse, the pace of job loss is accelerating. In the third quarter of 2008,  the economy shed an average of 199,000 jobs a month; in the fourth quarter,   510,000 jobs were lost on average each month.'b'Even with a stimulus plan, unemployment will remain uncomfortably high in 2009,  and even after it bottoms out, it is likely to revive slowly. That calls for not only extending unemployment benefits but expanding them, so that they cover more workers. Currently, less than half of jobless workers collect unemployment compensation.'b'The deteriorating job situation also calls for ensuring that states do not have to make unduly burdensome cuts in their own budgets. State and local governments are big employers in their own right, and money that is fed through them quickly reaches beneficiaries and contractors, as well as employees, helping to save and create jobs by supporting demand.'b'Every dollar spent on a politically expedient tax cut is money that is not spent where it could do more good. It also perpetuates the corrosive debate in which taxes are portrayed as basically evil and tax cuts as unmitigated good. That is not a debate that Mr. Obama should engage.'b'When the economy recovers, the nation will face a far more difficult task than deciding how to spend its way out of a slump. As a nation, we will have to right the country\xe2\x80\x99s severe long-term budget imbalance. That will require reforming health care and cutting spending, and \xe2\x80\x94 yes \xe2\x80\x94 tax increases.'b'Mr. Obama will need to lead that fight too. Planting the idea that tax cuts are not an overarching solution to serious problems is a good place to start.'b'In the likely event that Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is confirmed as secretary of state, the last thing she will need is a distracting ethics controversy.'b'That is why Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s confirmation hearing, now scheduled to begin on Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, must cover wider terrain than pressing world issues. It should address the awkward intersection between Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s new post and the charitable and business activities of her husband, former President Bill Clinton.'b'Last month, Mr. Clinton disclosed the names of more than 200,000 donors to his foundation. It was a positive step toward the transparency that Mr. Obama insisted on before selecting Mrs. Clinton. But it also reinforced concerns about potential conflicts of interest ahead.'b'The roster of donors to Mr. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s presidential library and global foundation enterprises include million-dollar-plus contributions from governments in the Middle East, tycoons from India, Nigeria, Ukraine and Canada, and international figures with interests in the policies Mrs. Clinton will be helping to write and carry out.'b'The five-page accord signed by representatives of Mr. Clinton and Mr. Obama could use tightening. For example, the wording calls for disclosure of \xe2\x80\x9cnew contributors\xe2\x80\x9d to Clinton Foundation programs. It does not necessarily require disclosing the size of their gifts or the dates they were made. Disclosure of Mr. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s charitable fund-raising and relevant private fees should be done monthly, or at least quarterly, not just once a year.'b'The overarching principle should be prompt disclosure of the amount and source of all payments to any Clinton charity or to Mr. Clinton personally by any person or entity with a political or economic interest, real or perceived, in State Department decisions. Ideally, the White House counsel\xe2\x80\x99s office would be assigned a larger role than envisioned in screening Mr. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s speaking and consulting deals before any check is received.'b'Mr. Clinton has agreed to reduce his fund-raising and administrative role in the Clinton Global Initiative. The international project will no longer accept contributions from foreign governments or hold big events outside the United States once Mrs. Clinton is installed. These are prudent moves. The committee must decide if they are sufficient, given Mr. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s continuing ties.'b'During her confirmation hearing, Mrs. Clinton must make it emphatically clear that past and future supporters of her husband or his work will not get favored treatment by the State Department. Avoiding the appearance of favoritism will be as important as the fact.'b'We believe that Mrs. Clinton has the potential to be a superb secretary of state. We also value Mr. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s work since leaving the White House to help advance the fight against AIDS, malaria, malnutrition and other global ills. He has agreed to greater transparency and more restrictions than any former president, going beyond what law requires. That does not alter the committee\xe2\x80\x99s duty to scour the plans for workability and loopholes.'b'Everyone should recognize that there is no perfect solution for Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s particular spousal dilemma. And, realistically, no set of rules, however well-meaning or tightly drafted, can substitute for the exercise of sound judgment and proper restraint. But they can help.'b'A well-worn landscape like Long Island\xe2\x80\x99s yields few surprises to the driver\xe2\x80\x99s gaze. Shops cluster by size and species: pizza with bagels and nail salons, Home Depot with Old Navy. But one roadside incongruity that always unnerves me is the sight of a person outside the shell of a car on purpose \xe2\x80\x94 like  a man pedaling slowly beside a highway on a bicycle.'b'Bicyclists and suburbs are an uneasy fit. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean the racing bikers who swarm like neon-colored beetles, hogging the middle of the road. I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the guys without helmets, on beat-up mountain bikes: restaurant workers wearing windbreakers over white dress shirts and ties; men in sweatshirts and baseball caps riding home from the store, plastic shopping bags hanging awkwardly off the handlebars.'b'Such sights are evidence of a valiant adaptation to a hostile environment. For immigrant workers, as with so many of us in the suburbs, life boils down to the job, the bed and the travel between. But when you live in a landscape designed for cars, and you are poor, and it is too far to walk to work, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no bus to take you there, the only option is two wheels. This is what is cheap and effective. It can also be deadly.'b'On Christmas Day, a car going at least 80 miles per hour on Route 111 in Central Islip hit a bicyclist, Hector Rapalo. The driver sped off. Mr. Rapalo, a 39-year-old Honduran immigrant who worked at a pizza shop, died. Police said that the collision may or may not have been an accident, but that the driver surely knew that he or she had struck someone.'b'Immigrants ask for little more than the opportunity to work so they can send money home. Their lives are quiet but precarious, in a place that accepts their labor but offers little warmth or welcome. An inveterate hostility sometimes sinks into brutality, as in the fatal stabbing in Patchogue last November of Marcelo Lucero, an Ecuadorean immigrant set upon by a gang of teenagers.'b'The accidents they suffer go unnoticed, except when carnage briefly makes the news: Santos Javier Ramos, 21, a bicyclist killed by a car in Selden; Enrique Aguilar-Gamez, 26, fatally struck by a minivan while bicycling in Copiague; Adolfo Reyes, 42, a day laborer badly injured by a hit-and-run driver while on foot in Holtsville. The police in that case suspected a hate crime, because there were no skid marks or evidence that the driver slowed down after Mr. Reyes flew into his windshield, fracturing his skull, collarbone and arm.'b'BOMBS and rockets are flying between Israel and Palestinians in Gaza, and once again, The Times is caught in a familiar crossfire, accused from all sides of unfair and inaccurate coverage.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo describe The Times\xe2\x80\x99s reporting as inadequate and favorable to Israel is an understatement,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hugh Sansom of Brooklyn. Dorit Sauer Raskin of Manhattan saw it in an entirely different light. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you not print any articles of the suffering of the people in Israel?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are the pro-Israel articles?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Jill Abramson, the managing editor for news, 'b'responded'b' last week on the newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s Web site to similar complaints. She said the paper is scrupulously careful to describe the motives, histories, politics and perspectives of everyone in the conflict, allowing readers to decide who is right or wrong. \xe2\x80\x9cI see a backwards vote of confidence in The Times\xe2\x80\x99s reporting, given that every identifiable faction in this fractured collision of peoples and injustices believes so firmly that we are taking a side \xe2\x80\x94 someone else\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d Abramson said.'b'It can be risky for editors and reporters to think that if everyone in a dispute is angry with them, then they must be doing something right. Sometimes they are so wrong the anger is justified. But in the case of the complex, intractable struggle between Israel and the Palestinians, even the best, most evenhanded reporting will not satisfy those passionately on one side or the other.'b''b'David K. Shipler'b', a former Times correspondent who won a Pulitzer Prize for his book \xe2\x80\x9cArab and Jew: Wounded Spirits in a Promised Land,\xe2\x80\x9d said in an interview that each side firmly believes it is the victim in the struggle. \xe2\x80\x9cAny fair-minded coverage has to shatter that paradigm,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBoth sides are both victims and perpetrators at the same time.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But the readers I am hearing from are not ready to accept that notion. Supporters of Israel want coverage that stresses the terror caused by Hamas rockets fired ever deeper into Israeli territory, and are offended at so many pictures of Palestinian casualties. Supporters of the Palestinians want the coverage to focus on the suffering caused by Israel\xe2\x80\x99s bombs and missiles, and on the economic sanctions and border closings that isolated Gaza before the latest fighting began.'b'The intensity of the criticism is no surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a war,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas Lemann, dean of the graduate school of journalism at Columbia University. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a media war. Public opinions outside the region are very important, and they\xe2\x80\x99re shaped by the press coverage.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Because of its international reach and influence, The Times comes in for particularly close scrutiny. Abramson said she thinks no other topic of news generates as much feedback. Photographs, the content and play of articles, headlines, captions and even individual word choices are examined and challenged.'b'Early in the conflict, Ethan Bronner, the Jerusalem bureau chief, wrote a deep and incisive  'b'front-page news analysis'b' that contained a single slip. When he said Israel would need \xe2\x80\x9canother peace treaty\xe2\x80\x9d with Hamas \xe2\x80\x94 he told me he had meant cease-fire \xe2\x80\x94 Roger Gerber of Scarsdale, N.Y., saw it as a sign of bias or \xe2\x80\x9cat best sloppy reporting\xe2\x80\x9d because Hamas rejects the existence of Israel and would never sign a peace treaty.'b'Bert Distelburger of New City, N.Y., said he suspected that a front-page picture last Monday of a dead Palestinian girl being carried on a stretcher in a Gaza City hospital was a faked \xe2\x80\x9cpropaganda photo\xe2\x80\x9d because, \xe2\x80\x9cA doctor does not examine a person face down.\xe2\x80\x9d Patrick Witty, the photo editor who recommended the picture, showed me how he blew it up on a large computer screen and scanned it carefully for any signs of digital doctoring. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a real photograph,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He also showed me obvious propaganda photos from both sides that he said he would never put in the newspaper \xe2\x80\x94 posed pictures of Palestinians looking at bodies or Israel\xe2\x80\x99s prime minister visiting a smiling soldier in a hospital.'b'Witty and his colleagues are frustrated because Israel has barred journalists from entering Gaza, and although The Times has two photographers in the region ready to go, it must rely on pictures taken by Palestinian photographers. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I can\xe2\x80\x99t have my own person there, I have to question every picture that comes in \xe2\x80\x94 to an obsessive degree,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Last summer, Witty unmasked as a fake a photo of an Iranian missile test that ran on many other front pages.'b'Stephen Weil of Washington said he understood that Israel\xe2\x80\x99s bombings had killed hundreds more Palestinians than the number of Israelis killed by Hamas rockets. Yet 'b'photos'b' on the newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s Web site \xe2\x80\x9ctell a different story: for every Palestinian victim, an Israeli one is shown.\xe2\x80\x9d He urged me to do a photo count, and said that if The Times was trying to suggest that the suffering on each side was roughly equal, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a lie.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'My assistant, Michael McElroy, did such a count, from the start of the latest fighting through Friday, and found that online and in the newspaper, there were almost three photos from Gaza showing the impact of the war for every photo from Israel. There were 28 photos, some quite graphic, of dead and wounded Palestinians, five of Israelis. Such a ratio offends supporters of Israel, who argue that Hamas uses civilians as human shields and that the pictures inflame people against Israel.'b'But most of the destruction is in Gaza, and news photographs are not about blame but about showing what happened. Demolished buildings and dead bodies provide dramatic images; fear in Israel is more difficult to capture with a camera. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing fair in war photography,\xe2\x80\x9d Witty said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s tragic.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some readers questioned the accuracy of casualty numbers in The Times. \xe2\x80\x9cCasualty figures are always incorrect,\xe2\x80\x9d Shipler said, \xe2\x80\x9cespecially the day you report them.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The newspaper ran a 'b'correction'b' last Monday, saying that for the first three days of the conflict, it should have said more than 60 civilians were killed, not \xe2\x80\x9csome 60.\xe2\x80\x9d United Nations officials had counted 62 dead women and children but had no count of civilian men, because it is hard to tell them from Hamas fighters who do not wear uniforms.'b'When Israeli bombs 'b'killed dozens'b' at a United Nations school on Tuesday, it was too dangerous for the newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s Palestinian stringer, Taghreed El-Khodary, who has worked for The Times for seven years, to go to the scene. She went instead to a hospital, where an official told her that 40 were killed, including 10 children and 5 women. The head surgeon and an ambulance driver said 45 were dead. United Nations officials, who were not on the scene, said 30 were killed. The Times emphasized the hospital\xe2\x80\x99s count of 40.'b'Ian Fisher, the deputy foreign editor who helps direct daily coverage, said, \xe2\x80\x9cLike all human things, we are not perfect, but the attention that goes into this is tremendous.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Though the most vociferous supporters of Israel and the Palestinians do not agree, I think The Times, largely barred from the battlefield and reporting amid the chaos of war, has tried its best to do a fair, balanced and 'b'complete job'b' \xe2\x80\x94 and has largely succeeded.'b'To the Editor:'b'As Mark Felt\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer and co-author, I strongly take issue with statements in \xe2\x80\x9cW.

Hamas and Hezbollah proudly proclaim that their priority is not a Palestinian state but to continue murdering Jews in order to bring about the destruction of the Jewish state.'b'Aside from a military response, how does Mr. Cohen suggest Israel defend its citizens from an entity that targets civilians with thousands of missiles and trains its youngsters to aspire to becoming Islamic martyrs by killing Jews?'b'As to the conflict in Gaza, perhaps Mr. Cohen could advise us how to further minimize casualties among noncombatants. Israel has taken extraordinary steps to protect innocent lives, while Hamas uses human shields, deliberately launching missiles from densely populated residential areas.'b'Liberals love to give us lessons in morality.

It will be the burden of their lifetimes. If they each give birth to a gazelle  \xe2\x80\x94  a lean, energy-efficient and innovation-friendly stimulus  \xe2\x80\x94  it will be the opportunity of their lifetimes.'b'So here\xe2\x80\x99s hoping that our new administration and Congress will be guided in shaping the stimulus by reading John Maynard Keynes in one hand  \xe2\x80\x94  to get as much money injected as quickly as possible  \xe2\x80\x94  and by reading \xe2\x80\x9cRising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future\xe2\x80\x9d with the other.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGathering Storm\xe2\x80\x9d was the outstanding 2005 report produced by our National Academies on how to keep America competitive by vastly improving math and science education, investing in long-term research, recruiting top students from abroad and making U.S. laws the most conducive in the world for innovation.'b'You see, even before the current financial crisis, we were already in a deep competitive hole  \xe2\x80\x94  a long period in which too many people were making money from money, or money from flipping houses or hamburgers, and too few people were making money by making new stuff, with hard-earned science, math, biology and engineering skills.'b'The financial crisis just made the hole deeper, which is why our stimulus needs to be both big and smart, both financially and educationally stimulating. It needs to be able to produce not only more shovel-ready jobs and shovel-ready workers, but more Google-ready jobs and Windows-ready and knowledge-ready workers.'b'If we spend $1 trillion on a stimulus and just get better highways and bridges  \xe2\x80\x94  and not a new Google, Apple, Intel or Microsoft  \xe2\x80\x94  your kids will thank you for making it so much easier for them to commute to the unemployment office or mediocre jobs.'b'Barack Obama gets it, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure Congress does. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama said on Thursday, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll put people to work repairing crumbling roads, bridges and schools by eliminating the backlog of well-planned, worthy and needed infrastructure projects.

Can we stimulate both our economy and our people in time? Maybe rather than just giving everyone a quick $1,500 to hit the mall to buy flat-screen TVs imported from China, or creating those all-important green-collar jobs for low-skilled workers  \xe2\x80\x94  to put people to work installing solar panels and insulating homes  \xe2\x80\x94  we should also give everyone who is academically eligible and willing a quick $5,000 to go back to school. Universities today are the biggest employers in many Congressional districts, and they\xe2\x80\x99re all having to downsize.'b'My wife teaches public school in Montgomery County, Md., where more and more teachers can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to buy homes near the schools where they teach, and now have long, dirty commutes from distant suburbs. One of the smartest stimulus moves we could make would be to eliminate federal income taxes on all public schoolteachers so more talented people would choose these careers. I\xe2\x80\x99d also double the salaries of all highly qualified math and science teachers, staple green cards to the diplomas of foreign students who graduate from any U.S. university in math or science  \xe2\x80\x94  instead of subsidizing their educations and then sending them home  \xe2\x80\x94  and offer full scholarships to needy students who want to go to a public university or community college for the next four years.'b'J.F.K. took us to the moon. Let B.H.O. take America back to school.'b'But that will take time. There\xe2\x80\x99s simply no shortcut for a stimulus that stimulates minds not just salaries. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can bail out a bank; you can\xe2\x80\x99t bail out a generation,\xe2\x80\x9d says the great American inventor, Dean Kamen, who has designed everything from the Segway to artificial limbs. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can print money, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t print knowledge. It takes 12 years.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Sure, we\xe2\x80\x99ll waste some money doing that. That will happen with bridges, too. But a bridge is just a bridge. Once it\xe2\x80\x99s up, it stops stimulating. A student who normally would not be interested in science but gets stimulated by a better teacher or more exposure to a lab, or a scientist who gets the funding for new research, is potentially the next Steve Jobs or Bill Gates. They create good jobs for years. Perhaps more bridges can bail us out of a depression, but only more Bills and Steves can bail us into prosperity.'b'WASHINGTON'b'In the past week, I\xe2\x80\x99ve twice been close enough to Dick Cheney to kick him in the shins.'b'I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.

I met her five years ago when she sold me a  teenager, Srey Mom, for $203 and then blithely wrote me a receipt confirming that the girl was now my property. At another brothel nearby, I purchased another imprisoned teenager for $150.'b'Astonished that in the 21st century I had bought two human beings, I took them back to their villages and worked with a local aid group to help them start small businesses. I\xe2\x80\x99ve remained close to them over the years, but the results were mixed.'b'The second girl did wonderfully, learning hairdressing and marrying a terrific man.  But Srey Mom, it turned out, was addicted to methamphetamine and fled back to the brothel world to feed her craving.'b'I just returned again to Ms. Khorn\xe2\x80\x99s brothel to interview her, and found something remarkable. It had gone broke and closed, like many of the brothels in Poipet. One lesson is that the business model is more vulnerable than it looks. There are ways we can make enslaving girls more risky and less profitable, so that traffickers give up in disgust.'b'For years, Ms. Khorn had been grumbling to me about the brothel \xe2\x80\x94 the low margins, the seven-day schedule, difficult customers, grasping policemen and scorn from the community. There was also a personal toll, for her husband had sex with the girls, infuriating her, and the couple eventually divorced bitterly.  Ms. Khorn was also troubled that her youngest daughter, now 13, was growing up surrounded by drunken, leering men.'b'Then in the last year, the brothel business became even more challenging amid rising pressure from aid groups, journalists and the United States State Department\xe2\x80\x99s trafficking office. The office  issued reports shaming Cambodian leaders and threatened sanctions if they did nothing.'b'Many of the brothels are owned by the police, which complicates matters, but eventually authorities in Cambodia were pressured enough that they ordered a partial crackdown.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me to close down exactly,\xe2\x80\x9d said another Poipet brothel owner whom I\xe2\x80\x99ve also interviewed periodically. \xe2\x80\x9cBut they said I should keep the front door closed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'About half the brothels in Poipet seem to have gone out of business in the last couple of years. After Ms. Khorn\xe2\x80\x99s brothel closed, her daughter-in-law took four of the prostitutes to staff a new  brothel, but it\xe2\x80\x99s doing poorly and she is thinking of starting a rice shop instead. \xe2\x80\x9cA store would be more profitable,\xe2\x80\x9d grumbled the daughter-in-law, Sav Channa.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe police come almost every day, asking for $5,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAny time a policeman gets drunk, he comes and asks for money. ... Sometimes I just close up and pretend that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a brothel. I say that we\xe2\x80\x99re all sisters.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ms. Channa, who does not seem to be imprisoning anyone against her will, readily acknowledged that some other brothels in Poipet torture girls, enslave them and occasionally beat them to death. She complained that their cruelty gives them a competitive advantage.'b'But brutality has its own drawbacks as a business model, particularly during a crackdown, pimps say. Brothels that imprison and torture girls have to pay for 24-hour guards, and they lose business because they can\xe2\x80\x99t allow customers to take girls out to hotel rooms. Moreover, the Cambodian government has begun prosecuting the most abusive traffickers.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne brothel owner here was actually arrested,\xe2\x80\x9d complained another owner in Poipet, indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter that, I was so scared, I closed the brothel for a while.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To be sure, a new brothel district has opened up on the edge of Poipet \xe2\x80\x94 in the guise of \xe2\x80\x9ckaraoke lounges\xe2\x80\x9d employing teenage girls. One of the Mama-sans there offered that while she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a young virgin girl in stock, she could get me one.'b'Virgin sales are the profit center for many brothels in Asia (partly because they stitch girls up and resell them as virgins several times over), and thus these sales are their economic vulnerability as well. If we want to undermine sex trafficking, the best way is to pressure governments like Cambodia\xe2\x80\x99s to organize sting operations and arrest both buyers and sellers of virgin girls. Cambodia has shown it is willing to take at least some action, and that is one that would strike at the heart of the business model.'b'Sexual slavery is like any other business: raise the operating costs, create a risk of jail, and the human traffickers will quite sensibly shift to some other trade. If the Obama administration treats 21st-century slavery as a top priority, we can push many of the traffickers to quit in disgust and switch to stealing motorcycles instead.'b'London'b'SUCCESSION \xe2\x80\x94 the handover of power from one leader to another \xe2\x80\x94 is the moment of truth for a political system. The American presidential election, for all its magnificent hucksterism, was once again a confirmation of the messy but noble dynamism of democracy \xe2\x80\x94 America does its handover of power with dignity (barring a few dubious presidential pardons).'b'Yet in the 21st century there are three Great Powers, and two \xe2\x80\x94 Russia and China \xe2\x80\x94 boast authoritarian systems ruled by tiny cabals that decide the succession of political power through mysterious, invisible and almost magical rites. The succession in China is shamelessly undemocratic and secretive \xe2\x80\x94 but firm and orderly. Moscow is different, if only because the absence of working mechanisms  for succession are a real threat to the international order.'b'Late last month, just days before President Bush hosted the surviving former presidents and President-elect Barack Obama in the White House, Russia\xe2\x80\x99s rubber-stamp Parliament was passing a law, backed by President Dmitri Medvedev, that would allow the next Russian president to serve two six-year terms, up from two four-year terms. The law\xe2\x80\x99s implications are as obscure as all developments in Russia. But it seems a maneuver to allow Vladimir Putin \xe2\x80\x94 Russia\xe2\x80\x99s previous president, current prime minister and still paramount leader \xe2\x80\x94 to return to an ever-stronger presidency.'b'Having reached the old term limit last year, Mr. Putin chose and installed a trusted prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9, Mr. Medvedev, as successor. Now many expect the president to return the favor by resigning and permitting Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s return to office. In contortion worthy of medieval Byzantium, Mr. Putin, having handed over power but actually not handed it over at all, may imminently be officially restored to it.'b'Vladimir Putin personifies the successes and flaws of today\xe2\x80\x99s Russia. However superficial the nation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csovereign democracy\xe2\x80\x9d may be, his popularity is enormous and real. Any politician would envy his association with stability, prosperity, security, restored imperial power and vigorous state authority.'b'It was always presumptuous to expect Russia, an ancient nation-state and proud empire of distinct culture with a tradition of autocracy, to become an Anglo-American democracy overnight \xe2\x80\x94 just as it is na\xc3\xafve to expect it in other parts of the world. The unspoken contract between ruler and subject is that in return for safety, prosperity and prestige, the Russians entrust power and cede democratic freedoms to their leaders.'b'Even under a regime dominated by former K.G.B. officials, Moscow is freer than at any time in its history, other than the mid-1990s. So it is astonishing that, while Russia has its own Vogue magazine and Internet cafes, its political process is now more arcane, more eccentric  and yet more public than it was during the 18th-century \xe2\x80\x9cage of palace revolutions.\xe2\x80\x9d The existence of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s democratic Constitution has led to far more smoke and mirrors than in China, where successions to a bureaucratic collective leadership are managed by a tiny camarilla in a self-declared one-party state.'b'The view of de Custine about  Russia  in the mid-19th century could easily apply to the 21st: \xe2\x80\x9cI came here to see a country, but what I find is a theater ... In appearances, everything happens as it does everywhere else. There is no difference except in the very foundation of things.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Russia has had a functioning system for handing over power for only 121 years in its entire history: during the later years of the Romanov autocracy. Before Emperor Paul I established a legal structure in 1797, there was no law of succession: Czars simply chose their heirs. Both Peter the Great and Ivan the Terrible undermined their own achievements by killing their sons and chosen heirs. After Peter\xe2\x80\x99s death in 1725, the succession was decided through 70 years of palace coups and regicide, a system oft described by the witty phrase \xe2\x80\x9cautocracy tempered by assassination.\xe2\x80\x9d Strong, intelligent empresses like Elizabeth and Catherine the Great seized power, creating an age of omnipotent petticoats.'b'Catherine, a German with no claim to the throne, in 1762 overthrew her own husband, Peter III, who was subsequently strangled by two courtiers, Aleksei Orlov and his brother Grigory (who was also Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s lover) in a drunken frenzy. The official announcement was that he had died of piles \xe2\x80\x94 prompting the French philosopher d\xe2\x80\x99Alembert to joke, when invited by Catherine to visit, that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go since he suffered from hemorrhoids, potentially fatal in Russia.'b'Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s heir, Paul I, so hated his mother that he created his law of strict male succession. He was a despotic, half-mad emperor with a fixation on military parades, and in 1801 was strangled and brained with an inkwell by his own courtiers. Yet his decision to codify the turnover of power ushered in an era of stable successions that lasted until 1917.'b'There was no succession rule in the Soviet state, an empire ruled by a murderous clique, men who met in paranoid secrecy as if they were still scruffy conspirators plotting in a room above some provincial tavern. Sovereignty in this institutionalized conspiracy was meant to rest in the Central Committee, but actually five or six magnates decided everything.'b'Regarding themselves as irreplaceable, both Lenin and Stalin tried in different ways to destroy their successors \xe2\x80\x94 Lenin through a testament that attacked Stalin and Trotsky, Stalin through purges culminating in the Doctors\xe2\x80\x99 Plot of 1953. The aftermaths in both cases were grim: all Lenin\xe2\x80\x99s potential heirs were  killed by Stalin, and the struggle after Stalin\xe2\x80\x99s death in 1953 was described by Winston Churchill as \xe2\x80\x9cbulldogs fighting under a rug.\xe2\x80\x9d At first the sadistic secret-police chief Lavrenti Beria emerged as strongman, until he was overthrown and shot in a plot hatched by Nikita Khrushchev.'b'Khrushchev, in turn, was overthrown in a palace coup in 1964 and pensioned off \xe2\x80\x94 though his successor, Leonid Brezhnev, considered having him killed. Brezhnev reigned into senility if not embalmment, followed by successions as sclerotically secretive as they were physically redundant. And so it continued through Mikhail Gorbachev, the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the tumultuous reign of Boris Yeltsin and the steely paramountcy of Mr. Putin.'b'Vladimir Putin wants his successes in Russia to be respected by the West; hence he did not simply ignore the Constitution and stay in the presidency. He and his grandees  believe in the idiosyncratic style of authoritarian democracy  that has restored Russian prestige (although his courtiers are also keen to preserve their power and wealth).'b'Things could be worse: the neighboring former Soviet republics demonstrate the crasser solutions Russia rightly wishes to avoid. In Kazakhstan, the Constitution has been altered so President Nursultan Nazarbayev may reign endlessly. In Turkmenistan, the gruesomely dotty Sapamurat  Niyazov appointed himself president for life and took the name Turkmenbashi, \xe2\x80\x9cfather of All Turkmens.\xe2\x80\x9d Azerbaijan has effectively become a monarchy: on his death in 2003, President Heydar Aliyev (who had served in Brezhnev\xe2\x80\x99s Politburo) was succeeded by his son, Ilham \xe2\x80\x94 a surprising return of the hereditary principle also seen in other \xe2\x80\x9csocialist republics\xe2\x80\x9d including Syria (ruled by the Assad dynasty) and North Korea (the Kims).'b'If the Russians are happy with it, should their peculiar semi-modern, semi-medieval system concern us? A superb book called \xe2\x80\x9cFlawed Succession,\xe2\x80\x9d edited by Uri Ra\xe2\x80\x99anan in 2006,  examines four 20th-century Russian successions and suggests it does: \xe2\x80\x9cThe absence of a transparent, consistently implemented, non-arbitrary transfer of power mechanism,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Professor Ra\xe2\x80\x99anan, means that power is \xe2\x80\x9ctransferred inevitably by coups, whether through covert opaque manipulations ... or physical elimination.\xe2\x80\x9d Without such a mechanism, \xe2\x80\x9ca democracy cannot be established,\xe2\x80\x9d nor can rule of law or a civic society.'b'Clearly, this lack of civic society affects the way rulers rule. Russia is so feudal in its system of patronage and reward that it is virtually impossible for a leader to hand over power without controlling his successor or at least receiving an exemption from prosecution \xe2\x80\x94 something Mr. Putin granted his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, in 1999. Leaders, writes Professor Ra\xe2\x80\x99anan, \xe2\x80\x9care condemned to lead a Hobbesian existence, fearing the penalties that come with loss of power.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It matters because the whims of the system are reflected in Russia\xe2\x80\x99s lurchingly inconsistent foreign and military policies, which are unreadable to outsiders, from its war in Georgia last year to the current gas crisis with Ukraine. Are these accidents, adventures, opportunities, policies? And who is deciding them?'b'Yet a drop in its oil revenues could lead to domestic unrest \xe2\x80\x94 there is no other way to overthrow the oligarchy. Meanwhile, Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s succession and (likely) restoration is a leisurely dance of the seven veils in which one veil is dropped only for another to be donned \xe2\x80\x94 more fascinating even than the danse macabre of Soviet Kremlinology. But no one, probably not even the grandees of the Kremlin themselves, knows how it will end.'b'The Obama team is tight with information, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the scoop on the senior advisers he\xe2\x80\x99s gathered to push a new Middle East policy as the Gaza war rages: Shibley Telhami, Vali Nasr, Fawaz Gerges, Fouad Moughrabi and James Zogby.'b'This group of distinguished Arab-American and Iranian-American scholars, with wide regional experience, is intended to signal a U.S. willingness to think anew about the Middle East, with greater cultural sensitivity to both sides, and a keen eye on whether uncritical support for Israel has been helpful.'b'O.K., forget the above, I\xe2\x80\x99ve let my imagination run away with me. Barack Obama has no plans for this line-up on the Israeli-Palestinian problem and Iran.'b'In fact, the people likely to play significant roles on the Middle East in the Obama Administration read rather differently.'b'They include Dennis Ross (the veteran Clinton administration Mideast peace envoy who may now extend his brief to Iran); James Steinberg (as deputy secretary of state); Dan Kurtzer (the former U.S. ambassador to Israel); Dan Shapiro (a longtime aide to Obama); and Martin Indyk (another former ambassador to Israel who is close to the incoming secretary of state, Hillary Clinton.)'b'Now, I have nothing against smart, driven, liberal, Jewish (or half-Jewish) males; I\xe2\x80\x99ve looked in the mirror. I know or have talked to all these guys, except Shapiro. They\xe2\x80\x99re knowledgeable, broad-minded and determined. Still, on the diversity front they fall short. On the change-you-can-believe-in front, they also leave something to be desired.'b'In an adulatory piece in Newsweek, Michael Hirsh wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cRoss\xe2\x80\x99s previous experience as the indefatigable point man during the failed Oslo process, as well as the main negotiator with Syria, make him uniquely suited for a major renewal of U.S. policy on nearly every front.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Really?

With the Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya networks broadcasting 24-7 images of the carnage in Gaza, where there are more than 800 dead, mobilization in the Arab world is intense. Rage against Israel, and behind it America, bodes ill.'b'Change is needed, and not just in the intensity of U.S. diplomatic involvement with Israel-Palestine. Some fundamental questions must be asked.'b'Does regarding the Middle East almost exclusively through the prism of the war on terror make sense? Does turning a blind eye to the Israeli settlements in the West Bank that frustrate a two-state solution, and the Israeli blockade of Gaza that radicalizes its population, not undermine U.S. interest in bolstering moderate Palestinian sentiment?'b'Should policy not be directed toward reconciling a Palestinian movement now split between Fatah and Hamas, without which no final-status peace will be possible? Beyond their terrorist wings, in their broad grass-roots political movements, what elements of Hamas and Hezbollah can be coaxed toward the mainstream?'b'Do we understand the increasingly sophisticated Middle East of Al Jazeera where, as Telhami, a professor at the University of Maryland, put it to me, \xe2\x80\x9cPeople are not dumb and our credibility is at a historic near-zero?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Asking these questions does not alter America\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security within its pre-1967 borders, which is and should be unwavering. It does not change the unacceptability of Hamas rockets or the fact the Hamas Charter is vile. But it would signal that the damaging Bush-era consensus that Israel can do no wrong is to be challenged.'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel encouraged  \xe2\x80\x94  not by the putative Ross-redux team, nor by the nonbinding resolutions passed last week in the Senate and the House of Representatives. The former offered \xe2\x80\x9cunwavering commitment\xe2\x80\x9d to Israel. The latter recognized \xe2\x80\x9cIsrael\xe2\x80\x99s right to defend itself against attacks from Gaza.\xe2\x80\x9d Neither criticized Israel.'b'It seems that among liberal democracies, it is only in the U.S .Congress that a defense against terror that results in the slaying of hundreds of Palestinian children is not cause for agonized soul-searching.

As noted in \xe2\x80\x9cNegotiating Arab-Israeli Peace: American Leadership in the Middle East,\xe2\x80\x9d a fine evaluation of U.S. diplomacy by Kurtzer and Scott Lasensky, the lack of expertise on Islam and an Arab perspective was costly at Camp David.

Now, with Gaza blood flowing, come deeds.'b'After the presidential election, the Republican National Committee filed a lawsuit that could drive a stake through the heart of the campaign finance system. It challenges the constitutionality of the McCain-Feingold law\xe2\x80\x99s ban on \xe2\x80\x9csoft money\xe2\x80\x9d contributions. If the suit succeeds, it will seriously damage democracy by allowing a virtually unlimited amount of corporate and other special-interest money to flood into politics.'b'There is no denying that the campaign finance system is badly broken. It suffered even more harm  when Barack Obama became the first major-party nominee to refuse  public financing and the spending limits that come with it. One of Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s top priorities should be fixing the system\xe2\x80\x99s flaws, including  the core problem that it does not provide enough money for  a strong presidential campaign in modern times. But it will be impossible to fix the system if the R.N.C. prevails in court.'b'The Republicans are trying to remove the restrictions that McCain-Feingold puts on contributions to national political parties. Now, the parties are allowed to accept no more than $28,500 a year from individuals, and nothing at all from corporations or labor unions. The R.N.C. wants to strip away these restrictions so it can accept unlimited amounts of \xe2\x80\x9csoft,\xe2\x80\x9d or unrestricted, money from corporations and rich people.'b'The suit, which is before a special three-judge panel in Washington, claims that the limits are unconstitutional. The R.N.C. says it uses much of the money it raises for activities not related to federal elections, such as redistricting, grass-roots organizing and issue advertising. It argues that the First Amendment prohibits limiting contributions for these purposes.'b'The problem with this argument is that the Supreme Court  has already rejected it. In 2003, in McConnell v. F.E.C., the justices upheld the precise provisions the Republicans are now challenging.'b'In its ruling, the court emphasized that it does not matter what the money is spent on. Because the national parties have close ties to federal elected officials, the court said, large donations to the parties inject special-interest money into the federal government and have a corrupting effect on politics.'b'The McConnell decision should end the matter. But the R.N.C. seems to be hoping that because of changes in the court \xe2\x80\x94 in particular, Justice Sandra Day O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s replacement by Samuel Alito \xe2\x80\x94 it can persuade the court to undo this recent and important precedent.'b'The Republican Party\xe2\x80\x99s suit was clearly prompted by its troubles in the 2008 election, in which Mr. Obama proved far more adept at fund-raising than John McCain. It is disturbing that the R.N.C. sees its salvation in clearing the way for corporations and other special interests to flood its campaign coffers once again.'b'In its 2003 ruling, the Supreme Court declared that McCain-Feingold\xe2\x80\x99s limits on soft money were a permissible means \xe2\x80\x9cto confine the ill effects of aggregated wealth on\xe2\x80\x9d national politics. The courts should reaffirm that well-reasoned decision \xe2\x80\x94 and  Mr.  Obama and Congress should get to work fixing the current badly flawed, out-of-date campaign finance system.'b'The Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s recent decision not to award the Purple Heart to soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder strikes us as reasonable and well considered. This is not to say that the result was uncomplicated or unlikely to cause understandable sadness and pain.'b'The military has always honored the sacrifice of veterans who are wounded in its wars. But it has been slow to recognize that those wounds can include invisible injuries: the nightmares, rages and terrors of PTSD, which are as real as any scar or missing limb.'b'PTSD can be difficult to diagnose, with symptoms that can arise later in life, far from the battlefield and are not necessarily linked to any specific actions of an enemy. So the Pentagon contends that it has no choice but to exclude its sufferers from the Purple Heart, given to those whose injuries result from direct and  intentional action by the enemy. Doing so would not debase the medal, as some defenders of the Purple Heart callously put it, but it would change it, perhaps in unintended and unwelcome ways.'b'The main criterion for awarding the Purple Heart has always been bloodshed. Those looking for absolute fairness in this distinction will never find it: a soldier who cowers or blunders into harm\xe2\x80\x99s way will receive his medal just as surely as his quick-thinking, unscathed buddy will not. A soldier whose lacerations heal completely will wear the same medal as someone who has lost a limb or been paralyzed for life.'b'None of this relieves the military of its duty to fully honor those whose injuries are unseen. A Purple Heart may not be the answer \xe2\x80\x94 not until, perhaps, advances in brain science bring full objectivity to the diagnosis of mental injury. But PTSD sufferers surely deserve medical care every bit as diligent and excellent as what their fellow veterans receive for more visible injuries. The Pentagon has been prodded to do so by the deadly innovation of the current war: the bomb blasts that have exacted such a deadly toll in brain injuries.'b'The military is, in fact, moving forward merely by mentioning PTSD and the Purple Heart in the same breath. Imagine Gen. George Patton, who so notoriously slapped a quivering enlisted man, learning that his beloved Army was even considering giving medals to those whose combat tours left them mentally shattered.'b'But there is far more to do. Recent veterans of Iraq or Afghanistan will tell you that the military stigma against mental illness has not abated, that the combat ethos \xe2\x80\x94 suck it up, soldier \xe2\x80\x94 persists and that some officers continue to belittle the severity, and even question the existence, of post-traumatic stress.'b'At least 300,000  service members who were in  Afghanistan or Iraq show symptoms of PTSD. They  know a truth their forebears of Vietnam, Korea and World War II have lived with for years: war injures everyone it touches.'b'The Bush administration has decided that it will not issue final fuel-economy standards before it leaves office. It is not entirely clear why. The regulators may have run out of time, or the White House may have chosen not to inflict any last-minute pain on the automakers.'b'The standards would surely have been weaker than what the automakers are capable of achieving. The Obama administration now has a free hand to set its own standards that will save consumers money at the pump, reduce oil dependency and greenhouse gases, and help make the American car companies more competitive.'b'The 2007 energy bill required new cars and trucks to meet a fleetwide average of 35 miles per gallon by 2020, a 40 percent increase over today\xe2\x80\x99s average of 25 m.p.g. Congress intended this as a floor, not a ceiling, and ordered the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to write specific regulations.'b'Last May, as part of these regulations, the agency set an interim fleetwide standard of 31.6 m.p.g by 2015. This was initially praised for pushing carmakers more than halfway to the 2020 goal. The automakers have since suggested they can meet these goals without difficulty, while reputable studies have said they can do even better \xe2\x80\x94 at least as high as 35 m.p.g. by 2015, and 40 m.p.g. by 2020, with no changes in current technology.'b'During Congressional hearings last year on the automakers\xe2\x80\x99 troubles, General Motors and Ford provided production plans to show that they would make more fuel-efficient cars. The Obama administration should make such vehicles a condition of any future  help. No matter what Detroit does, the new administration must set much tougher fuel-economy standards.'b'On Christmas Eve, the conservative pundit Monica Crowley argued on Fox News that instead of  rescuing America from the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt\xe2\x80\x99s spending on public works made it worse.

In 1934, H. L. Mencken was already decrying it as \xe2\x80\x9ca saturnalia of expropriation and waste.\xe2\x80\x9d When F.D.R. ran for re-election in 1936, a headline in William Randolph Hearst\xe2\x80\x99s newspapers insisted that \xe2\x80\x9cMoscow Backs Roosevelt.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But Americans were not  fooled. They knew  F.D.R. was on their side in a way that Herbert Hoover and his fellow free-marketers hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been. They could see first-hand the good that Roosevelt\xe2\x80\x99s jobs programs were doing for the Depression\xe2\x80\x99s victims and the slow but unmistakable improvements in the economy.'b'In the 1934 midterm elections, the voters delivered their first verdict on the New Deal, expanding the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 margins in Congress. In 1936, F.D.R. won in a bigger landslide than he had four years earlier. By 1940, the Republican nominee, Wendell Willkie, was supporting much of Roosevelt\xe2\x80\x99s social welfare and regulatory regime.'b'Anti-New Deal rhetoric has never disappeared from American political life. When Barry Goldwater ran for president in 1964, he attacked President Dwight Eisenhower for having presided over a \xe2\x80\x9cdime store New Deal.\xe2\x80\x9d But in recent years, the attacks have heated up.'b'At the start of the Bush administration, conservatives talked openly about rolling back the New Deal. They were trying to unravel the regulatory state, including protections for workers, consumers and investors. They were also promoting a favorite cause of Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s: privatizing Social Security, the crown jewel of the New Deal.'b'These days the public is in no mood, given the high costs of deregulation in the mortgage industry and the Bernard Madoff scandal, for more talk about dismantling regulations and federal oversight. But today, the new focus is Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s stimulus package. If F.D.R.\xe2\x80\x99s New Deal spending made things worse, it follows that the Obama administration should not make the same mistake.'b'The anti-New Deal line is wrong as a matter of economics. F.D.R.\xe2\x80\x99s spending programs did help the economy and created millions of new jobs. The problem, we now know, is not that F.D.R. spent too much priming the pump, but rather that he spent too little. It was his decision to cut back on spending on New Deal programs that brought about a nasty recession in 1937-38.'b'The second problem is that the criticism overlooks the relief Roosevelt\xe2\x80\x99s programs brought to millions. When F.D.R. took office, unemployment was 25 percent, and families were losing their homes, living in shantytowns, even fighting one another for  food at garbage dumps.'b'The difference that the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Works Progress Administration and other New Deal public works programs made in people\xe2\x80\x99s lives is incalculable.'b'F.D.R.\xe2\x80\x99s labor secretary, Frances Perkins, described in her memoir what a relief job meant to an \xe2\x80\x9calmost deaf, elderly lawyer\xe2\x80\x9d she knew whose practice had failed. He had gotten a job as a caretaker at a small seaside park. \xe2\x80\x9cHe made little extra plantings,\xe2\x80\x9d she recalled, \xe2\x80\x9carranged charming paths and walks, acted as guide to visitors, supervised children\xe2\x80\x99s play.\xe2\x80\x9d When she saw him, she said, \xe2\x80\x9che would always ask me to take a message to the President \xe2\x80\x94 a message of gratitude for a job which paid him fifteen dollars a week and kept him from starving to death.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Congressional Republicans say Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s stimulus will cost too much, and that over time the economy will cure itself. When critics raised the same objections to F.D.R.\xe2\x80\x99s programs, his  relief administrator, Harry Hopkins, had a ready answer: \xe2\x80\x9cPeople don\xe2\x80\x99t eat in the long run.

New York, for example, taxes nonresidents who work for in-state employers, not just on the income they earn when they work in the state but also on income earned when working from home.

Ideally he\xe2\x80\x99d scrap the proposed $150 billion payroll tax cut as well, though I\xe2\x80\x99m aware that it was a campaign promise.'b'Money not squandered on ineffective tax cuts could be used to provide further relief to Americans in distress \xe2\x80\x94 enhanced unemployment benefits, expanded Medicaid and more. And why not get an early start on the insurance subsidies \xe2\x80\x94 probably running at $100 billion or more per year \xe2\x80\x94 that will be essential if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to achieve universal health care?'b'Mainly, though, Mr. Obama needs to make his plan bigger. To see why, consider a new report from his own economic team.'b'On Saturday, Christina Romer, the future head of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, who will be the vice president\xe2\x80\x99s chief economist, released estimates of what the Obama economic plan would accomplish. Their report is reasonable and intellectually honest, which is a welcome change from the fuzzy math of the last eight years.'b'But the report also makes it clear that the plan falls well short of what the economy needs.'b'According to Ms. Romer and Mr. Bernstein, the Obama plan would have its maximum impact in the fourth quarter of 2010. Without the plan, they project, the unemployment rate in that quarter would be a disastrous 8.8 percent. Yet even with the plan, unemployment would be 7 percent \xe2\x80\x94 roughly as high as it is now.'b'After 2010, the report says, the effects of the economic plan would rapidly fade away. The job of promoting full recovery would, however, remain undone: the unemployment rate would still be a painful 6.3 percent in the last quarter of 2011.'b'Now, economic forecasting is an inexact science, to say the least, and things could turn out better than the report predicts. But they could also turn out worse. The report itself acknowledges that \xe2\x80\x9csome private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11 percent in the absence of action.\xe2\x80\x9d And I\xe2\x80\x99m with Lawrence Summers, another member of the Obama economic team, who recently declared, \xe2\x80\x9cIn this crisis, doing too little poses a greater threat than doing too much.\xe2\x80\x9d Unfortunately, that principle isn\xe2\x80\x99t reflected in the current plan.'b'So how can Mr. Obama do more? By including a lot more public investment in his plan \xe2\x80\x94 which will be possible if he takes a longer view.'b'The Romer-Bernstein report acknowledges that \xe2\x80\x9ca dollar of infrastructure spending is more effective in creating jobs than a dollar of tax cuts.\xe2\x80\x9d It argues, however, that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a limit on how much government investment can be carried out efficiently in a short time frame.\xe2\x80\x9d But why does the time frame have to be short?'b'As far as I can tell, Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s planners have focused on investment projects that will deliver their main jobs boost over the next two years. But since unemployment is likely to remain high well beyond that two-year window, the plan should also include longer-term investment projects.'b'And bear in mind that even a project that delivers its main punch in, say, 2011 can provide significant economic support in earlier years. If Mr. Obama drops the \xe2\x80\x9cjump-start\xe2\x80\x9d metaphor, if he accepts the reality that we need a multi-year program rather than a short burst of activity, he can create a lot more jobs through government investment, even in the near term.'b'Still, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t Mr. Obama wait for proof that a bigger, longer-term plan is needed? No. Right now the investment portion of the Obama plan is limited by a shortage of \xe2\x80\x9cshovel ready\xe2\x80\x9d projects, projects ready to go on short notice. A lot more investment can be under way by late 2010 or 2011 if Mr. Obama gives the go-ahead now \xe2\x80\x94 but if he waits too long before deciding, that window of opportunity will be gone.'b'One more thing: even with the Obama plan, the Romer-Bernstein report predicts an average unemployment rate of 7.3 percent over the next three years. That\xe2\x80\x99s a scary number, big enough to pose a real risk that the U.S. economy will get stuck in a Japan-type deflationary trap.'b'So my advice to the Obama team is to scrap the business tax cuts, and, more important, to deal with the threat of doing too little by doing more. And the way to do more is to stop talking about jump-starts and look more broadly at the possibilities for government investment.'b'Barack Obama made news Sunday  on ABC\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThis Week\xe2\x80\x9d: The White House dog will likely be a Labradoodle or a Portuguese water dog.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to say I\xe2\x80\x99m a little disappointed. These are nice, friendly, generally obedient breeds (or in the case of the Labradoodle, a crossbreed). But what a missed opportunity! Obama could have made a bolder, edgier choice,  like a mini-Australian shepherd. I happen to know one well. He\xe2\x80\x99s very smart, a bit neurotic, devoted to his master (if sometimes confused about whether he or the master is the master), and always looking for people to herd. A mini-Aussie would have fit right into a White House populated by Rahm Emanuel, Larry Summers, Joe Biden et al. Instead, Obama\xe2\x80\x99s going with a no-drama canine alternative.'b'And he seems to be going for the no-dramatic-change-in-policy-in-the-White-House alternative as well. Consider Obama\xe2\x80\x99s reaction when  George Stephanopoulos played a clip of Dick Cheney counseling Obama not to implement his campaign rhetoric until he\xe2\x80\x99s fully briefed on the details of the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s counterterrorism policy.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think that was pretty good advice, which is I should know what\xe2\x80\x99s going on before we make judgments and that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be making judgments on the basis of incomplete information or campaign rhetoric. So I\xe2\x80\x99ve got no quibble with that particular quote,\xe2\x80\x9d said Obama. Usually, presidents pretend their campaign positions are more than \xe2\x80\x9ccampaign rhetoric.\xe2\x80\x9d Not Obama.'b'Obama did note that he differs with Cheney on \xe2\x80\x9csome things that we know happened,\xe2\x80\x9d including waterboarding. And he did reiterate his pledge to close Guant\xc3\xa1namo. But he warned that it was \xe2\x80\x9cmore difficult than I think a lot of people realize,\xe2\x80\x9d explaining that while he was committed to the rule of law, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t interested \xe2\x80\x9cin releasing people who are intent on blowing us up.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And at one point he returned, unbidden, to the much-maligned vice president, commenting, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought that Dick Cheney\xe2\x80\x99s advice was good.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Perhaps the president-elect was just being polite. Or perhaps he just enjoys torturing (metaphorically!) some of his previously most ardent supporters who want Dick Cheney tried as a war criminal.'b'In fact, Stephanopoulos asked about that. He pointed to  a popular question on Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Web site about  whether he\xe2\x80\x99ll appoint a special prosecutor to investigate \xe2\x80\x9cthe greatest crimes of the Bush administration, including torture and warrantless wiretapping.\xe2\x80\x9d Obama stipulated that no one should be above the law. But he praised C.I.A.  employees,  and said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want them \xe2\x80\x9clooking over their shoulders and lawyering.\xe2\x80\x9d He took the general view \xe2\x80\x9cthat when it comes to national security, what we have to focus on is getting things right in the future, as opposed to looking at what we got wrong in the past.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'With respect to the Middle East, Obama didn\xe2\x80\x99t even say we\xe2\x80\x99d gotten much wrong in the past. Asked by Stephanopoulos whether his policy would build on Bush\xe2\x80\x99s or would be a clean break, Obama answered, \xe2\x80\x9cif you look not just at the Bush administration, but also what happened under the Clinton administration, you are seeing the general outlines of an approach.\xe2\x80\x9d So: No break.'b'Meanwhile, the Obama transition team\xe2\x80\x99s chief national security spokeswoman, Brooke Anderson, was denying a press report that Obama\xe2\x80\x99s advisers were urging him to initiate low-level or clandestine contacts with Hamas as a prelude to change in policy. Anderson told The Jerusalem Post that the story wasn\xe2\x80\x99t accurate, and reminded one and all that Obama \xe2\x80\x9chas repeatedly stated that he believes that Hamas is a terrorist organization dedicated to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s destruction, and that we should not deal with them until they recognize Israel, renounce violence and abide by past agreements.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'On Iran,  Obama did say he\xe2\x80\x99d be taking \xe2\x80\x9ca new approach,\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cengagement is the place to start\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9ca new emphasis on being willing to talk.\xe2\x80\x9d But he also reminded Stephanopoulos that the Iranian regime is exporting terrorism through Hamas and Hezbollah and is \xe2\x80\x9cpursuing a nuclear weapon that could potentially trigger a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.\xe2\x80\x9d He said his willingness to talk would be combined with \xe2\x80\x9cclarity about what our bottom lines are\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 one of them presumably being, as he\xe2\x80\x99s said before, no Iranian nuclear weapons.

That will also (unfortunately) fail to deter Iran. \xe2\x80\x9cEngagement is the place to start,\xe2\x80\x9d Obama said, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not likely to be the place Obama ends. He\xe2\x80\x99ll end up where Bush is \xe2\x80\x94 with the choice of using force or acquiescing to the idea of  a nuclear Iran.'b'And he\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be calling Dick Cheney for advice.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cPlan to Jump-Start Economy With No Instruction Manual\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 10):'b'The Obama stimulus plan includes about $150 billion of tax cuts for individuals and families. Despite the fact that our economic problems are due in large part to a $400 billion-a-year decrease in consumer spending, many Congressional Democrats and economists have criticized this part of the stimulus plan because they think that a large portion of the tax cuts will be saved rather than spent. Consequently, they believe that more direct government spending, rather than tax cuts, will provide a better economic stimulus.'b'But there may be a way to increase consumer spending, without incurring the risk that tax cuts will be saved, not spent.

Far more troublesome is the conventional assumption that the recession is a more or less classic business cycle that an infusion of cash through infrastructure projects and tax cuts will turn around. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t, and it won\xe2\x80\x99t be.'b'The current recession is not cyclical; it is structural, and it is unprecedented. During the 1930s, thousands of factories closed. But their buildings and equipment remained in place and intact, and they could be reactivated to meet World War II mobilization needs. That model no longer exists.'b'Most of the thousands of manufacturing facilities that closed since World War II closed for good. Their equipment was crated and shipped overseas; their buildings are boarded up, their workers laid off. These factories didn\xe2\x80\x99t close because of a cyclical shortfall in demand but because they lost their markets to imports.'b'No fiscal stimulus can possibly match the benefits of using low-wage overseas labor for such production. Thus, the hollowed-out manufacturing sector will not be able to create the advertised millions of new jobs. I believe that this structural issue looms larger than who gets what tax cuts.'b'S.

Instead of bailouts, the government should insist that banks start lending again. This can be accomplished with government guarantee of the loans. Such guarantees would be for both the housing and automobile industries.'b'In addition, first-time buyers of houses should get a $10,000 rebate from the government, and those buying hybrid vehicles a $5,000 rebate.

And he has made it clear that he is aware of the minefields that accompany mammoth long-term deficits.'b'At some point, however, someone is going to have to talk about raising revenue. The dreaded T-word is going to come up:  'b'taxes'b'.'b'Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea floating around that takes its cue from the legendary Willie Sutton. Why not go where the money is?'b'The economist Dean Baker is a strong advocate of a financial transactions tax. This would impose a small fee  \xe2\x80\x94  ranging up to, say, 0.25 percent  \xe2\x80\x94  on the sale or transfer of stocks, bonds and other financial assets, including the seemingly endless variety of exotic financial instruments that have been in the news so much lately.'b'According to Mr. Baker, the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, the fees would raise a ton of money, perhaps $100 billion or more annually  \xe2\x80\x94  money that the government sorely needs.'b'But there\xe2\x80\x99s another intriguing element to the proposal. While the fees would be a trivial expense for what the general public tends to think of as ordinary traders  \xe2\x80\x94  people investing in stocks, bonds or other assets for some reasonable period of time  \xe2\x80\x94  they would amount to a much heavier lift for speculators, the folks who bring a manic quality to the markets, who treat it like a casino.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt raises money in a way that comes primarily at the expense of speculation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Baker. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fees would be a considerable expense for someone who is buying futures, or a stock, or any asset at 2 o\xe2\x80\x99clock and then selling it at 3. The more you trade, the more you pay.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor the typical person holding stock, who is planning to hold it for a long period of time, paying the quarter of one percent on a trade is just not that big a deal.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The fees, though small, could amount to a big deal for speculators because in addition to the volume of their trades they often make their money on very small margins. Someone who buys an asset and then sells it an hour later at a one percent appreciation might feel quite pleased. He or she would be less pleased at having to pay a quarter-percent fee to purchase the asset in the first place and then another quarter percent to sell it.'b'This, according to Mr. Baker, is part of the beauty of the transfer tax; it tends to curb at least some speculation. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very progressive tax,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat discourages nonproductive activity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A hallmark of the Bush years has been the rampant irresponsibility  \xe2\x80\x94  by the White House, Congress and the general public  \xe2\x80\x94  when it comes to matters of finance. The costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were placed on credit cards and off the books. Their ultimate overall costs will be in the trillions.'b'Incredibly, President Bush and Congress  'b'cut'b'  taxes in wartime, which is insane.'b'Budget deficits and the national debt are streaking toward the moon. And the only remedy anyone has come up with for fending off Great Depression II has been deficit spending on a scale reminiscent of World War II.'b'Excuse me, but did somebody say the baby boomers are about to start retiring?'b'Maybe the piper will never have to be paid. Maybe the deficits will someday magically right themselves. Maybe some prosperous future generation will be more than happy to clean up the mess we left behind.'b'If none of that is true, we should start looking now for some real money somewhere. A stock transfer tax is not a bad place to start.'b'Every holiday season, after getting our fill of  egg nog, my family and I enjoy a tradition of watching one of our favorite movies: \xe2\x80\x9cA Few Good Men,\xe2\x80\x9d starring Jack Nicholson, Kevin Bacon, Tom Cruise and Demi Moore.

Putting it on calls upon the honor of baseball\xe2\x80\x99s past, as if within its fabric is the spirit of everyone who has contributed to the team\xe2\x80\x99s cause. The longer you wear it, the harder it is to stop wearing it. It is as if it seeps into your soul.'b'One of my favorite mentors in baseball was Shawon Dunston (a Brooklyn native, by the way). A shortstop who was known in high school for his rocket arm and his .700 batting average, Shawon played at the major league level for 18 years. And he often repeated to me this one indispensable piece of advice: \xe2\x80\x9cNever give the uniform back. Let them rip it off of your body.\xe2\x80\x9d Once you give it back, he insisted, it will never be the same, and neither will you.'b'All of us, no matter what dream we pursue, hope for a storybook walk into the sunset, where we end our journey on our own terms. Imagine, for instance, what that might mean for a ballplayer: the magic of winning a World Series in your final season and heading home to a ticker-tape parade.'b'But for most players, that is not the ending at all. You either have to turn in the sacred uniform after floundering at some point \xe2\x80\x94 as I found out first-hand from Joe Torre and Brian Cashman after getting my Yankee spring training pink slip \xe2\x80\x94 or the door seems to arbitrarily slam in your face, \xe2\x80\x9cpast due\xe2\x80\x9d is stamped on your career and you reluctantly walk away. Either way, it rarely feels like it\xe2\x80\x99s happening on your own terms.'b'Even the gift of longevity in professional sports brings a burden. Each year that you survive and earn the right to wear the uniform for another season, you find it harder to define yourself without it. It begins to feel that you are wearing the uniform 24 hours a day.'b'Our uniform is our patch on the arm, a badge that becomes our ticket to social acceptance, fame, financial security (maybe) and admission to an elite club of \xe2\x80\x9csuccess.\xe2\x80\x9d But it\xe2\x80\x99s also a ticket into the theater of self-doubt. A doubt that turns most players into awkward Clark Kents without their Superman costumes. Or Col. Jessup in his \xe2\x80\x9ccivvies.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Because with that uniform comes the responsibility of representing cities, towns, family names, team legacies and even your own childhood hopes. And all that can confuse your sense of where the uniform ends and your real self begins.'b'I remember walking into the locker room at my first major league spring training and seeing my jersey hanging next to that of future Hall of Famer Ryne Sandberg. I knew something had changed. It was no longer about promoting high school or college pride; I was about to wear baseball history on my sleeve, and that was not for the faint of heart. The moment I put on that uniform, I was Doug Glanville the Ballplayer. That became the quickest and most direct way to describe who I was and who everyone would want to be if they were in my shoes.'b'For the most part, players embrace being \xe2\x80\x9cthe ballplayer.\xe2\x80\x9d This label allows you to be what you always dreamed of being. The wait is over \xe2\x80\x94 you get V.I.P. treatment. You can even stop working on the side of you that isn\xe2\x80\x99t a ballplayer, just as long as you are wearing that uniform \xe2\x80\x94 and that can be addictive. You might resist becoming wholly defined as a ballplayer by laying claim to more than that \xe2\x80\x94 father, artist, neighbor \xe2\x80\x94 but such attempts are often hollow. After a while, it is just easier to accept it. After all, it\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful dream of many people that we are living \xe2\x80\x94 including our own.'b'I began playing baseball from the moment I could hold a ball. And when I finally took off the uniform, I had played 15 years in the pros. I had essentially played baseball my entire life. I was fortunate to be able to study engineering and do other things along the way, but I wore the uniform the whole time. I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised I didn\xe2\x80\x99t find pinstripes on my body when I jumped in the shower after I retired.'b'In the end, I had to find honor outside the game  \xe2\x80\x94 or, more specifically, outside the uniform \xe2\x80\x94  and I had to find it in areas where I\xe2\x80\x99d had little exposure. I had to learn how to get access to opportunities without the sex appeal of being a \xe2\x80\x9ccurrent player,\xe2\x80\x9d without great tickets to offer, without hot information about the workings of the locker room, without the ability to invite someone into the inner circle of the famous. I could no longer just flash my \xe2\x80\x9cbadge\xe2\x80\x9d and watch the rest unfold automatically.'b'It takes a lot of introspection to avoid this Superman effect, of feeling heroic and powerful in uniform and ungainly and lost outside of it. Often it is more comfortable to just keep finding ways to wear the uniform, by playing for as long as your body, mind and soul will allow, or by remaining close to the game (and in uniform) as a coach or manager. Players all share a love for the game, so why not stay on for as long as possible?'b'Eventually, many players find honor outside of the uniform \xe2\x80\x94 even as their game-winning hits and diving catches on ESPN fade to memories. But it takes a lot of work. I had to fight for it and to trust it. I had to understand that the things that made me excel in a professional baseball uniform could help me in other environments, too. But it takes time to truly understand that while there is a history and a legacy behind every baseball uniform, each player who wears it adds something to that history \xe2\x80\x94 something that was there inside them long before they ever put on a uniform. And that this same \xe2\x80\x9csomething\xe2\x80\x9d can be found again when the uniform is put away.'b'So I carry on, as many do, without the pinstripes or the M.L.B. logo on my hat. Lt. Kaffee was on point: you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to wear a patch on your arm to have honor. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he really understood how hard it could be, or how long it might take, to really feel it to your core. If ever.'b'William D.

Those two men were in a separate fraternity and could talk directly about things the rest avoided.'b'Neuhaus was no stranger to death. As a young minister, he worked in the death ward at Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, a giant room with 50 to 100 dying people in it, where he would accompany two or three to their deaths each day. One sufferer noticed an expression on Neuhaus\xe2\x80\x99s face and said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d and then sagged back and expired.'b'Much later, Neuhaus endured his own near-death experience. An undiagnosed tumor led to a ruptured intestine and a series of operations. He recovered slowly, first in intensive care, and then in a regular hospital room, where something strange happened.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was sitting up staring intently into the darkness, although in fact I knew my body was lying flat,\xe2\x80\x9d he later wrote in an essay called \xe2\x80\x9cBorn Toward Dying\xe2\x80\x9d in his magazine, First Things. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I was staring at was a color like blue and purple, and vaguely in the form of hanging drapery. By the drapery were two \xe2\x80\x98presences.\xe2\x80\x99 I saw them and yet did not see them, and I cannot explain that ... .'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then the presences \xe2\x80\x94 one or both of them, I do not know \xe2\x80\x94 spoke. This I heard clearly. Not in an ordinary way, for I cannot remember anything about the voice. But the message was beyond mistaking: \xe2\x80\x98Everything is ready now.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That was the end of Neuhaus\xe2\x80\x99s vision, but not his experience. \xe2\x80\x9cI pinched myself hard, and ran through the multiplication tables, and recalled the birth dates of my seven brothers and sisters, and my wits were vibrantly about me. The whole thing had lasted three or four minutes, maybe less. I resolved at that moment that I would never, never let anything dissuade me from the reality of what had happened. Knowing myself, I expected I would later be inclined to doubt it. It was an experience as real, as powerfully confirmed by the senses, as anything I have ever known.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Most scientists today would say that Neuhaus\xe2\x80\x99s vision was the product of him confusing an inner voice for an outer voice. He was suffering the sort of mental illusion that sometimes befalls epileptics before a seizure.'b'Neuhaus took it the other way. While most people might use the science of life to demystify death, Neuhaus used death to mystify life.'b'When he wrote about his experience later, his great theme was the way death has a backward influence back onto life: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are born to die. Not that death is the purpose of our being born, but we are born toward death, and in each of our lives the work of dying is already under way.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Neuhaus spent the next days, months and years impressed by the overwhelming fact of death. This made him, he writes, a bit blubbery. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter some time, I could shuffle the few blocks to the church and say Mass. At the altar, I cried a lot and hoped the people didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice. To think that I\xe2\x80\x99m really here after all, I thought, at the altar, at the axis mundi, the center of life. And of death.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It also made him almost indifferent about when his life would end. People would tell him to fight for life and he would enjoy their attention, but the matter wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really in his hands, and everything was ready anyway.'b'He quoted John Donne who also was  changed by a near-death experience: \xe2\x80\x9cThough I may have seniors, others may be elder than I, yet I have proceeded apace in a good university, and gone a great way in a little time, by the furtherance of a vehement fever.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Cancer returned, and Neuhaus died last week. In his final column for First Things, he wrote again about his mortality.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBe assured that I neither fear to die nor refuse to live. If it is to die, all that has been is but a slight intimation of what is to be. If it is to live, there is much I hope to do in the interim.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This awareness of death, and of the intermingling of life and death, gave Neuhaus\xe2\x80\x99s writing an extra dimension  \xe2\x80\x94 like a metaphysician who has been writing about nature within earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere and suddenly discovers space.'b'So perhaps the Rainbow Room, high above Rockefeller Center, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been what it used to be when it was a beacon of glamour. Perhaps, for at least the last decade, there has been something entirely ersatz about the experience of dining there \xe2\x80\x94 all but the prices, which were very real. But now it looks as though the Rainbow Room may be nothing at all \xe2\x80\x94  no dancing, no dining, and no Ciprianis, the family that has run it since 1998.'b'If this were a ground-floor establishment \xe2\x80\x94 and the Ciprianis were a ground-floor empire \xe2\x80\x94 someone would have slapped a \xe2\x80\x9cLost Our Lease\xe2\x80\x9d sticker across the front window. Tishman Speyer Properties, the landlord, wants the Ciprianis out for failure to pay rent. Meanwhile, the family claims that this is just another scene in a long-running feud, in which they are the victims.'b'The Ciprianis were bound to feel the recession. Their restaurants are some of the most expensive on the planet. And Tishman Speyer was bound to feel it, too, since the rent they were asking for the Rainbow Room was $6 million a year, knocked down by an arbitrator from $8.7 million.'b'Losing the Rainbow Room would mean losing a landmark, a place that mattered not only to tourists and high rollers but to anyone who was lucky to enjoy some of the excellent American chefs who passed through its kitchen at one time or another. We hope that it finds a way to survive. Imagining Rockefeller Center without the Rainbow Room is like imagining it without the annual Christmas tree \xe2\x80\x94 if a visit to that Christmas tree happened to be an incredibly expensive night on the town.'b'New York Democrats have been trumpeting the need for reform in state government for decades. Only one thing stood in their way, they argued: they needed control of lawmaking in Albany.'b'Now they have that control \xe2\x80\x94 a Democratic governor plus Democratic majorities in both branches of the State Legislature. And, guess what? Instead of reform, Democrats are promising something called the \xe2\x80\x9cpath to reform.\xe2\x80\x9d In other words, once again, the real thing is somewhere down the road and still out of reach.'b'Democrats in the State Senate get some elbow room here. They are still a little disorganized since taking over a few days ago after more than 40 years in the minority. And they do get a little credit for new rules that move slightly in the right direction. These rules will allow any senator to attach his or her name to a bill \xe2\x80\x94 previously, members of the majority party (the Republicans) could bump any member of the minority (the Democrats) as a sponsor.'b'In addition, votes in the Senate will be more public than in the past. The Republican majority was adept at hiding the most important procedural decisions.'b'But much of the real reform in the Senate has been put off for a whole year. Instead of sweeping out secretive and unfair practices once and for all, the new Democratic majority has formed a committee to decide on new rules by 2010.'b'Good government groups in Albany rightly argue that it should not take this committee one whole year to write better rules. Why not a couple of months or by the end of the fiscal year on March 31?'b'Maybe Senate Democrats are taking their cue from Gov. David Paterson, who was one of the most ardent voices for reform in Albany until he took over the state\xe2\x80\x99s top job. At the recent State of the State speech, he did not even mention reform as one of the goals of his administration. As Blair Horner, legislative expert for the New York Public Interest Research Group, put it: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Senate is at least talking about a path to reform. The governor is headed into a cul de sac.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'New York Democrats still have the chance to earn the public\xe2\x80\x99s respect for airing out the State Capitol. Or, they can earn our censure by trying to paste a reform label on business as usual.'b'A scene from the last days of the Bush administration: On a snowy afternoon last weekend, a church in New York City is filled to bursting with more than 1,000 people. Parents holding babies, teenagers, old men and women with heavy coats and canes. They murmur and shout in prayer, a keyboard and guitar carrying their voices to the height of the vaulted ceiling.'b'The music has a deafening buoyancy, but as congregants step forward to speak, their testimony is heavy with foreboding and sorrow. They tell of families terrorized and split apart.'b'A young woman from Pakistan describes humiliating conditions at a detention center in Elizabeth, N.J., where she was sent with her mother and ailing father. A mother tells of her son, an Army sergeant and citizen, losing his wife to deportation. A Mexican man, with theatrical defiance, waves a shoe at the unnamed forces that have thwarted his desire to legalize.'b'It is hard to appear sinister in a church, and the congregation at Iglesia La Sinagoga, a center of Pentecostalism on 125th Street in East Harlem, seemed utterly ordinary. But as undocumented immigrants and their loved ones, they are the main targets of the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s immigration war.'b'Families like theirs have endured a relentless campaign of intimidation and expulsion, organized at the top levels of the federal government and haphazardly delegated to state and local governments.'b'The campaign has been disproportionate and cruel. The evidence is everywhere.'b'On Monday, The Times reported that federal immigration prosecutions had soared in the last five years, overloading federal courts with misdemeanor cases of illegal border crossers, who are tried and sentenced in groups of 40 to 60 for efficiency. At the same time, prosecutions for weapons, organized crime, public corruption and drugs have plummeted. The Arizona attorney general called the situation \xe2\x80\x9ca national abdication by the Justice Department.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And last week, Attorney General Michael Mukasey, in an appalling last-minute ruling, declared that immigrants do not have the constitutional right to a lawyer in a deportation hearing and thus have no right to appeal on the grounds of bad legal representation. Mr. Mukasey overturned a decades-old practice designed to ensure robust constitutional protection for immigrants \xe2\x80\x94 one needed now more than ever in the days of the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s assembly-line prosecutions.'b'The event at the Pentecostal church was organized by local ministers and Democratic politicians to spur the cause of immigration reform this year.'b'It could be a difficult case to make. We heard far too little about the need for immigration reform from President-elect Barack Obama during the general election \xe2\x80\x94 and virtually nothing from the nation\xe2\x80\x99s leaders since then. But the United States cannot afford to put immigration on a back burner and merely continue with the existing enforcement regime. The costs are too high for the country\xe2\x80\x99s values. And they are too high for the economy.'b'Defending immigrants\xe2\x80\x99 rights defends standards in all workplaces. Workers who are terrorized into submission, in families that are destroyed by deportation and raids, are more likely to undercut other workers by tolerating low pay and miserable job conditions.'b'Restoring proportionality and good sense to the criminal justice system also would free up resources for fighting serious crimes. Most important, repairing a system warped by political priorities into hunting down and punishing the wrong people \xe2\x80\x94 like those bringing their suffering to a Pentecostal church \xe2\x80\x94 would help restore a sense of what the country stands for, and remind us of who we are.'b'Despite rising concern that conflicts of interest may bias the outcome of clinical trials, the Food and Drug Administration has distressingly limited interest in rooting out the problem.'b'The inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services reviewed all 118 applications for marketing drugs and medical devices that were approved by the F.D.A. in fiscal year 2007. It found appalling failures to collect information and act on it.'b'The makers of drugs or medical devices are required to obtain financial information from the scientists conducting clinical trials before the trials start, consult with the F.D.A. to resolve serious conflicts and submit all the financial information to the F.D.A. when they apply for marketing approval after the trials end. The agency is supposed to evaluate whether any conflicts that are uncovered undermine the reliability of the trial data, and if so, how tainted data should be handled.'b'The inspector general found that fewer than 1 percent of the doctors who helped oversee clinical trials reported any financial conflicts \xe2\x80\x94 such as consulting payments, honoraria, grants, patents or stock options \xe2\x80\x94 that might influence their studies. That number seems unbelievably low given credible estimates that one-fifth to one-third of all doctors have such conflicts.'b'In 42 percent of the approved marketing applications, the agency did not receive all the required financial information, mostly because the sponsoring companies took advantage of a loophole that allowed them to say they had tried with due diligence to get the information from clinical investigators but were unable to. Even when the doctors did report significant conflicts to the companies, in 20 percent of the cases neither the F.D.A. nor the companies took action to minimize potential bias.'b'The inspector general made several suggestions, including stressing that the due diligence exemption should be used rarely. The agency accepted most, but it strongly opposed a recommendation that it require companies to submit financial conflict information before a clinical trial is started, not after it is completed. The F.D.A. complained that that would increase its workload for no clear gain, especially since many drugs or devices that enter clinical trials never reach the market.'b'Such bureaucratic excuses seem lame. Surely it would be better for the F.D.A. to eliminate potential conflicts before they can bias a trial than try to mitigate them after the results are in.'b'The agency\xe2\x80\x99s lax performance underscores the need for Congress to pass legislation requiring all drug and device makers to report their financial arrangements with doctors in a public databank. That would make it harder for clinical investigators or sponsoring companies to hide potential conflicts, including those that might bias clinical trials for the F.D.A.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cMoving Forward in Hard Times\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 8):'b'Gov.

What is to stop angry Palestinians from launching rockets against Israel? And what is to stop angry Israelis from retaliating just as they are doing now, guaranteeing a perpetual cycle of violence?'b'Rocket attacks against faceless civilians, and devastating military action against a neighbor, are possible only because each group is able to classify the other as precisely that: \xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore subhuman.'b'The solution is obvious, even if it is difficult for some to imagine: Jews and Arabs need to live side by side and interact with one another as equal human beings every day.'b'I hope that President-elect Barack Obama will extend his eloquent advocacy of understanding and reconciliation among Americans of different racial backgrounds to advocacy of a one-state solution in Israel/Palestine, with equal justice for all its citizens.'b'Saleem Nicola'b'\nHarrison, N.Y., Jan.'b'\n13, 2009'b''b''b'\xc2\x95'b'To the Editor:'b'Three related elements define Israel\xe2\x80\x99s self-identity: being a Jewish state; being a people victimized in the Holocaust; and, being small, actually, tiny in comparison to the Arab world around it.

Mr. Rayyan, who was a  member of the Hamas ruling elite, and an important recruiter of suicide bombers until Israel killed him two weeks ago (along with several of his wives and children), arrived late to our meeting from parts unknown.'b'He was watchful for assassins even then, and when I asked him to describe his typical day, he suggested that I might be a spy for Fatah. Not the Mossad, mind you, not the C.I.A., but Fatah.'b'What a phantasmagorically strange conflict the Arab-Israeli war had become! Here was a Saudi-educated, anti-Shiite (but nevertheless Iranian-backed) Hamas theologian accusing a one-time Israeli Army prison official-turned-reporter of spying for Yasir Arafat\xe2\x80\x99s Fatah, an organization that had once been the foremost innovator of anti-Israeli terrorism but was now, in Mr. Rayyan\xe2\x80\x99s view, indefensibly, unforgivably moderate.'b'In the Palestinian civil war, Fatah, which today controls much of the West Bank and is engaged in intermittent negotiations with Israel, had become Mr. Rayyan\xe2\x80\x99s  direst enemy, a party of apostates and quislings. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst we must deal with the Muslims who speak of a peace process and then we will deal with you,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared.'b'But we spoke that day mainly about the hadith, the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, that specifically concerned Jews and their diverse and apparently limitless character failings. This sort of conversation, while illuminating, can become wearying over time, at least for the Jewish participant, and so I was happy to learn that Mr. Rayyan had his own sore points.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHezbollah is doing very well against Israel, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. His face darkened, suggesting that he understood the implication of my question. At the time, Hamas, too, was firing rockets into Israel, though irregularly and without much effect.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe support our brothers in the resistance,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. But then he added, \xe2\x80\x9cI think each situation is different.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'How so?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey have advantages that we in Gaza don\xe2\x80\x99t have,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have excellent weapons. Hezbollah moves freely in Lebanon. We are trapped in the Israeli cage. So I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to hear the sentence, \xe2\x80\x98Hezbollah is the leader of the resistance.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s a very annoying sentence. They are heroes to us. But we are the ones fighting in Palestine.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they\xe2\x80\x99re Shia,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. Mr. Rayyan, who was educated by Wahhabi clerics in Saudi Arabia, was known in Gaza as a firm defender of Sunni theology and privilege, and sometimes lectured at the Islamic University of Gaza on the danger of Shiite \xe2\x80\x9cinfiltration.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes! There are many different secret agendas,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to be aware of this.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Hamas men across Gaza were of two minds on the subject of Hezbollah: One night, I met the members of a Hamas rocket team in the town of Beit Hanoun, on Gaza\xe2\x80\x99s northern border with Israel. The group\xe2\x80\x99s leader, who went by the name of Abu Obeidah, said that he, too, was frustrated by Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s success against Israel; he even asked if Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s rocket attacks that summer were featured on television in America, and seemed to deflate physically  when I told him no.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone, all the media, says that Hezbollah is wonderful,\xe2\x80\x9d he complained. \xe2\x80\x9cWe stand with our brothers of Hezbollah, of course, but, really, look at the advantages they have. They get all the rockets they will ever need from Iran.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Hamas is not a monolith, and opinions inside the group differ about many things, including engagement with the Shiites  of Hezbollah and Iran. The former Hamas leader Abdel Aziz Rantisi told me shortly before he was assassinated by Israel in 2004 that it would be \xe2\x80\x9cuncharitable\xe2\x80\x9d to find fault with Iran.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do the Arab states do for us?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIran is steadfast against the Jews.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Today, there is no doubt that Rantisi\xe2\x80\x99s view holds sway inside the organization, and many in Hamas wish for even closer ties with Tehran, particularly over the past month as they have absorbed a battering from Israel. Even those who believe that Iran is secretly trying to bring Sunni Palestinians to Shiism acknowledge anti-Israel Shiites as ideals of resistance.'b'As the Gaza war moves to a cease-fire, a crucial question will inevitably arise, as it has before: Should Israel (and by extension, the United States) try to engage Hamas in a substantive and sustained manner?'b'It is a fair question, one worth debating, but it is unmoored from certain political and theological realities. One irresistible reality grows from Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s complicated, competitive relationship with Hezbollah. For Hamas, Hezbollah is not only a source of weapons and instruction, it is a mentor and role model.'b'Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s desire to best Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s achievements is natural, of course, but, more to the point, it is radicalizing. One of the reasons, among many, that Hamas felt compelled to break its cease-fire with Israel last month was to prove its potency to Muslims impressed with Hezbollah.'b'Another reality worth considering concerns theology. Hamas and Hezbollah emerged from very different streams of Islam: Hamas is the Palestinian branch of the Sunni Muslim Brotherhood; Hezbollah is an outright Iranian proxy that takes its inspiration from the radical Shiite politics of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. But the groups share a common belief that Jews are a cosmological evil, enemies of  Islam since Muhammad sought refuge in Medina.'b'Periodically, advocates of negotiation suggest that the hostility toward Jews expressed by Hamas is somehow mutable. But in years of listening, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard much to suggest that its anti-Semitism is insincere. Like Hezbollah, Hamas believes that God is opposed to  a Jewish state in Palestine. Both groups are rhetorically pitiless, though, again, Hamas sometimes appears to follow the lead of Hezbollah.'b'I once asked Abdel Aziz Rantisi where he learned what he called \xe2\x80\x9cthe truth\xe2\x80\x9d of the Holocaust \xe2\x80\x94 that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen \xe2\x80\x94 and he referred me to books published by Hezbollah. Hamas and Hezbollah also share the view that the solution for Palestine lies in Europe. A spokesman for Hezbollah, Hassan Izzedine, once told me that the Jews who survive the Muslim \xe2\x80\x9cliberation\xe2\x80\x9d of Palestine \xe2\x80\x9ccan go back to Germany, or wherever they came from.\xe2\x80\x9d He went on to argue that the Jews are a \xe2\x80\x9ccurse to anyone who lives near them.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Nizar Rayyan expressed much the same sentiment the night we spoke in 2006. We had been discussing a passage of the Koran that suggests that God turns a group of impious Jews into apes and pigs. The Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, among others, has deployed this passage in his speeches. Once, at a rally in Beirut, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe shout in the face of the killers of prophets and the descendants of the apes and pigs: We hope we will not see you next year. The shout remains, \xe2\x80\x98Death to Israel!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Rayyan said that, technically, Mr. Nasrallah was mistaken. \xe2\x80\x9cAllah changed disobedient Jews into apes and pigs, it is true, but he specifically said these apes and pigs did not have the ability to reproduce,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Rayyan said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo it is not literally true that Jews today are descended from pigs and apes, but it is true that some of the ancestors of Jews were transformed into pigs and apes, and it is true that Allah continually makes the Jews pay for their crimes in many different ways. They are a cursed people.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I asked him the question I always ask of Hamas leaders: Could you agree to anything more than a tactical cease-fire with Israel? I felt slightly ridiculous asking: A man who believes that God every now and again transforms Jews into pigs and apes might not be the most obvious candidate for  peace talks at Camp David. Mr. Rayyan answered the question as I thought he would, saying that a long-term cease-fire would be unnecessary, because it will not take long for the forces of Islam to eradicate Israel.'b'There is a fixed idea among some Israeli leaders that Hamas can be bombed into moderation. This is a false and dangerous notion. It is true that Hamas can be deterred militarily for a time, but tanks cannot defeat deeply felt belief.'b'The reverse is also true: Hamas cannot be cajoled into moderation. Neither position credits Hamas with sincerity, or seriousness.'b'The only small chance for peace today is the same chance that existed before the Gaza invasion: The moderate Arab states, Europe, the United States and, mainly, Israel, must help Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s enemy, Fatah, prepare the West Bank for real freedom, and then hope that the people of Gaza, vast numbers of whom are unsympathetic to Hamas, see the West Bank as an alternative to the squalid vision of Hassan Nasrallah and Nizar Rayyan.'b'One of America\xe2\x80\x99s greatest strengths is its potential for redemption and renewal. We saw that again Tuesday during Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s confirmation hearing to be President-elect Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s secretary of state.'b'After eight incredibly self-destructive years \xe2\x80\x94 when President Bush bullied and alienated this country\xe2\x80\x99s friends and enabled far too many of its enemies \xe2\x80\x94 Senator Clinton promised a return to a foreign policy based on \xe2\x80\x9cprinciples and pragmatism, not rigid ideology; on facts and evidence, not emotion or prejudice.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To a Congress bitter about the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s arrogant disregard of its opinions and its constitutional powers, she pledged full consultation. Mrs. Clinton also pointedly forswore \xe2\x80\x9cpetty turf wars.\xe2\x80\x9d We, too, recall how Donald Rumsfeld insisted on controlling every aspect of the Iraq war \xe2\x80\x94 and the disastrous cost.'b'At any other time, talk of pragmatism, principle and cooperation might be dismissed as boilerplate. After the last eight years, it is cool water in the desert.'b'Like most cabinet nominees, Mrs. Clinton was short on policy specifics. She affirmed the incoming administration\xe2\x80\x99s intention to increase diplomatic contacts with both Iran and Syria (a major change from the Bush administration and some of her own previous positions). Still, she offered no details on what diplomatic incentives Mr. Obama would offer to try to wean Tehran from its nuclear ambitions; nor did she say what new pressure might be brought to bear should that fail beyond repeating the mantra that no options are off the table.'b'After weeks in which Mr. Obama largely refused to comment on the war in Gaza, Mrs. Clinton struck a different \xe2\x80\x94 and welcome \xe2\x80\x94 tone from the Bush administration, emphasizing the \xe2\x80\x9ctragic humanitarian costs\xe2\x80\x9d of the conflict in which more than 900 Gaza residents and 13 Israelis have died. She declared a firm commitment to an Israeli-Palestinian peace settlement with a two-state solution, but there were no specifics. There is less than a week before Inauguration Day, and until there is a cease-fire, there is no hope of reviving negotiations.'b'The hearing featured the usual senatorial preening with committee members heaping praise on Mrs. Clinton \xe2\x80\x94  and vice versa. We hope the pledges to work together in the national interest have real staying power.'b'Even as he expressed enthusiastic support for Mrs. Clinton, Senator Richard Lugar, the panel\xe2\x80\x99s ranking Republican, raised thoughtful and serious questions about former President Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s charitable activities. The \xe2\x80\x9ccore of the problem,\xe2\x80\x9d he warned, is that foreign governments and others \xe2\x80\x9cmay perceive the Clinton Foundation as a means to gain favor with the secretary of state.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He rightly called for steps to make Mr. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s fund-raising activities more transparent and to strengthen the oversight process that the former president has agreed to.'b'Mrs. Clinton said the current agreement is \xe2\x80\x9cprobably as close as we can get.\xe2\x80\x9d We strongly endorse Mr. Lugar\xe2\x80\x99s point that the Clintons must do everything possible to err on the side of caution. We urge them to take another look at tightening the oversight procedures.'b'Rising above petty turf wars. Coordinating effective approaches to complex issues. Reinvigorating American diplomacy. War as the last resort. Confirmation promises. But after eight years, they are a huge relief.'b'To most people the word \xe2\x80\x9cgeothermal\xe2\x80\x9d means hot springs and geysers \xe2\x80\x94 like parts of Iceland or Yellowstone National Park where water is heated by the presence of magma near the surface of the earth. But the earth\xe2\x80\x99s heat lies below everywhere, and it offers a virtually untapped energy reserve of enormous potential with a very short list of drawbacks.'b'In 2006, a panel led by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology surveyed the prospects for electricity production from enhanced geothermal systems. Its conclusions were conservative but very optimistic. The panel suggested that with modest federal support, geothermal power could play a critical role in America\xe2\x80\x99s energy future, adding substantially to the nation\xe2\x80\x99s store of renewable energy and more than making up for coal-burning power plants that would have to be retired.'b'Following up on the M.I.T. study and a separate survey of its own, the Bureau of Land Management issued a decision last month that would open up as many as 190 million acres to leases for geothermal exploration and development. These lands are mostly in the West, where hot rock lies closer to the surface than it generally does in the East.'b'There is a lot of research yet to be done about geothermal sources, new techniques for deep drilling and energy generation at the surface. But the basics are clear enough. Water is injected deep into the earth where it absorbs heat from the surrounding rock. As the fluid returns to the surface, that heat is used to generate electricity. The fluid is then re-injected. The system forms a closed loop. It creates almost no emissions and is entirely renewable. It also occupies a smaller surface area than either solar or wind power.'b'Still, large-scale commercial production is at least a decade away and will require improvements on currently available technology. Geothermal development also will mean still more competition for scarce water, more holes in the ground and more roads to service those holes.'b'The M.I.T. report\xe2\x80\x99s statement that the success of geothermal production \xe2\x80\x9cwould parallel the development of the U.S. coal-bed methane industry\xe2\x80\x9d is no doubt meant to be reassuring. Yet in parts of the West, coal-bed methane has been an environmental disaster, both for fragile landscapes and the wildlife that depend on them.'b'Geothermal development must not be allowed to foster another drilling free-for-all of the kind we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen during the past decade. Done right, it could help free the country of the grievous environmental burden of coal-burning power plants. Done wrong, it could create grievous environmental problems of its own. Mindful of the dangers, the next administration should commit to developing this extraordinary resource.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re sure that he isn\xe2\x80\x99t enjoying it, but Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico is offering statehouses across the nation a needed lesson in \xe2\x80\x9cpay-to-play\xe2\x80\x9d contamination. Mr. Richardson backed away from the chance to run the Commerce Department as federal prosecutors investigate whether his aides steered a lucrative state contract to a generous political donor.'b'The governor proclaimed his innocence while conceding the inquiry would be too much of a distraction from the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s opening months. (Neither he nor the Obama team explained why the investigation \xe2\x80\x94 which has been going on for months \xe2\x80\x94 is more of a distraction now than when Mr. Richardson was first interviewed for the job.)'b'Pay-to-play is a staple of bad government. Proving an actual quid pro quo that can be prosecuted can be difficult, especially under porous state laws. But appearances \xe2\x80\x94 the fawning recipient, the deep-pocketed donor \xe2\x80\x94 taint all politicians. And pleas of \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ceveryone else does it\xe2\x80\x9d aren\xe2\x80\x99t fit for middle-schoolers let alone elected leaders.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s needed is some courage in statehouses to fix the shoddy campaign-finance rules and laissez-faire lobbying privileges and impose bans on \xe2\x80\x9cfact-finding\xe2\x80\x9d junkets and other \xe2\x80\x9chonest graft\xe2\x80\x9d for legislators. Clear rules would remove any doubt, and any temptation.'b'In Massachusetts, a public integrity task force just issued a sweeping plan to fix the state\xe2\x80\x99s toothless lobbying and conflict-of-interest laws. Sure enough, one state lawmaker, caught up in ethics allegations, is already arguing that the Legislature doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the time, given the ballooning budget deficit \xe2\x80\x94 as if responsible politicians can\xe2\x80\x99t walk and chew gum in the same session.'b'Of course, the most brazen episode of pay-to-play of late is Gov. Rod Blagojevich of Illinois. He is charged with trying to auction off  the United States Senate seat vacated by President-elect Barack Obama. The now-impeached governor wound up arrested, begging for someone to take the seat off his hands for nothing \xe2\x80\x94 with the rest of us shuddering at the spectacle.'b'Complaints about bed bugs in New York City are rising steadily. As any health official can attest, the only good thing about these nighttime pests is that they don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to cause disease. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count panic attacks and the outsize frustration for residents who try to get help from a maze of local and state bureaucracies.'b'There are a lot of agencies that do a little about bed bugs, but nobody that can help with the whole shebang. The city health department has some information. The housing people can come take a look. The state controls the pesticides, although not well enough to advise homeowners what works and who exterminates carefully.'b'Gale Brewer, a member of City Council, has been trying for years to get help for any family under attack. After sleepless nights and days spent covered in calamine  lotion, these exhausted people need a one-stop link or telephone line to guide them, she rightly argues.'b'Until that happens, Ms. Brewer is on a campaign to warn people against bringing home used furniture and clothes. This, of course, goes against a very old New York City tradition \xe2\x80\x94 redecorating the apartment with somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s recycled furniture. Too often, however, that free daybed on the sidewalk brings along a small army that will cost thousands of dollars to defeat.'b'In Boston, officials began giving out fluorescent orange stickers \xe2\x80\x94 with a picture of the dreaded bed bug \xe2\x80\x94 to warn against taking home overstuffed trash. Other cities have established bed bug task forces to help fight invasions in homes, hotels and hospitals.'b'Unfortunately, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has done much on other quality-of-life issues, has not made bed bugs a big deal. We hope Ms. Brewer, other Council members and state lawmakers \xe2\x80\x94 and the mayor \xe2\x80\x94 will press for better training and more rigorous certification of exterminators, more public education about these pests, tougher standards for used furniture and a task force to figure out how to stay ahead of an army that seems to be growing every year.'b'I have only one question about Israel\xe2\x80\x99s military operation in Gaza: What is the goal? Is it the education of Hamas or the eradication of Hamas? I hope that it\xe2\x80\x99s the education of Hamas. Let me explain why.'b'I was one of the few people who argued back in 2006 that Israel actually won the war in Lebanon started by Hezbollah. You need to study that war and its aftermath to understand Gaza and how it is part of a new strategic ballgame in the Arab-Israel arena, which will demand of the Obama team a new approach.'b'What Hezbollah did in 2006  \xe2\x80\x94  in launching an unprovoked war across the U.N.-recognized Israel-Lebanon border, after Israel had unilaterally withdrawn from Lebanon  \xe2\x80\x94  was to both upend Israel\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding peace strategy and to unveil a new phase in the Hezbollah-Iran war strategy against Israel.'b'There have always been two camps in Israel when it comes to the logic of peace, notes Gidi Grinstein, president of the Israeli think tank, the Reut Institute: One camp says that all the problems Israel faces from the Palestinians or Lebanese emanate from occupying their territories. \xe2\x80\x9cTherefore, the fundamental problem is staying \xe2\x80\x94  and the fundamental remedy is leaving,\xe2\x80\x9d says Grinstein.'b'The other camp argues that Israel\xe2\x80\x99s Arab foes are implacably hostile and leaving would only invite more hostility. Therefore, at least when it comes to the Palestinians, Israel needs to control their territories indefinitely. Since the mid-1990s, the first camp has dominated Israeli thinking. This led to the negotiated and unilateral withdrawals from the West Bank, Lebanon and Gaza.'b'Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s unprovoked attack from Lebanon into Israel in 2006 both undermined the argument that withdrawal led to security and presented Israel with a much more vexing military strategy aimed at neutralizing Israel\xe2\x80\x99s military superiority. Hezbollah created a very \xe2\x80\x9cflat\xe2\x80\x9d military network, built on small teams of guerrillas and mobile missile-batteries, deeply embedded in the local towns and villages.'b'And this Hezbollah force, rather than confronting Israel\xe2\x80\x99s Army head-on, focused on demoralizing Israeli civilians with rockets in their homes, challenging Israel to inflict massive civilian casualties in order to hit Hezbollah fighters and, when Israel did strike Hezbollah and also killed civilians, inflaming the Arab-Muslim street, making life very difficult for Arab or European leaders aligned with Israel.'b'Israel\xe2\x80\x99s counterstrategy was to use its Air Force to pummel Hezbollah and, while not directly targeting the Lebanese civilians with whom Hezbollah was intertwined, to inflict substantial property damage and collateral casualties on Lebanon at large. It was not pretty, but it was logical. Israel basically said that when dealing with a nonstate actor, Hezbollah, nested among civilians, the only long-term source of deterrence was to exact enough pain on the civilians  \xe2\x80\x94  the families and employers of the militants  \xe2\x80\x94  to restrain Hezbollah in the future.'b'Israel\xe2\x80\x99s military was not focused on the morning after the war in Lebanon  \xe2\x80\x94  when Hezbollah declared victory and the Israeli press declared defeat. It was focused on 'b'the morning after the morning after'b', when all the real business happens in the Middle East. That\xe2\x80\x99s when Lebanese civilians, in anguish, said to Hezbollah: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat were you thinking? Look what destruction you have visited on your own community! For what? For whom?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s what Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s leader, said the morning after the morning after about his decision to start that war by abducting two Israeli soldiers on July 12, 2006: \xe2\x80\x9cWe did not think, even 1 percent, that the capture would lead to a war at this time and of this magnitude. You ask me, if I had known on July 11 ... that the operation would lead to such a war, would I do it? I say no, absolutely not.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That was the education of Hezbollah. Has Israel seen its last conflict with Hezbollah? I doubt it. But Hezbollah, which has done nothing for Hamas, will think three times next time. That is probably all Israel can achieve with a nonstate actor.'b'In Gaza, I still can\xe2\x80\x99t tell if Israel is trying to eradicate Hamas or trying to \xe2\x80\x9ceducate\xe2\x80\x9d Hamas, by inflicting a heavy death toll on Hamas militants and heavy pain on the Gaza population. If it is out to destroy Hamas, casualties will be horrific and the aftermath could be Somalia-like chaos. If it is out to educate Hamas, Israel may have achieved its aims. Now its focus, and the Obama team\xe2\x80\x99s focus, should be on creating a clear choice for Hamas for the world to see: Are you about destroying Israel or building Gaza?'b'But that requires diplomacy. Israel de facto recognizes Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s right to rule Gaza and to provide for the well-being and security of the people of Gaza  \xe2\x80\x94  which was actually Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s original campaign message, not rocketing Israel.

It is $6 million a year, not $6 million a month.'b'President-elect Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s team reacted predictably to the disclosure that Timothy Geithner, the nominee for Treasury secretary, failed to pay a chunk of his federal taxes over several recent years. The script gets played out, with slight variations, whenever a presidential nominee gets in that kind of trouble.'b'On Tuesday, when Mr. Geithner\xe2\x80\x99s failures were first reported by The Wall Street Journal, the Obama transition office issued a statement calling his underpayment of taxes \xe2\x80\x9chonest mistakes.\xe2\x80\x9d On Wednesday, Mr. Obama himself said it was \xe2\x80\x9cinnocent.\xe2\x80\x9d Those themes have been echoed by several of the senators who will conduct Mr. Geithner\xe2\x80\x99s confirmation hearing, which is now scheduled for next Wednesday.'b'As much as Mr. Obama and his team may wish it, however, the disclosures cannot be dismissed so easily, or papered over. The just-the-facts report of Mr. Geithner\xe2\x80\x99s tax transgressions, compiled and released by the Senate Finance Committee, paints a picture of noncompliance that is considerably more disturbing than his supporters are acknowledging.'b'Mr. Geithner must be questioned forcefully about these matters at the hearing next week, and his explanations must be credible. Even in the best of economic times, it would be hard to accept a Treasury secretary \xe2\x80\x94 who, after all, is in charge of the Internal Revenue Service \xe2\x80\x94 with a cavalier attitude toward paying his taxes. Today, in a time of economic peril, the nation cannot afford a Treasury secretary with a tainted ability to command respect and instill confidence.'b'According to the report, when Mr. Geithner\xe2\x80\x99s tax returns for 2003 and 2004 were audited by the I.R.S. in 2006, the auditors found that he had failed to pay self-employment tax in those years. To make good, he paid the back taxes, plus interest \xe2\x80\x94 $16,732.'b'Obama officials say Mr. Geithner, who worked for the International Monetary Fund, had made a common error among international employees in Washington. But as The Journal reported on Wednesday, failing to pay the self-employment tax is not necessarily common among sophisticated I.M.F employees. Rather, one of the reasons such noncompliance is widespread is that it includes household embassy workers and other lower- level contractors. And regardless, the Finance Committee found that Mr. Geithner had signed paperwork at the I.M.F. that acknowledged his self-employment tax obligation.'b'The story does not stop there. Mr. Geithner also failed to pay the self-employment tax in 2001 and 2002. Those returns, which the report says Mr. Geithner prepared himself, were not audited and so the I.R.S. did not order him to pay up \xe2\x80\x94 which raises the question of why he did not voluntarily amend those returns and pay the taxes and interest at the time of the 2006 audit. Instead, he waited until after vetting by the Obama team late last year revealed the shortfall \xe2\x80\x94 $19,176 in taxes and $6,794 in interest.'b'A similar lapse occurred on another tax issue.  On returns for 2001, 2004 and 2005, Mr. Geithner wrongly claimed expenses for sleep-away camps in calculating his dependent care tax credit. The accountant who prepared his 2006 return informed him that payments to overnight camps were not allowable expenses, but again, he did not file amended returns for the previous years at that time. The report does not break out the taxes and interest on that item alone, but along with other adjustments, Mr. Geithner owed an additional tax of $4,334 and interest of $1,232.'b'Many people find taxes baffling, but before his job at the I.M.F, Mr. Geithner was a senior official in the Treasury Department under President Clinton, and for the past five years he has been the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. With that professional profile, tax transgressions are tough to excuse.'b'Tragically, President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s political corruption of the Justice Department is no longer news. But it was still chilling to read a new report detailing illegal efforts to weaken the department\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement of civil rights laws. Bush administration hacks forced out accomplished career attorneys and packed the department with lawyers selected for their dedication to a right-wing political agenda rather than to enforcing the law.'b'The 67-page report, issued on Tuesday, was the last in a series of internal inquiries into hiring lapses at the Justice Department under former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. It was prepared by two veteran Justice Department watchdogs \xe2\x80\x94 Glenn Fine, the inspector general, and H. Marshall Jarrett, the chief of the Office of Professional Responsibility.'b'The report found that a former senior Justice Department official, Bradley Schlozman, set out to hire so-called \xe2\x80\x9cRight-Thinking Americans,\xe2\x80\x9d including members of the Federalist Society and other Republicans, for what were supposed to be apolitical career positions. He then gave them plum assignments on civil rights cases when he was helping to run the Civil Rights Division, beginning in 2003.'b'The report also concluded that Mr. Schlozman, who left the Justice Department in 2007 amid the uproar over the dismissal of at least eight United States attorneys, which led to Mr. Gonzales\xe2\x80\x99s resignation, gave false statements to Congress when he repeatedly denied factoring politics and ideology into his hiring decisions.'b'The report\xe2\x80\x99s case against Mr. Schlozman relies heavily on his words, from e-mail and phone messages to colleagues and underlings. His disdain for the traditional independence and mission of the Civil Rights Division is palpable. He spoke brazenly about reshaping the division by doing away with \xe2\x80\x9cpinko\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccrazy lib\xe2\x80\x9d lawyers and others he did not consider \xe2\x80\x9creal Americans.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs long as I\xe2\x80\x99m here, adherents of Mao\xe2\x80\x99s Little Red Book need not apply,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote in one e-mail message. The report found that Mr. Schlozman transferred three lawyers out of the division because they were viewed as liberals who opposed his political agenda. The transfers, the report found, violated federal civil service law and \xe2\x80\x9cconstituted misconduct.\xe2\x80\x9d All three lawyers brought federal discrimination claims and returned to the division after Mr. Schlozman\xe2\x80\x99s departure.'b'While he was a senior official in the division, political appointees overruled career lawyers to approve a Texas redistricting law that clearly violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act, as well as a plainly unconstitutional voter identification law in Georgia that amounted to a modernized poll tax.'b'Last week, without explanation, federal prosecutors declined to bring criminal charges against Mr. Schlozman. But the matter should be pursued,  starting in Congress. Lying under oath to Congress, notes Patrick Leahy, the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, is a serious offense that \xe2\x80\x9cundermines the very core of our Constitution principles and blunts the American people\xe2\x80\x99s right to open and transparent government.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It also violates a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s duty. Bar officials in Wichita, where Mr. Schlozman now practices law, cannot ignore his flouting of ethical standards.'b'Mr. Schlozman\xe2\x80\x99s dismal saga contains a timely reminder as the Judiciary Committee opens its hearing Thursday on Eric Holder\xe2\x80\x99s nomination to be the nation\xe2\x80\x99s next attorney general. Beyond any particular legal issue or program, Mr. Holder\xe2\x80\x99s main task, should he be confirmed, will be to restore Americans\xe2\x80\x99 trust in a fair, honest and independent Justice Department, respectful of Congress and the Constitution.'b'The new Yankee Stadium in the Bronx is still months away from the first pitch of Opening Day. But suddenly a lot of people are questioning yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s package deal for this luxurious ballpark in light of today\xe2\x80\x99s struggling economy.'b'Seats for $1,500 a game? Suites fit for the royal family? A scoreboard fit for the Big Board? A fabulous steakhouse and granite ramps (no ordinary cement for this crowd)? This $1 billion-plus pavilion and park financed with a lot of taxpayer help is beginning to sound like something fit for the Wizard of Oz.'b'To pay for many of these add-ons, the Yankees now want \xe2\x80\x94 surprise! \xe2\x80\x94 more help from the city. They have asked the Industrial Development Agency for an additional $400 million in tax-free financing to finish the project. Unless the city\xe2\x80\x99s leaders show some courage, the agency is expected to rubber-stamp that request by the end of the week, after a pro forma hearing on Thursday.'b'Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the development agency should renegotiate this latest round of what has always been an incredibly generous deal for one of the richest teams in the country. At a very minimum, they should insist that the Yankees pick up more of the city\xe2\x80\x99s share of the project, which now amounts to $362 million.'b'About $326 million of that money will pay for demolishing the old stadium, building new infrastructure and replacing 22 acres of city parkland that was  lost to the new stadium.'b'Yankee officials like to say that they are the ones paying to build this stadium, not the city\xe2\x80\x99s taxpayers. That is only partly true. The public has subsidized the project in many ways \xe2\x80\x94 providing generous tax-exempt financing and a variety of other assistance  like rent abatements.'b'Meanwhile, the total $362 million price tag to the city has almost doubled since the project was announced in 2006. And, according to the Independent Budget Office, the price dwarfs the $138 million the city will provide for the Mets\xe2\x80\x99 new stadium across town.'b'Some city contribution to costs for these stadiums makes sense. But the real question is how much New York gets in return on this very hearty investment.'b'The Yankees promise over 6,000 construction jobs. But once their new house is built, there could be as few as 22 full-time, year-round positions.'b'What makes this latest request feel like \xe2\x80\x9cicing on the cake,\xe2\x80\x9d as Assemblyman Richard Brodsky puts it, is that the rest of the city is staring at such hard times and a looming $1.5 billion budget deficit.'b'Mayor Bloomberg has \xe2\x80\x94 rightly \xe2\x80\x94 had to cut city budgets and increase property taxes and explain to residents how times are bad and how we all will have to share the pain. It is time for Mr. Bloomberg to make that same pitch to the Yankees.'b'If the Yankees can sign megamillion-dollar contracts (C. C. Sabathia just landed one for $161 million over seven  years), they should be flush enough to contribute more toward their new stadium and to the parks for people living nearby.'b'Mr. Bloomberg should insist that the Industrial Development Agency postpone consideration of this latest Yankee request and then renegotiate this deal.

Bush bids adieu to the American people.'b'Excitement mounts.'b'The man has been saying goodbye for so long, he\xe2\x80\x99s come to resemble one of those reconstituted rock bands that have been on a farewell tour since 1982. We had exit interviews by the carload and then a final press conference on Monday, in which he reminisced about his arrival on the national stage in 2000. \xe2\x80\x9cJust seemed like yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'I think I speak for the entire nation when I say that the way this transition has been dragging on, even yesterday does not seem like yesterday. And the last time George W. Bush did not factor into our lives feels like around 1066.'b'So far, the Bush farewell appearances have not drawn a lot of rave reviews. (Most striking, perhaps, was a critique of that final press conference from Ted Anthony of The Associated Press: \xe2\x80\x9cIt all felt strangely intimate and, occasionally, uncomfortable, in the manner of seeing a plumber wearing jeans that ride too low.\xe2\x80\x9d) A Gallup poll did find that his approval rating had risen slightly since they began, but this was probably due to enthusiasm for the part about his going away.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes you misunderestimated me,\xe2\x80\x9d Bush told the Washington press corps. This is not the first time our president has worried about misunderestimation, so it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to regard this not as a slip of the tongue, but as something the president of the United States thinks is a word. The rhetoric is the one part of the administration we\xe2\x80\x99re surely going to miss. We are about to enter a world in which our commander in chief speaks in full sentences, and I do not know what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do to divert ourselves on slow days.'b'The White House has promised that in his final address, the president will be joined by a small group of everyday American heroes, which means that the only person on stage with a history of failing to perform well in moments of stress will be the main speaker.'b'Bush is going to devote some of his time to defending his record, although there has been quite a bit of that already. Over the last few weeks we have learned that he thinks the Katrina response worked out rather well except for one unfortunate photo-op, and that he regards the fact that we invaded another country on the basis of false information as a \xe2\x80\x9cdisappointment.\xe2\x80\x9d Since Bush also referred to the disappointments of his White House tenure as \xe2\x80\x9ca minor irritant\xe2\x80\x9d it\xe2\x80\x99s perhaps best to think of the weapons of mass destruction debacle as a pimple on the administration\xe2\x80\x99s otherwise rosy complexion.'b'If there\xe2\x80\x99s any suspense about the speech it is how many times Bush will use the word \xe2\x80\x9cfreedom,\xe2\x80\x9d which popped up 27 times in his relatively brief second inaugural. The man who gave us Operation Iraqi Freedom, the Freedom Agenda, the USA Freedom Corps and the President\xe2\x80\x99s New Freedom Commission on Mental Health has so thoroughly debased one of the most profound concepts in our national vocabulary that it\xe2\x80\x99s getting hard to hear it used without remembering Janis Joplin\xe2\x80\x99s line about how freedom\xe2\x80\x99s just another word for nothing left to lose.'b'There are a lot of ways to approach this farewell-speech business. Ronald Reagan started with winning folksiness, then lurched into a warning against big government and a plea to raise a new generation of patriots that knows \xe2\x80\x9cwho Jimmy Doolittle was.\xe2\x80\x9d Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s sounded very much like a bid for a third term. (\xe2\x80\x9cThirty-five million Americans have used the family leave law ...\xe2\x80\x9d) On the other hand, anybody listening to it now would surely begin to tear up when Clinton got to the part about how he was leaving the country \xe2\x80\x9con track to be debt-free\xe2\x80\x9d by the end of 2009.'b'History does suggest that Bush performs best in venues like this one, in which he has a long lead time and virtually no actual role in preparing the words he is about to say. But still, what could he possibly tell the country that would change anybody\xe2\x80\x99s opinion about the last eight years?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy fellow Americans, before I leave you next week I want you to know that ...'b'A) \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough things have gone very wrong, I take comfort in the realization that Dick Cheney was actually in control from the get-go. Honest, I never even knew half the people in the cabinet.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'B) \xe2\x80\x9cLaura and I have come to realize that all things considered, retirement to a mansion in Texas is just totally inappropriate. And so we take our leave to begin a new life as missionaries at a small rescue station in the Gobi desert ...\xe2\x80\x9d'b'C) \xe2\x80\x9cSurprise! This has all actually been a bad dream. It\xe2\x80\x99s really still November of 2000 and tomorrow Al Gore is going to be elected president.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Otherwise, the best possible approach for a farewell address might be for Bush to follow his father\xe2\x80\x99s lead and just not give one.'b'PHNOM PENH, Cambodia'b'Before Barack Obama and his team act on their talk about \xe2\x80\x9clabor standards,\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99d like to offer them a tour of the vast garbage dump here in Phnom Penh.'b'This is a Dante-like vision of hell. It\xe2\x80\x99s a mountain of festering refuse, a half-hour hike across, emitting clouds of smoke from subterranean fires.'b'The miasma of toxic stink leaves you gasping, breezes batter you with filth, and even the rats look forlorn. Then the smoke parts and you come across a child ambling barefoot, searching for old plastic cups that recyclers will buy for five cents a pound. Many families actually live in shacks on this smoking garbage.'b'Mr. Obama and the Democrats who favor labor standards in trade agreements mean well, for they intend to fight back at oppressive sweatshops abroad. But while it shocks Americans to hear it, the central challenge in the poorest countries is not that sweatshops exploit too many people, but that they don\xe2\x80\x99t exploit enough.'b'Talk to these families in the dump, and a job in a sweatshop is a cherished dream, an escalator out of poverty, the kind of gauzy if probably unrealistic ambition that parents everywhere often have for their children.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d love to get a job in a factory,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pim Srey Rath, a 19-year-old woman scavenging for plastic. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least that work is in the shade. Here is where it\xe2\x80\x99s hot.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Another woman, Vath Sam Oeun, hopes her 10-year-old boy, scavenging beside her, grows up to get a factory job, partly because she has seen other children run over by garbage trucks. Her boy has never been to a doctor or a dentist, and last bathed when he was 2,  so a sweatshop job by comparison would be far more pleasant and less dangerous.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that many Americans are repulsed by the idea of importing products made by barely paid, barely legal workers in dangerous factories. Yet sweatshops are only a symptom of poverty, not a cause, and banning them closes off one route out of poverty. At a time of tremendous economic distress and protectionist pressures, there\xe2\x80\x99s a special danger that  tighter labor standards will be used as an excuse to curb trade.'b'When I defend sweatshops, people always ask me: But would you want to work in a sweatshop? No, of course not. But I would want even less to pull a rickshaw. In the hierarchy of jobs in poor countries, sweltering at a sewing machine isn\xe2\x80\x99t the bottom.'b'My views on sweatshops are shaped by years living in East Asia, watching as living standards soared \xe2\x80\x94 including those in my wife\xe2\x80\x99s ancestral village in southern China \xe2\x80\x94 because of sweatshop jobs.'b'Manufacturing is one sector that can provide millions of jobs. Yet sweatshops usually go not to the poorest nations but to better-off countries with more reliable electricity and ports.'b'I often hear the argument: Labor standards can improve wages and working conditions, without greatly affecting the eventual retail cost of goods. That\xe2\x80\x99s true. But labor standards and \xe2\x80\x9cliving wages\xe2\x80\x9d have a larger impact on production costs that companies are always trying to pare. The result is to push companies to operate more capital-intensive factories in better-off nations like Malaysia, rather than labor-intensive factories in poorer countries like Ghana or Cambodia.'b'Cambodia has, in fact, pursued an interesting experiment by working with factories to establish decent labor standards and wages. It\xe2\x80\x99s a worthwhile idea, but one result of paying above-market wages is that those in charge of hiring often demand bribes \xe2\x80\x94 sometimes a month\xe2\x80\x99s salary \xe2\x80\x94 in exchange for a job. In addition, these standards add to production costs, so some factories have closed because of the global economic crisis and the difficulty of competing internationally.'b'The best way to help people in the poorest countries isn\xe2\x80\x99t to campaign against sweatshops but to promote manufacturing there. One of the best things America could do for Africa would be to strengthen our program to encourage African imports, called AGOA, and nudge Europe to match it.'b'Among people who work in development, many strongly believe (but few dare say very loudly) that one of the best hopes for the poorest countries would be to build their manufacturing industries. But global campaigns against sweatshops make that less likely.'b'Look, I know that Americans have a hard time accepting that sweatshops can help people. But take it from 13-year-old Neuo Chanthou, who earns a bit less than $1 a day scavenging in the dump. She\xe2\x80\x99s wearing a \xe2\x80\x9cPlayboy\xe2\x80\x9d shirt and hat that she found amid the filth, and she worries about her sister, who lost part of her hand when a garbage truck ran over her.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s dirty, hot and smelly here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said wistfully. \xe2\x80\x9cA factory is better.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Eric Holder, President-elect Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s nominee for attorney general, is scheduled to appear today at a confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

A fuller expression of American possibility at a time of American penury is hard to imagine.'b'Obama will then move into the White House, which slaves helped build, facing the worst economic downturn since the 1930s.'b'Reconciliation and transcendence and a reaffirmation of the mythology of American possibility vie with debt, doubt and depression. If they are poised in equal measure, which will prevail?'b'One thing seems certain: The meltdown is going to hang over at least the first 18 months of the Obama presidency. The Treasury is bare. Americans are deluged in debt. Confidence has been Madoffed.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s the realism. But this 47-year-old man of mixed race, whose very name \xe2\x80\x94 O-Ba-Ma \xe2\x80\x94 has the three-syllable universality of a child\xe2\x80\x99s lullaby, has always had something of the providential about him, a global figure who looks more like the guy at the local bodega than the guys on dollar bills. That\xe2\x80\x99s the magic.'b'He needs this magic, which resonates in a voice with the solemn clarity of a bell. Smart power will not be enough. If it were, Americans would have elected Hillary Clinton president.'b'But in their abiding good sense, Americans intuited the imperative to reach beyond smartness for some ineffable quality, capable of unifying and inspiring at a time of national and global division.'b'Inevitably, the nation is looking back to 1932. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have nothing to fear but fear itself,\xe2\x80\x9d Franklin Delano Roosevelt said in his first inaugural, with the economy devastated by the Depression. He also said: \xe2\x80\x9cThis nation asks for action and action now.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Action followed \xe2\x80\x94 a torrent of legislation and speeches in the first 100 days designed to kick-start the country.'b'Obama has been vowing a similar flurry, but has also been talking down expectations, saying things are going to get worse. That may be true, but he has to be careful. An excess of realism will undo him.'b'Two of the greatest weapons he has are language, which he wields better than any recent president, and the bond he has established with the American people. Therein lies the magic. Like fireside-chatting F.D.R., he has to preserve this bond in a direct way or he will fail, because the facts are going to be hard.'b'That task begins with his inaugural speech. After eight arid years under a leader, President George W. Bush, who could not find within himself a solitary phrase to touch the soul, Americans\xe2\x80\x99 thirst to be uplifted is great.'b'Obama has to lay out a vision that goes beyond the war on terror and draws the partners of a re-imagined United States, less powerful but still indispensable, into a shared push for greater prosperity and security.'b'When you\xe2\x80\x99re down, you need friends. Clinton was right to say, \xe2\x80\x9cWe must build a world with more partners and fewer adversaries.\xe2\x80\x9d She might have added, especially in the Muslim world.'b'A good starting point would be the realization that the very barrier-breaking technology that helped America to the zenith of its post-cold-war power has now democratized knowledge in ways the United States cannot control. The world view shaped in the Middle East by Al Jazeera is not amenable to Western logic. It has its own.'b'Wealth has also migrated to an archipelago of new powers, including Brazil, Russia, China, India and the Gulf states.'b'This scattering of power demands a new U.S. humility, but there is still no idea as compelling as the American embodied in Obama\xe2\x80\x99s rise. Only if he can harness the magic of that to new realism can he summon the energy to overcome America\xe2\x80\x99s crisis. Smart power alone cannot usher in the postponed promise of the 21st century.'b'Gandhi, asked what he thought of Western civilization, replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI think it would be a good idea.\xe2\x80\x9d Obama could do worse than place on his new desk the words of another Indian-born man, a novelist of magical realist power, Salman Rushdie: \xe2\x80\x9cThis may be the curse of the human race. Not that we are so different from one another, but that we are so alike.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Once there was just Newtonian physics and the world seemed neat and mechanical. Then quantum physics came along and revealed that deep down things are much weirder than they seem. Something similar is now happening with public policy.'b'Once, classical economics dominated policy thinking. The classical models presumed a certain sort of orderly human makeup. Inside each person, reason rides the passions the way a rider sits atop a horse. Sometimes people do stupid things, but generally the rider makes deliberative decisions, and the market rewards rational behavior.'b'Markets tend toward efficiency. People respond in pretty straightforward ways to incentives. The invisible hand forms a spontaneous, dynamic order. Economic behavior can be accurately predicted through elegant models.'b'This view explains a lot, but not the current financial crisis \xe2\x80\x94 how so many people could be so stupid, incompetent and self-destructive all at once. The crisis has delivered a blow to classical economics and taken a body of psychological work that was at the edge of public policy thought and brought it front and center.'b'In this new body of thought, you get a very different picture of human nature. Reason is not like a rider atop a horse. Instead, each person\xe2\x80\x99s mind contains a panoply of instincts, strategies, intuitions, emotions, memories and habits, which vie for supremacy. An irregular, idiosyncratic and largely unconscious process determines which of these internal players gets to control behavior at any instant. Context \xe2\x80\x94 which stimulus triggers which response \xe2\x80\x94 matters a lot.'b'This mental chaos explains how people can respond so quickly and intuitively to so many different circumstances. But it also entails a decision-making process that is more complicated and messy than previously thought.'b'For example, we don\xe2\x80\x99t perceive circumstances objectively. We pick out those bits of data that make us feel good because they confirm our prejudices. As Andrew Lo of M.I.T. has demonstrated, if stock traders make a series of apparently good picks, the dopamine released into their brains creates a stupor that causes them to underperceive danger ahead.'b'Biases abound. People who\xe2\x80\x99ve been told to think of a high number will subsequently bid much more for an item than people who\xe2\x80\x99ve been told to think of a low number. As Jonah Lehrer writes in his forthcoming book, \xe2\x80\x9cHow We Decide,\xe2\x80\x9d there are certain circumstances (often when there are many options) in which gut instincts lead to the best decisions, while there are other circumstances (sometimes when there are a few options) when calm deliberation is best.'b'Most important, people seek relationships more than money. If behaving a certain way helps a stock trader or a regulator fit in with his crowd, he\xe2\x80\x99s likely to keep doing it without too much rigorous self-examination.'b'A thousand mental shortcomings contributed to the financial meltdown. Republicans have tried to explain it by pointing to irresponsible policies at Fannie Mae. But that only explains a piece of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening.'b'This crisis represents a flaw in the classical economic model and its belief in efficient markets. Republicans haven\xe2\x80\x99t begun to grapple with the consequences.'b'For years, Republicans have been trying to create a large investor class with policies like private Social Security accounts, medical savings accounts and education vouchers. These policies were based on the belief that investors are careful, rational actors who make optimal decisions. There was little allowance made for the frailty of the decision-making process, let alone the mass delusions that led to the current crack-up.'b'Democrats also have an unfaced crisis. Democratic discussions of the stimulus package also rest on a mechanical, dehumanized view of the economy. You pump in a certain amount of money and \xe2\x80\x9cthe economy\xe2\x80\x9d spits out a certain number of jobs. Democratic economists issue highly specific accounts of multiplier effects \xe2\x80\x94 whether a dollar of spending creates $1.20 or $1.40 of economic activity.'b'But an economy is a society of trust and faith. A recession is a mental event, and every recession has its own unique spirit. This recession was caused by deep imbalances and is propelled by a cascade of fundamental insecurities. You can pump hundreds of billions into the banks, but insecure bankers still won\xe2\x80\x99t lend. You can run up gigantic deficits, hire road builders and reduce the unemployment rate from 8 percent to 7 percent, but insecure people will still not spend and invest.'b'The economic spirit of a people cannot be manipulated in as simple-minded a fashion as the Keynesian mechanists imagine. Right now political and economic confidence levels are running in opposite directions. Politically, we\xe2\x80\x99re in a season of optimism, but despite a trillion spent and a trillion more about to be, the economic spirit cowers.'b'Mechanistic thinkers on the right and left pose as rigorous empiricists. But empiricism built on an inaccurate view of human nature is just a prison.'b'We agree that Israel had to defend itself against Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s rocket attacks. But we fear the assault on Gaza has passed the point of diminishing returns. It is time for a cease-fire with Hamas and a return to the peace negotiations that are the only real hope for guaranteeing Israel\xe2\x80\x99s long-term security.'b'We are encouraged that a cease-fire finally seems to be gaining traction. Although not much detail is known, reports have focused on an Egyptian proposal for a phased-in truce, followed by a pullout of Israeli forces and the reopening of border crossings to ease the economic blockade of Gaza.'b'The sudden diplomatic activity came as Israel unleashed its heaviest shelling of Gaza neighborhoods, including a hit on a United Nations compound where hundreds of Palestinians had taken shelter.'b'Israeli officials acknowledge that the 20-day offensive has not permanently crippled Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s military wing or ended its ability to launch rocket attacks. It is unlikely that Israel can achieve those aims militarily any time soon. The cost in human life and anti-Israeli fury would be enormous. Already more than 1,000 Palestinians have died in the densely populated Gaza Strip, where an always miserable life has become unbearable. Thirteen Israelis have died.'b'We also fear that the war is further weakening the palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and his Fatah faction \xe2\x80\x94 Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s sworn enemy. We know Mr. Abbas\xe2\x80\x99s limitations, but he believes in a two-state solution. If there is going to be a negotiated peace, he is the best hope.'b'As part of a cease-fire deal, Israel is right to demand a permanent halt to Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s rocket fire. Israel is also right not to rely on Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s promises. Hamas used the last cease-fire to restock its arsenal with weapons ferried in through tunnels dug under the Egypt-Gaza border.'b'The best protection would be to place monitors on the Egypt-Gaza border to stop the smuggling that is Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s lifeline. The Israelis also must be ready to ease their blockade of Gaza to allow more food and normal economic activity.'b'The Israeli foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, is expected in Washington on Friday where she will sign a hastily arranged deal to accept United States equipment and technical assistance to help monitor the Israeli-Gaza border.'b'American and Israeli officials say that Israel would never accept a cease-fire without that help and both are eager to heap praise on Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice for making it happen. But Washington could have provided that assistance years ago \xe2\x80\x94 just as it should have been pressing harder on every aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.'b'President-elect Barack Obama says he will work for a peace deal from Day 1. We hope Israel picks a new leader in elections next month who is truly committed to a two-state solution. With the support of the new American president, he or she must make an early downpayment on peace by ending settlement construction, cooperating seriously with Mr. Abbas and improving the lives of all Palestinians in the West Bank and in Gaza.'b'With a lamentable 5-to-4 ruling on Wednesday, the Supreme Court carved a new exception to the nearly century-old exclusionary rule, which forbids prosecutors from using evidence obtained by the police as the result of an improper search. The result was a meaningful dilution of Americans\xe2\x80\x99 Fourth Amendment protections and one more instance of the court\xe2\x80\x99s conservative majority upsetting precedent without admitting that it is doing so.'b'The case centered on the 2004 arrest of Bennie Dean Herring by police officers in Coffee County, Ala., based on a mistaken belief that he was the subject of an outstanding warrant. It turned out that the warrant, although still in the computerized database of a neighboring town, had been withdrawn five months earlier. By the time the error was discovered, officers had stopped Mr. Herring, handcuffed him, searched him and his truck and found methamphetamine and an unloaded pistol.'b'No one disputed that Mr. Herring\xe2\x80\x99s arrest lacked probable cause and that both the arrest and the search were therefore unconstitutional. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court declined to exclude the seized evidence, and upheld Mr. Herring\xe2\x80\x99s conviction on drug and gun charges. The arrest was based on careless police record-keeping rather intentional misconduct, the court reasoned.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo trigger the exclusionary rule,\xe2\x80\x9d Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority, \xe2\x80\x9cpolice conduct must be sufficiently deliberate that exclusion can meaningfully deter it, and sufficiently culpable that such deterrence is worth the price paid by the justice system.\xe2\x80\x9d The decision instructs judges to use a sliding scale to decide whether police misconduct warrants suppressing evidence.'b'That may seem reasonable, but it ignores both the inadequacy in the real world of using a cost-benefit calculus to deter unconstitutional law enforcement conduct, and the harm of involving the courts in trampling on people\xe2\x80\x99s rights by admitting the fruits of an unconstitutional search. The decision also overlooks the importance of preserving a strong incentive for maintaining accurate, up-to-date records in an era of increased law-enforcement reliance on coordinated computer databases. These points were noted by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in a thoughtful dissenting opinion.'b'The outcome was not very surprising. In recent years, the court has carved out several \xe2\x80\x9cgood faith\xe2\x80\x9d exceptions to the exclusionary rule, and justices on the court\xe2\x80\x99s right flank have made no secret of their ambition to carve out more. But until this week, those exceptions were limited to instances when the improper search resulted from nonpolice errors, say by judicial officers or a legislature   \xe2\x80\x94  not solely from police behavior.'b'The danger of this ruling is that judges will read its broad reasoning to prevent the exclusion of evidence in cases of negligent police conduct going well beyond sloppy record-keeping.'b'Mayor Michael Bloomberg conceded on Thursday in his annual State of the City speech that New York City is hurting from a global financial slump that could get \xe2\x80\x9cplenty bad\xe2\x80\x9d before it gets better. But if the city is shaken, the mayor said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s not broken.\xe2\x80\x9d He then offered to fix it.'b'It was an upbeat performance from a man who intends to run for another term and who radiated, at least outwardly, a level of confidence about the future that many of his constituents may not share. As politicians do, Mr. Bloomberg boasted about his successes, about how crime is down and tourism up. He also unveiled new programs to create jobs, to make the city a friendlier place for business and to maintain the quality of life that has been one of the hallmarks of his mayoralty.'b'His main pledge was to begin a program to add and retain 400,000 new jobs over the next six years, many of them \xe2\x80\x9cgreen jobs\xe2\x80\x9d retrofitting schools and other public buildings to save energy. He called, too, for new workspaces for artists, seed money for high-tech start-ups and emergency loans for small businesses.'b'He would also expand his innovative 311 telephone information service. The new variant \xe2\x80\x94 called P311 \xe2\x80\x94 would give parents greater access to information about the schools and their students, as well as a much-needed place to register their views.'b'Much will depend on help from Washington and, especially, the governor and State Legislature in Albany. Federal stimulus money could provide the financing to build the No. 7 subway line and at least five new libraries. The state will decide the fate of his proposals to simplify business taxes and reduce them for freelancers.'b'Mr. Bloomberg promised to keep crime down and not \xe2\x80\x9ccede an inch\xe2\x80\x9d to squeegee people or vandals. He said he would ask for more security cameras, more enforcement and stronger penalties to deal with these and other \xe2\x80\x9cquality-of-life criminals.\xe2\x80\x9d These proposals, too, are going to require Albany\xe2\x80\x99s approval, as will an important proposal requiring background checks for employees of gun dealers and the use of new technology to help trace guns.'b'The mayor, who helped steer the city through the economic crisis after Sept. 11, 2001, now has the equally daunting task of holding the city steady during a national recession. The question this election year is whether Mr. Bloomberg, a political independent, can convince Democrats in Albany to adopt any good idea that has his name on it.'b'There has often been an appealing vein of common sense in New Hampshire, and that is true of its regulations for people who venture outdoors. The state has always done what it can to rescue hikers and skiers who get lost or in trouble. Since 1999, it has billed them for the costs of rescue if their behavior was reckless. But in July, the standard was changed. If you find yourself in trouble thanks to your own negligence, a lower threshold of responsibility, then you also may end up paying the cost for being rescued.'b'There is something a little peculiar about the need for a law like this. The New Hampshire Fish and Game Department is hoping not only to recoup some of its rescue costs, but also to warn hikers and skiers that their behavior in nature has consequences.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine Americans protesting about having to pay for their ambulance rides after getting sick at home, or injured in a highway crash. But most Americans live lives that are incredibly distant from nature. They often do not understand that venturing into the backcountry means entering a realm of purely personal responsibility.'b'The greater reach of cellphone service, while making rescue more likely, makes it easier to forget the risks. You can get just as lost while carrying a cellphone \xe2\x80\x94 even with good coverage \xe2\x80\x94 as you can without it.'b'That is New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s trouble, and it is one of the reasons there is controversy over efforts to expand cellphone coverage in the national parks. That includes Yellowstone, where there are plans to expand the cellphone service that exists near developed areas, like Old Faithful. The backcountry is a world with rules of its own, enforced by nature itself. If that means billing visitors for the costs of their negligence, we say, fine by us.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cObama\xe2\x80\x99s Closing of Guant\xc3\xa1namo May Take a Year\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 13):'b'It is essential for the future of the United States that one of the first acts of President-elect Barack Obama after his inauguration be the repudiation of the shameful and immoral policies of secret and indefinite detention beyond the reach of civilized recourse to legal protections.'b'These protections are not only fundamental to the founding of the United States, but are also proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Geneva Conventions.'b'Guant\xc3\xa1namo is symbolic of the reprehensible detention policies of the Bush administration, so a symbolic executive order to close it is appropriate.

It\xe2\x80\x99s not just torture and illegal wiretapping, whose perpetrators claim, however implausibly, that they were patriots acting to defend the nation\xe2\x80\x99s security. The fact is that the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s abuses extended from environmental policy to voting rights. And most of the abuses involved using the power of government to reward political friends and punish political enemies.'b'At the Justice Department, for example, political appointees illegally reserved nonpolitical positions for \xe2\x80\x9cright-thinking Americans\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x94 their term, not mine  \xe2\x80\x94  and there\xe2\x80\x99s strong evidence that officials used their positions both to undermine the protection of minority voting rights and to persecute Democratic politicians.'b'The hiring process at Justice echoed the hiring process during the occupation of Iraq  \xe2\x80\x94  an occupation whose success was supposedly essential to national security  \xe2\x80\x94  in which applicants were judged by their politics, their personal loyalty to President Bush and, according to some reports, by their views on Roe v.

Any government official who tried to enforce accountability on, say, Halliburton quickly found his or her career derailed.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s much, much more. By my count, at least six important government agencies experienced major scandals over the past eight years  \xe2\x80\x94  in most cases, scandals that were never properly investigated.

What makes anyone think that they or their political heirs won\xe2\x80\x99t do it all over again, given the chance?'b'In fact, we\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen this movie. During the Reagan years, the Iran-contra conspirators violated the Constitution in the name of national security. But the first President Bush pardoned the major malefactors, and when the White House finally changed hands the political and media establishment gave Bill Clinton the same advice it\xe2\x80\x99s giving Mr. Obama: let sleeping scandals lie. Sure enough, the second Bush administration picked up right where the Iran-contra conspirators left off  \xe2\x80\x94  which isn\xe2\x80\x99t too surprising when you bear in mind that Mr. Bush actually hired some of those conspirators.'b'Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s true that a serious investigation of Bush-era abuses would make Washington an uncomfortable place, both for those who abused power and those who acted as their enablers or apologists.

Supporters of gay rights wonder if the California Supreme Court might soon confirm the legitimacy of Proposition 8, passed by state voters in November, which declares same-sex marriage illegal \xe2\x80\x94 leaving them no alternative but to take to the streets.'b'To help resolve the issue of gay rights, President-elect Obama should abolish the now moribund Commission on Civil Rights and replace it with a new commission that would address the rights of many groups, including gays.'b'The fault lines beneath the debate over gay rights are jagged and deep. Federal Social Security and tax benefits from marriage that straight people take for granted are denied to most gays in committed relationships.

Jos\xc3\xa9 Sucuzha\xc3\xb1ay died from being beaten with a bottle and a baseball bat. Yet the effort in Congress to enact a law that would increase the punishment for hate crimes against gays and lesbians is going nowhere.'b'Only two states, Massachusetts and Connecticut, permit gay marriage. New York acknowledges marriages from those states and from other countries, despite the federal Defense of Marriage Act of 1996, which was meant to allow other states not to recognize gay marriages performed elsewhere. Vermont, New Jersey and New Hampshire permit civil unions, which provide gay partners the rights, protections and responsibilities of marriage. On the other hand, a referendum that just passed in Arkansas goes beyond banning gay marriage to prohibit the adoption of children by unmarried couples. Mississippi, Florida and Utah have similar bans. And many Americans believe their religion forbids gay marriage or even civil unions.'b'In the 1950s, race relations in America generated escalating tension and strife. As Secretary of State John Foster Dulles told President Dwight Eisenhower, other nations vilified us for our treatment of \xe2\x80\x9cnegroes\xe2\x80\x9d as less-than-first-class citizens.

If the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s bill is higher than that rate, the patient must make up the difference or the doctor must settle for less.'b'The rub comes in defining what is reasonable and customary.'b'That calculation for most of the industry is made by a company called Ingenix, which conveniently is owned by UnitedHealth. The whole system is rendered suspect by an obvious conflict of interest: If Ingenix pegs the customary rates low, it keeps insurance reimbursements low and shifts more of the cost to the patient.'b'Investigators for Mr. Cuomo contend that UnitedHealth and Ingenix have been manipulating the data through a variety of stratagems to keep the customary rate calculation low \xe2\x80\x94 and the insurance payments low.'b'Based on their own data collection and calculations, the investigators estimated that insurers have systematically underpaid New Yorkers for medical services by 10 percent to 28 percent, depending on where they lived.'b'UnitedHealth neither admits nor denies any wrongdoing, but the company does acknowledge the inherent conflict of interest and is paying substantially to put the issue to rest.'b'As a result of the agreement, future reimbursements should be less subject to manipulation and a lot more transparent. UnitedHealth is planning to close its Ingenix databases and shift responsibility to an independent nonprofit organization \xe2\x80\x94 possibly a university-level school of public health \xe2\x80\x94 that will be the sole arbiter of data collection and calculation methodologies.'b'UnitedHealth will contribute $50 million to help get the new system operating.

Both UnitedHealth and Aetna will use the new database.'b'The new organization will also create a Web site where consumers around the country can find out the prevailing charges for out-of-network medical services in their area.

With gas prices likely to remain low as consumers grapple with recession, drivers are going to need extra motivation to swap their gas gluttons for the novel, environmentally friendly cars and trucks. If the incoming Obama administration is serious about its commitment to boost the fuel efficiency of the American fleet, it must put in place a mix of policies, beyond tightening fuel-economy standards for carmakers, to steer drivers to the new cars.'b'The price of Ford\xe2\x80\x99s new hybrid Fusion sedan, estimated to travel a whopping 41 miles per gallon in the city, is expected to start at more than $27,000.

(Harrison\xe2\x80\x99s editor, Daniel Webster, claimed it could have been worse, and that he had killed off \xe2\x80\x9cseventeen Roman proconsuls, as dead as smelts.\xe2\x80\x9d) The weather was terrible; Harrison came down with a cold, then pneumonia and was dead within a month.'b'Given current beaten-down expectations, our normal approach to Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s address would be to wander around muttering \xe2\x80\x9cwell as long as it\xe2\x80\x99s better than William Henry Harrison\xe2\x80\x99s...\xe2\x80\x9d But Barack Obama is a celebrated speaker, and our hopes are unusually high. So where are you going to be when it all happens? The options are many, including:'b'1. 'b'Go to Washington with the rest of the world.'b''b'For the nonelite, seeing the inauguration in Washington involves standing on the Mall, shivering and staring at a JumboTron in the company of many, many, many brand-new new acquaintances. Not everyone thinks this is the perfect way to experience history. Obama himself has been delicately hinting that we all might want to consider staying home, mentioning \xe2\x80\x9clong lines, a tough time getting around and most of all a lot of walking on what could be a very cold winter day.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Still, if you go, then you can always say you did. \xe2\x80\x9cActually having been there does give you some street cred, so to speak,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeremy Brooke Straughn, a sociologist at Purdue University, who has done research on generational memory. His own experiences go back to Jimmy Carter, whose inauguration he attended when he was 10. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I can remember is it was extremely far away and I was very cold,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. This is not the kind of story that is going to leave them spellbound at your next dinner party.'b'But I totally sympathize. The first inauguration I went to was Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s in 1993 and the only thing I can remember is watching Barney the purple dinosaur vamp down Pennsylvania Avenue during the parade.'b''b'2. Join other Obama supporters for an inauguration party.'b''b'To find the nearest one, you can check 'b'my.barackobama.com'b'. Or just close your eyes, click your heels and say \xe2\x80\x9cPresident Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x9d four times. This will trigger chips implanted in the heads of former campaign volunteers and someone will call you soon with an invitation to a Change Is Coming house meeting and a special offer on an Inaugural Seal fleece jacket.'b''b'3. \xe2\x80\x9cTotal Recall.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Watch the inauguration on television and hope that as time passes, you\xe2\x80\x99ll come to believe that you were actually there. Memory experts say that this sort of thing happens all the time, and the number of Americans who think they were at Woodstock, or watched the Red Sox win the World Series or marched on Washington with Martin Luther King Jr. is far, far greater than the number of actual attendees.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI almost feel like I was there for the \xe2\x80\x98I Have a Dream\xe2\x80\x99 speech, given how many times I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it on TV,\xe2\x80\x9d said John Mueller of Ohio State University. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the number of people who saw that plane floating in the Hudson is probably already a lot higher than is possible.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Virtual attendance: a great way to experience history without leaving the comfort of your own home. (By the way, I work in an office near the Hudson River and am already beginning to remember watching the rescue even though our view was completely blocked by several big buildings. And there may have been a moment after the inauguration in 1993 when Barney and I went clubbing.)'b'All this is good news for people who did not vote for Obama but now yearn to have a part in the inaugural events. If you go to Washington, you will be welcomed by happy Obamites wearing name tags and fleece jackets. Even if you don\xe2\x80\x99t, you may gradually begin to remember that when you went to the polls, you pulled the Democratic lever. And if the new president does well and manages to resurrect the economy, by 2011 you will clearly recall doing door-to-door canvassing last September in a Yes We Can T-shirt.'b'If you want to see hell on earth, go to Zimbabwe where the madman Robert Mugabe has brought the country to such a state of ruin that medical care for most of the inhabitants has all but ceased to exist.'b'Life expectancy in Zimbabwe is now the lowest in the world:  37 years for men and 34 for women. A cholera epidemic is raging. People have become ill with anthrax after eating the decaying flesh of animals that had died from the disease. Power was lost to the morgue in the capital city of Harare, leaving the corpses to rot.'b'Most of the world is ignoring the agony of Zimbabwe, a once prosperous and medically advanced nation in southern Africa that is suffering from political and economic turmoil \xe2\x80\x94 and the brutality of Mugabe\xe2\x80\x99s long and tyrannical reign.'b'The decline in health services over the past year has been staggering. An international team of doctors that conducted an \xe2\x80\x9cemergency assessment\xe2\x80\x9d of the state of medical care last month seemed stunned by the catastrophe they witnessed. The team was sponsored by Physicians for Human Rights. In their report, released this week, the doctors said:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe collapse of Zimbabwe\xe2\x80\x99s health system in 2008 is unprecedented in scale and scope. Public-sector hospitals have been shuttered since November 2008. The basic infrastructure for the maintenance of public health, particularly water and sanitation services, have abruptly deteriorated in the worsening political and economic climate.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Doctors and nurses are trying to do what they can under the most harrowing of circumstances: facilities with no water, no functioning toilets and barely any medicine or supplies. The report quoted the director of a mission hospital:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA major problem is the loss of life and fetal wastage we are seeing with obstetric patients. They come so late, the fetuses are already dead. We see women with eclampsia who have been seizing for 12 hours. There is no intensive care unit here, and now there is no intensive care in Harare.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf we had intensive care, we know it would be immediately full of critically ill patients. As it is, they just die.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mugabe\xe2\x80\x99s corrupt, violent and profoundly destructive reign has left Zim-babwe in shambles. It\xe2\x80\x99s a nation overwhelmed by poverty, the H.I.V./AIDS pandemic and hyperinflation. Once considered the \xe2\x80\x9cbreadbasket\xe2\x80\x9d of Africa, Zimbabwe is now a country that cannot feed its own people. The unemployment rate is higher than 80 percent. Malnutrition is widespread, as is fear.'b'A nurse told the Physicians for Human Rights team: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not supposed to have hunger in Zimbabwe. So even though we do see it, we cannot report it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mugabe signed a power-sharing agreement a few months ago with a political opponent, Morgan Tsvangirai, who out-polled Mugabe in an election last March but did not win a majority of the votes. But continuing turmoil, including violent attacks by Mugabe\xe2\x80\x99s supporters and allegations that Mugabe forces have engaged in torture, have prevented the agreement from taking effect.'b'The widespread skepticism that greeted Mugabe\xe2\x80\x99s alleged willingness to share power only increased when he ranted, just last month: \xe2\x80\x9cI will never, never, never surrender ...  Zimbabwe is mine.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Meanwhile, health care in Zimbabwe has fallen into the abyss. \xe2\x80\x9cThis emergency is so grave that some entity needs to step in there and take over the health delivery system,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susannah Sirkin, the deputy director of Physicians for Human Rights.'b'In November, the primary public referral hospital in Harare, Parirenyatwa Hospital, shut down. Its medical school closed with it. The nightmare that forced the closings was spelled out in the report:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe hospital had no running water since August of 2008. Toilets were overflowing, and patients and staff had nowhere to void  \xe2\x80\x94  soon making the hospital uninhabitable. Parirenyatwa Hospital was closed four months into the cholera epidemic, arguably the worst of all possible times to have shut down public hospital access. Successful cholera care, treatment and control are impossible, however, in a facility without clean water and functioning toilets.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The hospital\xe2\x80\x99s surgical wards were closed in September. A doctor described the heartbreaking dilemma of having children in his care who he knew would die without surgery. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no pain medication,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9csome antibiotics, but no nurses ... If I don\xe2\x80\x99t operate, the patient will die. But if I do the surgery, the child will die also.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s documented in the Physicians for Human Rights report is evidence of a shocking medical and human rights disaster that warrants a much wider public spotlight, and an intensified effort to mount an international humanitarian intervention.'b'Some organizations are already on the case, including Doctors Without Borders and Unicef. But Zimbabwe is dying, and much more is needed.'b''b'We are shaped by the places we have lived. And Barack Obama has lived in a lot of different places. His memoir, \xe2\x80\x9cDreams From  My Father,\xe2\x80\x9d recounts formative years spent in Indonesia; Honolulu; Los Angeles; New York City; Cambridge, Mass.; and Chicago. How might these places have helped to mold the man who will be the next president of the United States? What might he have taken away from, say, Jakarta in 1967? Or Columbia University? Six writers who lived where Mr. Obama lived \xe2\x80\x94when he lived there \xe2\x80\x94 reflect on those questions.'b''b''b''b''b''b'In a long series of valedictory speeches and interviews, President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have been crowing about Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay, secret prisons and abusive interrogations, claiming they met the highest legal standards and that no prisoner had been tortured. Fortunately, the truth broke through the noise, in the words of some of the very people ordered to carry out the policies.'b'In an interview in The Washington Post, Susan Crawford, the retired judge who runs the military tribunals at Guant\xc3\xa1namo, said that harsh interrogation methods had endangered the life of Mohammed al-Qahtani, a Saudi national accused of planning to take part in the 9/11 attacks. Authorized by then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, they included sustained isolation, nudity and prolonged exposure to the cold.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe tortured Qahtani,\xe2\x80\x9d Judge Crawford said, adding that she was therefore unable to prosecute a man who seemed to pose a real threat to the United States.'b'Judge Crawford was not the only one speaking out. Major David Frakt of the Air Force Reserve, who was assigned to defend another Guant\xc3\xa1namo prisoner, told MSNBC\xe2\x80\x99s Rachel Maddow that he and all the other defense lawyers in the system consider the tribunals \xe2\x80\x9cunfair, rigged\xe2\x80\x9d and unconstitutional. He noted that his client\xe2\x80\x99s prosecutor resigned to protest the lack of evidence in the case.'b'That is the real nature of Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s grotesque legacy: abuse and torture at an outlaw prison where hundreds of men \xe2\x80\x94 many of whom did nothing \xe2\x80\x94 have been held for years without real evidence or charges. And truly dangerous men were treated so badly that it may be impossible to bring them to justice.'b'\xc2\x95'b'It will be hard enough to close down Guant\xc3\xa1namo as Barack Obama has vowed to do, but the legal burdens Mr. Bush is dumping on his successor are much greater.'b'The appalling Military Commissions Act of 2006, railroaded through Congress, must be repealed. Interrogation rules that respect American values and laws and the Geneva Conventions must be set for all government agencies, including the intelligence agencies.'b'And there is the profound question of whether the new administration should prosecute those who tortured and abused prisoners \xe2\x80\x94 and those who ordered them to do it. Judge Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s legal finding that torture occurred adds a new complication, since a treaty obliges the United States to investigate such allegations.'b'We have heard a lot of talk about how the country needs to look forward and not backward. We certainly would like to forget the horrors of the last eight years. But you cannot fix something before you know exactly how it is broken. The clandestine system Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney have built will not give up its secrets easily.'b'To ensure that the abuses stop, Mr. Obama and his administration will have to work hard to find out all that has happened. They will have to locate and override all of the policy memos, directives and executive orders that have redefined and condoned torture and other abuses. Guant\xc3\xa1namo is the place to begin.'b''b'The timetable: 'b'Mr. Obama is expected to announce as early as Wednesday that he is beginning the process of shutting Guant\xc3\xa1namo. We hope he sets a target date. That may make it easier to persuade other governments to agree to accept some prisoners \xe2\x80\x94 one of the difficult challenges ahead. But we do not agree with critics who insist that date must fall within his first 100 days.'b'This page called early and often for closing Guant\xc3\xa1namo. But we recognize that this is going to be very hard work.'b''b'Sorting out the inmates: 'b'Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers will have to review every file, most of which the Bush administration has refused to turn over to any authority, including Congress. We know from bitter experience that the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s judgment is worthless when it comes to what these prisoners may have done, how they have been treated and what justice they should face.'b'Just last week, Mr. Cheney claimed that the interrogation of prisoners like Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, believed to be the planner of 9/11, who was tortured by waterboarding, allowed the United States to capture a \xe2\x80\x9cvery impressive\xe2\x80\x9d list of Al Qaeda leaders in 2003. If that is true, Mr. Obama needs to know who they are, where they are, and what was done to them in the last five years.'b''b'A blueprint: 'b'Senator Dianne Feinstein, the new head of the Intelligence Committee, has a bill for closing Guant\xc3\xa1namo that Mr. Obama should embrace. It sets a one-year deadline and requires that every prisoner either be charged and tried in United States federal court; transferred for trial by an international tribunal under United Nations authority; returned to the custody of the government of their homeland, if that government does not abuse and torture prisoners; held as a prisoner of war; or, simply, released.'b'The separate system of tribunals created by the military commissions act must be abolished. They are a mockery of American justice, and utterly unnecessary.'b'It was extremely encouraging to hear Eric Holder, Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s choice for attorney general, say  at his confirmation hearing on Thursday that the new administration is open to trying prisoners in the United States. It is appalling that an attorney general nominee has to say he respects the law, but such is the Bush legacy.'b''b'The real bad guys: 'b'After the prisoners are sorted out, Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s egregiously bad judgment leaves all Americans with a huge problem. The abuses authorized by top Bush officials, and so gleefully defended by Mr. Cheney in particular in the last few weeks, create the possibility that men like Mohammed al-Qahtani and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed will never be able to face justice in a real courtroom.'b'Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s team will have to come up with a solution that does not set such men free. We are not sure what it should be, but there is one unacceptable choice: creating a new detentions law that would allow them held without trial. That would merely compound Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s catastrophically bad choices.'b''b'Interrogations: 'b'The 2006 military tribunals law bound military interrogators to the Army field manual\xe2\x80\x99s rules, which conform with the Geneva Conventions \xe2\x80\x94 unlike Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s policies. But, at Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s insistence, the bill carved out an exemption that allowed intelligence agencies to go on hiring civilian interrogators and to engage in practices that are clearly immoral and illegal. Ms. Feinstein\xe2\x80\x99s bill would eliminate the loophole on how prisoners are treated and ban the use of civilian interrogators.'b'We were glad to hear Mr. Holder state that the Obama administration considers the Geneva Conventions binding. But we wish he had been more clear on a solution, beyond calling the Army field manual a \xe2\x80\x9cgood start\xe2\x80\x9d for interrogation rules in C.I.A. prisons. We also were unclear from his answers whether Mr. Obama has decided, as he should, to ban civilian interrogators.'b'Mr. Holder unequivocally declared waterboarding to be torture, which his predecessors would not do. But this is not just about waterboarding. Other practices, like forced nudity, prolonged isolation, and extremes of heat and cold, are abuses under the same laws and treaties that prohibit torture. And Judge Crawford reminded us that torture is not necessarily just one terrible act. In the Qahtani case, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cThis was not any one particular act; this was just a combination of things that had a medical impact on him, that hurt his health. It was abusive and uncalled for. And coercive. Clearly coercive.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'C.I.A. prisons: 'b'We have never heard a convincing explanation for why the Central Intelligence Agency needs its own network of prisons beyond the reach of law, in undisclosed locations. If there is a good reason, we hope this administration will explain it. We are skeptical, and we urge Mr. Obama to support Ms. Feinstein\xe2\x80\x99s bill, which would require the C.I.A. to report all detainees to the International Committee of the Red Cross.'b'\xc2\x95'b'We recognize that this is a daunting agenda, and that to succeed, Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s White House, Justice Department and Pentagon will also have to rebuild demoralized legal divisions where professionals were replaced with apparatchiks whose mission was to twist the law to justify their masters\xe2\x80\x99 decisions.'b'This work is essential to restoring the rule of law. It is essential to restoring this country\xe2\x80\x99s reputation around the world. And it is essential to restoring Americans\xe2\x80\x99 faith in themselves and in their government. That is the only way to move forward.'b'When the thermometer bottoms out, I remember, again, that winter isn\xe2\x80\x99t a season, it\xe2\x80\x99s a place. Just over the hill is the 19th  century, and somewhere beyond the river lies the 18th.  Why winter should seem so much more continuous with the past than summer does is never clear to me. But this morning it\xe2\x80\x99s 3 degrees, and I can hear Melville, a few miles north of where I am, writing to his sister: \xe2\x80\x9cThe weather here has been as cold as ever. Other than the weather I know not what to write about from Pittsfield.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s how it feels in the neighborhood of zero. There is no \xe2\x80\x9cother than the weather.\xe2\x80\x9d I feed the woodstove, keep the diesel pickup plugged in, and admire the fortitude of the crows. On the reservoirs, a couple of Canada geese walk along the edge of the ice as though they were lifeguards. The rivers \xe2\x80\x94 all but the Hudson \xe2\x80\x94 dwindle to a narrow sluice of dark water. It takes an effort to remember that the water, which looks so bitterly cold, is the warmest element in the landscape.'b'As dusk comes, the temporal illusion seems to gain strength. The snowmobile tracks that cross the fields fade, and I imagine a huddled figure coming through the trees and stumping down the hill as if he had walked right out of the distant past and was making his way toward the lights of this house. The smoke from the chimney smells completely familiar to him, whatever century he comes from. And about then in my private storytelling, I remember that I\xe2\x80\x99m living in the warmer, brighter future that everyone in the country of winter has always aspired to.'b'A couple of nights ago, dusk brought a different illusion. The clouds had been hammered flat. But in the last few moments of afternoon, the sun slid below the overcast, coming out strong and red along the rim of the horizon. It brought no real warmth. But I could not help feeling that this was the sun of summer shining all the way back into winter\xe2\x80\x99s heart; just a glimpse to see how we were all doing here huddled together. That was enough to turn my thoughts to soil and seeds and new shoots rising.'b'THE average weekday New York Times contains nearly 130,000 words of news, information and opinion distilled from millions cascading in from throughout the world. The newspaper employs layers of editors and multiple policies and procedures to make sure that every one of those words is as accurate as anyone can determine in the daily rush of history.'b'But, with all the safeguards, bad things still happen. Last month, because reporters and editors in three different parts of the paper did not take enough pains to verify information, The Times reported as fact a political telephone call that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, fell victim to a faked letter to the editor, and published a sensational anecdote about a college football recruiting battle that the paper cannot be confident is true.'b'Each failure had its unique causes, but all show how little breakdowns can lead to big mistakes and how, in a business that relies heavily on trust, it is imperative to stay vigilant and skeptical.'b''b'The Phone Call'b''b'On Dec. 9, David Halbfinger, the metro politics reporter, 'b'wrote'b' that Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts had called Gov. David Paterson of New York on behalf of his niece, Caroline Kennedy, who was eyeing the Senate seat being vacated by Hillary Clinton. Halbfinger\xe2\x80\x99s sources were unnamed \xe2\x80\x9cDemocratic aides,\xe2\x80\x9d and the story said a Kennedy spokesman had no comment.'b'But the next day, after Paterson denied speaking to Kennedy and Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman said the senator had not called anyone in New York about his niece and the Senate, The Times 'b'acknowledged'b' that it had not contacted either Kennedy or Paterson to seek response before the article was published.'b'How could such a basic step have been missed? A chagrined Halbfinger took full responsibility and said there was \xe2\x80\x9cno rational explanation.\xe2\x80\x9d He said, \xe2\x80\x9cI had an out-of-mind experience for two hours, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it happened. It was just awful.\xe2\x80\x9d The circumstances Halbfinger described amounted to a breakdown in communication with sources and fellow reporters.'b'He was the lead reporter on a story with three other contributors. Carl Hulse in Washington said he was asked to request an interview with Senator Kennedy but knew nothing about the reported phone call. He sent a message to Anthony Coley, Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman, asking if Kennedy would talk about \xe2\x80\x9cthe prospect of his niece joining him\xe2\x80\x9d in the Senate. Kennedy has not given press interviews since returning from surgery for brain cancer, and Coley signaled that there would be no interview this time. Halbfinger then sent his own message to Coley, referring to \xe2\x80\x9cthe Caroline thing,\xe2\x80\x9d and later asked Coley to call him. Coley replied that he would have \xe2\x80\x9cnothing for you on that story.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Halbfinger said he mistook the answer as a no-comment on the phone call. Instead, Coley was simply letting him know there would be no interview. Coley told me that had he been asked the direct question he would have waved The Times off. He said he thought the newspaper had made an \xe2\x80\x9chonest mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Halbfinger thought he had some corroboration because Nicholas Confessore, a reporter normally in the Albany bureau, was near him in the New York newsroom monitoring an interview on television with Kerry Kennedy, another niece of the senator\xe2\x80\x99s. Confessore announced that she had confirmed that her uncle had lobbied Paterson on Caroline\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, and he 'b'posted'b' that on the City Room blog. It turned out to be wrong.'b'Halbfinger said he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t explain why he didn\xe2\x80\x99t try to call Paterson. Also unexplained is whether the anonymous sources were in a position to know what they were talking about or had motives to mislead the paper. Craig Whitney, the standards editor, said the skimpy description of them was \xe2\x80\x9cinadequate.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b' The Faked Letter'b''b'In his nine years as editor of letters to the editor, Thomas Feyer figures he has read a million letters \xe2\x80\x94 and spotted more than one fake. But on Dec. 18, he was taken in by an e-mail message from someone claiming to be Bertrand Delano\xc3\xab, the mayor of Paris, who said Caroline Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s bid for the Senate was \xe2\x80\x9ca dynastic move\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnot very democratic.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Feyer knew Delano\xc3\xab to be outspoken and not always diplomatic, so he didn\xe2\x80\x99t heed the little alarms that this might be a hoax: the e-mail address was 'b'paris.com'b' instead of paris.fr, and there were none of the required contact telephone numbers. Feyer also should have been suspicious because the message carried an ad at the bottom, unlikely with government communication. But he said the fact that the real mayor\xe2\x80\x99s name was in the originating address helped persuade him that the message was genuine. He has since learned how easy it is to create false e-mail addresses.'b'The 'b'letter'b' was lightly edited and sent back to the writer for approval, as required by Times policy. Although there was no response, the letter went in the paper on Dec. 22. When the real mayor\xe2\x80\x99s office objected, The Times 'b'apologized'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cThere were warning signs, \xe2\x80\x9c Feyer said. \xe2\x80\x9cI should have held the letter.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He 'b'told readers'b' last Sunday that, from now on, The Times will adhere strictly to its verification policies for letters to the editor. All letter writers will be called before their submissions are published.'b'Andrew Rosenthal, the editor of the editorial page and Feyer\xe2\x80\x99s boss, said Feyer is \xe2\x80\x9cone of the most reliable, sensible editors I have ever known, with impeccable news judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d But he made \xe2\x80\x9cone real clunker,\xe2\x80\x9d Rosenthal added.'b'Feyer said he felt terrible about the incident because \xe2\x80\x9cthe credibility of The Times is everything.\xe2\x80\x9d He said he also felt a bit sad because \xe2\x80\x9cwe were operating with a level of trust that I suppose in today\xe2\x80\x99s Internet world you can\xe2\x80\x99t have.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'The Wild Party'b''b'On Dec. 26, Thayer Evans, a Houston-based freelancer who writes frequently for The Times, reported that one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s most intense college football recruiting battles had ended: Jamarkus McFarland of Lufkin, Tex., 'b'was going to Oklahoma'b', not Texas.'b'Evans had stayed close to McFarland and his mother, Kashemeyia Adams, for months, and he recounted an intense courtship of them by coaches and boosters. He quoted from a paper that McFarland had written for his high school English class that described the recruiting process, including comparisons of the football programs. McFarland\xe2\x80\x99s paper described a party at an upscale Dallas hotel, hosted by Texas fans after the Texas-Oklahoma game, where he said drugs and alcohol were plentiful and young women took off their clothes and were \xe2\x80\x9cromancing each other.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But McFarland later 'b'told'b' rivals.com, a football fan Web site, that he had \xe2\x80\x9cspiced up\xe2\x80\x9d the description of the party and intimated that, if he had known Evans was going to quote from his paper, he could have told the reporter what was accurate and what was not. Evans told me he went over the paper in detail with McFarland, and Adams told me that she knew the reporter reviewed what he was writing with her son, although she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the details of their conversation.'b'The Times asked McFarland to clarify his conflicting remarks, and after two days, he sent 'b'a text message'b' that cleared up nothing. It said he had respect for Evans, that his school paper was written \xe2\x80\x9cto capture and inform my audiences,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cI stand by this story and I have moved on.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Adams said that since The Times article was published, her son has been the target of racial slurs from angry Texas supporters, and she said she would not let him talk to reporters in the future. But she defended Evans\xe2\x80\x99s story. \xe2\x80\x9cAn article was written, and I was very well pleased with it, and that\xe2\x80\x99s that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'What really happened? I asked Evans how much he pressed for independent verification of the party. He said he asked for the name of the hotel, and McFarland could not remember it. The reporter did not ask who invited the young man to the party, who accompanied him or who else might have witnessed the lurid events.'b'Evans said that in retrospect, he could have done more to get independent corroboration of the party. But he said that McFarland and his mother had never misled him during their long association.'b'Tom Jolly, the sports editor, and Mike Abrams, who was editing the 2,800-word article on deadline on Christmas Day, said they did not press Evans about the party. Abrams said the allegations were in a school paper, and \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a trust between this kid and a teacher.\xe2\x80\x9d McFarland is a good student, and \xe2\x80\x9csubmitting this document for a grade added credibility,\xe2\x80\x9d Abrams said \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cmaybe too much credibility.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The article also contained allegations by Adams that she had received various offers to induce her son to go to Texas, although it made clear that she did not believe that anyone associated with the university was responsible for any misconduct. Nick Voinis, a spokesman for the University of Texas athletics department, complained to me that Evans did not call the university for comment before the article was published.'b'Evans did alert the university just before his article was published on the newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s Web site. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he seek reaction beforehand? He said that if anyone at Texas had spoken to him, it would have violated N.C.A.A. recruiting rules. And, he said, he did not want to give either Texas or Oklahoma information they could use to try to influence McFarland\xe2\x80\x99s decision.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI felt like we made the best efforts we could under the circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d Evans said.'b'Regardless of whether Texas officials would have commented, Evans should have given them the chance. As in each of the other cases, a phone call could have headed off much embarrassment.'b'Ronald Reagan may not have loved the press, but he had 'b'good advice'b' for every reporter: Trust but verify.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cWhere the Money Is,\xe2\x80\x9d by Bob Herbert (column, Jan. 13):'b'Mr. Herbert says the country should consider a financial transactions tax, an idea advocated by the economist Dean Baker.

Friedman (column, Jan. 14):'b'Mr. Friedman and Mr. Goldberg present two views  about the current conflict between Israel and Hamas. Mr. Friedman asks whether Israel is trying to \xe2\x80\x9ceducate\xe2\x80\x9d Hamas into a cease-fire. And Mr. Goldberg suggests that peace can come only if the Palestinian people themselves turn against Hamas and support Fatah in paving the way to a Palestinian state.'b'If Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin were alive today, he would certainly agree with Mr. Goldberg. He told me shortly before he was assassinated  that he was pushing so hard for such a state because the Palestinian people, with their own country, would not be likely to jeopardize their long-sought independence by tolerating anti-Israel terrorist action \xe2\x80\x94 a feeling that was shared by the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, in another interview with me.'b'But Mr. Rabin felt that to arouse enough antiterrorist and pro-Fatah sentiment to generate peace and make possible a state, Israel must give up most of its settlements.

Mr. Goldberg tells us that Hamas is rooted in a theology of anti-Semitism and believes that \xe2\x80\x9cJews are a cosmological evil, enemies of Islam\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cGod is opposed to a Jewish state in Palestine.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'So a much more fundamental and relevant question might be, Is Hamas educable?

Instead, it has used Israel\xe2\x80\x99s gift as a rocket launching pad, directly provoking the current crisis.'b'Until Palestinians embrace a culture of life and hope rather than one of death and destruction, the outlook for peace looks bleak indeed.'b'Jerry Rapp 'b'\n New York, Jan. 14, 2009'b''b'\xc2\x95'b'To the Editor:'b'Thanks to Jeffrey Goldberg for his powerful and eye-opening article.

But I can speak for myself, as a white American who grew up in the segregated nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital of the 1960s. Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s day is one that I never thought would come, and one that I still can\xe2\x80\x99t quite believe is here.'b'Last week I joined a group of journalists at an off-the-record conversation with the president-elect, a sort of preview of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s coming attractions. But as I walked some desolate downtown blocks to the standard-issue federal office building serving as transition headquarters, ghosts of the past mingled with hopes for the future. The contrast between the unemployed men on Washington\xe2\x80\x99s frigid streets and the buzzing executive-branch bees inside was, for me, as old as time.'b'My particular historical vantage point is a product of my upbringing as that odd duck, a native Washingtonian whose parents were not in government. The first presidential transition of my sentient lifetime, Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s, I remember vividly. Even an 11-year-old could see that the sleepy Southern town of the Eisenhower era was waking up, electrified by youth, glamour and the prospect of change.'b'But some of that change I didn\xe2\x80\x99t then understand. J.F.K.\xe2\x80\x99s arrival coincided with Washington\xe2\x80\x99s emergence as the first American city 'b'with a black majority'b'. Many whites responded by fleeing to the suburbs. My parents did the opposite, moving our family from the enclave of Montgomery County, Md., into the city as I was about to enter the fifth grade.'b'Our new neighborhood included the Sidwell Friends School. My mother, a public school teacher, decreed that her children would instead enroll in the public system that had been desegregated a half-dozen years earlier, after Brown v. Board of Education. In reality de facto segregation remained in place. Though a few African-Americans and embassy Africans provided the window dressing of \xe2\x80\x9cintegration,\xe2\x80\x9d my mostly white elementary, junior high and high schools had roughly the same diversity as, say, today\xe2\x80\x99s G.O.P.'b'I wish I could say we were all outraged at this apartheid. But we were kids  \xe2\x80\x94  privileged kids at that  \xe2\x80\x94  and out of sight was out of mind. Except as household help, black Washington was generally as invisible to us as it was to the tourists who were rigidly segregated from the real Washington while visiting its many ivory marble shrines to democratic ideals.'b'Gradually we would learn more  \xe2\x80\x94  from our parents and teachers, from televised incidents of violent racial confrontations far away, and from odd cultural phenomena like the 1961 best seller \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Black Like Me'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d In that book, a white novelist darkened his skin  for undercover travels through deepest Dixie, whose bigotry he then described in morbid firsthand detail to shocked adolescents like me.'b'Surely such horrific injustices could not occur in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital.'b'But as an unintended consequence of Washington\xe2\x80\x99s particular brand of Jim Crow, white public school students got a tiny taste of what racially mandated second-class citizenship could mean. In those days, the city didn\xe2\x80\x99t even have the bastardized form of \xe2\x80\x9cself-government\xe2\x80\x9d it has now; it was run as a plantation by 'b'Congressional District panels'b' led by racist white Southerners (then Democrats). These overseers didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to lavish money on an overwhelmingly black school system, and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t. By the early 1960s, per-student spending in Washington was less than that of any state, impoverished West Virginia and Mississippi included.'b'If Washington\xe2\x80\x99s white schools received a larger share of that meager budget, as they no doubt did, it was still obvious that our teachers had far fewer resources than their suburban and private school counterparts. Extracurricular activities could be curtailed by the costs of light and heat. The curriculum was also abridged, lest anyone get too agitated by America\xe2\x80\x99s racial inequities. In my history class, the Civil War was downsized to a passing speed bump. In English, we read \xe2\x80\x9cTom Sawyer,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cHuckleberry Finn.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Now that we were teenagers, we had both the curiosity and mobility to investigate the strangely undemocratic city that dealt us this hand. In the words of Constance McLaughlin Green, a Pulitzer Prize-winning urban historian, the District\xe2\x80\x99s black population had long occupied \xe2\x80\x9ca secret city all but unknown to the white world round about.\xe2\x80\x9d We wanted in on the secrets.'b'There was so much we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know, so much Americans still don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Take the Lincoln Memorial, to which the Obama family paid so poignant a 'b'nocturnal visit'b' this month. If you look up coverage of the memorial\xe2\x80\x99s 1922 dedication ceremonies 'b'in The Times'b', you can read of President Harding\xe2\x80\x99s forceful oration commemorating the demise of slavery. You also learn that Dr. Robert R. Moton, the president of the Tuskegee Institute, was invited to pay tribute to Lincoln \xe2\x80\x9cin the name of 12,000,000 Negroes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s what The Times did not report about Moton: \xe2\x80\x9cInstead of being placed on the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s platform, he was relegated along with other distinguished colored people to an all-Negro section separated by a road from the rest of the audience.\xe2\x80\x9d So wrote Green in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Secret City,\xe2\x80\x9d her landmark history of race relations in Washington. This was no anomaly. A local Ku Klux Klan had been formed months earlier, with no protests from either Congress or the white press, and the young Harding administration had toughened the exclusion of blacks from the city\xe2\x80\x99s public recreation facilities.'b'The eye-opening \xe2\x80\x9cSecret City\xe2\x80\x9d recounting this secret history was not published until 1967, some four years after the Lincoln Memorial served as a backdrop for \xe2\x80\x9cI Have a Dream.\xe2\x80\x9d It was also in 1967 that I graduated from Woodrow Wilson High. As a valedictory, a bunch of us on the school paper voted to publish an editorial in favor of home rule for D.C. \xe2\x80\x9cWashingtonians have to beg, plead and cajole members of Congress for funds to renovate slums and slum schools,\xe2\x80\x9d it read. That was putting it mildly; we still had much to learn. But the editorial was enough of an irritant that our principal tried to censor it, which prompted a brief civic kerfuffle (\xe2\x80\x9cStudent Editorial Banned at Wilson\xe2\x80\x9d read the headline in The Washington Post) and jump-started a few starry-eyed careers in journalism and political activism.'b'It was one year later that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated and Washington\xe2\x80\x99s secret city exploded. The'b' fires and riots'b'came within a block of the building where the Obama transition set up shop.'b'One would like to say in the aftermath of the 2008 election that everyone lived happily ever after. But the American drama, especially when it involves race, is always more complicated than that.'b'Looking back at my high school years, I\xe2\x80\x99m struck by how slowly history can move. The great civil rights legislation of the Johnson administration had been accomplished 'b'in 1964'b' 'b'and 1965'b', but by the time of my graduation the impact was minimal \xe2\x80\x94  even in the city where the laws were written and passed. Today the nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital still has 'b'no voting representation'b' in Congress and is still a ward of the federal government, reduced to begging, pleading and cajoling for basic needs. Some 19 percent of the population 'b'lives below the poverty line'b', and that 19 percent remains a secret city to many who work within the Beltway.'b'Washington is its own special American case, but only up to a point. For all our huge progress, we are not \xe2\x80\x9cpost-racial,\xe2\x80\x9d whatever that means. The world doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change in a day, and the racial frictions that emerged in both the Democratic primary campaign and the general election didn\xe2\x80\x99t end on Nov. 4. As Obama himself said 'b'in his great speech on race'b', liberals couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cpurchase racial reconciliation on the cheap\xe2\x80\x9d simply by voting for him. And conservatives? The so-called party of Lincoln has spent much of the past month in spirited debate about whether a white candidate for the party\xe2\x80\x99s chairmanship did the right thing by 'b'sending out'b' a \xe2\x80\x9chumorous\xe2\x80\x9d recording of \xe2\x80\x9cBarack the Magic Negro\xe2\x80\x9d as a holiday gift.'b'Next to much of our history, this is small stuff. And yet: Of all the coverage of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s victory, the most accurate take may still be the piquant morning-after summation of the satirical newspaper  The Onion. Under the headline \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Man Given Nation\xe2\x80\x99s Worst Job,\xe2\x80\x9d it 'b'reported'b' that our new president will have \xe2\x80\x9cto spend four to eight years cleaning up the messes other people left behind.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Those messes are enormous, bigger than Washington, bigger than race, bigger than anything most of us have ever seen. Nearly three months after Election Day, it remains astonishing that the American people have entrusted the job to a young black man who seemed to come out of nowhere looking for that kind of work just as we most needed him.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn no other country on earth is my story even possible,\xe2\x80\x9d Obama is fond of saying. That is true, and that is what the country celebrates this week. But it is all the tragic American stories that came before him, some of them still playing out in chilly streets just blocks from the White House, that throw both his remarkable triumph and the huge challenge ahead of him into such heart-stopping relief.'b'A few years ago, soon after I returned disconsolate and shellshocked from a trip to Darfur, I found New Yorkers burning with moral outrage.'b'The spark wasn\xe2\x80\x99t genocide, war or poverty, but rather homelessness \xe2\x80\x94 of a red-tailed hawk nicknamed Pale Male. Managers of a Fifth Avenue apartment building had dismantled his nest.'b'Fury! Television cameras! And public pressure that led to a solution for rebuilding the nest.'b'I wondered how some of that compassion for a hawk could be rechanneled to help human beings like those I had just seen dying in Darfur. The potential is vast: just imagine if we felt the same sympathy for the 25,000 children who will die today of poverty as we do for, say, a lost and terrified puppy on the street. But it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult to generate activism for distant people whom we can\xe2\x80\x99t visualize.'b'So I concocted a contest to take a university student with me on a reporting trip to Africa. I figured that the student\xe2\x80\x99s journey might help connect American students to truly desperate needs abroad.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ve held two of these student trips so far, and today I\xe2\x80\x99m delighted to announce the third.'b'If you apply, you should know that within The Times, my colleagues say that first prize is one trip with Kristof. Second prize is two trips.'b'But they\xe2\x80\x99re just jealous.

In rural Cameroon, we came across 'b'Prudence Lemokouno'b', a mother of three who was dying in childbirth. We gave money and donated blood in hopes of saving Prudence. We failed, and we watched Prudence\xe2\x80\x99s life ebb away.'b'Casey and I visited the Central African Republic and played basketball in a forest clearing \xe2\x80\x94 against Pygmies. Then we traveled to insecure areas to understand the human toll of banditry. Our reporting went well: we were held up at gunpoint. Twice.'b'The 'b'second trip'b', with Leana Wen, a medical student, and 'b'Will Okun'b', a Chicago teacher, started with a tour of booming Rwanda. Then in Congo we dined with a warlord in the jungle \xe2\x80\x94 and interviewed villagers raped by his troops.'b'A documentary of that second trip, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Reporter'b',\xe2\x80\x9d premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on Friday and will be shown on HBO later this year.'b'In this brutal economic environment, it\xe2\x80\x99s especially difficult to sustain compassion for people out of our line of sight. But the contest winner can help put a face on global poverty \xe2\x80\x94 the child who contracts malaria for want of a $5 bed net.'b'Grass-roots reporting encourages not only compassion but also a tough-minded appreciation for the messiness of life and the complexity of solutions. In many cases, the family is too poor to buy a bed net not just because of poverty but also because Dad spends the family money on his priority, which is banana beer.'b'One of the failures of the American education system is that it rarely exposes students to life around the world. As Bill Gates put it in his 2007 Harvard commencement address, \xe2\x80\x9cI left Harvard with no real awareness of the awful inequities in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope that Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s presidency makes public service more appealing. But if you want to save the world, you first must understand it.'b'So, embed yourself deep within a developing country for a summer or a year.

Even if you don\xe2\x80\x99t win my trip, you can still win your own.'b'I was walking by a TV the other day and CNN was on, airing a hearing of what seemed to be a banking committee in Congress debating whether to release more bailout money. CNN didn\xe2\x80\x99t identify the lawmaker who was speaking. He had a bit of a Southern drawl. But I burst out laughing when he said something like: \xe2\x80\x9cI remember a time when banks lent money to people. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s the other way around.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yes, kids, those were the days  \xe2\x80\x94  when banks lent money to the people not the people to the banks!'b'Many commentators have suggestions for Barack Obama on what should be his first meeting at the White House. Here is mine: Mr. Obama and his economic team should convene the 300 leading bank presidents in the East Room and the president should say to each one of them something like this:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLadies and gentlemen, this crisis started with you, the bankers, engaging in reckless practices, and it will only end when we clean up your mess and start afresh. The banking system is the heart of our economy. It pumps blood to our industrial muscles, and right now it\xe2\x80\x99s not pumping. We all know that in the past six months you\xe2\x80\x99ve gone from one extreme to another. You\xe2\x80\x99ve gone from lending money to anyone who could fog up a knife to now treating all potential borrowers, no matter how healthy, as bankrupt until proven innocent. And, therefore, you\xe2\x80\x99re either not lending to them or lending under such onerous terms that the economy can\xe2\x80\x99t get any liftoff. No amount of stimulus will work without a healthy banking system.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo here\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do: we\xe2\x80\x99re going to unclog the arteries. My banking experts have analyzed each of your balance sheets. You will tell us if we\xe2\x80\x99re right. Those of you who are insolvent, we will nationalize and shut down. We will auction off your viable assets and will hold the toxic ones in a government reconstruction fund and sell them later when the market rebounds. Those of you who are weak will be merged. And those of you who are strong will receive added capital for your balance sheets, after you write down all your remaining toxic waste. I am not going to continue rewarding the losers and dimwits amongst you with handouts.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Without this sort of come-to-Jesus strategy, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to just limp along. We\xe2\x80\x99ll never quite confront the real problem because we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take the upfront pain. Therefore, the market will never clear  \xe2\x80\x94  meaning start-ups in need of capital will be choked in their cribs and profit-making firms won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to grow as they should.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cRight now,\xe2\x80\x9d said David Smick, author of \xe2\x80\x9cThe World Is Curved,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe bankers are sitting on mountains of cash, including our bailout money, because they know their true balance sheets are a disaster  \xe2\x80\x94  far worse than publicly stated.\xe2\x80\x9d The situation will likely worsen as delinquent consumer and auto loans are piled atop bad mortgages. \xe2\x80\x9cObama needs to inject some truth serum into the banking discussion. No one trusts the banks, and even the bankers don\xe2\x80\x99t trust each other.\xe2\x80\x9d Bringing clarity to bank balance sheets, said Smick, \xe2\x80\x9cis the first step to fixing America\xe2\x80\x99s bank lending problem.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Only after we bring full transparency to the bank balance sheets will we see private capital buying into banks again at scale. But have no illusions. There are still real balance sheet problems that have to be surmounted. This is not just a psychological crisis.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI wish people would stop saying that this is a crisis of confidence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Steven Eisman, a portfolio manager and banking expert at FrontPoint Partners. \xe2\x80\x9cThe loss of confidence is just a symptom of bad credit and over-leverage. The banks are not lending because they know their balance sheets are loaded with future losses and they don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough capital. The TARP gave them preferred equity, which is nothing more than a bridge loan. We need the government to force the banks to write down all their bad assets now and then recapitalize themselves, preferably with private capital. Those banks that cannot raise sufficient capital should be seized and their deposits sold off.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For too long the government has been taking the banks at their own words, which is one reason we keep getting surprised with demands for more bailout cash. The Treasury needs to be doing its own brutal, burn-down analysis of every major bank\xe2\x80\x99s balance sheet  \xe2\x80\x94  and then acting accordingly.'b'In recent years, \xe2\x80\x9cwhenever other countries  \xe2\x80\x94  Russia, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea or Mexico  \xe2\x80\x94  got themselves into an economic crisis, we lectured them about how they had to adopt \xe2\x80\x98shock therapy,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d said Mois\xc3\xa9s Na\xc3\xadm, editor of Foreign Policy magazine. \xe2\x80\x9cBut now that we are the ones in crisis and in need of shock therapy, everyone is preaching gradualism.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A stimulus package that does not also unclog the arteries of our banking system will never stimulate sufficiently. Mr. Obama should take the pain early, blame it all on George Bush and then reap the benefits down the road. Postpone the pain, postpone the recovery.'b'WASHINGTON'b'As Barack Obama got to town, one of the first things he did was seek the counsel of past presidents, including George Bush senior.'b'As W. was leaving town, one of the last things he did was explain why he never sought the counsel of his father on issues that his father knew intimately, like Iraq and Saddam.'b'When Brit Hume did a joint interview last week with Bush father and son, dubbed \xe2\x80\x9c41st guy\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c43rd guy\xe2\x80\x9d by W., the Fox anchor asked whether it was true that \xe2\x80\x9cthere wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a lot of give and take\xe2\x80\x9d between them, except on family matters.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSee,\xe2\x80\x9d the Oedipally oddball W. replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthe interesting thing is that a president has got plenty of advisers, but what a president never has is someone who gave him unconditional love.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He talks about his father, the commander in chief who went to war with Saddam before he did, like a puppy. \xe2\x80\x9cYou rarely have people,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwho can pick up the phone and say, \xe2\x80\x98I love you, son,\xe2\x80\x99 or, \xe2\x80\x98Hang in there, son.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Maybe he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have needed so many Hang-in-there-sons if he had actually consulted his dad before he ignorantly and fraudulently rammed into the Middle East.'b'When W. admits the convoluted nature of his relationship with his father, diminishing a knowledgeable former president to the status of a blankie, you realize that, despite all the cocky swagger we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen,  this is not a confident man.'b'That is vividly apparent as we watch W. and Obama share the stage as they pass the battered baton. One seems small and inconsequential, even though he keeps insisting he\xe2\x80\x99s not; the other grows large and impressive, filling Americans with cockeyed hope even as he warns them not to expect too much too soon.'b'Even Obama\xe2\x80\x99s caution \xe2\x80\x94 a commodity notably absent from the White House for eight years \xe2\x80\x94 fills people with optimism.'b'W. lives in the shadow of his father\xe2\x80\x99s presence, while Obama lives in the shadow of his father\xe2\x80\x99s absence. W.\xe2\x80\x99s parlous presidency, spent trashing the Constitution, the economy and the environment, was bound up, and burdened by, the psychological traits of an asphyxiated and pampered son.'b'The exiting and entering presidents are opposite poles \xe2\x80\x94  one the parody of a monosyllabic Western gunslinger who disdains nuance, and one a complex, polysyllabic professor sort who will make a decision only after he has held it up to the light and examined it from all sides.'b'W. was immune to doubt and afraid of it. (His fear of doubt led to the cooking of war intelligence.) Obama is delighted by doubt.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s astonishing that, as banks continue to fail and Americans continue to lose jobs and homes, W. was obtuse enough to go on TV and give a canned ode to can-do-ism. \xe2\x80\x9cGood and evil are present in this world,\xe2\x80\x9d he reiterated, \xe2\x80\x9cand between the two of them there can be no compromise.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He gives the good-and-evil view of things a bad name. Good and evil are not like the Redskins and the Cowboys. Good and evil intermingle in the same breath, let alone the same society. A moral analysis cannot be a simplistic analysis.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou may not agree with some of the tough decisions I have made,\xe2\x80\x9d he said Thursday night. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I hope you can agree that I was willing to make the tough decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Actually, no. His decisions have been, for the most part, disastrous. If he\xe2\x80\x99d paid as much attention to facts as fitness, 9/11, Iraq, the drowning of New Orleans, the deterioration in Afghanistan and the financial deregulation orgy could have been prevented.'b'Bush fancied himself the Decider; Obama fancies himself the Convener. Some worry that a President Obama will overdo it and turn the Situation Room into the Seminar Room. (He\xe2\x80\x99s already showing a distressing lack of concern over whether his cherished eggheads bend the rules, like Tim Geithner\xe2\x80\x99s  not paying all his taxes, because, after all, they\xe2\x80\x99re the Best and the Brightest, not ordinary folk.)'b'W., Cheney and Rummy loved making enemies, under the mistaken assumption that the more people hated America, the more the Bushies were standing up for principle. But is Obama neurotically reluctant to make enemies, and overly concerned with winning over those who have smacked him, from Hillary and Bill to conservative columnists?'b'If W. and Cheney preferred Fox News on the TVs in the White House because they liked hearing their cheerleaders, Obama may leave the channel on Fox because he prefers seducing and sparring with antagonists to spooning with allies.'b'Right now, though, it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge relief to be getting an inquisitive, complicated mind in the White House.'b'W. decided there was no need to be president of the whole country. He could just be president of his base. Obama is determined to be president of as much of the country as possible.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re trading a dogmatic president for one who\xe2\x80\x99s shopping for a dog.

Kennedy replaced him, Abraham Lincoln was one of the two white men whose image most frequently graced even the most modest black home, second in popularity only to Jesus. Perhaps none of his heirs in the Oval Office has been as directly compared to Lincoln as will Barack Obama, in part because Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Emancipation Proclamation began freeing the slaves descended from the continent on which Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s father was born, and in part because of Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s own fascination with Lincoln himself.'b'Much has been written about what Mr. Obama thinks about Lincoln; but not much has been said about what Lincoln would think of Barack Hussein Obama. If his marble statue at the Lincoln Memorial could become flesh and speak, like Galatea,  what would the man who is remembered for freeing the slaves say about his first black successor?'b'It is difficult to say for sure, of course, but one thing we can be fairly certain about is that Lincoln would have been, um, surprised. Lincoln was thoroughly a man of his times, and while he staunchly opposed slavery \xe2\x80\x94 on moral grounds and because it  made competition in the marketplace unfair for poor white men \xe2\x80\x94 for most of his life he harbored fixed and unfortunate ideas about race.'b'Lincoln had a very complex relationship with blacks. Abolition was a fundamental part of Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s moral compass, but equality was not. While he was an early, consistent and formidable foe of slavery, Lincoln had much more ambivalent feelings about blacks themselves, especially about whether they were, or could ever be, truly equal with whites.'b'For example, on Aug. 14, 1862, he invited five black men to the White House to convince them to become the founders of a new nation in Panama consisting of those slaves he was about to free. A month before emancipation became law, he proposed a constitutional amendment guaranteeing financing for blacks who wished to emigrate to Liberia or Haiti.'b'Degrading words, deplored by most white abolitionists, like \xe2\x80\x9cSambo\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCuffee,\xe2\x80\x9d found their way into Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s descriptions of blacks; he even used \xe2\x80\x9cnigger\xe2\x80\x9d several times in speeches. He also liked to tell \xe2\x80\x9cdarkie\xe2\x80\x9d jokes and had a penchant for black-faced minstrel shows. The Lincoln of pre-White House days was a long way from the Great Emancipator; \xe2\x80\x9crecovering racist\xe2\x80\x9d would be closer to the truth.'b'Except for his barber, William Florville,  and William Johnson, a servant from Springfield, Ill., Lincoln didn\xe2\x80\x99t know many of what he referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cvery intelligent\xe2\x80\x9d black people before he moved to the White House. (In 1840, only 116 blacks lived in Springfield, and they were domestics, laborers or slaves.) In fact, if we add up the amount of time he spent with black people who were not servants even after he became president, it probably would not amount to 24 hours.'b'The truth is that successful blacks were almost total strangers to Lincoln, born as he was on the frontier and raised in a state settled by white Southerners. From this perspective, then, Lincoln most probably would have been shocked, perhaps horrified, by Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s election. Like the majority of Northern whites, Lincoln had a vision of America that was largely a white one.'b'Once in office, though, he met with more black leaders than any president before him, including Sojourner Truth (whom he unfortunately addressed as \xe2\x80\x9cAunty\xe2\x80\x9d), Henry Highland Garnet and Martin R. Delany, even if he never invited one to a formal meal. But we also know that Lincoln could recognize exceptional people, regardless of race.'b'As president, he became quite taken with one black man, Frederick Douglass, who initially seems to bear much in common with Barack Obama. Both Mr. Obama and Douglass had one black and one white parent; both rose from humble origins to become famous before age 45; both are among the greatest writers and orators of their generations; and both learned early to use words as powerful weapons. Lincoln, seeing this masterly orator of mixed-race ancestry, would most likely first have been reminded of his exceptional friend, Douglass.'b'Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s respect for Douglass \xe2\x80\x94 the first, and perhaps only, black man he treated as an intellectual equal \xe2\x80\x94 was total. He met with him at the White House three times and once told a colleague that he considered Douglass among the nation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmost meritorious men.\xe2\x80\x9d And just after delivering his second inaugural address, Lincoln asked Douglass  what he thought of the speech, adding that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no man in the country whose opinion I value more than yours.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The fact that Lincoln was no natural friend of the Negroes arguably makes his actions on their behalf all the more impressive, even if they were motivated by the urgent pragmatism of war. He and Douglass were unlikely allies: Douglass was a firebrand in the prophetic tradition, whereas Lincoln \xe2\x80\x94 like Barack Obama \xe2\x80\x94 spoke of pragmatism and post-partisanship. While Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s election may mark the triumph of Douglass\xe2\x80\x99s grand historical project for American race relations, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mark the ascent of another Douglass.'b'Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s great achievement, in the eyes of posterity, was really the outcome of his ingrained pragmatism. The Emancipation Proclamation was born of a certain opportunism (to win the war, Lincoln said, he needed freed slaves to defeat their former masters), and is not a lesser thing for it. Perhaps there is a lesson for Mr. Obama here: those who invoke high ideas and scorn compromise often bring themselves into disrepute. Those whose actions are conditioned by an exquisite sense of frailty, by an understanding that it\xe2\x80\x99s more important to avoid the worst than to attain the best, may better serve those ideals in the end.'b'Is Barack Obama another Abraham Lincoln? Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope not. Greatness \xe2\x80\x94 witness the presidencies of Lincoln, say, and Franklin D. Roosevelt \xe2\x80\x94 is forged in the crucible of disaster. It comes when character is equal to cataclysm. A peacetime Lincoln would have been no Lincoln at all. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope that Mr. Obama, for all of his considerable gifts, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get this particular chance to be great.'b'Barack Obama has written that Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chumble beginnings ... often speak to our own.\xe2\x80\x9d Once Lincoln had recovered from his shock that a descendant of \xe2\x80\x9camalgamation\xe2\x80\x9d (about which he once expressed reservations) had ascended to the presidency, one suspects their mutual embrace of economic independence and natural rights, their love and mastery of the English language, their shared desire to leave their mark on history, and their astonishing gift for pragmatic improvisation, would have drawn him to a man so fundamentally similar to himself.'b'FORTY-ONE years ago, I was blessed to spend the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\xe2\x80\x99s last birthday with him, along with Allard Lowenstein and staff members like Andy Young, Hosea Williams, Dorothy Cotton, James Bevel, James Orange and others. I recall vividly how he spent that day \xe2\x80\x94 and I mention it now because it\xe2\x80\x99s instructive to all of us if we are to follow Dr. King\xe2\x80\x99s example and not just admire him.'b'When Barack Obama is sworn in as the nation\xe2\x80\x99s first African-American president, many will view that moment as the culmination of the modern civil rights movement, a struggle most often identified with Dr. King.'b'It is fitting that Mr. Obama will assume the nation\xe2\x80\x99s highest office one day after we celebrate Dr. King\xe2\x80\x99s birthday. What would Dr. King, who spent much of his life changing conditions so that African-Americans could vote without fear of death or intimidation, think of the rise of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s 44th president?'b'I can say without reservation that he would be beaming. I am equally confident that he would not let the euphoria of the moment blind us to the unfinished business that lies ahead. And he would spell out those challenges in biblical terms: feed the hungry, clothe the naked and study war no more.'b'Dr. King spent his 39th birthday working. I remember him coming to the basement of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. He walked in that day around 9 a.m., after breakfast with his family, wearing blue jeans and a windbreaker. (I recall a bright, sunny day.) He convened the Southern Christian Leadership Conference staff and a rainbow coalition \xe2\x80\x94 blacks from the Deep South, whites from Appalachia, Jewish allies from New York, Latino farm worker organizers \xe2\x80\x94 to plan what would be his last campaign, the Poor People\xe2\x80\x99s March to the nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital. Though Dr. King had met with increasing hostility from the press and government, his mood was upbeat because we were energized by the vision of a new initiative to advance our movement.'b'Around noon Xernona Clayton, a friend of the King family, walked in with a birthday cake. She teased Dr. King, saying that he was \xe2\x80\x9cso busy you forgot to celebrate your own birthday.\xe2\x80\x9d Slightly embarrassed, Dr. King blew out the candles. We must have eaten the cake in record time because it seemed that within moments the plates were cleared and we were back in our meeting \xe2\x80\x94 with Al Lowenstein conducting a workshop about the march and how to step up pressure to end the Vietnam War.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s the model we should follow this week \xe2\x80\x94 and beyond. We should celebrate the election of our new president. And then we should get back to work to complete the unfinished business of making America a more perfect union.'b'With apologies to Billy Joel, who\xe2\x80\x99s more of a chronologist, and in tribute to a president, Barack Hussein Obama, representing a new post-cold-war generation of 21st-century Americans.'b''b'We Didn\xe2\x80\x99t Start the Fire (2)'b''b''b'Bill Clinton, Tina Fey, capitalist China, O.J.,\n'b' Asia rising, Facebook, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\n'b''b' Dick Cheney, Rumsfeld, Ugg boots, Seinfeld\n'b' West Bank, Gaza City, Tupac Amaru Shakur\n'b''b'Mohamed Atta, W.M.D., Harry Potter, Reality TV\n'b' Tom Cruise, American Beauty, MP3, Oprah Winfrey\n'b''b'Schwarzenegger, YouTube, America\xe2\x80\x99s got organic food\n'b' Armstrong, blogosphere, Monica Lewinsky\n'b''b''b' We didn\xe2\x80\x99t start the fire'b'\n'b''b' It was always burning'b'\n'b''b' Since the world\xe2\x80\x99s been turning'b'\n'b''b' We didn\xe2\x80\x99t start the fire'b'\n'b''b' No we didn\xe2\x80\x99t light it'b'\n'b''b' But we tried to fight it'b'\n'b''b'Vlad Putin, Medvedev, Assad, Posh-and-Becks\n'b' The West Wing, Y2K, massacre in Falluja\n'b''b'Britney Spears, Spike Lee, Kurt Cobain, Sarkozy\n'b' Mia Hamm, Heath Ledger, Viagra, Napster\n'b''b'Lindsay Lohan, skinny jeans, Boston\xe2\x80\x99s got a winning team\n'b' Lehman Brothers, A.I.G., subprime, Ponzi scheme\n'b''b'Rwanda, Darfur, Bosnia, and a billion poor,\n'b' Tehran, Hezbollah, trouble with the jihadis\n'b''b''b' We didn\xe2\x80\x99t start the fire'b'\n'b''b' It was always burning'b'\n'b''b' Since the world\xe2\x80\x99s been turning'b'\n'b''b' We didn\xe2\x80\x99t start the fire'b'\n'b''b' No we didn\xe2\x80\x99t light it'b'\n'b''b' But we tried to fight it'b'\n'b''b' New Orleans, Bola\xc3\xb1o, Sarah Palin no-go\n'b' TiVo, Hu Jintao, and the vegan-eco crowd\n'b''b'Tony Blair, Paris Hilton, Princess Di, Bin Laden\n'b' Pyongyang, the renditions gang, Roger Clemens in a cloud\n'b''b'ACT UP, Infinite Jest, O.J.

The congregants did so, it seemed to me, as we read, \xe2\x80\x9cOur God and God of our ancestors: We ask your blessings for our country \xe2\x80\x94 for its government, for its leaders and advisers, and for all who exercise just and rightful authority ...\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Barack Obama will assume that just and rightful authority at noon on Tuesday. After a dinner with him that I attended last week, as we said our goodbyes, I overheard one of my fellow conservatives say softly to the president-elect, \xe2\x80\x9cSir, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be praying for you.\xe2\x80\x9d Obama seemed to pause as they shook hands, and to thank him more earnestly than he did those of us who simply \xe2\x80\x94 and sincerely \xe2\x80\x94 wished him well.'b'The incoming president is the man of the moment. He deserves good wishes and sincere prayers. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve found myself thinking these last few days more about the man who has shouldered the burdens of office for the past eight years, George W. Bush.'b'He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my favorite among Republicans in 2000. He has made mistakes as president, and has limitations as a leader. But he has exercised his just and rightful authority in a way \xe2\x80\x94 I believe \xe2\x80\x94 that deserves recognition and respect.'b'It will probably be a while before he gets much of either. In synagogue, right after the prayer for our country, there is a prayer for the state of Israel, asking the \xe2\x80\x9crock and redeemer of the people Israel\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cspread over it the shelter of your peace.\xe2\x80\x9d As we recited this on Saturday, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but reflect that a distressingly small number of my fellow Jews seem to have given much thought at all to the fact that President Bush is one of the greatest friends the state of Israel \xe2\x80\x94 and, yes, the Jewish people \xe2\x80\x94 have had in quite a while. Bush stood with Israel when he had no political incentive to do so and received no political benefit from doing so. He was criticized by much of the world. He did it because he thought it the right thing to do.'b'He has been denounced for this, as Israel has been denounced for doing what it judged necessary to defend itself. The liberal sage Bill Moyers has been a harsh critic of Bush. On Jan. 9, on PBS, he also lambasted Israel for what he called its \xe2\x80\x9cstate terrorism,\xe2\x80\x9d its \xe2\x80\x9cwaging war on an entire population\xe2\x80\x9d in Gaza. He traced this Israeli policy back to the Bible, where \xe2\x80\x9cGod-soaked violence became genetically coded,\xe2\x80\x9d apparently in both Arabs and Jews. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t presume to say what is and isn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cgenetically coded\xe2\x80\x9d in Moyers\xe2\x80\x99s respectable Protestant genes. But I\xe2\x80\x99m glad it was George W. Bush calling the shots over the last eight years, not someone well-thought of by Moyers.'b'Many of Bush\xe2\x80\x99s defenders have praised him for keeping the country safe since Sept. 11, 2001. He deserves that praise, and I\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly happy to defend most of his surveillance, interrogation and counterterrorism policies against his critics.'b'But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think keeping us safe has been Bush\xe2\x80\x99s most impressive achievement. That was winning the war in Iraq, and in particular, his refusal to accept defeat when so many counseled him to do so in late 2006. His ordering the surge of troops to Iraq in January 2007 was an act of personal courage and of presidential leadership. The results have benefited both Iraq and the United States. And the outcome in Iraq is a remarkable gift to the incoming president, who now only has to sustain success, rather than trying to deal with the consequences in the region and around the world of a humiliating withdrawal and a devastating defeat.'b'The cost of the war in Iraq, and in Afghanistan, has been great. Last Wednesday afternoon, in the midst of all the other activities of the final week of an administration, Bush had 40 or so families of fallen soldiers to the White House. The staff had set aside up to two hours. Bush, a man who normally keeps to schedule, spent over four hours meeting in small groups with the family members of those who had fallen in battle.'b'This past weekend Barack Obama added to his itinerary a visit to Arlington National Cemetery. Obama knows that he, too, will be a war president. He knows the decisions he makes as commander in chief will be his most consequential. And so on Sunday morning, before going to church, he placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns and stood silently as taps was sounded. The somber tableau provided quite a contrast to all the hubbub and talk of the last few days. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s silent tribute captured a deeper truth, and \xe2\x80\x94 I dare say \xe2\x80\x94 a more fundamental hope, than could any speech.'b'From plug-in cars to carbon capture to wind farms linked to \xe2\x80\x9cintelligent\xe2\x80\x9d power grids, many of the solutions pitched to restructure the country\xe2\x80\x99s energy system and confront global warming rely on a faith in high tech: we expect, or at least hope, that an Apollo project, the energy equivalent of the 'b'dot.com'b' revolution or some other burst of creative genius will engineer the problem away.'b'Obviously, game-changing technologies will play a big role in cutting America\xe2\x80\x99s consumption of fossil fuels. They will also be essential to achieving the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that most scientists think will be necessary to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. But as it frames its strategy to deal with both problems, the Obama administration cannot overlook the low-hanging fruit \xe2\x80\x94 the gains to be had from making existing technologies more efficient.'b'The plain truth is that the United States is an inefficient user of energy. For each dollar of economic product, the United States spews more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than 93 of 137 countries tracked in the indicators of the International Energy Agency. Those doing better include not only cutting-edge nations like Japan but low-tech countries like Thailand and Mexico.'b'True, energy efficiency has improved, especially in states like California. But American drivers, households and businesses still use more energy than those in most other rich countries to do the same thing. The United States spends more energy to produce a ton of cement clinker than Canada, Mexico and even China. It is one of the most energy-intensive makers of pulp and paper, emitting more than three times as much carbon dioxide per ton as Brazil and twice as much as South Korea.'b'Per-capita carbon dioxide emissions by households in the United States and Canada are the highest in the world \xe2\x80\x94 in part because of bigger homes. And the energy efficiency of electricity production from fossil fuels is lower in the United States than in most rich countries and some poor ones, mainly because of the higher share of coal in the mix.'b'Transportation tells the same story. The United States uses the most energy per passenger mile among the 18 rich economies surveyed by the energy agency. In 2006, the American auto fleet used, on average, a little less than five gallons of gas to travel 100 miles. The Irish went the same distance with under four gallons, the Italians with less than three, basically because they use smaller cars that get better mileage.'b'The Union of Concerned Scientists points out that switching from an S.U.V. that gets 14 miles per gallon to one that gets 16 would save the same amount of fuel as swapping a 35-mile-a-gallon car for a 51-m.p.g. new generation gas-sipper. This is not an argument for more S.U.V.\xe2\x80\x99s. It simply shows that we can wring savings from modest efficiency gains in products we already use.'b'A study by McKinsey &amp; Company last year argued that most of the carbon abatement needed between now and 2030 could be achieved with existing technologies, things like insulating homes, improving fuel efficiency, and switching to concentrated laundry detergents to reduce packaging and transport costs. Merely improving transmissions would vastly increase fuel economy.'b'A quantum jump in energy efficiency will still require political leadership. Cheap energy has kept America from making the necessary investments. Yet they must be made; neither the country nor the atmosphere can wait for high tech to ride to the rescue.'b'The United Arab Emirates has bested other oil-rich Persian Gulf countries by becoming the first to conclude a legally binding nuclear cooperation agreement with the Bush administration. It deserves even greater congratulations for forswearing uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing. Those are the key processes for making fuel for nuclear reactors \xe2\x80\x94 or nuclear weapons.'b'Many countries have these agreements \xe2\x80\x94 known in the business as 123\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 with Washington, which allow them to buy American nuclear reactors and fuel. But none have made that important concession.'b'Under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, all members in good standing have the right to make their own fuel. But the temptations are considerable and the technology far too easy to divert (see Iran).'b'That is why the U.A.E\xe2\x80\x99s choice is so especially important, and why other nuclear suppliers should be encouraging their clients to make the same choice.'b'Nuclear energy is one way to address climate change, and developing countries \xe2\x80\x94 that agree to international rules for inspections \xe2\x80\x94 must have the same access to nuclear technology as the developed world.'b'President Bush promoted nuclear energy with gusto but notably failed to develop a strategy to ensure that a proliferation of nuclear power would not also lead to a proliferation of nuclear weapons. Mr. Obama and the new Congress must do better.'b'More than 25 nations plan to build nuclear power plants for the first time. That includes Saudi Arabia, which is negotiating its own cooperation deal with Washington.'b'Many of these countries say they must diversify to meet future energy needs. And the major nuclear suppliers are only too eager to compete for their business.'b'Too often these countries ignore serious questions about whether more nuclear plants will pose new safety and waste disposal hazards, and whether their clients\xe2\x80\x99 sudden enthusiasm is driven less by concerns about global warming or declining oil reserves and more by rising fears of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear ambitions and appetites for their own weapons programs.'b'Congress must review the U.A.E. deal before it is finalized. Some lawmakers have raised worrisome questions about goods with military or potential nuclear- related uses moving through Dubai, one of the emirates, to Iran. Officials there must explain how they plan to strengthen their export controls. If not, Congress may have to slow its approval or place tougher restrictions on the 123 agreement until it is sure that American technology sold to the U.A.E. cannot be diverted.'b'There is also something unsettling about the slick lobbying campaign the U.A.E. has mounted to push the deal through quickly.'b'The agreement sets an important and welcome new standard. But Congress must exercise due diligence with this agreement and all of the others that will follow.'b'Lasantha Wickramatunga, an extraordinarily courageous journalist, wrote his own obituary. After he was murdered on Jan. 8, his letter from the grave appeared in papers all over the world including his own, The Sunday Leader in Sri Lanka.'b'His farewell piece is not only a painful explanation of why another brave journalist would die while trying to publish truths that most people are afraid to whisper. It is also a powerful indictment of the increasingly brutal Sri Lankan government, which runs one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a journalist.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo other profession calls on its practitioners to lay down their lives for their art save the armed forces and, in Sri Lanka, journalism,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote in his last editorial, to be published on his death.'b'The Committee to Protect Journalists, which has reported eight journalists killed in Sri Lanka in the last two years, has called for a nonpartisan investigation and diplomatic pressure on Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, to investigate this latest killing. Instead of pursuing those who killed Mr. Wickramatunga, some in the Sri Lankan government have cynically begun suggesting the journalist\xe2\x80\x99s death has benefited the Tamil rebels and others who oppose the Rajapaksa-run state.'b'Mr. Wickramatunga\xe2\x80\x99s final essay catalogs the troubles journalists have suffered in his country \xe2\x80\x94 bombings, killings and coercion \xe2\x80\x94 all while trying to tell about corruption in government and civil rights abuses during an extended civil war. But in a larger sense, his farewell helps explain why some people are willing to give up easier lives to pursue the business of truth-telling.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy then do we do it?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wickramatunga\xe2\x80\x99s farewell letter asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI often wonder that. After all, I, too, am a husband, and the father of three wonderful children. Is it worth the risk? Many people tell me it is not.\xe2\x80\x9d He then explained why he and so many other journalists take on these jobs around the world, even though more than 700 of their colleagues have been killed since 1992 while trying to film, record or write honestly about what was going on around them.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a calling that is yet above high office, fame, lucre and security,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wickramatunga wrote before he died for his principles. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the call of conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In a recent interview, George Steel, the newly appointed head of the New York City Opera, said of the opera, \xe2\x80\x9cNew York is unthinkable without it.\xe2\x80\x9d And yet it was a very close call.'b'The City Opera has been plagued with woes: a failed search for a new home downtown, the disastrously brief tenure of the company\xe2\x80\x99s last director, Gerard Mortier, and an entire season in the dark while its future home \xe2\x80\x94 the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center \xe2\x80\x94 is being renovated. Whatever else we hope for from Mr. Steel, we hope for stability first.'b'He has his work cut out for him. He will have to struggle to keep the chorus and the orchestra on salary while there are essentially no revenues. And he is facing a fund-raising and endowment crisis, like almost every other institution on the planet.'b'The operatic ground has also shifted in recent years. City Opera used to be a roguish young company compared with the grand dame of Joseph Volpe\xe2\x80\x99s Metropolitan Opera. But Peter Gelb\xe2\x80\x99s Met is staging vibrant, often hip productions that will compete directly for the City Opera audience. We hope that Mr. Steel will hurl himself at these problems with all the passion of an operatic tenor, if perhaps more focus and business sense.'b'His task will be not just to raise money and inspire his company. As he begins to take the measure of the board that hired him, we suspect he may also see the necessity of strengthening that board. New York deserves two opera companies running at the peak of their creative energies. We will be delighted when the day comes when Mr. Steel and his City Opera are ready to challenge Mr. Gelb and the Met to a true operatic duel.'b'Old-fashioned voodoo economics  \xe2\x80\x94 the belief in tax-cut magic  \xe2\x80\x94 has been banished from civilized discourse. The supply-side cult has shrunk to the point that it contains only cranks, charlatans, and Republicans.'b'But recent news reports suggest that many influential people, including Federal Reserve officials, bank regulators, and, possibly, members of the incoming Obama administration, have become devotees of a new kind of voodoo: the belief that by performing elaborate financial rituals we can keep dead banks walking.'b'To explain the issue, let me describe the position of a hypothetical bank that I\xe2\x80\x99ll call Gothamgroup, or Gotham for short.'b'On paper, Gotham has $2 trillion in assets and $1.9 trillion in liabilities, so that it has a net worth of $100 billion. But a substantial fraction of its assets \xe2\x80\x94 say, $400 billion worth \xe2\x80\x94 are mortgage-backed securities and other toxic waste. If the bank tried to sell these assets, it would get no more than $200 billion.'b'So Gotham is a zombie bank: it\xe2\x80\x99s still operating, but the reality is that it has already gone bust. Its stock isn\xe2\x80\x99t totally worthless \xe2\x80\x94 it still has a market capitalization of $20 billion \xe2\x80\x94 but that value is entirely based on the hope that shareholders will be rescued by a government bailout.'b'Why would the government bail Gotham out? Because it plays a central role in the financial system. When Lehman was allowed to fail, financial markets froze, and for a few weeks the world economy teetered on the edge of collapse. Since we don\xe2\x80\x99t want a repeat performance, Gotham has to be kept functioning. But how can that be done?'b'Well, the government could simply give Gotham a couple of hundred billion dollars, enough to make it solvent again. But this would, of course, be a huge gift to Gotham\xe2\x80\x99s current shareholders \xe2\x80\x94 and it would also encourage excessive risk-taking in the future. Still, the possibility of such a gift is what\xe2\x80\x99s now  supporting Gotham\xe2\x80\x99s stock price.'b'A better approach would be to do what the government did with zombie savings and loans at the end of the 1980s: it seized the defunct banks, cleaning out the shareholders. Then it transferred their bad assets to a special institution, the Resolution Trust Corporation; paid off enough of the banks\xe2\x80\x99 debts to make them solvent; and sold the fixed-up banks to new owners.'b'The current buzz suggests, however, that policy makers aren\xe2\x80\x99t willing to take either of these approaches. Instead, they\xe2\x80\x99re reportedly gravitating toward a compromise approach: moving toxic waste from private banks\xe2\x80\x99 balance sheets to a publicly owned \xe2\x80\x9cbad bank\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9caggregator bank\xe2\x80\x9d that would resemble the Resolution Trust Corporation, but without seizing the banks first.'b'Sheila Bair, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, recently tried to describe how this would work: \xe2\x80\x9cThe aggregator bank would buy the assets at fair value.\xe2\x80\x9d But what does \xe2\x80\x9cfair value\xe2\x80\x9d mean?'b'In my example, Gothamgroup is insolvent because the alleged $400 billion of toxic waste on its books is actually worth only $200 billion. The only way a government purchase of that toxic waste can make Gotham solvent again is if the government pays much more than private buyers are willing to offer.'b'Now, maybe private buyers aren\xe2\x80\x99t willing to pay what toxic waste is really worth: \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t have really any rational pricing right now for some of these asset categories,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Bair says. But should the government be in the business of declaring that it knows better than the market what assets are worth? And is it really likely that paying \xe2\x80\x9cfair value,\xe2\x80\x9d whatever that means, would be enough to make Gotham solvent again?'b'What I suspect is that policy makers \xe2\x80\x94 possibly without realizing it \xe2\x80\x94 are gearing up to attempt a bait-and-switch: a policy that looks like the cleanup of the savings and loans,  but in practice amounts to making huge gifts to bank shareholders at taxpayer expense, disguised as \xe2\x80\x9cfair value\xe2\x80\x9d purchases of toxic assets.'b'Why go through these contortions? The answer seems to be that Washington remains deathly afraid of the N-word \xe2\x80\x94 nationalization. The truth is that Gothamgroup and its sister institutions are already wards of the state, utterly dependent on taxpayer support; but nobody wants to recognize that fact and implement the obvious solution: an explicit, though temporary, government takeover. Hence the popularity of the new voodoo, which claims, as I said, that elaborate financial rituals can reanimate dead banks.'b'Unfortunately, the price of this retreat into superstition may be high. I hope I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong, but I suspect that taxpayers are about to get another raw deal \xe2\x80\x94 and that we\xe2\x80\x99re about to get another financial rescue plan that fails to do the job.'b'To the Editor:'b'As discussed in your Jan. 9 editorial \xe2\x80\x9cCuddly Welcome for Mr. Daschle,\xe2\x80\x9d the recent Senate confirmation hearing for our next secretary of health and human services was full of good feelings, but fixing our dysfunctional health care system will take courage and willingness to lead fundamental change.'b'As Mr. Daschle knows, more that two-thirds of each health care dollar is spent on episodes of preventable late-stage chronic disease.

There is nothing in the plan, as yet, to stop foreclosures on Americans\xe2\x80\x99 homes.'b'Such an omission was understandable when the package was conceived mainly as stimulus, which implies short-term action to jolt the economy.

Mr. Obama supported such a bankruptcy amendment during his campaign. Committees in both the House and Senate each passed a bankruptcy amendment last year.

Imagine if he could somehow be seated in a place of honor at the inauguration alongside Dr. King and Mr. Wilkins and Mr. Young. Imagine the stories and the mutual teasing and the laughter, and the deep emotion that would accompany their attempts to rise above their collective disbelief at the astonishing changes they did so much to bring about.'b'And then imagine a tall white man being ushered into their presence, and the warm smiles of recognition from the big four \xe2\x80\x94 and probably tears \xe2\x80\x94 for someone who has been shamefully neglected by his nation and his party, Lyndon Johnson.'b'Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s contributions to the betterment of American life were nothing short of monumental. For blacks, he opened the door to the American mainstream with a herculean effort that resulted in the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He followed up that bit of mastery with the Voting Rights Act of 1965.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOnce the black man\xe2\x80\x99s voice could be translated into ballots,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson would say, \xe2\x80\x9cmany other breakthroughs would follow.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Without Lyndon Johnson, Barack Obama and so many others would have traveled a much more circumscribed path.'b'I wish Johnson could be there, his commitment to civil rights so publicly vindicated, his eyes no doubt misting as the oath of office is administered.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s so easy, now that the moronic face of racism is so seldom openly displayed, to forget how far we\xe2\x80\x99ve really come. When Dr. King delivered his \xe2\x80\x9cI Have a Dream Speech\xe2\x80\x9d at the Lincoln Memorial in 1963, it was illegal, just a stone\xe2\x80\x99s throw away in Virginia, for whites and blacks to marry. Illegal! Just as it is illegal now for gays to marry.'b'Less than a month after the speech, members of the Ku Klux Klan bombed a black church in Birmingham, Ala., where children had gathered for a prayer service. Four girls were killed. Three were 14 years old, and one was 11.'b'My sister, Sandy, and I, growing up in Montclair, N.J., a suburb of New York City, were protected from the harshest rays of racism by a family that would let nothing, least of all some crazy notion of genetic superiority, soil our view of the world or ourselves.'b'My grandparents, who struggled through the Depression and World War II, and my parents, who worked tirelessly to give Sandy and me a wonderful upbringing in the postwar decades, seemed always to have believed that all good things were possible.'b'Even if the doors of opportunity were closed, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe they were locked. Hard work, in their eyes, was always the key.'b'Still, the idea of a black president of the United States never came up. Perhaps even for them that was too much to imagine. I wish they could have stayed around long enough to see it.'b'In 1962, Daniel Bell published a book called \xe2\x80\x9cThe End of Ideology.\xe2\x80\x9d The title struck a nerve because it reflected the view, common at the time, that the United States was about to leave behind the brutal, ideological politics that had characterized the 1930s and the early cold war. The 1960s, it was believed, would be a decade of cool pragmatism. Keynesian models would be used to scientifically regulate the economy. Important decisions would be made empirically.'b'Instead, we got what Francis Fukuyama later called The Great Disruption. The information economy began to disrupt the industrial economy. The feminist revolution disrupted gender and family relations. The civil rights revolution disrupted social arrangements. The Vietnam War discredited the establishment.'b'These disruptions were generally necessary and good, but the transition was painful. People lost faith in old social norms, but new ones had not yet emerged. The result was disorder. Divorce rates skyrocketed. Crime rates exploded. Faith in institutions collapsed. Social trust cratered.'b'As community bonds dissolved, individual autonomy asserted itself. Liberals championed the moral liberation of individuals. Conservatives championed their economic liberation. The combined result was a loss of community and social cohesion, and what Christopher Lasch called a culture of narcissism.'b'Instead of ending ideology, the Great Disruption produced ideological politics. The weakening of social norms led to fierce battles as groups vied to create new ones. Personal became political. Groups fought over basic patterns of morality.'b'Republicans tended to win elections because liberals were associated with disorder and conservatives with attempts to restore it. Yet both sides were infected with the same pulverizing style. Politics wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just about allocating resources. It was a contest over values, lifestyles and the status of your tribe. This venomous style dominated politics straight through the two baby boomer presidencies \xe2\x80\x94 of Clinton and Bush.'b'But societies do mend themselves, slowly and organically. In 2002, Rick Warren wrote a phenomenally popular book called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Purpose Driven Life.\xe2\x80\x9d The first sentence was, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not about you.\xe2\x80\x9d That was a sign that the age of expressive individualism was coming to an end. New community patterns and social norms were coalescing.'b'Crime rates had begun to fall, along with teen pregnancy rates and a rash of other social indicators. Young people flocked to perform community service. Couples created families that sought to harvest the gains of feminism while preserving the best of traditionalism.'b'In the cultural realm, the Great Disruption came to an end. New social norms and patterns settled into place. Barack Obama exemplifies the social repair. The product of a scattered family, he has created a highly traditional one, headed by two professionally accomplished adults. To an almost eerie extent, he exemplifies discipline, equipoise and self-control. Under his leadership, as Peter Beinart noted in Time, Democrats came to seem like the party of order while Republicans were associated with disorder.'b'Obama\xe2\x80\x99s challenge will be to translate the social repair that has occurred over the past decade into political and governing repair. Part of that will be done with his inaugural address today. Look for him to emphasize the themes of responsibility, cohesion and unity. Look for him to reject the culture, which lingered in the financial world, of anything goes.'b'Part of that will be done with his governing style. Obama aims to realize the end-of-ideology politics that Daniel Bell and others glimpsed in the early 1960s. He sees himself as a pragmatist, an empiricist. Politics is not personal with him. He does not turn political disagreements into a status contest between one kind of person and another. He is convinced that most Americans practice their politics between the 40-yard lines.'b'Part will be accomplished with his aggressive outreach efforts. Already he has cooperated with Republicans. He has rejected the counsel of the old liberal warriors who want retribution and insularity.'b'But the real test will come in the realm of policy. The next few months will be occupied with the stimulus package. And anybody who is not terrified by the prospect of spending $800 billion hastily has not spent enough time studying the difference between economic textbooks and the way government actually operates.'b'But after that, folks in the Obama camp hope to create a Grand Bargain. That would mean building on a culture of cohesion and tackling the issues that require joint sacrifice \xe2\x80\x94 like reducing deficits, fixing Medicare and Social Security and reforming health care. These problems were insoluble during the era of division and distrust. In the climactic season of his presidency, the winter of 2010, Obama would seek to fundamentally restore balance to American government.'b'If he can do that, the Great Disruption would truly be over. The next chapter in American history would begin on firmer ground.'b'Washington'b'THE past few weeks have been a time to reflect on the legacy of the Bush administration. It has not been a kind time for George W. Bush. Most analyses have been harsh, raking him over the coals for everything from Hurricane Katrina to Abu Ghraib to the financial meltdown to his advocacy of nearly unfettered executive power. I would join in many of those criticisms. But there is one area where President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s legacy will be strong and admirable \xe2\x80\x94 the way he is leaving office.'b'Presidential transitions are always difficult. The United States has an extraordinarily long three-month interregnum during which the person departing the presidency retains full power while the person elected to assume the office waits to take over. I have likened it to a man who moves in with his fianc\xc3\xa9e \xe2\x80\x94 while her soon-to-be former husband still lives in the house. This awkwardness combines with the natural tension between the old and new over policy and personnel that exists even when the outgoing and incoming presidents are in the same party (ask members  of George H. W. Bush and Ronald Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s staffs about the 1988 transition).'b'For an outgoing president, there is always some resentment that the new guy is expected to act as president starting the day after the election; everyone anticipates his policies and ignores the actions of the lame duck. The president is often skittish about providing the newcomer with  top-secret information, in part because the new team is not formally in place. For the president-elect, the outgoing president\xe2\x80\x99s 11th-hour actions, including appointments of his loyalists to career positions, stir resentment.'b'Incoming members of a president-elect\xe2\x80\x99s team often encounter sullenness from their outgoing counterparts, or a false eagerness by some who don\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave their posts at all.'b'Beginning well before the election, President Bush and his chief of staff, Josh Bolten, decided to make this transition different by removing many of the usual obstacles and fostering  cooperation and harmony. President Bush created a formal transition council, headed by Mr. Bolten and including all the people in charge of national security and the economy in his administration, and this group has met regularly to address every action, large and small, that needs to be taken to turn over power.'b'The signals went beyond simple cooperation. Mr. Bolten and Clay Johnson, from the Office of Management and Budget, who had worked on the transition when President Bush came to the White House, expedited the security checks and other administrative processes for Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s nominees. National security briefings were held with the president-elect in Chicago, and a high level of important information was shared with his top aides even before they were assigned to specific posts. It is also clear that Mr. Bush has agreed to make a few difficult or unpopular decisions on his way out so as not to burden Mr. Obama with them \xe2\x80\x94 for example, his request last week that Congress release the second half of the $700 financial billion bailout.'b'To be sure, President Bush has signed some last-minute executive orders, especially in the environmental area, that will create headaches for Mr. Obama. But as a top Obama transition official told me, these were limited in number and scope and all done in the open.'b'A good piece of the credit for the smooth transition is also due to the Obama transition team. But it was important for President Bush to be accommodating, given the nature of this transition, occurring as it does during a time of war and economic crisis. The nation can little afford a rocky transfer of power. America also faces threats from terrorists and other adversaries, and the first few months of a new administration can be a vulnerable time for the nation \xe2\x80\x94 when the full national security and economic teams are not yet in place and no crisis decision-making process has been established.'b'The Bush administration may be leaving the country with big policy problems. But George W. Bush deserves a big gold star for the way he is leaving his office.'b'There was no shortage of powerful imagery on Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Inauguration Day, starting with the confident man who defied all political conventions \xe2\x80\x94 that he was too young, too inexperienced, too black or not black enough \xe2\x80\x94 to stand on the steps of the Capitol and take the oath of office in a city and a country that are still racially divided in many shameful ways.'b'And there was the crowd that for a day, and we hope much longer, defied those divisions. By the hundreds of thousands they came from every part of a nation that has rarely been in such peril and yet is so optimistic about its new leader.'b'In his Inaugural Address, President Obama gave them the clarity and the respect for which all Americans have hungered. In about 20 minutes, he swept away eight years of President George Bush\xe2\x80\x99s false choices and failed policies and promised to recommit to America\xe2\x80\x99s most cherished ideals.'b'With Mr. Bush looking on (and we\xe2\x80\x99d like to think feeling some remorse),  President  Obama declared: \xe2\x80\x9cOn this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord. On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn- out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The speech was not programmatic, nor was it filled with as much soaring language as F.D.R.\xe2\x80\x99s first Inaugural Address or John Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s only one. But it left no doubt how Mr. Obama sees the nation\xe2\x80\x99s problems and how he intends to fix them and, unlike Mr. Bush, the necessary sacrifices he will ask of all Americans.'b'The American story \xe2\x80\x9chas not been the path for  the faint-hearted, for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame,\xe2\x80\x9d he  said.'b'Just as he reshaped the Democratic Party to win its nomination, and the American electorate to defeat John McCain, Mr. Obama said he intended to reshape government so it will truly serve its citizens.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe question we ask today is not whether our  government is too big or too small, but whether it works, whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Mr. Obama was unsparing in condemning the failed ideology of uncontrolled markets. He said the current economic crisis showed how \xe2\x80\x9cwithout a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control\xe2\x80\x9d and that the nation has to extend the reach of prosperity to \xe2\x80\x9cevery willing heart, not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Obama also did not shrink from the early criticism of his ambitious economic recovery plan. Rather, he said the \xe2\x80\x9cstate of our economy calls for action, bold and swift,\xe2\x80\x9d to build roads and bridges and electrical power and digital networks, to transform schools, and \xe2\x80\x9charness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'After more than seven years of Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s using fear and xenophobia to justify a disastrous and unnecessary war, and undermine the most fundamental American rights, it was exhilarating to hear Mr. Obama reject \xe2\x80\x9cas false the choice between our safety and our ideals.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Instead of Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s unilateralism, Mr. Obama said the United States is \xe2\x80\x9cready to lead once more,\xe2\x80\x9d by making itself a \xe2\x80\x9cfriend of each nation and every man, woman and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity.\xe2\x80\x9d He said \xe2\x80\x9cour power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama told the Muslim world that he wants \xe2\x80\x9ca new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Obama was steely toward those \xe2\x80\x9cwho seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents.\xe2\x80\x9d He warned them that \xe2\x80\x9cour spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.\xe2\x80\x9d But where Mr. Bush painted this as an epochal, almost biblical battle between America and those who hate us and \xe2\x80\x9cwho hate freedom,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama also offered to \xe2\x80\x9cextend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As the day continued with a parade and parties and  balls, the image that stayed with us was the way the 44th president managed to embrace the symbolism and rise above it. It filled us with hope that with Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s help, this battered nation will be able to draw together and mend itself.'b'To the Editor:'b'On Tuesday, Barack Obama became the 44th president of the United States.  That he is the first African-American president of a country that only a handful of generations ago fought a bloody civil war that abolished slavery, and only 50 years ago struggled in the streets to bring civil rights to all citizens whatever their color, is a testament to something very good going on in America.'b'The grip of fear, cultural tyranny and bigotry itself has weakened and loosened to a point where, truly, the words of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. take on a new and powerful meaning, \xe2\x80\x9cLet freedom ring.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'These are hard times for people and our country. War, economic faltering and collapse in some areas, the threat of terrorism \xe2\x80\x94 these and more can bring fear and uncertainty to every citizen of this country.'b'There is much to be learned, much to be improved, there is hardship ahead as there was years ago and always will be. And in this struggle the Lord continues to work to bring us opportunities to strive for Him and do the right thing, to grow, to reach for a better life not just without, but a spiritual life within, which honors God, one another and strives to bring good will, respect and honor to all human beings, because they are human beings.'b'Take a moment this week to reflect on this historic inauguration of our 44th president. Perhaps this is a moment in history, within a time of uncertainty, to see a light shine, brighter than before, reflecting in the faces of all people, of all backgrounds and colors, bringing just a little more hope and faith and genuine charity to this world.

We hope that they choose a leader  who is truly committed to negotiating peace with the Palestinians. That will require some very difficult concessions. But it is the only way to guarantee their country\xe2\x80\x99s lasting security.'b'The cease-fire gives President Obama some breathing room to consider how the Gaza war affects prospects for a new peace initiative \xe2\x80\x94 but not a lot. The new president has said he will work for a peace deal from Day 1 and we hope he means it.'b'It will require a commitment to be more evenhanded, creative and energetic in encouraging Israelis and Palestinians toward peace. It could also benefit from a diverse American negotiating team with considerable expertise in the Arab and Islamic world.'b'We were encouraged to hear Secretary of State-designate Hillary Clinton say at  her Senate confirmation hearing last week that \xe2\x80\x9cwe cannot give up on peace\xe2\x80\x9d even after repeated failed attempts. The previous administration barely tried. This administration has its work cut out for it.'b'Washington'b'Four hours before the inauguration, there was enough menace in a subway crowd \xe2\x80\x94 a shouting throng packed together with the exits jammed \xe2\x80\x94 that the station master made a bad choice of announcement. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t panic!\xe2\x80\x9d he bellowed over the public address system.'b'In seconds, he recovered with a brilliant follow-up, a rhythmic incanting: \xe2\x80\x9cO-ba-ma!\xe2\x80\x9d The crowd picked it up instantly. \xe2\x80\x9cO-ba-ma! O-ba-ma!\xe2\x80\x9d Patience and celebration were restored until the crush could ease.'b'All the long day, it was like that. The new president\xe2\x80\x99s name, simply his name, was just the restorative the enormous crowds needed.'b'Is there a problem in the nation? Hear ordinary Americans chant: \xe2\x80\x9cO-ba-ma!\xe2\x80\x9d One tedious, serpentine line outside the Mall, its restlessness surfacing, suddenly was prodded into happiness when teenagers broke into song: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re off to see Obama \xe2\x80\x94 the wonderful president of ours!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The crowd \xe2\x80\x94 dense and chilled, vital and hopeful \xe2\x80\x94 was the place to be for savoring this day\xe2\x80\x99s history. There was no way not to sense, inevitably to join in, the joy that seemed to roll as a singular force across the Mall and out to the watching nation.'b'In saluting \xe2\x80\x9cour patchwork heritage,\xe2\x80\x9d President Obama could have been describing his audience that stretched back toward the Lincoln Memorial \xe2\x80\x94 a splendid array of skin color, assembled pride and historic sharing that put a fresh gleam on that well-worn notion of American politics, integration.'b'Beyond celebrating Lincoln and emancipation, the throngs included tribes of American Indians celebrating \xe2\x80\x94 oh yes, \xe2\x80\x9cO-ba-ma!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 like victorious conventioneers in their burnished regalia at a hotel party Monday night. Downtown, bars were booming under a sliver of moon on a cold night. The Metro trains were busy with travelers in gowns and tuxes. One young African-American father rode almost dreamily, his thoughts somewhere else as he repeatedly kissed the forehead of his child.'b'The next day, under the inaugural sunshine, just as the president took the oath, a bearded black man in a fur coat shouted with a near gasp: \xe2\x80\x9cYou the man!\xe2\x80\x9d Some in the crowd had to caper \xe2\x80\x94 two women doing the cancan and waving a sign: \xe2\x80\x9cYes we Can-Can!\xe2\x80\x9d But others quietly showed tears. Anyone in the crowd had to hope the new president, for all his careful warning about hard times, got a sense of how the public rooted for him on Day 1.'b'The inaugural crowd of Ronald Reagan had its own joy and made a great scene 28 years ago. But that felt much more about one party\xe2\x80\x99s victory, particularly when he denounced government itself as the problem, not the solution.'b'That remains a shocking notion in a democracy, and Mr. Obama took aim at it. He summoned the throng before him, and the nation all about, to abandon the \xe2\x80\x9cstale political arguments that have consumed us for so long.\xe2\x80\x9d Show that government does indeed work, was his prescription, yoking the fortunes of both public and president. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off,\xe2\x80\x9d said President Obama, touching the crowd\xe2\x80\x99s craving for something basic, something lately untried.'b'The Obama speech patterns became a separate source of celebration, the way John F. Kennedy imitators used to do \xe2\x80\x9cvi-gah\xe2\x80\x9d salutes. After the speech, a man happily walking a bridge back to Virginia as the best way home suddenly tried an Obama riff on his friends. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must walk the bridge built by our ancestors! We will find it long and hard! And we will confront Exit 10 C \xe2\x80\x94 wherever it leads!\xe2\x80\x9d His friends laughed and shared the pleasure of having heard firsthand President Obama in his opening hour.'b'Farther ahead on the bridge, a man who came up from Georgia to hear Mr. Obama said he\xe2\x80\x99ll be grateful forever to have been in that crowd on the Mall. He said his new president didn\xe2\x80\x99t pull punches in convincing him that \xe2\x80\x9cthis winter of our hardship\xe2\x80\x9d will be seasons long. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be alright,\xe2\x80\x9d the Georgian firmly insisted as the inaugural crowd dispersed out toward home and the future.'b'For one day, for one hour, let us take a bow as a country. Nearly 233 years after our founding, 144 years after the close of our Civil War and 46 years after Martin Luther King\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cI Have a Dream\xe2\x80\x9d speech, this crazy quilt of immigrants called Americans finally elected a black man, Barack Hussein Obama, as president. Walking back from the inauguration, I saw an African-American street vendor wearing a home-stenciled T-shirt that pretty well captured the moment \xe2\x80\x94 and then some. It said: \xe2\x80\x9cMission Accomplished.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But we cannot let this be the last mold we break, let alone the last big mission we accomplish. Now that we have overcome biography, we need to write some new history \xe2\x80\x94 one that will reboot, revive and reinvigorate America. That, for me, was the essence of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s inaugural speech and I hope we \xe2\x80\x94 and he \xe2\x80\x94 are really up to it.'b'Indeed, dare I say, I hope Obama really has been palling around all these years with that old Chicago radical Bill Ayers. I hope Obama really is a closet radical.'b'Not radical left or right, just a radical, because this is a radical moment. It is a moment for radical departures from business as usual in so many areas. We can\xe2\x80\x99t thrive as a country any longer by coasting on our reputation, by postponing solutions to every big problem that might involve some pain and by telling ourselves that dramatic new initiatives \xe2\x80\x94 like a gasoline tax, national health care or banking reform \xe2\x80\x94 are too hard or \xe2\x80\x9coff the table.\xe2\x80\x9d So my most fervent hope about President Obama is that he will be as radical as this moment \xe2\x80\x94 that he will put 'b'everything'b' on the table.'b'Opportunities for bold initiatives and truly new beginnings are rare in our system \xe2\x80\x94 in part because of the sheer inertia and stalemate designed into our Constitution, with its deliberate separation of powers, and in part because of the way lobbying money, a 24-hour news cycle and a permanent presidential campaign all conspire to paralyze big changes.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe system is built for stalemate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Michael J. Sandel, the Harvard University political theorist. \xe2\x80\x9cIn ordinary times, the energy and dynamism of American life reside in the economy and society, and people view government with suspicion or indifference. But in times of national crisis, Americans look to government to solve fundamental problems that affect them directly. These are the times when presidents can do big things. These moments are rare. But they offer the occasion for the kind of leadership that can recast the political landscape, and redefine the terms of political argument for a generation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the 1930s, the Great Depression enabled Franklin Roosevelt to launch the New Deal and redefine the role of the federal government, he added, while in the 1960s, the assassination of John F. Kennedy and \xe2\x80\x9cthe moral ferment of the civil rights movement\xe2\x80\x9d enabled Lyndon Johnson to enact his Great Society agenda, including Medicare, the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThese presidencies did more than enact new laws and programs,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Sandel. \xe2\x80\x9cThey rewrote the social contract, and redefined what it means to be a citizen. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s moment, and his presidency, could be that consequential.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'George W. Bush completely squandered his post-9/11 moment to summon the country to a dramatic new rebuilding at home. This has left us in some very deep holes. These holes \xe2\x80\x94 and the broad awareness that we are at the bottom of them \xe2\x80\x94 is what makes this a radical moment, calling for radical departures from business as usual, led by Washington.'b'That is why this voter is hoping Obama will swing for the fences. But he also has to remember to run the bases. George Bush swung for some fences, but he often failed at the most basic element of leadership \xe2\x80\x94 competent management and follow-through.'b'President Obama will have to decide just how many fences he can swing for at one time: grand bargains on entitlement and immigration reform? A national health care system? A new clean-energy infrastructure? The nationalization and repair of our banking system? Will it be all or one? Some  now and some later? It is too soon to say.'b'But I do know this: while a crisis is a terrible thing to waste, so too is a great politician, with a natural gift for oratory, a rare knack for bringing people together, and a nation, particularly its youth, ready to be summoned and to serve.'b'So, in sum, while it is impossible to exaggerate what a radical departure it is from our past that we have inaugurated a black man as president, it is equally impossible to exaggerate how much our future depends on a radical departure from our present. As Obama himself declared from the Capitol steps: \xe2\x80\x9cOur time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions \xe2\x80\x94 that time has surely passed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We need to get back to work on our country and our planet in wholly new ways. The hour is late, the project couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be harder, the stakes couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be higher, the payoff couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be greater.'b''b'Timothy Geithner, President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s nominee for Treasury secretary, appears  before the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday. The Op-Ed page asked seven experts in finance and economics to pose the questions they would like to hear the nominee answer.'b''b'1. The American tax code is so complex that even Treasury secretary nominees can easily make mistakes on their returns. Furthermore, while income tax rates are 10 percent to 35 percent for individuals and 35 percent for corporations, because of the proliferation of deductions, credits, exclusions and loopholes, the revenue from income tax amounts to only 10 percent of gross domestic product. Should you give priority to simplifying the code and enforcing compliance before raising rates?'b''b' \xe2\x80\x94 CHARLES O. ROSSOTTI, the commissioner of internal revenue from 1997 to 2002'b''b'1. Ordinary taxpayers would like an answer to this question: Why have they been billed more than $45 billion to rescue Citigroup from failure when, as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, you were its primary supervisor? Three major problems led to Citigroup\xe2\x80\x99s downfall: bad investment policy; overexpansion, which overwhelmed Citigroup\xe2\x80\x99s management; and an inadequate capital base. Why was Citigroup\xe2\x80\x99s supervision inadequate to deal with these problems?'b'2. The Treasury and Federal Reserve have been selecting which companies in American industry and finance will get taxpayer money. What criteria do you use to decide?'b'3. During the banking crisis of the late 1980s, assets of failed savings and loans were acquired by the government\xe2\x80\x99s Resolution Trust Corporation. The trust corporation then sold off the assets in an orderly fashion. Would you consider requesting Congress to revive the Resolution Trust Corporation, so you would not have to decide which companies to save and which not to save? Would you consider re-establishing the trust corporation now for commercial banks that are likely to fail?'b''b'\xe2\x80\x94 ANNA JACOBSON SCHWARTZ, an economist at the National Bureau of Economic Research and the author, with Milton Friedman, of \xe2\x80\x9cA Monetary History of the United States, 1867 to 1960\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'1. Do you believe that money from the Treasury\xe2\x80\x99s Troubled Asset Relief Fund should be exclusively used to preserve our financial system, or should it be used to assist distressed non-financial institutions like manufacturers and retailers? If non-financial institutions are eligible, how do you decide which are deserving?'b'2. Do you believe raising taxes on savings and investment, as would occur if the Bush tax cuts expire in 2010, will help or hurt our economy?'b'3. How do we more effectively regulate the financial services industry without adding unnecessary regulations that cripple our ability to compete globally?'b''b' \xe2\x80\x94 MITT ROMNEY, a former governor of Massachusetts'b''b'1. In the past, you have praised the \xe2\x80\x9cresiliency\xe2\x80\x9d of the American financial system. But a resilient financial system would demand that banks maintain stricter capital standards in normal times so that when a crisis hits, they don\xe2\x80\x99t all have to tighten lending at the same time. What exactly did you mean by \xe2\x80\x9cresiliency\xe2\x80\x9d?'b''b'\xe2\x80\x94 ROBERT SHILLER, professor of economics at Yale'b''b'1. The income tax code favors those with employer-provided health insurance over those who buy their own health insurance or pay medical bills out of pocket. It also favors homeowners over renters, through the mortgage interest deduction. Is this tax treatment efficient or fair? Might you favor a more level playing field?'b'2. President Obama supports the estate tax. Why should a person who leaves his money to his children pay more in taxes than another person with the same lifetime income who spends all his money on himself?'b''b'\xe2\x80\x94 N. GREGORY MANKIW, a professor of economics at Harvard'b''b'1. The American financial regulatory system is highly fragmented, with authority divided among federal and state governments, the Federal Reserve, the comptroller of the currency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, etc. Do you favor an overhaul of the system and, if so, what should the new system look like?'b''b'\xe2\x80\x94 JOHN STEELE GORDON, the author of \xe2\x80\x9cAn Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'1. This country has long benefited from the world\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in our financial markets. Are financial regulatory reforms necessary now to restore investors\xe2\x80\x99 confidence and revive our economy?'b'2. Should debt securities that are held by regulated banks and pension funds be rated by multiple independent credit reports that have been commissioned by a federal agency, or should we continue to let the issuers of debts decide who will rate their risks?'b'3. Should large financial institutions incur higher reserve requirements or other regulatory penalties when they become \xe2\x80\x9ctoo big to fail\xe2\x80\x9d?'b''b'\xe2\x80\x94 ROGER B. MYERSON, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago and a winner of the 2007 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences'b''b'IN an interview last month, 'b'Barack Obama'b' spoke of his and 'b'Michelle'b'\xe2\x80\x99s plans to \xe2\x80\x9copen up the White House and remind people this is the people\xe2\x80\x99s house.\xe2\x80\x9d He said they wanted to host jazz musicians, chamber music recitals and poetry readings, \xe2\x80\x9cso that once again we appreciate this incredible tapestry that\xe2\x80\x99s America.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The allusion to Camelot was unmistakable. Nearly 50 years ago, 'b'Jacqueline Kennedy'b' transformed a shabby White House into an elegant showcase for America\xe2\x80\x99s cultural life and design heritage. Her refurbished state rooms, stocked with historically important furniture arranged with an eye to drama and beauty, became a worthy backdrop for performances, concerts and glamorous dinners. She helped make Americans proud of the place and, for the first time, of our own accomplishments in the decorative arts.'b'This is an appealing model for the Obamas. Unfortunately, they\xe2\x80\x99ll find that Mrs. Kennedy made her own example very hard to follow \xe2\x80\x94 because she pulled it off largely through charm and cunning, and then shrouded her schemes in a welter of bureaucracy that now makes it difficult for any successor to again enliven the d\xc3\xa9cor of the executive mansion.'b'The forlorn state rooms that Mrs. Kennedy found when she and her husband arrived in 1961 \xe2\x80\x94 furnished in Truman-era reproductions of 19th-century pieces from B. Altman and insignificant broadloom carpets \xe2\x80\x94 were desperately in need of revamping. The first lady whipped things into shape in a remarkably short time. She got Congress to pass legislation that designated the White House a museum and hired a curator. She set up the Fine Arts Committee for the White House to locate and raise money for the acquisition of 18th- and 19th-century furniture and art relating to the history of the presidency.'b'Mrs. Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s redesign, which was largely the work of St\xc3\xa9phane Boudin, the celebrated French decorator whose clients included the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, was historically minded rather than historically accurate. In the Green Room, for example, Boudin relied on historical documents to inspire colors, wall coverings and curtains, but his goal was to create a sense of harmony. He arranged the Jeffersonian Federal furniture so as to reconcile the rather leggy, spindly pieces with the room\xe2\x80\x99s enormous proportions.'b'But the first lady cast the work as a \xe2\x80\x9crestoration\xe2\x80\x9d and put Henry Francis du Pont, an  authority on American antiques, at the helm of the committee in order to place all her design decisions beyond reproach. Du Pont and the committee provided cover for Mrs. Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s Parisian decorator. While du Pont gave advice and helped acquire hundreds of important antiques, it was Boudin who had the first lady\xe2\x80\x99s ear. The chief usher of the White House understood he was to allow du Pont to rearrange the furniture during his visits, but then move it back when he left.'b'The American decorator Sister Parish was cannily given credit for some of Boudin\xe2\x80\x99s work on the state rooms, and fabric woven in France was sneaked through customs in a diplomatic pouch. Mrs. Kennedy cleverly sold her remodeling to the American public with a breathy televised tour of the work in progress.'b'The same committee that functioned largely as a charade for Mrs. Kennedy still operates today, to the White House\xe2\x80\x99s detriment. (It\xe2\x80\x99s now known as the Committee for the Preservation of the White House.) Subsequent first ladies have read its preservationist mandate literally, turning many rooms into stultifying period pieces. Pat Nixon and her team replaced, for instance, Boudin\xe2\x80\x99s window treatments in the Green Room with gold-tasseled reproductions  of Federal-era draperies, which robbed the room of its former vitality.  Yesterday, the Obamas stepped into a house whose design influences virtually stop around the end of the 19th century.'b'The Obamas should ignore most of what Jackie Kennedy said and instead do what she actually did \xe2\x80\x94 ideally, without the guile. As she understood, the White House, in order to truly be \xe2\x80\x9cthe people\xe2\x80\x99s house,\xe2\x80\x9d should reflect its living character as much as its history. Mrs. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s appointment of Michael Smith, a Los Angeles-based decorator, is a promising start. He is well versed in the art of Gilbert Stuart and the craftsmanship of Duncan Phyfe, but is unlikely to shy from adding, say, modern paintings by Mark Rothko or furniture by Samuel Marx.'b'Mrs. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s preservation committee, refreshed by the appointment of artists, architects, designers, critics, environmentalists, even philosophers, could pull off a perfect marriage of preservation and progress.'b'The White House ought to reflect the truth that people live surrounded by many historic periods at once \xe2\x80\x94 in our art, music and literature as well as in the d\xc3\xa9cor of the rooms we inhabit. To revive the spirit of Camelot, the Obamas need to show reverence for the past without living in it.'b'WASHINGTON'b'It was the Instant the Earth Stood Still.'b'Not since Klaatu landed in a flying saucer on the Ellipse has Washington been so mesmerized by an object whirring through the sky.'b'But this one was departing, not arriving.'b'As W. ceased to be president, he flew off over the Capitol and across the Mall en route to Andrews Air Force Base, and then back to Texas.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen many presidents come and go, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve never watched a tableau like the one Tuesday, when four million eyes turned heavenward, following the helicopter\xe2\x80\x99s path out of town. Everyone, it seemed, was waving goodbye, with one or two hands, a wave that moved westward down the Mall toward the Lincoln Memorial, and keeping their eyes fixed unwaveringly on that green bird.'b'They wanted to make absolutely, positively certain that W. was gone. It was like a physical burden being lifted, like a sigh went up of \xe2\x80\x9cThank God. Has Cheney\xe2\x80\x99s wheelchair left the building, too?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The crowd was exuberant that George Bush was now an ex-president, and 43 himself was jovial \xe2\x80\x9cthe way he always is,\xe2\x80\x9d according to his last press secretary, Dana Perino.'b'It was like a catharsis in Greek drama, with the antagonist plucked out of the scene into the sky, and the protagonist dropping into the scene to magically fix all the problems.  Except Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s somber mien and restrained oratory conveyed that he\xe2\x80\x99s no divinity and there will be no easy resolution to this plot.'b'It was a morning of such enormous emotion and portent \xe2\x80\x94 jaw-dropping, Dow-dropping and barrier-dropping \xe2\x80\x94 that even the cool new president had to feel daunted to see his blocks-long  motorcade and two million hope-besotted faces beaming up at him, dreaming that he can save their shirts.'b'The optimism was tempered by pessimism, a vibe of \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe this once-in-a-lifetime guy can do it, but boy, there are a lot of never-in-our-lifetime problems here.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Unlike W., Obama is a realist. He knows there is the potential of letting all these blissed-out people down.'b'The day had its jittery moments:  Teddy Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s collapse and   Robert Byrd\xe2\x80\x99s distraught reaction. There was also that  match of the titan smarty-pants  \xe2\x80\x94  the new Democratic president face to face with the conservative chief justice he voted against.'b'First John Roberts had to say, Easy, cowboy, after Mr. Obama jumped the gun on \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d at the start of the oath of office. Then the president, who had obviously been looking over his lines, graciously offered the chief justice a chance to correct his negligent syntax, when he put the \xe2\x80\x9cfaithfully\xe2\x80\x9d and other words out of place.'b'Under the platform, near where I sat, Denzel Washington, Beyonc\xc3\xa9, Jay-Z and P. Diddy looked on proudly as the new commander in chief showed he was in command of the script and the country.'b'After thanking President Bush \xe2\x80\x9cfor his service to our nation,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama executed a high-level version of Stephen Colbert\xe2\x80\x99s share-the-stage smackdown of W. at the White House correspondents\xe2\x80\x99 dinner in 2006.'b'With W. looking on, and probably gradually realizing with irritation, as he did with Colbert, who Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s target was  \xe2\x80\x94  (Is he talking about me? Is 44 saying I messed everything up?)  \xe2\x80\x94  the newly minted president let him have it:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to wild applause (and to Bartlett\xe2\x80\x99s), adding: \xe2\x80\x9cThose ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9d He said America is choosing hope over fear, unity over discord, setting aside \xe2\x80\x9cfalse promises\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cchildish things.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Letting a little air out of the highest hopes about what one man, even \xe2\x80\x9cThe One,\xe2\x80\x9d can do, he emphasized the word \xe2\x80\x9cour.\xe2\x80\x9d He stressed that rebuilding after the wreckage of W. and Cheney will be a shared burden and that \xe2\x80\x9cgiving our all to a difficult task\xe2\x80\x9d isn\xe2\x80\x99t as bad as it sounds.'b'I grew up here, and it was the first time I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen the city wholly, happily integrated, with a mood redolent of New York in the weeks after 9/11. The Obamas have made an unprecedented pledge to get involved in the real city that lies beyond the political Oz, and have already started doing so in many ways, including starting the night out at the D.C.

The only people who felt unified during Woodstock were those who were there \xe2\x80\x94 everybody else was horrified or jealous. But the inauguration left the whole country glued together emotionally, one big American ball of hope.'b'President Obama has made it clear that each of us has a role to perform, sacrifices to make in the great task of rebuilding the country. But his inaugural speech did not actually make those new duties look all that daunting. He mentioned firefighters running into burning buildings and parents nurturing their children, both of which have been going on for some time. He expressed hope that if a levee broke, we would help the refugees, and I have a feeling that in the event of another such crisis we will not disappoint.'b'On Wednesday in the Capitol, our elected officials seemed to be making at least a modest effort to respond to Obama\xe2\x80\x99s call to give up \xe2\x80\x9cthe recriminations and worn-out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics.\xe2\x80\x9d The Senate confirmed Hillary Clinton as secretary of state 94 to 2, with Obama\xe2\x80\x99s newest BFF, John McCain, urging his colleagues to work together while other Republicans hopped up to sing Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s praises. \xe2\x80\x9cA very ethical person and a wise person,\xe2\x80\x9d chimed in Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.'b'Can you remember back when Hillary was first elected to the Senate eight years ago, and the Republican majority leader made the wistful suggestion that she might be hit by lightning before she was sworn in?

Given the fact that Bunning claimed his last opponent looked \xe2\x80\x9clike one of Saddam Hussein\xe2\x80\x99s sons,\xe2\x80\x9d we were not expecting him to be an early harbinger of the new era.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTim has made some mistakes, which he has freely admitted and corrected,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charles Schumer of New York. This is what Geithner\xe2\x80\x99s supporters always say. It\xe2\x80\x99s their defenses that make him sound really indefensible.'b'Despite the aid of a spiffy TurboTax program, Geithner neglected to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes for the years he was employed by the International Monetary Fund. When the Internal Revenue Service audited his 2003 and 2004 returns and told him to hand over the money, it apparently did not occur to him that he had been working at the same job and paying taxes the same way in 2001 and 2002. It took a cabinet nomination to jog his memory.'b'Nevertheless, most of the senators seem to feel that Geithner is, in the words of Charles Grassley, the Finance Committee\xe2\x80\x99s ranking Republican, \xe2\x80\x9cnot only the best choice,\xe2\x80\x9d but the only choice.'b'The idea that there\xe2\x80\x99s only one man who can save the day in a time of great economic crisis is worrisome, given the number of indispensable financial giants who\xe2\x80\x99ve turned out to be deeply dispensable on second look.

Bush, they would be waterboarded).'b'Two themes were particularly reassuring in Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Inaugural Address. One was his inclusiveness, his effort to tug people into his big tent, a huge contrast from Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s years of governing from an ideological pup tent.'b'President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s inclusiveness started with his celebration of America as a patchwork of \xe2\x80\x9cChristians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus \xe2\x80\x94 and nonbelievers.\xe2\x80\x9d If you know of any other sitting president who has dared to embrace atheists (Thomas Jefferson did, but not while in office), post the information on my blog, 'b'nytimes.com/ontheground'b').'b'Mr. Obama was also the first president to use the word \xe2\x80\x9cMuslim\xe2\x80\x9d in an Inaugural Address. In an oblique olive branch that I took to be directed toward Iran and Syria, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The second reassuring theme has to do with \xe2\x80\x9chard power\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csoft power,\xe2\x80\x9d in the terminology of Joseph Nye, a Harvard professor. In the Bush-Cheney years, America sought to rely overwhelmingly on military \xe2\x80\x9chard power,\xe2\x80\x9d and the result was setbacks around the world, from Iran\xe2\x80\x99s accelerated nuclear program to North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s processing of plutonium for a half-dozen nuclear weapons (compared with zero during the Clinton presidency).'b'As my colleague David Sanger documents in his superb new book, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Inheritance\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cWe pursued a path that has left us less admired by our allies, less feared by our enemies, and less capable of convincing the rest of the world that our economic and political model is worthy of emulation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s first attempt at soft power is the nifty new White House Web site, complete with a White House blog. In his Inaugural Address, Mr. Obama focused on soft power alongside hard power: \xe2\x80\x9cOur security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Tempering qualities? Dick Cheney never wanted to temper anything, including his temper.'b'This mix of soft and hard power is what Professor Nye calls \xe2\x80\x9csmart power\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 an update of Teddy Roosevelt\xe2\x80\x99s notion of speaking softly and carrying a big stick \xe2\x80\x94 and it seems to be an emerging theme of the new administration. Hillary Rodham Clinton emphasized it in her confirmation hearings.'b'Professor Nye said that Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s inaugural was a perfect example of smart power. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not going to make our adversaries roll over, but it\xe2\x80\x99ll help in terms of mainstream Muslims and it\xe2\x80\x99ll help in terms of allies,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Nye said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99ll give a very different tone to foreign policy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Now the world will be watching to see if Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s policy matches his rhetoric. The economy will be paramount, of course, but it will take months or years to judge results there.'b'In the meantime, there are two immediate litmus tests by which the world will begin to judge Mr. Obama at once. The first will be his handling of Guant\xc3\xa1namo and torture  \xe2\x80\x94  the architects of those Bush policies did more damage to America than anyone confined in Guant\xc3\xa1namo  \xe2\x80\x94  and it was reassuring that Mr. Obama promptly suspended action by military tribunals.'b'A second test is Middle East policy. The Bush policy of (mostly) disengagement and obliviousness to Palestinian suffering has made it harder to achieve a peace that is the best hope for Israelis and Palestinians alike. Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s calls Wednesday to Middle Eastern leaders were helpful, and he should immediately make clear that he wants Israel to halt the settlements and ease repressive restrictions on the West Bank.'b'These steps would reassure the world that its hopes for a new day in Washington just may be justified.'b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 President Obama made a responsible speech for \xe2\x80\x9ca new era of responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d that is set to include a \xe2\x80\x9cresponsible\xe2\x80\x9d withdrawal from Iraq. Standing at the west front of the Capitol, he was not at his most uplifting, nor his most inspiring, as he called in sober tones for a new \xe2\x80\x9cspirit of service\xe2\x80\x9d that will renew America and, through it, the world.'b'I sat 30 feet away and felt stirred but not transported. Perhaps that was the point. There\xe2\x80\x99s too much work to do for high rhetorical flourish.'b'The day was bright but freezing. The trombones of the Marine Band glinted in the unforgiving light. The sun proceeded in its slow arc to noon, yet it seemed to grow colder, as if nature itself were stilled.'b'A shivering crowd of more than one million stretched back across the National Mall toward the Lincoln Memorial. But the Great Liberator, freer of slaves in a terrible war, was passed over in silence. So, too, was the throng.'b'The symbols, like the national catharsis, could speak for themselves, just as the 21-gun salute to an African-American president contained its own eloquence. This was a spare inaugural speech, devoid of allusion to setting, almost disembodied.'b'Still, there were powerful phrases and signals that together amounted to an attempt to re-imagine a nation in crisis.'b'The word \xe2\x80\x9cpeace\xe2\x80\x9d appeared four times, as in \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.\xe2\x80\x9d His predecessor did not like the word \xe2\x80\x9cpeace,\xe2\x80\x9d which somehow smacked to him of weakness. He rarely used it.'b'But engaged in two wars, its Treasury bare, the United States has a pressing strategic interest in furthering peace where it can. Hence Obama\xe2\x80\x99s little phrase to the Muslim world that should echo in Tehran: \xe2\x80\x9cWe will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The United States was defined anew as \xe2\x80\x9ca nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus  \xe2\x80\x94 and nonbelievers.\xe2\x80\x9d A kind of Christian assumption has inhabited American politics these past eight years  \xe2\x80\x94  from the ex-president\xe2\x80\x99s born-again hot line to God, through his unfortunate talk of a \xe2\x80\x9ccrusade,\xe2\x80\x9d to his fundamentalist positions on issues like stem-cell research. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s allusion to atheists returned religion to its proper station, as a personal choice rather than political credo.'b'As for speaking of Muslims before America\xe2\x80\x99s more numerous Jews, this seemed an appropriate political gesture after the many slights since 9/11 toward America\xe2\x80\x99s Muslim community.'b'Another little phrase  \xe2\x80\x94  \xe2\x80\x9cWe will restore science to its rightful place\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x94  also appeared aimed at halting the religious invasion of public life and circumscribing the anti-Darwinian lunacy of the extreme Christian right.'b'As the Dow plunged another 400 points, or more than 4 percent, Obama spoke in far more guarded terms about the free market than is typical from an American leader. \xe2\x80\x9cNor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, calling for a \xe2\x80\x9cwatchful eye\xe2\x80\x9d over the marketplace.'b'This is an admission of facts: a huge state intervention has occurred and an $825 billion stimulus package of tax cuts and public works projects is coming. But it was also a signal that a far less ideological United States will emerge under Obama, one that will speak less of a global mission to spread liberty, democracy and free markets. Call it the new American humility.'b'Obama vowed to defeat those who \xe2\x80\x9cseek to advance their aims by inducing terror.\xe2\x80\x9d Note how terror has shifted here from an amorphous jihadist ideology  \xe2\x80\x94  \xe2\x80\x9cthe war on terror\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x94  to an emotion (what you feel when a suicide bomber detonates himself). We are not going to hear the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cglobal war on terror,\xe2\x80\x9d or its awful GWOT acronym, too often, if at all, from the Obama administration.'b'There is no point flattering America\xe2\x80\x99s adversaries by inflating their vile methods into an ideology and then declaring an unwinnable war against it.'b'America is returning to its Constitution: \xe2\x80\x9cWe reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.\xe2\x80\x9d With that little sentence, Obama bade farewell to renditions, torture, the trampling of habeas corpus, Guant\xc3\xa1namo and other stains on the nation\xe2\x80\x99s conscience. This work will not be complete until Guant\xc3\xa1namo is closed and those wrongly imprisoned, some for more than five years, are compensated.'b'The personal convictions of a constitutional lawyer are allied to strategy here: America\xe2\x80\x99s ideals remain among the most powerful tools in its diplomatic arsenal. As Obama said, \xe2\x80\x9cOur power alone cannot protect us; nor does it entitle us to do as we please.\xe2\x80\x9d Rather, \xe2\x80\x9cour security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Responsibility, restraint, humility, peace: this is not the habitual vocabulary of America\xe2\x80\x99s heroic narrative. It constitutes a new lexicon of American power. Are Americans ready to die for responsibility?'b'Perhaps not, but they may well seek dialogue in its name. \xe2\x80\x9cThe world has changed  \xe2\x80\x94  and we must change with it,\xe2\x80\x9d Obama said. Even change has changed now: no longer a clarion call, it is a responsibility.'b'Tripoli, Libya'b'THE shocking level of the last wave of Israeli-Palestinian violence, which ended with this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s cease-fire, reminds us why a final resolution to the so-called Middle East crisis is so important. It is vital not just to break this cycle of destruction and injustice, but also to deny the religious extremists in the region who feed on the conflict an excuse to advance their own causes.'b'But everywhere one looks, among the speeches and the desperate diplomacy, there is no real way forward. A just and lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians is possible, but it lies in the history of the people of this conflicted land, and not in the tired rhetoric of partition and two-state solutions.'b'Although it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to realize after  the horrors we\xe2\x80\x99ve just witnessed, the state of war between the Jews and Palestinians has not always existed. In fact, many of the divisions between Jews and Palestinians are recent ones. The very name \xe2\x80\x9cPalestine\xe2\x80\x9d  was  commonly used to describe the whole area, even by the Jews who lived there, until 1948, when the name \xe2\x80\x9cIsrael\xe2\x80\x9d came into use.'b'Jews and Muslims are cousins descended from Abraham. Throughout the centuries both faced cruel persecution and often found refuge with one another. Arabs sheltered  Jews and protected them after  maltreatment at the hands of the Romans and their expulsion from Spain in the Middle Ages.'b'The history of Israel/Palestine is not remarkable by regional standards \xe2\x80\x94 a country inhabited by different peoples, with rule passing among  many tribes, nations and ethnic groups; a country that has withstood many wars and waves of peoples from all directions. This is why it gets so complicated when members of either party claims the right to assert that it is 'b'their'b' land.'b'The basis for the modern State of Israel is the persecution of the Jewish people, which is undeniable. The Jews have been held captive, massacred, disadvantaged in every possible fashion by  the Egyptians, the Romans, the English, the Russians, the Babylonians, the Canaanites and, most recently, the Germans under Hitler. The Jewish people want and deserve their homeland.'b'But the Palestinians too have a history of persecution, and they view the coastal towns of Haifa, Acre, Jaffa and others as the land of their forefathers, passed from generation to generation, until only a short time ago.'b'Thus the Palestinians believe that what is now called Israel forms part of their nation, even were they to secure the West Bank and Gaza. And the Jews believe that the West Bank is Samaria and Judea, part of their homeland, even if a Palestinian state were established there.  Now, as Gaza still smolders, calls for a two-state solution or partition persist. But neither will work.'b'A two-state solution will create an unacceptable security threat to Israel. An armed Arab state, presumably in the West Bank, would give Israel less than 10 miles of strategic depth at its narrowest point. Further, a Palestinian state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip would do little to resolve the problem of refugees. Any situation that keeps the majority of Palestinians in refugee camps and does not offer a solution within the historical  borders of Israel/Palestine is not a solution at all.'b'For the same reasons, the older idea of partition of the West Bank into Jewish and Arab areas, with buffer zones between them, won\xe2\x80\x99t work. The Palestinian-held areas could not accommodate all of the refugees, and buffer zones symbolize exclusion and breed tension. Israelis and Palestinians have also become increasingly intertwined, economically and politically.'b'In absolute terms, the two movements must remain in perpetual war or a compromise must be reached. The compromise is one state for all, an \xe2\x80\x9cIsratine\xe2\x80\x9d that would allow the people in each party to feel that they live in all of the disputed land and they are not deprived of any one part of it.'b'A key prerequisite for peace is the right of return for Palestinian refugees to the homes their families left behind in 1948. It is an injustice that Jews who were not originally inhabitants of Palestine, nor were their ancestors, can move in  from abroad while Palestinians who were displaced only a relatively short time ago should not be so permitted.'b'It is a fact that Palestinians inhabited the land and owned farms and homes there until recently, fleeing in fear of violence at the hands of Jews after 1948 \xe2\x80\x94 violence that  did not occur, but rumors of which led to a mass exodus. It is important to note that  the Jews did not forcibly expel Palestinians. They were never \xe2\x80\x9cun-welcomed.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet only the full territories of Isratine can accommodate all the refugees and bring about the justice that is key to peace.'b'Assimilation is already a fact of life in Israel. There are more than one million Muslim Arabs in Israel; they possess Israeli nationality and take part in political life with the Jews, forming political parties. On the other side, there are Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Israeli factories depend on Palestinian labor, and goods and services are exchanged. This successful assimilation can be a model for Isratine.'b'If the present interdependence and the historical fact of Jewish-Palestinian coexistence guide their leaders, and if they can see beyond the horizon of the recent violence and thirst for revenge toward a long-term solution, then these two peoples will come to realize, I hope sooner rather than later, that living under one roof is the only option for a lasting peace.'b'IN 1969, Neil Armstrong appeared to have omitted an indefinite article as he stepped onto the moon and left earthlings puzzled over the difference between \xe2\x80\x9cman\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmankind.\xe2\x80\x9d In 1980, Jimmy Carter, accepting his party\xe2\x80\x99s nomination, paid homage to a former vice president he called Hubert Horatio Hornblower. A year later, Diana Spencer reversed the first two names of her betrothed in her wedding vows, and thus, as  Prince Charles Philip supposedly later joked, actually married his father.'b'On Tuesday, Chief Justice John Roberts joined the Flubber Hall of Fame when he administered the presidential oath of office apparently without notes. Instead of having Barack Obama \xe2\x80\x9csolemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d Chief Justice Roberts had him \xe2\x80\x9csolemnly swear that I will execute the office of president to the United States faithfully.\xe2\x80\x9d When Mr. Obama paused after \xe2\x80\x9cexecute,\xe2\x80\x9d the chief justice prompted him to continue with \xe2\x80\x9cfaithfully the office of president of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d (To ensure that the president was properly sworn in, the chief justice re-administered the oath Wednesday evening.)'b'How could a famous stickler for grammar have bungled that 35-word passage, among the best-known words in the Constitution? Conspiracy theorists and connoisseurs of Freudian slips have surmised that it was unconscious retaliation for Senator Obama\xe2\x80\x99s vote against the chief justice\xe2\x80\x99s confirmation in 2005. But a simpler explanation is that the wayward adverb in the passage is blowback from Chief Justice Roberts\xe2\x80\x99s habit of grammatical niggling.'b'Language pedants hew to an oral tradition of shibboleths that have no basis in logic or style, that have been defied by great writers for centuries, and that have been disavowed by every thoughtful usage manual. Nonetheless, they refuse to go away, perpetuated by the Gotcha! Gang and meekly obeyed by insecure writers.'b'Among these fetishes is the prohibition against \xe2\x80\x9csplit verbs,\xe2\x80\x9d in which an adverb comes between an infinitive marker like \xe2\x80\x9cto,\xe2\x80\x9d or an auxiliary like \xe2\x80\x9cwill,\xe2\x80\x9d and the main verb of the sentence. According to this superstition, Captain Kirk made a grammatical error when he declared that the five-year mission of the starship Enterprise was \xe2\x80\x9cto boldly go where no man has gone before\xe2\x80\x9d; it should have been \xe2\x80\x9cto go boldly.\xe2\x80\x9d Likewise, Dolly Parton should not have declared that \xe2\x80\x9cI will always love you\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cI always will love you\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cI will love you always.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Any speaker who has not been brainwashed by the split-verb myth can sense that these corrections go against the rhythm and logic of English phrasing. The myth originated centuries ago in a thick-witted analogy to Latin, in which it is impossible to split an infinitive because it consists of a single word, like dicere, \xe2\x80\x9cto say.\xe2\x80\x9d But in English, infinitives like \xe2\x80\x9cto go\xe2\x80\x9d and future-tense forms like \xe2\x80\x9cwill go\xe2\x80\x9d are two words, not one, and there is not the slightest reason to interdict adverbs from the position between them.'b'Though the ungrammaticality of split verbs is an urban legend, it found its way into The Texas Law Review Manual on Style, which is the arbiter of usage for  many law review journals. James Lindgren, a critic of the manual, has found that many lawyers have \xe2\x80\x9cinternalized the bogus rule so that they actually believe that a split verb should be avoided,\xe2\x80\x9d adding, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Invasion of the Body Snatchers has succeeded so well that many can no longer distinguish alien speech from native speech.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In his legal opinions, Chief Justice Roberts has altered quotations to conform to his notions of grammaticality, as when he excised the \xe2\x80\x9cain\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d from Bob Dylan\xe2\x80\x99s line \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you ain\xe2\x80\x99t got nothing, you got nothing to lose.\xe2\x80\x9d On Tuesday his inner copy editor overrode any instincts toward strict constructionism and unilaterally amended the Constitution by moving the adverb \xe2\x80\x9cfaithfully\xe2\x80\x9d away from the verb.'b'President Obama, whose attention to language is obvious in his speeches and writings, smiled at the chief justice\xe2\x80\x99s hypercorrection, then gamely repeated it. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope that during the next four years he will always  challenge  dogma and boldly lead the nation in new directions.'b'After eight years of shameful policies and politicization at the Justice Department, Eric Holder has made a strong case that he is well suited to lead the needed overhaul. We hope Mr. Holder will not only be able to undo the damage his predecessors did, but also turn the department back into a powerful force for fairness and the rule of law.'b'The Bush Justice Department hired lawyers on the basis of political affiliation, brought cases to help the Republican Party win elections and endorsed torture, among other serious misdeeds. Mr. Holder, who held the No. 2 position at the department under President Bill Clinton, promises a new direction on all of these fronts.'b'At his confirmation hearings, he said emphatically that waterboarding \xe2\x80\x94 an interrogation technique in which detainees are made to feel they are drowning \xe2\x80\x94 is torture. The last two attorneys general, Alberto Gonzales and Michael Mukasey, were unwilling to make this simple statement.'b'It was especially encouraging to hear Mr. Holder tell the Senate that one of the first things he would have to do is undertake a \xe2\x80\x9cdamage assessment.\xe2\x80\x9d He promised to reconsider the recently announced decision not to prosecute Bradley Schlozman, the former head of the civil rights division. The department\xe2\x80\x99s inspector general found that he made political hiring decisions and testified falsely to Congress about them. That is a good start.'b'In his Senate testimony, Mr. Holder assuaged concerns about his biggest liability \xe2\x80\x94 the role he played in acquiescing to President Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s pardon of the fugitive financier Marc Rich. Mr. Holder explained the mistakes he made, and how he learned from them.'b'The next attorney general will have a great deal of work to do getting key parts of the Justice Department up and running again \xe2\x80\x94 and fighting on the right side. He will need to ensure that the voting rights section advocates for voters\xe2\x80\x99 rights, rather than trying to impede them, as it has in recent years. He will need to see that the civil rights division fights on the side of civil rights.'b'Republicans have stalled the vote on Mr. Holder, but we hope not for long. In his Inaugural Address, President Obama pledged to begin \xe2\x80\x9cthe work of remaking America.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Holder can play a key role by turning the Justice Department, once again, into a force for justice.'b'Long before President Obama took office, pretty much everyone, even President George Bush, said the prison at Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay needed to be closed. In June 2007, the White House claimed it was working on a \xe2\x80\x9cnumber of steps\xe2\x80\x9d that had to happen first \xe2\x80\x94 but getting started was really hard.'b'Well, maybe not so hard. It took President Obama less than 12 hours. Before midnight of his first day in office, he took the obvious and vital step of halting the military tribunals at the prison camp. And he reportedly is considering a draft executive order that would direct that the prison be closed entirely within a year.'b'All reasonable people, including many of the defense lawyers and some of the judges and prosecutors assigned to them, recognize these tribunals for what they are: a mockery of American standards of justice and due process.'b'The retired judge who runs them told Bob Woodward of The Washington Post recently that she had to reject prosecution of a Saudi man accused of planning to take part in the 9/11 attacks because the case had been tainted by torture. At least one prosecutor has resigned because he considered the cases rigged.'b'Mr. Obama rightly denounced the tribunals during the campaign. And we were delighted to see him shut them down so swiftly now that he is in the White House.'b'Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s decision came in a legal filing by military prosecutors, which described the halt as temporary, to give the administration time \xe2\x80\x9cto review the military commission process, generally, and the cases currently pending before the military commissions, specifically.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We presume that is a legal nicety. There is no good reason to restart these trials and doing so would send precisely the wrong signal to the world. We\xe2\x80\x99re now eagerly awaiting Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s announcement of the process by which he will shut Guant\xc3\xa1namo and what he will do with its estimated 245 prisoners.'b'We know that many pose no threat to the United States, if they are guilty of anything at all. We also know that a few are very dangerous and that the illegal and abusive policies of the Bush administration will make it very hard to bring them to full justice. Fixing that part of Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s grotesque legacy will be a lot harder than closing the prison.'b'In the past few months, a surprising number of people have said to me, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, by the way, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to Peru,\xe2\x80\x9d as if no further explanation were needed. One thing I do know. While they\xe2\x80\x99re there, they will probably buy a chullo or two, one of those cone-like alpaca pan-Andean hats with earflaps. Judging from the look of New York, a lot of people have been to Peru recently. Gone is the Afghan pakol. Gone is the keffiyeh. This is the winter of the Andean hat.'b'If there\xe2\x80\x99s a political statement in the chullo, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little hard to decipher. Perhaps it signals indigenousness, international-ness. But what it mostly says is, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care how I look as long as I\xe2\x80\x99m warm. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen chullos that look like one cup of a knit bikini top and some that make their wearers look like mittenheads, complete with dangling strings. The other day I saw a fur-lined chullo that looked as though it had eaten the elder George Bush\xe2\x80\x99s Russian hat. You can give a fedora a rakish tilt. You can wear a hoodie with sinister \xc3\xa9lan. But it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to wear a chullo stylishly. It is to the noggin what a golf club cover is to a 3-wood. It is a bag for the head.'b'In a way, seeing so many chullos in New York is a little like seeing so many baseball caps on Peruvians and Bolivians \xe2\x80\x94 a token of our global inclusiveness, like the Andean musicians you hear in the subways playing what you think is Paul Simon but is really a Peruvian classic.'b'Perhaps the anti-stylishness of the chullo \xe2\x80\x94 its simple functionality \xe2\x80\x94 is its politics. The fact is that really cold weather eclipses style. I see men and women wearing earmuffs that look like noseplugs. They are clearly trying to keep their hair kempt. It\xe2\x80\x99s a lost cause. Your hair is not truly your own until warmer days and higher humidity return. Until then, there is no better way to get hat hair than a chullo.'b''b'VERLYN KLINKENBORG'b''b'If ever there was a moment when the Senate should have used the confirmation process to delve into the big issues confronting the nation, it was at Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s hearing for Treasury Secretary-designate Timothy Geithner.'b'Unfortunately, Mr. Geithner\xe2\x80\x99s self-inflicted tax problems made that hard. But even after the nominee admitted that  his failure to pay tens of thousands of dollars in federal taxes had been \xe2\x80\x9ccareless\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cunintentional\xe2\x80\x9d (he has since paid back taxes, plus interest) members of the Finance Committee were not terribly sharp in their questions about how Mr. Geithner will help President Obama face down the country\xe2\x80\x99s desperate financial problems.'b'We were not impressed with Mr. Geithner\xe2\x80\x99s excuses for his tax problems, but barring any new damaging disclosures, we heard nothing disqualifying. He is clearly an intelligent man and Mr. Obama is entitled to pick his own team.'b'Wall Street is also comfortable with the choice. That is an endorsement that cuts both ways \xe2\x80\x94 but one that could advance the cause of renewed regulation if Mr. Obama lives up to his promises and is a strong champion for regulatory reform.'b'We still don\xe2\x80\x99t have a clear picture of Mr. Geithner\xe2\x80\x99s role \xe2\x80\x94 as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the past five years \xe2\x80\x94 in the decisions to bail out Bear Stearns, the American International Group and Citigroup, or the decision to let Lehman Brothers go under.'b'The Finance Committee is expected to approve his nomination Thursday, but before the full Senate votes, we hope that we will hear more from Mr. Geithner and the president on their plans for unraveling the nation\xe2\x80\x99s desperate financial mess.'b'At the hearing, Mr. Geithner was unchallenged when he said that the disastrous collapse of Lehman Brothers last September occurred because the government had no legal authority to intervene. That narrative surfaced weeks after the collapse and contradicts explanations given at the time.'b'It is certainly not the type of open, transparent, and fully accountable explanation that the new president is promising.'b'At the hearing, Mr. Geithner did give a good general outline of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s plan to right the nation\xe2\x80\x99s financial system, saying Mr. Obama would lay out, \xe2\x80\x9cwe hope in the next few weeks,\xe2\x80\x9d a comprehensive plan to get the banks lending again, to address the foreclosure crisis and to directly address the lack of credit to small businesses and consumers.'b'Like most nominees, Mr. Geithner gave vague answers when asked more detailed questions. He promised new financial regulation, but also referred often to a new regulatory \xe2\x80\x9cframework.\xe2\x80\x9d It remains to be seen if the goal is to put in place robust new rules or \xe2\x80\x94 as the Bush team proposed last year \xe2\x80\x94 just rearrange agencies.'b'The entire Obama economic team earned their stripes \xe2\x80\x94 for good and more often ill \xe2\x80\x94 during the deregulatory and self-regulatory efforts of the 1990s and this decade. The nation needs more and better information and reassurance, about what they have learned from that past and how they will lead the nation in the vastly different direction that Mr. Obama has promised.'b'A month of negative news for the Tennessee Valley Authority could lead to positive changes in national policy, including federal regulation of toxic coal wastes and new legal constraints on coal-fired power plants. More broadly, the authority\xe2\x80\x99s recent travails may help persuade the public that coal is nowhere near as \xe2\x80\x9cclean\xe2\x80\x9d as a high-priced industry advertising campaign makes it out to be.'b'In December, hundreds of acres of Roane County in eastern Tennessee were buried under a billion gallons of toxic coal sludge after the collapse of one of the T.V.A.\xe2\x80\x99s containment ponds. It was an accident waiting to happen and an alarm bell for Congress and federal regulators.'b'Senator Barbara Boxer of California noted that coal combustion in this country produces 130 million tons of coal ash every year \xe2\x80\x94 enough to fill a train of boxcars stretching from Washington, D.C., to Australia. Amazingly, the task of regulating the more than 600 landfills and impoundments holding this ash is left to the states, which are more often lax than not. Ms. Boxer  will press  the Obama administration to devise  rules for the disposal of coal ash as well as  design and construction standards for the impoundments.'b'Just as the T.V.A. was dealing with this mess, Lacy Thornburg, a federal district judge in North Carolina, ordered the giant utility to  reduce emissions from four coal-fired power plants that had been sending pollution into North Carolina.'b'The ruling validated an unusual legal strategy adopted by North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general, Roy Cooper, who sued the T.V.A. in 2006 on grounds that pollution from its power plants in Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky constituted a \xe2\x80\x9cpublic nuisance\xe2\x80\x9d to the citizens of his state. Mr. Cooper chose this route because the Bush administration had systematically weakened regulations that had been used in the past to force power companies to clean up their emissions.'b'Taken together, the coal ash disaster and Judge Thornburg\xe2\x80\x99s ruling did much to undercut the coal industry\xe2\x80\x99s cheery \xe2\x80\x9cclean coal\xe2\x80\x9d campaign, whose ads would have us believe that low-polluting coal is here or just around the corner.'b'It is neither.    Coal is certainly an  important fuel, providing just over half of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s electricity. And progress has been made:   new coal-fired plants are cleaner than old ones, and  older plants that have been required under the Clean Air Act to install pollution controls are cleaner than the many plants that have managed to escape the law\xe2\x80\x99s reach.'b'But coal remains an inherently dirty fuel, and a huge contributor to not only ground-level pollution \xe2\x80\x94 including acid rain and smog \xe2\x80\x94 but also global warming. The sooner the country understands that, the closer it will be to mitigating the damage.'b'Washington'b'WITHIN his first 100 days, President Obama will attend his inaugural global summit meeting: an April gathering of the Group of 20 industrialized and developing nations in London. The president, with bipartisan backing in Congress, should send an audacious signal of hope. Starting with the United States, Mr. Obama should call for each developed country to pledge 0.7 percent of its stimulus package to a vulnerability fund for assisting developing countries that can\xe2\x80\x99t afford bailouts and deficits.'b'The United States could begin by pledging some $6 billion of its own $825 billion stimulus package \xe2\x80\x94 just 4 percent of what was provided to American International Group. With this modest step, the United States would speed up global recovery, help the world\xe2\x80\x99s poor and bolster its foreign policy influence.'b'There is no time to waste. The economic crisis has already pushed an estimated 100 million people back into poverty. Slumping exports have helped imperil the jobs of workers around the world. In many places foreign and domestic investment is frozen. So far we have avoided the currency collapses of 1997 and 1998, but 2009 will be a dangerous year.'b'The good news is that if Mr. Obama sends the right signal, many countries are likely to contribute to a vulnerability fund. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has expressed interest in the idea. Last year President Nicolas Sarkozy of France called for an increase in aid, and has taken a particular interest in Africa. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany wants to help finance construction projects in poor countries.'b'Japan has already pledged to help the World Bank recapitalize banks in poor countries. Australia and Russia have supported a food vulnerability fund that we created last year. Canada has been increasing its aid; the European Commission has been debating over contributing more assistance. Last year, Saudi Arabia gave an emergency $500 million grant to the World Food Program.'b'Italy, as the host of the Group of 8 industrialized nations finance ministers\xe2\x80\x99 meeting next month, should pave the way for the Group of 20 meeting by making the drive for a vulnerability fund a priority. The World Bank, with the United Nations and regional development banks, could then manage the fund to facilitate fast and flexible aid delivery, backed by safeguards to ensure that the money is well spent.'b'There are three priorities for vulnerability fund investments. First, we need safety net programs that are aligned with the developing country\xe2\x80\x99s ability to put them to good use. Over the past year as food and fuel prices soared, the World Bank worked with United Nations agencies to increase food-for-work programs, seed and fertilizer projects, maternal and child nutrition programs and other assistance. We have committed nearly $1.2 billion for projects like a school meals program for more than 30,000 children in Haiti, a cash-for-work program in Sierra Leone for road work and drainage, and grants for farmers in Rwanda to buy fertilizer. These investments in health, education and nutrition are more than just temporary poverty relief. They are investments in human capital. The vulnerability fund would help expand these modest shock absorbers for the poor.'b'Second, investments in infrastructure can yield huge benefits. Just look at China, which demonstrated 10 years ago that wisely chosen infrastructure projects can create jobs while building a foundation for productivity and growth. The World Bank is increasing support for such projects to $15 billion a year over the next three years. This includes financing for low-carbon technology projects as well as public-private partnerships that will create jobs while improving the delivery of basic services.'b'Third, the vulnerability fund would help support small and medium-sized enterprises and microfinance institutions. Small businesses are the most dynamic and flexible employers, and the best safety net is a job. Small businesses operate where Wall Street, and even Main Street, give way to villages with no streets. The credit contraction squeezes out small businesses and their lenders, while state-owned enterprises and big companies get bailed out. The World Bank has already responded to the global crisis with plans to recapitalize small banks in developing countries, as well as by providing credit lines for microfinance institutions that serve the poorest people. The vulnerability fund would continue these initiatives.'b'The conventional wisdom is that Congress can\xe2\x80\x99t be bothered with foreign assistance. In reality, prodded by churches, schools and community groups, both Democrats and Republicans have generously backed well-run programs to improve nutrition and fight hunger, AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Congress has supported microfinance and small business development worldwide. There is an additional incentive for America to help: building projects abroad are likely to increase demand for American-made equipment.'b'Poor people in Africa should not pay the price for a crisis that originated in America. The total aid from developed countries is about $100 billion a year, a modest sum in light of developing countries\xe2\x80\x99 needs. The United Nations target for aid is 0.7 percent of an economy. The United States contribution is about 0.2 percent, although polls consistently show the American public is willing to contribute much more.'b'Support for a vulnerability fund can help limit the depth and length of the international downturn, prevent the contagion of social unrest and help save a generation from a new poverty trap. For less than 1 percent of America\xe2\x80\x99s stimulus package, President Obama can lead the G-20 in London and reintroduce America to the world.'b'President Obama wasted no time in moving to roll back the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s disgraceful strictures on open government.'b'In a welcome series of orders, Mr. Obama directed federal agencies to err on the side of transparency, not the Bush-era default of secrecy and delay, in releasing records to the public. He also undid the executive order signed by President George Bush that lets past presidents and vice presidents sit indefinitely on potentially embarrassing records that belong in the public domain.'b'And Mr. Obama issued some of the toughest limitations yet on the power of lobbyists to influence government from within. Under the new rules, anyone who leaves the Obama administration will be barred from lobbying the executive branch for the remainder of Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s time in office, rather than the yearlong ban Mr. Bush employed. In addition, no one may serve in the Obama administration if he or she lobbied an executive agency in the preceding two years.'b'The new president\xe2\x80\x99s actions provided a burst of executive sunshine that Washington badly needs. Unfortunately, Mr. Obama already wants to make an exception for William Lynn, a former lobbyist for the defense contractor Raytheon, to become deputy secretary of defense. Mr. Lynn, a respected Pentagon official in the Clinton administration, has the right r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 \xe2\x80\x94 except that he was a lobbyist until last year. This clearly violates the mint-new standard, especially since the Pentagon job is so wide-ranging that recusal on specific issues is impossible.'b'The White House is hoping for Senate approval nevertheless, arguing that while the president sought the firmest ethics rules, he also believes that \xe2\x80\x9cany standard is not perfect,\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9ca waiver process that allows people to serve their country is necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d Maybe the Senate will concur that Mr. Lynn is \xe2\x80\x9cuniquely qualified\xe2\x80\x9d and a waiver is justified. But this is not an ideal first test of Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s exemplary rules. Voters who heeded the president\xe2\x80\x99s campaign message of openness must demand any exceptions to be few and far between.'b'This is particularly true for Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s order reversing a memo from Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Justice that hobbled agencies in fulfilling the Freedom of Information Act\xe2\x80\x99s promise of accountability. A healthy democracy needs to know what is going on in its government. Small wonder historians instantly hailed Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s reversal of Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s order, which gave veto power to past presidents, vice presidents and their heirs over which executive archives are made public.'b'President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s new orders go well beyond the standards of his predecessors, particularly in shutting, not slowing, the revolving-door path from well-connected government veteran to high-salaried corporate lobbyist. The promise of transparency is heartening (though the Obama White House\xe2\x80\x99s initial opening day action in crimping photographers\xe2\x80\x99 traditional access to ceremonies was not). The president has vowed \xe2\x80\x9ca clean break from business as usual,\xe2\x80\x9d with transparency at the core. The nation welcomes this promise and will be tracking its fulfillment.'b'What is it with American bankers and their sense of entitlement?'b'After losing billions, taking billions from taxpayers and avoiding disaster only by selling itself to Bank of America, Merrill Lynch was still ready to give a multimillion-dollar \xe2\x80\x9cperformance\xe2\x80\x9d bonus to its chief executive, John Thain. It refrained only after a storm of protest that reached from Main Street to Capitol Hill.'b'As it turns out, the outrage was not enough to stop the flow of money to other executives. According to a report in The Financial Times on Thursday, Merrill granted $3 billion to $4 billion in bonuses in December \xe2\x80\x94 part of a total compensation budget of $15 billion for the year that was just slightly less than that of 2007.'b'The year-end bonuses were approved by Merrill\xe2\x80\x99s compensation committee just days after shareholders approved the merger and days before Bank of America was made aware of Merrill\xe2\x80\x99s stunning fourth-quarter losses. The news of the rushed bonuses almost prompted Bank of America to pull out of the deal and ultimately required the Treasury to provide an extra $20 billion, as well as a guarantee on billions more in potential losses.'b'Mr. Thain stepped down on Thursday. But the problem is not one banker. The entire financial industry must be made to understand that the billions it has gotten from the public purse are not a reward for the havoc it wreaked on the financial system and the lives of so many Americans.'b'The $700 billion federal rescue package was meant to shore up the banks\xe2\x80\x99 balance sheets and revive moribund lending to consumers and corporations. But banks have mostly refused to increase lending. Some healthy banks have used government money to buy their more sickly brethren \xe2\x80\x94 which might raise their standing but does the economy little good.'b'Many have been lavishing dividends on their shareholders. JPMorgan Chase has maintained its dividend despite plunging profits, squandering needed capital. Citigroup and Bank of America cut their dividends only when they got a second helping of rescue funds.'b'Though the Obama administration has not set specific criteria for the next chapter of the bank rescue, President Obama insisted he would toughen the restrictions. Clear rules are needed to limit dividends and give the government the option to block mergers between banks receiving taxpayer funds.'b'The vague rules on executive pay in the rescue legislation must also be tightened. Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has proposed banning bonuses altogether for the top 25 executives of a bank that is getting money from the Treasury rescue package. The banking rescue package was meant to serve the American economy. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the bankers\xe2\x80\x99 money.'b'We welcome President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s choice of George Mitchell to be his new Middle East envoy. It is an unenviable and essential job.'b'A former Senate majority leader, Mr. Mitchell has the stature to represent the new administration. He negotiated the 1998 Good Friday accord in Northern Ireland, good training for taking on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As a Lebanese-American, his appointment also sends an important signal that the United States will continue to be an unwavering ally of Israel but also sensitive to the Palestinians\xe2\x80\x99 many legitimate grievances.'b'His report on a failed Israeli-Palestinian cease-fire pact, produced in 2001 at former President Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s request, suggests Mr. Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s even-handed approach. It urged the Israeli government to freeze construction of new settlements and stop shooting at unarmed demonstrators, and Palestinians to prevent terrorist attacks and punish the perpetrators. That advice remains sound.'b'We fear Mr. Mitchell will find the situation even more difficult today. Eight years later, Hamas is in control of Gaza and shows no interest in making peace with Israel. The Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, who controls the West Bank, is committed to a two-state solution but has been dangerously weakened by Israel\xe2\x80\x99s invasion of Gaza.'b'One of Mr. Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s first tasks will be to find ways both to lessen the suffering of Gazans and bolster Mr. Abbas. To succeed, Mr. Mitchell will need strong support from President Obama and, we hope, a good relationship with a new Israeli prime minister who is fully committed to a two-state solution.'b'It is a tough job.

When I was growing up in New England, with Dutch immigrant parents, ice skating was taken for granted as a regular winter activity.'b'During lengthy stretches of very cold weather, the larger ponds and lakes would freeze over, and my father would pull out his ancient skates for big strides around the periphery. The long pieces of wood with a blade inserted and leather straps fastened over his boots attracted attention, much to the embarrassment of his kids.'b'While I was studying in the Netherlands during college, so I could practice my rusty mother tongue, my uncle and aunt invited me to go skating during a deep freeze. Since this was the uncle who had once completed the Dutch 11 Cities Race, I accepted, even though I had to borrow a pair of the old-fashioned skates. After a few tentative moments on the canal, I caught on and kept up.'b'While I tried to explain how much skating practice I had had growing up, my uncle insisted that the skill must have been in my genes.'b'Antonia Bloembergen'b'\n Foster City, Calif., Jan. 18, 2009'b''b'There is a strong case to be made for a short, sharp stimulus package to restrain the collapse of the American economy. This would involve big, simple programs with immediate impact \xe2\x80\x94 a temporary cut in the payroll tax, big aid to the states, expanded unemployment insurance and food stamps.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s also a very strong case to be made for long-term government reform. America could fundamentally rethink its infrastructure policies \xe2\x80\x94 create a new model adapted to new modes of community-building. It could fundamentally rethink human capital policies \xe2\x80\x94 create a lifelong menu of learning options, from pre-K programs to service opportunities for the elderly.'b'But the stimulus bill emerging in the House of Representatives does neither of these things. The bill marked up Wednesday in the Appropriations Committee is a muddled mixture of short-term stimulus haste and long-term spending commitments. It is an unholy marriage that manages to combine the worst of each approach \xe2\x80\x94 rushed short-term planning with expensive long-term fiscal impact.'b'The bill has three essential failings. First, it lacks any strategic vision. This $825 billion bill has to be passed within weeks. There\xe2\x80\x99s no time for  fundamental rethinking or new approaches. Instead, there\xe2\x80\x99s a sloppy profusion of 152 different appropriations \xe2\x80\x94 off-the-shelf ideas that mostly create costlier versions of the status quo.'b'The committee staff took the kernel of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s vision \xe2\x80\x94 infrastructure programs to create jobs \xe2\x80\x94 and surrounded it with an undisciplined sprawl of health, education, entitlement and other spending. There\xe2\x80\x99s money for nurse training, Medicare, Head Start, boatyard support, home weatherization and so on. Eleven of the programs in the bill account for the vast majority of the actual job creation. The rest may be worthy or not, but they have little to do with stimulus. The total package is so diffuse, it costs $223,000 to create a single job.'b'Second, the bill has relatively modest short-term impact. Many parts don\xe2\x80\x99t even pretend to be stimulus measures, like funding for basic research, or special ed programs. But even the parts of the bill that aim to stimulate will have modest near-term impact. A study by the Congressional Budget Office found that less than half of the money for infrastructure and discretionary programs would be spent by Oct. 1, 2010.'b'According to The Washington Post, of the $30 billion devoted to highway spending, only $4 billion will be spent in the next two years. Less than $3 billion of the $18.5 billion for renewable energy and less than half the financing for school construction will be spent by 2011.'b'The Appropriations Committee chairman, David Obey, fulminated against the C.B.O. Wednesday, and the uselessness of economists in general, but he had no answer to these findings.'b'Third, the spending measures in this bill have no sunset. In the middle of the Appropriations markup, the ranking member, Jerry Lewis from California, asked his chairman the crucial question: What happens when the economy recovers? Does this new spending disappear?'b'Chairman Obey refused to answer, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to. The entire argument for these measures over the previous hours had been that they were good in themselves. The commitments in this bill will constitute the new budget base line. They will contribute to the coming  $2 trillion deficits. Worse, these new structures, and the lobbyists they attract, will create more impediments to the innovation that Obama may seek in the years ahead.'b'On Tuesday, President Obama was inaugurated and vowed a new era. On Wednesday, the House Appropriations Committee met and showed the old era was very much alive. Democratic subcommittee chairmen sat like potted plants because all power was wielded by Chairman Obey. Republicans were in the dark because of an information embargo placed on the majority staff.'b'President Obama is clearly going to have to show the hard way that he meant what he said about bringing change. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t run for president just to sign whatever bills the Old Bulls put on his desk.'b'He\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to prove the hard way that he meant what he said about being pragmatic and evidence-based. That means he won\xe2\x80\x99t sweep a C.B.O. study under the rug simply because the findings are inconvenient.'b'He\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to show that his plans have credibility, that a stimulus bill is really a stimulus bill, and not a Christmas tree for every special interest desire.'b'If he can do that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll look back on this stimulus as a timely, temporary and targeted success. If not, we\xe2\x80\x99ll just remember it as the sprawling mess that kicked up dozens of scandal headlines about $200 million programs to lay grass around the Jefferson Memorial.'b'The glow of the inauguration lingers, but the precedent-setting tests are already at hand.'b'Like anyone who pays attention to business and financial news, I am in a state of high economic anxiety. Like everyone of good will, I hoped that President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Inaugural Address would offer some reassurance, that it would suggest that the new administration has this thing covered.'b'But it was not to be. I ended Tuesday less confident about the direction of economic policy than I was in the morning.'b'Just to be clear, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything glaringly wrong with the address \xe2\x80\x94 although for those still hoping that Mr. Obama will lead the way to universal health care, it was disappointing that he spoke only of health care\xe2\x80\x99s excessive cost, never once mentioning the plight of the uninsured and underinsured.'b'Also, one wishes that the speechwriters had come up with something more inspiring than a call for an \xe2\x80\x9cera of responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 which, not to put too fine a point on it, was the same thing former President George W. Bush called for eight years ago.'b'But my real problem with the speech, on matters economic, was its conventionality. In response to an unprecedented economic crisis \xe2\x80\x94 or, more accurately, a crisis whose only real precedent is the Great Depression \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Obama did what people in Washington do when they want to sound serious: he spoke, more or less in the abstract, of the need to make hard choices and stand up to special interests.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s not enough. In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s not even right.'b'Thus, in his speech Mr. Obama attributed the economic crisis in part to \xe2\x80\x9cour collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 but I have no idea what he meant. This is, first and foremost, a crisis brought on by a runaway financial industry. And if we failed to rein in that industry, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t because Americans \xe2\x80\x9ccollectively\xe2\x80\x9d refused to make hard choices; the American public had no idea what was going on, and the people who did know what was going on mostly thought deregulation was a great idea.'b'Or consider this statement from Mr. Obama: \xe2\x80\x9cOur workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions \xe2\x80\x94 that time has surely passed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The first part of this passage was almost surely intended as a paraphrase of words that John Maynard Keynes wrote as the world was plunging into the Great Depression  \xe2\x80\x94  and it was a great relief, after decades of knee-jerk denunciations of government, to hear a new president giving a shout-out to Keynes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe resources of nature and men\xe2\x80\x99s devices,\xe2\x80\x9d Keynes wrote, \xe2\x80\x9care just as fertile and productive as they were. The rate of our progress towards solving the material problems of life is not less rapid. We are as capable as before of affording for everyone a high standard of life. ... But today we have involved ourselves in a colossal muddle, having blundered in the control of a delicate machine, the working of which we do not understand.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But something was lost in translation. Mr. Obama and Keynes both assert that we\xe2\x80\x99re failing to make use of our economic capacity. But Keynes\xe2\x80\x99s insight   \xe2\x80\x94 that we\xe2\x80\x99re in a \xe2\x80\x9cmuddle\xe2\x80\x9d that needs to be fixed  \xe2\x80\x94 somehow was replaced with standard we\xe2\x80\x99re-all-at-fault, let\xe2\x80\x99s-get-tough-on-ourselves boilerplate.'b'Remember, Herbert Hoover didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a problem making unpleasant decisions: he had the courage and toughness to slash spending and raise taxes in the face of the Great Depression. Unfortunately, that just made things worse.'b'Still, a speech is just a speech. The members of Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s economic team certainly understand the extraordinary nature of the mess we\xe2\x80\x99re in. So the tone of Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s address may signify nothing about the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s future policy.'b'On the other hand, Mr. Obama is, as his predecessor put it, the decider. And he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to make some big decisions very soon. In particular, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to decide how bold to be in his moves to sustain the financial system, where the outlook has deteriorated so drastically that a surprising number of economists, not all of them especially liberal, now argue that resolving the crisis will require the temporary nationalization of some major banks.'b'So is Mr. Obama ready for that? Or were the platitudes in his Inaugural Address a sign that he\xe2\x80\x99ll wait for the conventional wisdom to catch up with events? If so, his administration will find itself dangerously behind the curve.'b'And that\xe2\x80\x99s not a place that we want the new team to be. The economic crisis grows worse, and harder to resolve, with each passing week. If we don\xe2\x80\x99t get drastic action soon, we may find ourselves stuck in the muddle for a very long time.'b'Washington'b'THIS week, President Obama called upon all Americans to volunteer, to pitch in and give back. We hope that  the president is serious about this challenge, because providing  more opportunities for national and community service won\xe2\x80\x99t just lift the nation\xe2\x80\x99s spirit, it could help save the economy.'b'In fact, an  investment in service as part of the economic recovery plan could add hundreds of thousands of jobs to the four million the Obama administration has proposed. And because  jobs at nonprofit groups pay so little, they would  cost the government less  than many other stimulus measures.'b'The economic crisis has hit hospitals, nursing homes, nursery schools,  centers for the elderly and  soup kitchens with a triple whammy. The evaporation of wealth has depressed  charitable donations; the state and local budget crunch has deprived nonprofit groups of their most dependable revenue stream; and, even as resources shrink, more Americans need assistance. In Michigan, for example, more than 70 percent of nonprofit groups have seen increased demand for their services, while half report that their financial support has dropped.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s important that charities remain able to help those in need. But the nonprofit plunge also seriously endangers the nation\xe2\x80\x99s job market. Nonprofit enterprises have 9.4 million employees and 4.7 million volunteers nationwide  \xe2\x80\x94 together, that\xe2\x80\x99s 10 percent of the American work force, more than the auto and financial industries combined. Yet nonprofit groups have been almost completely overlooked during the economic debate. That\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake.'b'There is, however, a bipartisan solution ready to go: during the campaign, both Mr. Obama and Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee, endorsed the Serve America Act, which would greatly expand national and community service.'b'By including key provisions of that bill in the economic recovery package, Congress and the administration would enable 250,000 Americans to do full-time service over the next two years. We can invest in a new generation of volunteers as well: if federal work-study programs were doubled, over half a million part-time opportunities a year would be created for college students. All this could be done through existing nonprofit groups, charities and faith-based organizations, not a new government bureaucracy.'b'The total two-year cost? Less than $8 billion \xe2\x80\x94 adding not even 1 percent to a $825 billion recovery package.'b'As Americans have proven in times of crisis, what we ask of ourselves matters a great deal.

They are either prisoners of their parentage or privileged by it. Some of their excuses are hollow. But other excuses are legitimate, and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t magically disappear when Obama put his left hand on the Lincoln Bible.'b'Representative Clyburn and those like him would do well to cool this rhetoric lest the enormous and ingrained obstacles facing black children get swept under the rug as Obama is swept into power. For instance:'b'\xc2\x95 According to Child Trends, a Washington research group, 70 percent of black children are 'b'born to single mothers'b'. Also, black children are the most likely to live in 'b'unsafe neighborhoods'b'. And, black teenagers, both male and female, were more likely to report having been 'b'raped'b'.'b'\xc2\x95 According to reports last year from the National Center for Children in Poverty, 60 percent of black children live in 'b'low-income families'b' and a third live in 'b'poor families'b', a higher percentage than any other race.'b'\xc2\x95 A 2006 report from National Center for Juvenile Justice said that black children are twice as likely as white and Hispanic children to be the 'b'victims of'b' \xe2\x80\x9cmaltreatment.\xe2\x80\x9d The report defines maltreatment as anything ranging from neglect to physical and sexual abuse.'b'Most of these kids will rise above their circumstances, but too many will succumb to them.

Like why, in a state chock-full of distinguished residents, it was so hard to scrounge up Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s replacement.'b'Caroline Kennedy, who seemed to have pretty much locked up the seat, told Gov. David Paterson this week that she wanted out, citing mysterious personal reasons. New York Democrats were a little resentful, particularly since for most of them there were few reasons \xe2\x80\x94 up to and including having been deceased for several weeks \xe2\x80\x94 that are grave enough to warrant passing up a free Senate seat.'b'Respectful of the longstanding state tradition that there is no situation so bad that it can\xe2\x80\x99t be made worse, Paterson\xe2\x80\x99s office followed up by sliming Kennedy.'b'Even before the messy denouement, there were worrisome signs that Kennedy was just not the kind of person who would have fun doing 4,600 events across the state. A well-adjusted U.S. senator needs to combine a sincere interest in public policy with a joyful acceptance of the need to demean oneself while begging for votes and donations. But Caroline only seemed really enthusiastic about the first bit.'b'The state\xe2\x80\x99s senior senator, Chuck Schumer, on the other hand, believes that doing something silly is a way to reassure voters that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s better than they are. One of his fondest memories is competing in a sausage-eating contest in Cheektowaga. His staff has a rule requiring aides to intervene if it looks as if their man is about to sing, dance or put on a strange hat.'b'Clinton had a zest for the endless campaign, too, although the fact that she was keeping count of the number of appearances suggests that even she perceived a very deep downside to the job.'b'On Friday in Albany, Governor Paterson introduced Kirsten Gillibrand, a 42-year-old second-term member of Congress, as the new junior senator from New York. One look and you could see that this was a woman who would like nothing more than to march in 45 parades. She thanked everybody on the planet and introduced her 8-month-old son who was, she explained happily, \xe2\x80\x9ca good eater and a good sleeper.\xe2\x80\x9d Little Henry, we have since learned, was born shortly after Gillibrand spent 13 hours in the House of Representatives, voting on the farm bill and sitting through an endless hearing of the Armed Services Committee, where she successfully offered an amendment before moving on to the delivery room.'b'Despite Gillibrand\xe2\x80\x99s giddy good cheer, there was a sense of uneasiness in the air at the press conference. And it had nothing to do with the fact that while the new senator was being unveiled, the New York State Senate\xe2\x80\x99s recently retired majority leader was being indicted for political corruption. Really, Albany takes stuff like that in stride.'b'Gillibrand is conservative by New York Democratic standards, and there were rumblings of revolt in the party\xe2\x80\x99s extremely large liberal wing. \xe2\x80\x9cA very bad choice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Representative Carolyn McCarthy of Long Island, a gun control advocate who was incensed by Gillibrand\xe2\x80\x99s perfect N.R.A. voting record.'b'The way a legislator votes is sort of, um, significant. Gillibrand\xe2\x80\x99s current House district is conservative, but the state isn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x94 particularly the Democratic part.'b'However, it seems as if the new senator\xe2\x80\x99s politics are evolving at a rate previously seen only in science-fiction movies. She\xe2\x80\x99s developed a hitherto unnoticed belief in gay marriage. At her press conference, she expressed an interest in working on one of McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s gun control bills. She has an appointment to meet in Harlem with Al Sharpton.'b'It feels as if it\xe2\x80\x99s time for the Senate to finish swearing-in new faces and move on to ... bills. Let\xe2\x80\x99s take what we\xe2\x80\x99ve got and wait and see.'b'While the governor of Illinois is having his impeachment trial, his selection for the Senate, Roland Burris, is now happily ensconced in Fred Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s old office. You will remember that in the presidential race, Thompson entered in a blaze of glory but wound up looking extremely silly. Perhaps Burris, who entered Washington on a wave of hilarity, will turn out to be a statesman.'b'Stranger things have happened. After all, we live in a world in which the former president of France was hospitalized this week after an attack by his \xe2\x80\x9cclinically depressed\xe2\x80\x9d Maltese.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re in for the long haul. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a New Yorker with a parade or sausage-eating contest coming up, be sure to invite Senator Gillibrand. Meanwhile, hope for the best. And watch out for small, bipolar dogs.'b'Boston'b'On a rainy October night in 2006, I took a cab to the John F. Kennedy library here to conduct a very public interview. As we pulled up, the driver asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s on the program?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBarack Obama,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cour next president.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I mentioned this to then-Senator Obama during the program and he got a good laugh out of it. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet announced that he was running. The capacity crowd in the auditorium was clear about what it wanted. It cheered every mention of a possible run. Obama-mania was already well under way, and it would only grow.'b'I was back at the library this week to interview Gwen Ifill about her new book, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama,\xe2\x80\x9d and I wondered aloud about this continuing love affair with all things Obama  \xe2\x80\x94  the feverish excitement, the widespread joy and pride, and the remarkable surge of hope in an otherwise downbeat, if not depressing, period.'b'Where was all this coming from? What was it about?'b'Yes, as everyone agrees, Mr. Obama is handsome, fit, smart, and a great speaker. As Ms. Ifill noted in her book, \xe2\x80\x9cVoters are attracted to youth, vitality and change.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And Americans tend to get giddy over winners, especially underdogs who take the measure of a foe thought to be impregnable  \xe2\x80\x94  in this case, the mighty forces carefully assembled over several years by the Clintons.'b'And it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the president himself who looks good. Even the shameless purveyors of fantasy at central casting would blush at the thought of crafting a family as picture perfect as the Obamas. So, yes, there is an awful lot to like about the Obama phenomenon.'b'But I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen charismatic politicians and pretty families come and go like sunrises and sunsets over the years. There was something more that was making people go ga-ga over Obama. Something deeper.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ve been watching that something this week, and it\xe2\x80\x99s called leadership. Mr. Obama has been feeding the almost desperate hunger in this country for mature leadership, for someone who is not reckless and clownish, shortsighted and self-absorbed.'b'However you feel about his policies, and there are people grumbling on the right and on the left, Mr. Obama has signaled loudly and clearly that the era of irresponsible behavior in public office is over.'b'No more crazy wars. No more torture, and no more throwing people in prison without even the semblance of due process. No more napping while critical problems like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, global warming, and economic inequality in the United States grow steadily worse.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe remain a young nation,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama said in his Inaugural Address, \xe2\x80\x9cbut in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'On Wednesday, his first full day in office, the president took steps to make the federal government more transparent, signaling immediately that the country would move away from the toxic levels of secrecy that marked the Bush years.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTransparency and rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. It was a commitment to responsible behavior, and a challenge to the public to hold the Obama administration accountable. It reminded me of the wonderful line written into a federal appeals court ruling in 2002 by Judge Damon Keith:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDemocracies die behind closed doors.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This has been the Obama way, to set a responsible example and then to call on others to follow his mature lead. In Iowa, after his victory in the Democratic caucuses a year ago, he promised to be \xe2\x80\x9ca president who will be honest about the choices and challenges we face, who will listen to you and learn from you, even when we disagree, who won\xe2\x80\x99t just tell you what you want to hear, but what you need to know.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In a cynical age, the inclination is to dismiss this stuff as so much political rhetoric. But Mr. Obama carries himself in a way that suggests he means what he says, which gives him great credibility when he urges Americans to work hard and make sacrifices, not just for themselves and their families but for the common good \xe2\x80\x94  and when he tells black audiences that young men need to hitch up their trousers and behave themselves, and that families need to turn off the TV so the kids can do their homework.'b'Or when he says of the many serious challenges facing the nation, as he did in his Inaugural Address: \xe2\x80\x9cThey will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America: They will be met.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The bond is growing between the nation and its new young leader. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope it\xe2\x80\x99s a mature romance that weathers the long haul.'b'At the press conference announcing her appointment on Friday, Senator-designate Kirsten Gillibrand acknowledged that she is still an unknown to most New Yorkers. It is a blank slate that could serve her well.'b'As she moves from representing a conservative upstate district into Hillary Rodham Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s office, Ms. Gillibrand needs to move beyond some narrower views suited to her old constituents and embrace her role as a senator of a powerful, diverse and complicated state.'b'Ms. Gillibrand certainly seems to have the capacity to make that large political leap. She comes from hearty political stock \xe2\x80\x94 her grandmother and father were powerful forces in Albany\xe2\x80\x99s city and state politics. She was an expert securities lawyer, a useful background these days. And she has managed two skillful campaigns, raising a considerable amount of money to win what was considered an unassailable Republican seat.'b'Ms. Gillibrand, 42, has solid credentials in the fight for women\xe2\x80\x99s issues, including abortion rights, and she has bravely endorsed gay marriage \xe2\x80\x94 moves that would normally be considered political suicide in her district.'b'What is the most disappointing about Ms. Gillibrand\xe2\x80\x99s record is her extreme opposition to reasonable gun control laws. Her opposition to new efforts to trace illegal guns and support for rolling back gun control laws in the District of Columbia go well beyond her declared support for hunters\xe2\x80\x99 rights. She earned a top rating and vigorous campaign support from the National Rifle Association. Her jarring views on guns could cost her a bitter Democratic primary fight next year for re-election if gun-control advocates like Representative Carolyn McCarthy of Long Island challenge her on this issue.'b'On Friday, Ms. Gillibrand seemed ready to hear arguments against her views on guns. She vowed to help push Ms. McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s latest bill to speed background checks on those who buy guns at gun shows. She should also agree to Senator Charles Schumer\xe2\x80\x99s offer to escort her on a listening tour of New York\xe2\x80\x99s urban neighborhoods where guns are not used for hunting the Thanksgiving turkey. Senator Schumer said he was confident that once she saw the problem, her views on this grave issue would \xe2\x80\x9cevolve.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ms. Gillibrand\xe2\x80\x99s appointment was the product of a particularly inept conclusion to Gov. David Paterson\xe2\x80\x99s search for a new senator. After weeks of vetting candidates, Mr. Paterson should have been able to name his replacement within hours of Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s inevitable confirmation as secretary of state earlier this week.'b'Instead, the governor-turned-Hamlet seemed to string along a host of powerful politicians unnecessarily. And his aides, hiding behind anonymity, maligned Caroline Kennedy as \xe2\x80\x9cunfit\xe2\x80\x9d for the job after she wisely withdrew her name from consideration. It was an unnecessarily sour and an ungracious way to treat a prominent citizen who stepped forward to do public service, an increasingly rare event.'b'With everything he needs to do solve New York\xe2\x80\x99s ills, Mr. Paterson should start by controlling his team.'b'When Joseph Bruno, a former New York State senator, retired last year, he took reporters on a tour of all the monuments in the Albany area that bear his name. Now, added to the stadium, the park and the bust at the airport, there is a 35-page federal indictment on eight counts that charges him with trading his considerable influence for more than $3 million in consulting fees or other compensation.'b'Mr. Bruno, a 79-year-old former boxer, has pleaded not guilty and vowed to fight the charges. But, as a statement from Common Cause, a government watchdog group, concluded correctly, this is \xe2\x80\x9can indictment of not only Joe Bruno, but New York State\xe2\x80\x99s ethics laws.\xe2\x80\x9d Mainly, it is the latest evidence that New York\xe2\x80\x99s lawmakers cannot police themselves adequately. They need federal agents and United States attorneys to do it for them.'b'Mr. Bruno, a Republican, was majority leader of the Senate for more than 13 years and, as such, one of the most powerful government officials in the state. He was one of the \xe2\x80\x9cthree men in the room\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 as Albany\xe2\x80\x99s power structure was described at the time. The indictment claims that he was paid what he called consulting fees as gifts and as payment for convincing several unions to invest in his companies. It says that Mr. Bruno then took \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretionary official action\xe2\x80\x9d on legislative, contract or regulatory issues that would help those unions.'b'Mr. Bruno also is charged with helping out Jared Abbruzzese, a businessman, who then gave the senator thousands of dollars, including $80,000 for a horse that was \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually worthless.\xe2\x80\x9d The indictment calls these rewards gifts, which under state rules should not be more than $75 a year.  The indictment, however, rests in large part on the federal law requiring \xe2\x80\x9chonest services\xe2\x80\x9d of public officials that has been used by prosecutors in the last 20 years. Assemblyman Anthony Seminerio, another Albany stalwart, is facing similar charges in Queens.'b'It is time for Albany\xe2\x80\x99s many self-declared reformers to toughen ethics requirements and oversight of lawmakers \xe2\x80\x94 including how they get money, as outside income, as gifts and as campaign contributions. New Yorkers deserve something better than this revolving door from the Capitol to the courthouse.'b'President Obama on Friday began dismantling his predecessor\xe2\x80\x99s broad and damaging assault on women\xe2\x80\x99s reproductive health and freedom. He lifted the odious gag rule that President George W. Bush imposed on international family planning groups and began trying to restore financing to the United Nations Population Fund.'b'It was a reassuring message that Mr. Obama takes seriously his duty to safeguard women\xe2\x80\x99s lives and basic rights, including free speech and the choice of whether to bear a child.'b'The gag rule was first imposed by President Ronald Reagan. It barred any health care provider receiving American family planning assistance from counseling women on abortion, engaging in political speech on abortion or providing abortions, even with its own money.'b'President Bill Clinton lifted the gag rule, but Mr. Bush reinstated it in toughened form on his first full day in office in 2001. That seriously disrupted the best quality and most accessible family planning services in poor countries. It denied women access to desperately needed contraceptives, help in preventing H.I.V.-AIDS, and maternal care. Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s executive order lifting the financing ban will mean fewer deaths from unsafe illegal abortions.'b'Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s stated intention to work with Congress to restore financing to the population fund also is a life-saving step. It ends the sorry exercise by which Mr. Bush repeatedly blocked money approved by Congress to advance poor women\xe2\x80\x99s reproductive health, reduce infant mortality, end sexual trafficking and prevent the spread of H.I.V. and AIDS.'b'To justify this cruelty, the Bush administration perpetuated a bogus charge that the population fund has either stood by or helped with coerced abortions in China.'b'We trust these policy changes mark a good start toward a larger shift that will see the Obama administration undo the full range of Republican attacks on reproductive freedom. We also hope it will press hard for passage of the Prevention First legislation designed to reduce abortions by, for example, facilitating honest sex education and improved access to contraceptives.'b'The rapidly deteriorating economy has confronted states with their toughest budget decisions in years. This month, about 45 states reported budget gaps for the present fiscal year and most expect to struggle with shortfalls over the next two years.'b'The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says that these deficits could reach $350 billion. Individual budget gaps could be quite large \xe2\x80\x94 at least a 10 percent difference between income and spending in New York and five other states this year. Since a majority of state constitutions require balanced budgets, the only alternatives are to raise taxes or cut spending.'b'To cope, many states are spending less on health care and education, which take up a large percentage of most state budges. But the bottom line is that there are few good choices and a lot of very bad ones, since services would be cut at the moment of greatest need.'b'President Obama has promised federal help, and the $825 billion stimulus package being considered in Congress contains more than $250 billion in badly needed aid to states. It is hard to see how essential state programs can survive without it.'b'New Jersey, to take one example, is cutting funds for charity care in hospitals; Massachusetts has trimmed spending for Head Start. Tennessee\xe2\x80\x99s health care reductions could deprive 30,000 to 40,000 sick people of needed care.'b'Federal help also could keep states from rushing into short-term fixes that could have bad long-term consequences. Pre-kindergarten programs save enormous amounts of money later on because as the students age they are less likely to repeat a grade, need special education or get involved with the justice system.'b'On the plus side, the fiscal crisis may force states to think creatively and, for once, use plain common sense. States burdened with billions of dollars in soaring prison budgets, like California, may no longer be able to afford the three-strikes-and-you\xe2\x80\x99re-out laws that lock up nonviolent offenders for decades for minor crimes.'b'The common itch to build new prisons must also be controlled; even Texas is beginning to make distinctions between chronic violent offenders who need long-term incarceration and those who don\xe2\x80\x99t. Utah, meanwhile, has put its full-time employees on a four-day workweek. This has saved on energy bills and, surprisingly, in reduced sick pay. Some hard choices can be wise ones.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cThe Next War President\xe2\x80\x9d (column, Jan. 19):'b'I take strong exception to William Kristol\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of what I said about Israel\xe2\x80\x99s action in Gaza and my position on violence in the Middle East. According to him, I \xe2\x80\x9clambasted Israel\xe2\x80\x9d for what I \xe2\x80\x9ccalled its \xe2\x80\x98state terrorism.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'b'Here is the exact transcript of what I said:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEvery nation has the right to defend its people. Israel is no exception, all the more so because Hamas would like to see every Jew in Israel dead. But brute force can turn self-defense into state terrorism. It\xe2\x80\x99s what the U.S. did in Vietnam, with B-52s and napalm, and again in Iraq, with shock and awe. By killing indiscriminately the elderly, kids, entire families, by destroying schools and hospitals, Israel did exactly what terrorists do and exactly what Hamas wanted. It spilled the blood that turns the wheel of retribution.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Furthermore, I do believe that the violence in the Middle East has roots deep in history, and in the competition of the three monotheistic faiths, each of which claims divine title to much of the same land.

Under such a program, a limit is set on emissions, and polluters can emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases only by obtaining permits.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s good policy. However, Dr. Chu may find the path to cap and trade made more difficult by the well-intentioned advocates of  a national \xe2\x80\x9crenewable portfolio standard,\xe2\x80\x9d which would require energy companies to produce specific amounts of electricity largely from wind, solar and geothermal energy.'b'A renewable portfolio standard is said to be needed for creating and improving renewable energy technologies. In practice, however, it does little to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and makes energy production excessively expensive.'b'Coal-fired power plants produce more than 83 percent of the electricity sector\xe2\x80\x99s carbon dioxide emissions. But because coal is cheaper than natural gas or oil, it is the least likely to be displaced by solar or wind power.'b'Natural gas has a relatively low carbon content. But it is likely to be the first to be displaced by renewable sources of energy because it is more expensive than coal. That means that even a renewable portfolio standard as high as 20 percent would reduce emissions by only a small fraction of what is needed to lower the risk of catastrophic climate change.'b'This modest decrease in carbon dioxide emissions would come at twice the cost per ton of reduction that would come from a cap-and-trade strategy. Under cap and trade, in other words, we could double the reduction for the same money. And isn\xe2\x80\x99t a maximum decrease in emissions the ultimate goal? In this struggling economy, America\xe2\x80\x99s elected officials cannot afford to make expensive choices that do not solve our problems.'b'And, most important, a renewable portfolio standard would do nothing to help develop the technology that\xe2\x80\x99s most urgently needed to address climate change: a method of capturing carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants \xe2\x80\x94 which generate more than half of all electricity in the United States.'b'To replace  all of America\xe2\x80\x99s coal-fired power plants with renewable sources of energy would cost nearly a trillion dollars. Even if the United States could pay such a price, China and other developing countries that rely on coal  far more than we do could not. China is building more and more coal-fired power plants and, by 2020, will have three times as many as the United States has today.'b'Carbon-capture technology, much more than solar or wind power or other renewable forms of energy generation, is our most important potential green technology for export. And the fastest way to develop it is to create a market for it here in the United States by establishing a cap-and-trade program that puts a price on carbon dioxide emissions, and investing private and taxpayer money in research on carbon capture and storage. A renewable portfolio standard would only divert our attention from this vital mission.'b'Consider what it would mean for our company alone. At Entergy, less than 25 percent of the electricity we produce comes from coal-fired power plants, so our carbon dioxide emissions are already low. And we are researching retrofit technologies to capture carbon dioxide from the coal plants we do have.'b'Under a renewable portfolio standard, though, we would be required to spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually developing solar, wind and geothermal energy, but would have no incentive to continue our pursuit of carbon-capture technology.'b'Renewable forms of energy have their place in meeting our needs, and putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions will make them more economically appealing. But it makes little sense to institute a renewable portfolio standard to require their development. Instead, the new energy secretary should advise President Obama to create a strong cap-and-trade program and send a clear signal to the rest of the world that we are serious about addressing climate change.'b'An editorial on Monday placed the United States incorrectly\non a list of carbon dioxide emitters. The country\nis ranked 93 out of 137, not 75 out of 107.'b'LAST April, The Times published an investigation of a Pentagon public relations program intended to win favorable coverage of the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s war on terror through retired officers working as military analysts on television. The 'b'report'b', \xe2\x80\x9cBehind TV Analysts, Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s Hidden Hand,\xe2\x80\x9d revealed a program that gave the analysts talking points and unusual access to top officials \xe2\x80\x94 contacts, the article said, that some of the officers hoped would benefit military contractors with whom they had ties.'b'Nine days ago, the Defense Department\xe2\x80\x99s inspector general 'b'concluded'b' that the program did not violate Pentagon policies and regulations, and said investigators found no case in which an officer used information or contacts obtained through the program to get a competitive advantage for a contractor.'b"Steve Capus, the president of NBC News, said in a letter to me that the report \xe2\x80\x9cundercuts the premise\xe2\x80\x9d of the Times article. I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree, and I think the Inspector General's report was a highly flawed response to an important piece of journalism that his own network is taking into account as it rewrites ethics guidelines. But I think Capus had a legitimate issue with how the Times article was presented."b'The article, by David Barstow, raised the question of whether the information program was proper but never said it was illegal or against regulations. And if no officer got a benefit for a commercial client from it, that was not because some didn\xe2\x80\x99t try. John C. Garrett, a retired Army colonel, an analyst for Fox News and a lobbyist for a firm that represents military contractors, said in the article that the access he gained through the information program helped him identify business opportunities for clients.'b'Further, the inspector general\xe2\x80\x99s office left its conclusions open to question by erroneously identifying several retired officers as having no ties to military contractors when in fact they did.'b'Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the report was \xe2\x80\x9cdisappointing.\xe2\x80\x9d He said a couple of its conclusions didn\xe2\x80\x99t square with its own evidence.'b'For example, the report said that one retired general was excluded from the briefings because he criticized the conduct of the war in Iraq, and that a senior public affairs official urged the Pentagon to cultivate a core of \xe2\x80\x9creliably friendly\xe2\x80\x9d analysts \xe2\x80\x9cthat we can count on to carry our water.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet the inspector general found \xe2\x80\x9cinsufficient evidence\xe2\x80\x9d that the Pentagon was trying to reward favorable commentators and punish critics. Levin said he hoped coming investigations by the Government Accountability Office and the Federal Communications Commission \xe2\x80\x9cwill be more objective and insightful.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Capus questioned why The Times 'b'assigned Barstow to cover'b' the inspector general\xe2\x80\x99s report. \xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t that present an inherent conflict?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. It would if the report had made Barstow himself the issue, but investigative reporters routinely write follow-up articles, and Barstow\xe2\x80\x99s was a straightforward account that said the inspector general \xe2\x80\x9cfound no wrongdoing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'NBC, with some reason, felt unfairly stung by The Times\xe2\x80\x99s report \xe2\x80\x94 a 7,500-word article, 20 photographs and 5 graphics. Nine photos of retired officers talking on television \xe2\x80\x94 four of them on NBC or MSNBC \xe2\x80\x94 dominated the front page. They included the most celebrated of all military analysts, Barry R. McCaffrey, the retired Army four-star general who just happened to be the man excluded from the Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s information program for criticizing Donald Rumsfeld\xe2\x80\x99s management of the Iraq war.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are going to show photographs of our people and list their names, then it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to ask, what are you specifically suggesting they said on air that was influenced by the Pentagon P.R. campaign?\xe2\x80\x9d Capus asked me at the time. I thought it was a good question. The article barely mentioned McCaffrey and another NBC analyst, Gen. Wayne Downing, who died in 2007, yet included them in what a reader could reasonably interpret as a virtual rogue\xe2\x80\x99s gallery of analysts spouting the Pentagon line.'b'Matthew Purdy, The Times\xe2\x80\x99s investigations editor, said the photos were intended to show \xe2\x80\x9cthe ubiquitousness\xe2\x80\x9d of the analysts on television, and that the article made their roles clear. But all it said about Downing and McCaffrey was that they were part of a group created before the war to help make the case for ousting Saddam Hussein, they had consulting firms, and they sat on boards of military contractors. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t account for McCaffrey\xe2\x80\x99s attacks on Rumsfeld.'b'What readers were not told was that this was the first of a two-part package and that the second article would focus on McCaffrey. That article was not published for seven more months, while Barstow continued reporting.'b'On Nov. 30, under the 'b'front-page headline'b' \xe2\x80\x9cOne Man\xe2\x80\x99s Military-Industrial-Media Complex,\xe2\x80\x9d Barstow wrote that McCaffrey represented an exclusive club of mostly retired generals whose \xe2\x80\x9cwar commentary can fit hand in glove with undisclosed commercial interests and network executives are sometimes oblivious to possible conflicts of interest.\xe2\x80\x9d The article cited a letter that McCaffrey wrote to Gen. David Petraeus, then the commander in Iraq, on behalf of a small company trying to sell armored vehicles. He praised Petraeus, whom he has known and championed for more than 30 years, on CNBC the same week and testified to Congress in favor of more armored vehicles in Iraq, an argument he had made before being retained by the contractor.'b'Television viewers had no idea about the association with the contractor, and David McCormick, the vice president for broadcast standards at NBC News, told me he could not recall if he knew.'b'McCaffrey was outraged by the coverage of him, though he had refused repeated requests to be interviewed by Barstow, instead issuing a short statement defending his integrity. In two conversations with me, he said he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine how The Times could publish the first article about \xe2\x80\x9cgenerals shilling for the Pentagon without mentioning me as a hero, the antithesis of that hypothesis.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Indeed, the inspector general\xe2\x80\x99s report said that investigators took sworn testimony from a senior Pentagon official that McCaffrey was \xe2\x80\x9cdisinvited\xe2\x80\x9d from briefings because he provided an \xe2\x80\x9cunfavorable perspective on the war.\xe2\x80\x9d The finding seems to contradict a 'b'letter to the editor'b' in The Times from Lawrence Di Rita, who oversaw the public affairs operation for a time and said he was \xe2\x80\x9cunaware of any decision\xe2\x80\x9d to cut off McCaffrey\xe2\x80\x99s access.'b'The second article did describe McCaffrey\xe2\x80\x99s criticism but said that after he was frozen out, he was shaken by the experience and \xe2\x80\x9cbegan to backpedal, professing his \xe2\x80\x98greatest respect\xe2\x80\x99 for Mr. Rumsfeld to Tim Russert.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'McCaffrey acknowledged that there was \xe2\x80\x9ca lull\xe2\x80\x9d in his criticism after \xe2\x80\x9cI was being pounded. I was having speeches canceled. ... I was out on an ice floe there.\xe2\x80\x9d He said Baghdad had fallen, and everyone was declaring victory.'b'He said that nothing he said or didn\xe2\x80\x99t say was because of business interests: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake. I can\xe2\x80\x99t even begin to respond to that. That\xe2\x80\x99s not who I am.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Barstow said he never intended to say that McCaffrey did anything illegal or unethical. He said he was describing how the world works and raising the issue of disclosure of potential conflicts.'b'McCaffrey, a much-decorated, thrice-wounded war hero, unhappily became the symbol of an entrenched system of insider access, overlapping interests and lack of public disclosure. It is an issue of high interest in Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Washington. Even as they testified to McCaffrey\xe2\x80\x99s integrity, some of his most ardent supporters recognized that the system presented multiple opportunities for conflicts of interest. Ralph Peters, who wrote 'b'a biting criticism'b' of Barstow\xe2\x80\x99s second article in The New York Post, said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think retired flag officers should be allowed to work in the military industry \xe2\x80\x9csince their inherent influence is simply too great.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'McCormick said NBC has \xe2\x80\x9ctaken to heart\xe2\x80\x9d issues raised in the Times coverage as it rewrites its rules on disclosure by contributors like McCaffrey. McCaffrey said he will follow any disclosure rules, as long as they apply to everybody, not just retired military officers.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cOaf of Office\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Jan. 22):'b'Thank you to Steven Pinker for demonstrating that Chief Justice John G.

Bush\xe2\x80\x99s top aides took office. At the time, nearly everyone got them wrong.'b'In January 2001, the common perception of the new Bush team was that it represented above all a reversion to the policies of previous Republican administrations. The new appointees were considered a bunch of \xe2\x80\x9cretreads.\xe2\x80\x9d Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Colin Powell and a wave of lower officials had served in the George H. W. Bush administration. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was returning to a job he had held in the Ford administration.'b'And so the expectation was that their policies would represent a return to the pragmatic approaches epitomized by the elder Mr. Bush and his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft. There would be no more Clinton-era ambitions overseas of the sort that critics acidly called \xe2\x80\x9cforeign policy as social work.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Why were these early readings of George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy team so far off the mark?'b'First, the whole notion of a team of \xe2\x80\x9cretreads\xe2\x80\x9d coming back into office glosses over the possibility of internal disagreements, both among personalities and over issues.'b'In the George H. W. Bush administration, Mr. Cheney and General Powell, as secretary of defense and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, led the Pentagon during the invasion of Panama, the Persian Gulf war and the collapse of the Soviet Union. But they had also come away from these events with very different notions of America\xe2\x80\x99s role in the world.'b'The signs of discord were there before the Bush team took office. Mr. Powell had described, in his 1995 memoir, how he jokingly told Mr. Cheney that he and his civilian aides in the Pentagon were a bunch of \xe2\x80\x9cright-wing nuts.\xe2\x80\x9d He also recalled that on the day before Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s inauguration, Mr. Cheney cleaned out his office and left the Pentagon without ever saying goodbye to General Powell.'b'Those stories were predictive: George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s Republican \xe2\x80\x9cretreads\xe2\x80\x9d quickly began to squabble \xe2\x80\x94 remember that Secretary Powell told the press that he intended to continue the Clinton policies on North Korea, but was quickly forced to take back his words. And then came Iraq.'b'The second reason so many people initially misperceived George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy team was that they failed to take into account the significant changes in the Republican Party during its eight years out of office.'b'Instead of looking for a revival of the previous Republican administration, those trying to divine the direction of George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy would have been better off examining Bob Dole\xe2\x80\x99s 1996 presidential campaign (in which Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz played leading roles), or the informal Republican meetings on Capitol Hill in the late 1990s (in which Messrs. Cheney and Rumsfeld were key participants). In these, the Republicans emphasized issues that had been secondary concerns in the previous Bush administration, including missile defense and North Korea.'b'Third, the initial predictions about the Bush \xe2\x80\x9cretreads\xe2\x80\x9d proved wrong because the judgments were based on their service at lower levels of government. Thus analysts failed to address the key question: How might each of these officials operate at the highest levels of power?'b'Consider Dick Cheney. In early 2001, he was often depicted as the embodiment of the spirit and foreign-policy prudence of past Republican administrations. Yet he emerged as the driving force for the administration\xe2\x80\x99s unilateralist policies. Brent Scowcroft, who had worked alongside Mr. Cheney in two administrations, told a reporter in 2005: \xe2\x80\x9cI consider Cheney a good friend \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99ve known him for 30 years. But Dick Cheney I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anymore."'b'The comment was understandable, but wrong. In fact, Mr. Cheney\xe2\x80\x99s views \xe2\x80\x94 on executive authority, on military power, on removing constraints from intelligence agencies \xe2\x80\x94 were relatively consistent for three decades. The difference was that by 2001 he had greater clout to put his views into effect.'b'How might this history \xe2\x80\x94 that is, the misperceptions of 2001 \xe2\x80\x94 apply to the new Obama team?'b'We should consider whether there will be disputes among his foreign-policy advisers, including Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and the national security adviser, James Jones.'b'Will the fashionable concept of a \xe2\x80\x9cteam of rivals\xe2\x80\x9d along the lines of Abraham Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s cabinet prove viable? Possibly. But it might also turn out that this phrase is merely a forced construct from events of 150 years ago. Among the Obama advisers, there have already been signs of disagreement over Russia\xe2\x80\x99s incursion into Georgia and Israel policy.'b'Yes, the Obama team includes quite a few Clinton administration personnel. But many of them now put forth different ideas and principles from what they used to, in reaction to changing circumstances \xe2\x80\x94 above all, the war in Iraq.'b'For example, many Democrats, starting with the president, have pointed with approval to the sort of realism exemplified by Mr. Scowcroft, who has long argued that foreign policy should emphasize national interests and play down issues like democracy or human rights.'b'Such praise would have been virtually unthinkable in the early 1990s, when the Democrats excoriated Mr. Scowcroft for a lack of idealism. His views haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed; rather, many Democrats have.  Believe it or not it was the Democrats in those years who voiced skepticism about the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cPowell doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the idea that American troops should be sent into combat only if there are clear goals and an endgame, and if overwhelming force can be used on behalf of those objectives. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the point of having this superb military that you\xe2\x80\x99re always talking about if we can\xe2\x80\x99t use it?\xe2\x80\x9d Madeleine Albright, the ambassador to the United Nations, asked General Powell.'b'Now, in the wake of the war in Iraq, the Democrats are in a different place. They may conceivably have to address once again the issue of humanitarian intervention, and there will probably be a wide difference of opinions among them.'b'Finally, as the Cheney experience tells us, we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t jump to conclusions about how Obama officials will behave based on the past. Should we take Hillary Clinton to be a proponent of an assertive American foreign policy, based on the positions she took on Kosovo and Iraq? Or a dove, based on her much earlier opposition to the Vietnam War? How will the garrulous senatorial style of Joe Biden work out in the executive branch? Will Mr. Gates function differently on a team of Democrats?'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s true that the George W. Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s views of foreign policy reflected a distinct worldview. It was shaped not merely by the events of Sept. 11 (as some of the departed Bush team continues to insist), but by reactions to the previous three decades of foreign policy, including Vietnam, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Persian Gulf War.'b'While that\xe2\x80\x99s all clear now, it was not so obvious on Inauguration Day in 2001. We should keep this in mind before making simplistic early judgments about Democratic \xe2\x80\x9cretreads.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Oxford, England'b'GOVERNMENT and markets both have their place in a decent society, President Obama suggested in his Inaugural Address, but can become a force for ill if they are without restraint. Missing from Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s address was only the proper name of the political philosophy, coded into the constitutional DNA of the United States, that proposes this and other balances: liberalism.'b'Like many of Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s speeches, the Inaugural Address presented, in substance, a blend of classical constitutional and modern egalitarian liberalism. The thing, but never the word. Anyone who knows anything about contemporary political discourse in the United States understands why.'b'Just over 20 years ago, a group of leading American intellectuals, gathered by the historian Fritz Stern, placed an advertisement  in this very paper trying to defend the word \xe2\x80\x9cliberalism\xe2\x80\x9d against its abuse by Ronald Reagan and others on the American right. It was in vain. Over the last two decades a truly eccentric usage has triumphed in American public debate. Liberalism has become a pejorative term denoting \xe2\x80\x94 to put the matter a tad frivolously \xe2\x80\x94 some unholy marriage of big government and fornication.'b'This weird usage leads, at the extreme, to book titles like \xe2\x80\x9cDeliver Us From Evil: Defeating Terrorism, Despotism and Liberalism.\xe2\x80\x9d But it infects the mainstream too. Asked during a primary debate to define \xe2\x80\x9cliberal,\xe2\x80\x9d and say if she was one, Hillary Clinton replied that a word originally associated with a belief in freedom had unfortunately come to mean favoring big government. So, she concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cI prefer the word progressive, which has a real American meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d This implies that the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cliberal\xe2\x80\x9d must be unreal, un-American, or possibly both.'b'The United States is not the only place where \xe2\x80\x9cliberalism\xe2\x80\x9d is fiercely contested. In a recent conference at Oxford, with speakers from the Americas, Europe, India, Japan and China, we explored what we deliberately called \xe2\x80\x9cLiberalisms.\xe2\x80\x9d Interestingly, what is furiously attacked as \xe2\x80\x9cliberalism\xe2\x80\x9d in France, and in much of Central and Eastern Europe, is precisely what is most beloved of the libertarian or \xe2\x80\x9cfiscal conservative\xe2\x80\x9d strand of the American right. When French leftists and Polish populists denounce \xe2\x80\x9cliberalism,\xe2\x80\x9d they mean Anglo-Saxon-style, unregulated free-market capitalism. (Occasionally the prefix neo- or ultra- is added to make this clear.)'b'One Chinese intellectual told us that in his country, \xe2\x80\x9cLiberalism means everything the government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like.\xe2\x80\x9d The term is used in China as a political instrument to attack, in particular, advocates of further market-oriented economic reform. Standards of what counts as socially or culturally liberal also vary widely. An Indian speaker wryly observed that in India a \xe2\x80\x9cliberal\xe2\x80\x9d father is one who allows his children to choose whom they want to marry.'b'Faced with this worldwide conceptual cacophony, some at the conference argued that we should abandon the term, or at least dismantle it into component parts with plainer meanings. But combinations and balances belong to liberalism\xe2\x80\x99s defining essence, and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. As the Oxford political theorist Michael Freeden observed, if just one of the necessary components \xe2\x80\x94 for example, the free market \xe2\x80\x94 dominates, then the result can be illiberalism. The vital, never-ending debate over liberalism is not just over its indispensable ingredients, but also over their form, proportion and relation to one another.'b'A plausible minimum list of ingredients for 21st century liberalism would include liberty under law, limited and accountable government, markets, tolerance, some version of individualism and universalism, and some notion of human equality, reason and progress. The mix of ingredients differs from place to place. Whether some distant cousin really belongs to the extended family of liberalisms is a matter of healthy dispute. But somewhere in this contested, evolving combination there is a thing of enduring value.'b'This has been an American argument, some would say 'b'the 'b'American argument, for more than 200 years. In fact, the United States is still full of liberals, both progressive or left liberals and, I would insist, conservative or right liberals. Most of them just don\xe2\x80\x99t use the word. Liberalism is the American love that dare not speak its name.'b'For obvious reasons, we are now witnessing worldwide criticism of a version of pure free-market liberalism, a k a neo-liberalism, charged with having led us into our current economic mess. Yet, our Chinese and European colleagues agreed that markets remain an indispensable condition of liberty. One leading Chinese economic reformer even suggested that there is less income inequality in those Chinese provinces where the market plays a larger role.'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect Mr. Obama to use that word any time soon. But those of us who believe in the universal, enduring value of liberalism are happy to see him start by vigorously restoring more of the thing. He has decisively reasserted the importance of equal liberty under the rule of law, not least by ordering the closing of Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay prison. Seeking a more just and efficient balance between government and markets is at the heart of his domestic agenda. He has also found ways to present the traditional liberal value of tolerance in new language that speaks to our increasingly mixed-up world.'b'Then, perhaps in his second term, he might even dare to rescue the word.'b'Some people claim that Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s election has ushered in a \xe2\x80\x9cpostracial\xe2\x80\x9d America, but the truth is that race, and racial discrimination, are still very much with us. The Supreme Court should keep this reality in mind when it considers a challenge to an important part of the Voting Rights Act that it recently agreed to hear. The act is constitutional \xe2\x80\x94 and clearly still needed.'b'Section 5, often called the heart of the Voting Rights Act, requires some states and smaller jurisdictions to \xe2\x80\x9cpreclear\xe2\x80\x9d new voting rules with the Justice Department or a federal court. When they do, they have to show that the proposed change does not have the purpose or effect of discriminating against minority voters.'b'When Congress enacted Section 5 in 1965, officials in the South were creating all kinds of rules to stop blacks from voting or being elected to office. Discrimination against minority voters may not be as blatant as it was then, but it still exists. District lines are drawn to prevent minorities from winning; polling places are located in places hard for minority voters to get to; voter ID requirements are imposed with the purpose of suppressing the minority vote.'b'After holding lengthy hearings to document why the Voting Rights Act was still needed, Congress reauthorized it in 2006 with votes of 98 to 0 in the Senate and 390 to 33 in the House. Now, a municipal utility district in Texas that is covered by Section 5  is arguing that it is unconstitutional, and that it imposes too many burdens on jurisdictions covered by it.'b'If the Supreme Court \xe2\x80\x94 which is expected to hear arguments in the case this spring \xe2\x80\x94 strikes down Section 5, it would be breaking radically with its own precedents. The court has repeatedly upheld the Voting Rights Act against challenges, and as recently as 2006 it ruled that complying with Section 5 is a compelling state interest. It would also be an extreme case of conservative judicial activism, since the 14th and 15th Amendments expressly authorize Congress to enact laws of this sort to prevent discrimination in voting.'b'A perennial criticism of Section 5  is that it covers jurisdictions it should not, or fails to cover ones it should. There is no way to construct a perfect list, but Congress has done a reasonable job of drawing up the criteria, and it has built flexibility into the act. Jurisdictions are allowed to \xe2\x80\x9cbail out\xe2\x80\x9d if they can show that they no longer need to be covered, and courts can add new jurisdictions if they need to be covered.'b'In last fall\xe2\x80\x99s election, despite his strong national margin of victory \xe2\x80\x94 and hefty campaign chest \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Obama got only about one in five white votes in the Southern states wholly or partly covered by Section 5. And there is every reason to believe that minority voters will continue to face obstacles at the polls.'b'If Section 5 is struck down, states and localities would have far more freedom to erect barriers for minority voters \xe2\x80\x94 and there is little doubt that some would do just that. We have not arrived at the day when special protections like the Voting Rights Act are not needed.'b'Eight years is never enough. And in time-honored fashion, the Bush administration used its last two months in office to rush through a series of regulatory changes. In equally time-honored fashion, Rahm Emanuel, President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s chief of staff, has ordered all agencies and departments to review these rules and, where possible, suspend or stop the ones they don\xe2\x80\x99t like.'b'Any rules that were not completed by Jan. 20 can simply be withdrawn or rewritten. Those that have become law can be undone in three ways, all laborious.'b'One is to undertake a new rule-making process \xe2\x80\x94 preliminary proposals, public comment and hearings, a final proposal, etc. \xe2\x80\x94 which could take months or even years. The second is to ask Congress to revoke the rule under the rarely used Congressional Review Act. The third is to wait for an outside group to bring suit, then step aside and not defend the rule in court.'b'Here is a selection of last-minute rules that in our view are worth overturning one way or another.'b''b'Health care:'b' One particularly objectionable rule took effect the day President Bush left town. It gives an increased number of medical institutions and a broad range of health care workers the right to refuse to provide abortion referrals, unbiased counseling or emergency contraception, even to rape victims \xe2\x80\x94 further restricting women\xe2\x80\x99s rights to health care. The administration should suspend enforcement and craft a new rule.'b''b' Gun control: 'b'A new rule would end a 25-year ban on carrying loaded weapons in national parks, which are among the safest places in this country. Before that changes, the administration should overturn this rule.'b''b'Workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights: 'b'Revisions to the federal guest worker program would weaken wage protections and housing standards for temporary agricultural workers, who already have far too few protections.'b''b'The environment: 'b'The Bush administration worked overtime in its waning days to weaken protections for the air, water and endangered species. Representative Nick Rahall, a Democrat from West Virginia, plans to invoke the Congressional Review Act to overturn an Interior Department ruling that carved out significant exceptions to required scientific reviews of federal projects that could harm threatened or endangered species.'b'Interior\xe2\x80\x99s last-minute rules also eased restrictions on mining companies that dump waste into rivers and streams; opened two million acres of Western lands to potentially harmful oil shale development; and revoked Congress\xe2\x80\x99s authority to withdraw land from commercial development in emergencies. The Environmental Protection Agency, meanwhile, relaxed restrictions on water and air pollution from factory farms.'b'We suspect other agencies simply ran out of time. Even so, the new administration must try to undo all the damage that did get done.'b'The forest green has long healed in Shanksville, Pa., where Flight 93 crashed as its passengers gave their lives struggling against the hijackers of 9/11. Further healing is at hand with the end of rancorous, shameful delay in creating a memorial to honor the 40 passengers and crew.'b'A running fight over land prices threatened the planned opening  \xe2\x80\x94 on 9/11/11, the flight\xe2\x80\x99s 10th anniversary \xe2\x80\x94   of the first and most sacred part of the memorial: the precise site where the plane plunged into the earth. Breaking the deadlock required a personal plea from the victims\xe2\x80\x99 long-suffering families to George W. Bush in his final days as president.'b'Congress had already authorized the memorial; the major obstacle was the government\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance to condemn and take possession of the acreage that would form the centerpiece of the memorial. The victims\xe2\x80\x99 families had worked tirelessly on their own to assemble surrounding parcels through donations. Absent an order for eminent domain, however, the National Park Service and the principal landowner were left to engage in unseemly haggling over prices for the core site \xe2\x80\x94 an old strip mine sward that is now, de facto, a cemetery.'b'Mr. Bush finally agreed that condemnation was the best course and ordered the Department of the Interior to seek a settlement in court. The Park Service agreed to take immediate possession so work can begin on preparing the site in time for the 10th-anniversary opening.'b'The Flight 93 families should not have been put through all this; having to wait while the contending parties haggled over price was particularly reprehensible. The families\xe2\x80\x99 resolve to fight through to a solution is a memorial in itself to their lost loved ones\xe2\x80\x99 defense of the nation.'b'Legally, at least, getting drunk was not an option at the onset of the Great Depression. Prohibition, in effect from 1920 through 1933,  stopped hordes of unemployed Americans from lawfully getting sloshed. The forces of temperance needn\xe2\x80\x99t have bothered. As the world skids deeper into recession today, workers are resisting the temptation to drown their sorrows in booze.'b'SABMiller, the second-biggest brewer in the world, reported a surprise 1 percent drop in volume shipments in the last three months of 2008, compared with a year earlier. Its lager volumes in Europe fell 1 percent, led by a 22 percent drop in Russia. In the United States, volume sales of its MillerCoors joint venture with Canada\xe2\x80\x99s Molson dropped 2.3 percent.'b'The Danish brewer Carlsberg announced it was cutting about 275 jobs in Europe. Diageo, which makes everything from Cuervo tequila to Guinness, put on hold an $840 million  expansion of beer production in Ireland. The British Beer and Pub Association reported that pubs were struggling across the country as beer sales fell to their lowest in 70 years.'b'Makers of other forms of tipple are getting worried too. Rob Sands, president and chief executive of Constellation Brands, the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest wine company, warned  this month that he was \xe2\x80\x9crecalibrating our sales expectations\xe2\x80\x9d to account for the weak macroeconomic environment.'b'I had expected booze to behave more like Big Macs or items sold at Wal-Mart, which do well in bad times because consumers trade down. Psychologists argue that people frequently turn to alcohol as self-medication to manage the stress caused by unemployment.'b'In fact, a 2006 survey of alcohol consumption among some 4,500 Scottish men found that the unemployed consumed about 40 percent more alcoholic beverages than the employed and were 75 percent more likely to be binge drinkers. In Russia, deaths by alcohol poisoning jumped by nearly 300 percent after the economy went into a tailspin in 1992.'b'Evidently, some other dynamic is muting our tendency for therapeutic inebriation. A study based on surveys by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 1987 through 1999 found that drinking in this country generally drops during economic hard times, especially among heavy drinkers.'b'On balance, this is a good thing. It is probably best for us to face the economic downturn as soberly as possible. Still, the decline in our alcoholic intake is not necessarily all for the good. The study based on C.D.C. data suggested that alcohol sales were falling because workers\xe2\x80\x99 incomes were falling too. It\xe2\x80\x99s not about virtue but affordability.'b'So here\xe2\x80\x99s another reason to hope the economic tailspin can be brought to a halt as soon as possible: more of us will be able to afford a drink.'b'To the Editor:'b'In \xe2\x80\x9cThe Next War President\xe2\x80\x9d (column, Jan. 19), William Kristol says, \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but reflect that a distressingly small number of my fellow Jews seem to have given much thought at all to the fact that President Bush is one of the greatest friends the state of Israel \xe2\x80\x94 and, yes, the Jewish people \xe2\x80\x94 have had in quite a while.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As a dual citizen of the United States and Israel, I often think about, and of course appreciate, Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s friendship.

Just one of their investments, the 'b'Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations'b', has  saved more than three million lives since 2000.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s a down payment.'b'In 1960, almost 20 million children died annually before age 5, Mr. Gates notes. There are more children today, yet the death toll has been halved to under 10 million annually. Now his goal is to see it halved again, saving an additional five  million children\xe2\x80\x99s lives annually.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re on the verge of some big advances,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Gates said. In particular, a promising malaria vaccine will enter its final phase of human trials this year, with others behind it. Mr. Gates said he is \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely confident\xe2\x80\x9d that a successful malaria vaccine will be achieved, probably within a half dozen years, and an AIDS vaccine 10 or more years from now.'b'Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m a cynical journalist, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to sound too infatuated. I think the Gates Foundation has missed the chance to leverage the revolution in social entrepreneurship, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been as effective in advocacy as it has been in research, and has missed an opportunity to ignite a broad social movement behind its issues.'b'But if Mr. Gates manages to accomplish as much in the world of vaccines, health and food production as he thinks he can, then the consequences will be staggering. Squared.  In that case, the first few paragraphs of Mr. Gates\xe2\x80\x99s obituary will be all about overcoming diseases and poverty, barely mentioning his earlier career in the software industry.'b'Mr. Gates said he got the idea for an annual letter from Warren Buffett, who writes such a letter ruminating about investments and the business world.

For example, the Gates Foundation made a major push for smaller high schools in the United States, often helping to pay for the creation of small schools within larger buildings.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMany of the small schools that we invested in did not improve students\xe2\x80\x99 achievement in any significant way,\xe2\x80\x9d he acknowledges. Small schools succeeded when the principal was able to change teachers, curriculum and culture, but smaller size by itself proved disappointing. \xe2\x80\x9cIn most cases,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cwe fell short.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Gates comes across as a strong education reformer, focusing on supporting 'b'charter schools'b' and improving teacher quality.

If you want your child to get the best education possible, it is actually more important to get him assigned to a great teacher than to a great school.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Gates told me he was optimistic that President Obama would make progress on these issues, notwithstanding the economic crisis, and he noted that the downturn had only added to the need for foreign assistance and education spending. \xe2\x80\x9cThe poorer you are, the worse the impact is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'I asked Mr. Gates what advice he had for ordinary readers who might want to engage in micro-philanthropy.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe key thing is to pick a cause, whether its crops or diseases or great high schools,\xe2\x80\x9d he  said. \xe2\x80\x9cPick one and get some more in-depth knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d If possible, travel to see the problems firsthand, then pick an organization to support with donations or volunteer time.'b'So try it.

We spent a decade feasting on easy money, don\xe2\x80\x99t-pay-as-you-go consumerism and a metastasizing celebrity culture.

He spoke of those at the economic pinnacle who embraced greed and irresponsibility as well as the rest of us who collaborated in our \xe2\x80\x9ccollective failure to make hard choices.\xe2\x80\x9d He branded as sub-American those who \xe2\x80\x9cprefer leisure over work or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame.\xe2\x80\x9d And he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just asking Paris Hilton \xe2\x80\x9cto set aside childish things.\xe2\x80\x9d As Linda Hirshman astutely pointed out 'b'on The New Republic\xe2\x80\x99s Web site'b', even Obama\xe2\x80\x99s opening salutation  \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cMy fellow citizens,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cfellow Americans\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x94 invoked the civic responsibilities we\xe2\x80\x99ve misplaced en masse.'b'These themes are not new for Obama. They were there back on Feb. 10, 2007, when, on another frigid day, 'b'he announced'b' his presidential candidacy in Springfield, Ill. Citing \xe2\x80\x9cour mounting debts\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chard choices,\xe2\x80\x9d he talked of how \xe2\x80\x9ceach of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csome measure of sacrifice.\xe2\x80\x9d His campaign, he said then, \xe2\x80\x9chas to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship.\xe2\x80\x9d But the press, convinced that Obama was a sideshow to the inevitable Clinton-Giuliani presidential standoff, didn\xe2\x80\x99t parse his words all that carefully, and neither did a public still maxing out on its gluttonous holiday from economic history. However inadvertently, Time magazine had captured the self-indulgent tenor of the times when, weeks earlier, it slapped some reflective Mylar on its cover and 'b'declared'b' that the 2006 Person of the Year was \xe2\x80\x9cYou.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It was in keeping with the unhinged spirit of the boom that three days after Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Springfield declaration, a Wall Street baron, Steven Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group, a private equity and hedge fund, 'b'celebrated his 60th birthday'b' with some 350 guests in the vast Seventh Regiment Armory on Manhattan\xe2\x80\x99s East Side. To appreciate the degree of ostentation and taste, you need only know that Rod Stewart was the headliner, at 'b'an estimated cost'b' of $1 million.'b'That same week the National Association of Realtors 'b'told'b' less well-heeled Americans not to fret about its report that median home prices had fallen in 73 metro areas during the final quarter of 2006. \xe2\x80\x9cThe bottom appears to have already occurred,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the N.A.R. economists. Another predicted: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we get the figures for this spring, I expect to see a discernible improvement in both sales and prices.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We have discerned what happened to those sales and prices ever since. As for the Blackstone Group, it 'b'went public'b' four months after its leader\xe2\x80\x99s 60th birthday revels. Its shares have 'b'since lost'b' 85 percent of their value, and Schwarzman\xe2\x80\x99s bash has become a well-worn symbol of our deflated Gilded Age.'b'Yet the values of the bubble remain entrenched even as Obama takes office. In the upper echelons, we can find fresh examples of greed and irresponsibility daily even without dipping into the growing pool of those money \xe2\x80\x9cmanagers\xe2\x80\x9d who spirited victims to Bernie Madoff.'b'Last week\xe2\x80\x99s object lesson was John Thain, the chief executive of Merrill Lynch. He was lionized as a rare Wall Street savior as recently as September, when he helped seal the deal that sped his teetering firm into the safe embrace of Bank of America 'b'on the same weekend'b' Lehman Brothers died. Since then we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned that even as he was 'b'laying off Merrill employees'b' by the thousands,  he was lobbying (unsuccessfully) for 'b'a personal bonus'b' as high as $30 million and 'b'spending'b' $1.22 million of company cash on refurbishing his office, an instantly notorious 'b'$1,405 trashcan'b' included.'b'Thain 'b'resigned'b' on Thursday. Only then did we learn that he 'b'doled out billions'b' in secret, last-minute bonuses to his staff last month, just before Bank of America took over and just before the government ponied up a second bailout to cover Merrill\xe2\x80\x99s unexpected $15 billion fourth-quarter loss. So far American 'b'taxpayers have spent'b' $45 billion on this mess, and that\xe2\x80\x99s only our down payment.'b'In less lofty precincts of the American economic spectrum, the numbers may be different but the ethos has often been similar. As Wall Street titans grabbed bonuses based on illusory, short-term paper profits, so regular Americans took on all kinds of debt wildly disproportionate to their assets and income. The nearly 'b'$1 trillion in unpaid credit-card balances'b' is now on deck to be the next big crash.'b'This debt-ridden national binge of greed and irresponsibility washed over our culture not just through the Marie Antoinette antics of a Schwarzman and a Thain but in mass forms of conspicuous consumption and entertainment. Cable networks like Bravo, A&amp;E, TLC and HGTV produced an avalanche of creepy programming catering to the decade\xe2\x80\x99s housing bubble alone  \xe2\x80\x94 an orgiastic genre that might be called Subprime Pornography. Some of the series  \xe2\x80\x94  \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Flip This House'b',\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Flip That House'b',\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Sell This House'b',\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c'b'My House Is Worth What'b'?\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x94  still play on even as more and more house owners are being flipped into destitute homelessness.'b'The austerity of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Inaugural Address seemed a tonal corrective to the glitz and the glut. The speech was, as my friend Jack Viertel, a theater producer, put it, \xe2\x80\x9cstoic, stern, crafted in slabs of granite, a slimmed-down sinewy thing entirely evolved away from the kind of Pre-Raphaelite style of his earlier oration.\xe2\x80\x9d Some of the same critics who once accused Obama of sounding too much like a wimpy purveyor of Kumbaya now faulted him for not rebooting those golden oldies of the campaign trail as he took his oath. But he is no longer campaigning, and the moment for stadium cheers has passed.'b'If we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned anything since the election, it is this: We have not remotely seen the bottom of this economy, and no one has a silver bullet to arrest the plunge, the hyped brains in the new White House included. Most economists failed to anticipate the disaster, after all, and our tax-challenged incoming Treasury Secretary may prove as evanescent as past saviors du jour. As we applauded Thain in September, we were also desperately trying to convince ourselves that Warren Buffett\xe2\x80\x99s $5 billion 'b'investment in Goldman Sachs'b' would turn the tide, and that Hank Paulson, as Newsweek wrote in a 'b'cover story'b' titled \xe2\x80\x9cKing Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'would be'b' the \xe2\x80\x9cright man at the right time.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Obama couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give us 'b'F.D.R.\xe2\x80\x99s first inaugural address'b' because we are not yet where America was in 1933  \xe2\x80\x94 in its fourth year of downturn after the crash of \xe2\x80\x9929, with an 'b'unemployment rate of 25 percent'b'. But no one knows for sure that we cannot end up there.'b'On Tuesday, our new president did offer one subtle whiff of the Great Depression. His 'b'injunction that'b' \xe2\x80\x9cwe must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off\xe2\x80\x9d was a paraphrase of 'b'the great songwriter Dorothy Fields'b', who wrote that lyric for \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Swing Time'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (1936), arguably the best of the escapist musicals Hollywood churned out to lift the nation\xe2\x80\x99s spirits in hard times. But Obama yoked that light-hearted evocation of Astaire and Rogers to a call for sacrifice that was deliberately somber, not radiantly Kennedyesque.'b'That call included the obligatory salutes to those who serve by parenting, firefighting or helping strangers when natural disaster strikes. But he also cited one less generic example: \xe2\x80\x9cworkers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job.\xe2\x80\x9d There will be  \xe2\x80\x94  there must be  \xe2\x80\x94  far larger sacrifices in that vein yet to come. No one truly listening to the Inaugural Address could doubt that this former community organizer intends to demand plenty from us as we face down what he calls \xe2\x80\x9craging storms.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Last weekend, Bob Woodward 'b'wrote an article for The Washington Post'b' listing all the lessons the new president can learn from his predecessor\xe2\x80\x99s many blunders. But what have we learned from our huge mistakes during the Bush years? While it\xe2\x80\x99s become a Beltway clich\xc3\xa9 that America\xe2\x80\x99s new young president has yet to be tested, it is past time for us to realize that our own test is also about to begin.'b'Stop me if you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard this one before. \xe2\x80\x9cGuy walks into a bar ...\xe2\x80\x9d No, not that one  \xe2\x80\x94  this one: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is 'b'the'b' most critical year ever for Palestinian-Israeli diplomacy. It is five minutes to midnight. If we don\xe2\x80\x99t get diplomacy back on track soon, it will be the end of the two-state solution.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that line almost every year for the last 20, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never bought it. Well, today, I\xe2\x80\x99m buying it.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re getting perilously close to closing the window on a two-state solution, because the two chief window-closers  \xe2\x80\x94  Hamas in Gaza and the fanatical Jewish settlers in the West Bank  \xe2\x80\x94  have been in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seats. Hamas is busy making a two-state solution inconceivable, while the settlers have steadily worked to make it impossible.'b'If Hamas continues to obtain and use longer-  and longer-range rockets, there is no way any Israeli government can or will tolerate independent Palestinian control of the West Bank, because a rocket from there can easily close the Tel Aviv airport and shut down Israel\xe2\x80\x99s economy.'b'And if the Jewish settlers continue with their \xe2\x80\x9cnatural growth\xe2\x80\x9d to devour the West Bank, it will also be effectively off the table. No Israeli government has mustered the will to take down even the \xe2\x80\x9cillegal,\xe2\x80\x9d unauthorized settlements, despite promises to the U.S. to do so, so it\xe2\x80\x99s getting hard to see how the \xe2\x80\x9clegal\xe2\x80\x9d settlements will ever be removed. What is needed from Israel\xe2\x80\x99s Feb. 10 elections is a centrist, national unity government that can resist the blackmail of the settlers, and the rightist parties that protect them, to still implement a two-state solution.'b'Because without a stable two-state solution, what you will have is an Israel hiding behind a high wall, defending itself from a Hamas-run failed state in Gaza, a Hezbollah-run failed state in south Lebanon and a Fatah-run failed state in Ramallah. Have a nice day.'b'So if you believe in the necessity of a Palestinian state or you love Israel, you\xe2\x80\x99d better start paying attention. This is not a test. We\xe2\x80\x99re at a hinge of history.'b'What makes it so challenging for the new Obama team is that Mideast diplomacy has been transformed as a result of the regional disintegration since Oslo  \xe2\x80\x94  in three key ways.'b'First, in the old days, Henry Kissinger could fly to three capitals, meet three kings, presidents or prime ministers and strike a deal that could hold. No more. Today a peacemaker has to be both a nation-builder and a negotiator.'b'The Palestinians are so fragmented politically and geographically that half of U.S. diplomacy is going to be about how to make peace between Palestinians, and build their institutions, so there is a coherent, legitimate decision-making body there  \xe2\x80\x94  before we can make peace between Israelis and Palestinians.'b'Second, Hamas now has a veto over any Palestinian peace deal. It\xe2\x80\x99s true that Hamas just provoked a reckless war that has devastated the people of Gaza. But Hamas is not going away. It is well armed and, despite its suicidal behavior of late, deeply rooted.'b'The Palestinian Authority led by Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank will not make any compromise deal with Israel as long as it fears that Hamas, from outside the tent, would denounce it as traitorous. Therefore, Job 2 for the U.S., Israel and the Arab states is to find a way to bring Hamas into a Palestinian national unity government.'b'As the Middle East expert Stephen P. Cohen says, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not enough for Israel that the world recognize that Hamas criminally mismanaged its responsibility to its people. Israel\xe2\x80\x99s longer-term interest is to be sure that it has a Palestinian partner for negotiations, which will have sufficient legitimacy among its own people to be able to sign agreements and fulfill them. Without Hamas as part of a Palestinian decision, any Israeli-Palestinian peace will be meaningless.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But bringing Hamas into a Palestinian unity government, without undermining the West Bank moderates now leading the Palestinian Authority, will be tricky. We\xe2\x80\x99ll need Saudi Arabia and Egypt to buy, cajole and pressure Hamas into keeping the cease-fire, supporting peace talks and to give up rockets  \xe2\x80\x94  while Iran and Syria will be tugging Hamas the other way.'b'And that leads to the third new factor  \xe2\x80\x94  Iran as a key player in Palestinian-Israeli diplomacy. The Clinton team tried to woo Syria while isolating Iran. President Bush tried to isolate both Iran and Syria. The Obama team, as Martin Indyk argues in \xe2\x80\x9cInnocent Abroad: An Intimate Account of American Peace Diplomacy in the Middle East,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cneeds to try both to bring in Syria, which would weaken Hamas and Hezbollah, while also engaging Iran.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'So, just to recap: It\xe2\x80\x99s five to midnight and before the clock strikes 12 all we need to do is rebuild Fatah, merge it with Hamas, elect an Israeli government that can freeze settlements, court Syria and engage Iran  \xe2\x80\x94  while preventing it from going nuclear  \xe2\x80\x94  just so we can get the parties to start talking. Whoever lines up all the pieces of this diplomatic Rubik\xe2\x80\x99s Cube deserves two Nobel Prizes.'b'WASHINGTON'b'I love Blago.'b'I love his beady little eyes. I love his Serbian shock of hair. I love his flaring nostrils. I love the way he jogs through the snow under indictment, like a stork in spandex trying to gallop. I love the way he compares himself in quick order to Pearl Harbor, Oliver Wendell Holmes and a dead cowboy.'b'I love the hurly-burly way the Illinois governor rammed through his choice for the Senate, compared with the namby-pamby way the New York governor strangled his best choice for the Senate.'b'So now we have an N.R.A. handmaiden in Bobby Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s old seat? Kirsten Gillibrand, a k a Tracy Flick, accepting the honor with her Republican pal Al D\xe2\x80\x99Amato beside her on stage? Gross.'b'After quoting Kipling and Tennyson in previous shameless press conferences, Blago moved on to an old cowboy movie analogy on Friday to explain why he should be allowed to call Rahm Emanuel, Valerie Jarrett and Jesse Jackson Jr. as witnesses at the impeachment trial he\xe2\x80\x99s refusing to attend.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere was an old saying in the Old West,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a cowboy who was charged with stealing a horse in town. And some of the other cowboys, especially the guy whose horse was stolen, were very unhappy with that guy. And one of the cowboys said, \xe2\x80\x98Let\xe2\x80\x99s hang him.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the other cowboys said: \xe2\x80\x98Hold on. Before we hang him, let\xe2\x80\x99s first give him a fair trial. Then we\xe2\x80\x99ll hang him.\xe2\x80\x99 Under these rules, I\xe2\x80\x99m not even getting a fair trial. They\xe2\x80\x99re just hanging me.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Raising his own high bar for chutzpah, he complained to The Associated Press   about his arrest, \xe2\x80\x9cDec. 9 to my family, to us, to me, is what Pearl Harbor Day was to the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Even though he is accused of pressuring The Chicago Tribune  \xe2\x80\x94 fire members of the editorial board who had criticized him or lose his help in selling the prime asset Wrigley Field  \xe2\x80\x94 Blago called on The Tribune to write editorials defending his rights.'b'Mayor Richard Daley pronounced Blago \xe2\x80\x9ccuckoo.\xe2\x80\x9d Governor Paterson is simply a goofball.'b'Paterson could have acted a month ago, or even a week ago. There was no reason not to, certainly not his claim that he had to wait for Hillary, ad nauseam, to exit to State. Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s governor named Michael Bennet senator two and a half weeks before Ken Salazar resigned his seat for the Interior Department.'b'Then the Democrats would have had another Kennedy in the Senate representing New York \xe2\x80\x94  Bobby\xe2\x80\x99s niece and a smart, policy-oriented, civic-minded woman to whom the president feels deeply indebted in an era when every state has its hand out.'b'Instead they have Gillibrand, who voted against the Wall Street \xe2\x80\x94  as in New York \xe2\x80\x94 bailout bill. And who introduced a bill to balance the federal budget annually, which suggests she would oppose the $825 billion in deficit spending that President Obama proposes to rescue the country, not least New York.'b'Paterson\xe2\x80\x99s five weeks of dithering let the jealous vindictiveness of the Clintons and friends  \xe2\x80\x94 still fuming over Caroline\xe2\x80\x99s endorsement of Obama and Teddy\xe2\x80\x99s blocking Hillary from a leading health care role in the Senate  \xe2\x80\x94 poison the air. With his usual sense of entitlement and aggrievement, Bill Clinton of Arkansas did not want Caroline Kennedy of New York to have the seat that Hillary Clinton of Illinois held.'b'Paterson wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking of New York, only of how an upstate ally who was a woman would bolster his own chances for re-election. We can only hope that an avenging Andrew Cuomo takes him out in a primary.'b'The 42-year-old Gillibrand, who has been in the House for only two years, is known as opportunistic and sharp- elbowed. Tracy Flick is her nickname among colleagues in the New York delegation, many of whom were M.I.A. at her Albany announcement.'b'Fellow Democrats were warning Harry Reid on Friday that he was going to have his hands full with the new senator because she\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ca pain.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Chuck Schumer embraced Gillibrand because at long last he can be the best-known senator from New York, something that would have been impossible with Kennedy.'b'The governor who began his accidental tenure, thanks to Client 9, by confessing his infidelities and drug use had so little class that he trashed Kennedy while letting her hang out to dry, then let aides trash her even after she dropped out.'b'Kennedy friends said that, as Caroline was pulling out for family reasons, the governor made a crude attempt to control the spin  \xe2\x80\x94 a childish \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t quit, I\xe2\x80\x99m firing you\xe2\x80\x9d power play.'b'Carolyn McCarthy, who ran for Congress on an antigun platform after her husband was killed and her son wounded   by a gunman on the Long Island Rail Road  in 1993, said she may challenge the \xe2\x80\x9cN.R.A. poster child\xe2\x80\x9d in 2010.'b'She had the best line Friday, wondering about the chuckle-headed governor: \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s in control up there?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'AS diplomats stitch together a cease-fire between Hamas and Israel, the most depressing feature of the conflict is the sense that future fighting is inevitable. Rational calculation suggests that neither side can win these wars. The thousands of lives and billions of dollars sacrificed in fighting demonstrate the advantages of peace and coexistence; yet still both sides opt to fight.'b'This small territory is the world\xe2\x80\x99s great symbolic knot. \xe2\x80\x9cPalestine is the mother of all problems\xe2\x80\x9d is a common refrain among  people we have interviewed across the Muslim world: from Middle Eastern leaders to fighters in the remote island jungles of Indonesia; from Islamist senators  in Pakistan to volunteers for martyrdom on the move from Morocco to Iraq.'b'Some analysts  see this as a testament to the essentially religious nature of the conflict. But research we recently undertook suggests a way to go beyond that. For there is a moral logic to seemingly intractable religious and cultural disputes. These conflicts cannot be reduced to secular calculations of interest but must be dealt with on their own terms, a logic very different from the marketplace or realpolitik.'b'Across the world, people believe that devotion to sacred or core values that incorporate moral beliefs \xe2\x80\x94 like the welfare of family and country, or commitment to religion and honor \xe2\x80\x94 are, or ought to be, absolute and inviolable. Our studies, carried out with the support of the National Science Foundation and the Defense Department, suggest that people will reject material compensation  for dropping their commitment to sacred values and will defend those values regardless of the costs.'b'In our research, we surveyed nearly 4,000 Palestinians and Israelis from  2004 to  2008,  questioning citizens across the political spectrum including  refugees, supporters of Hamas and Israeli settlers in the West Bank. We asked them to  react to  hypothetical but realistic compromises in which their side would be required to give away something it valued in return for a lasting peace.'b'All those surveyed responded to the same set of deals. First they would be given a straight-up offer in which each side would make  difficult concessions in exchange for peace; next they were given a scenario in which their side was granted an additional material incentive; and last came a proposal in which the other side agreed to a symbolic sacrifice of one of its sacred values.'b'For example, a typical set of trade-offs offered to a Palestinian might begin with this premise: Suppose the United Nations organized a peace treaty between Israel and the Palestinians under which Palestinians would be required to give up their right to return to their homes in Israel and there would be two states, a Jewish state of Israel and a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza. Second, we would sweeten the pot: in return, Western nations would give the Palestinian state $10 billion  a year for 100 years. Then the symbolic concession: For its part, Israel would officially apologize for the displacement of civilians in the 1948 war'b'Indeed, across the political spectrum, almost everyone we surveyed rejected the initial solutions we offered \xe2\x80\x94 ideas that are accepted as common sense among most Westerners, like  simply trading land for peace   or accepting shared sovereignty over Jerusalem. Why the opposition to trade-offs for peace?'b'Many of the respondents insisted that the values involved were sacred to them. For example, nearly half the Israeli settlers we surveyed said they would not consider trading any land in the West Bank \xe2\x80\x94 territory they believe was granted them by God \xe2\x80\x94 in exchange for peace. More than half the Palestinians considered full sovereignty over Jerusalem in the same light, and more than four-fifths felt that the \xe2\x80\x9cright of return\xe2\x80\x9d was a sacred value, too.'b'As for sweetening the pot,  in general the greater the monetary incentive involved in the deal, the greater the disgust from respondents. Israelis and Palestinians alike often reacted as though we had asked them to sell their children. This strongly implies that using the standard approaches of \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness-like negotiations\xe2\x80\x9d favored by Western diplomats will only backfire.'b'Many Westerners seem to ignore these clearly expressed \xe2\x80\x9cirrational\xe2\x80\x9d preferences, because in a sensible world they ought not to exist. Diplomats hope that peace and concrete progress on material and quality-of-life matters (electricity, water, agriculture, the economy and so on) will eventually make people forget the more heartfelt issues. But this is only a recipe for another Hundred Years\xe2\x80\x99 War \xe2\x80\x94 progress on everyday material matters will simply heighten attention on value-laden issues of \xe2\x80\x9cwho we are and want to be.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Fortunately, our work also offers hints of  another, more optimistic course.'b'Absolutists who violently rejected offers of money or peace for sacred land were considerably more inclined to accept deals that involved their enemies making symbolic but difficult gestures. For example, Palestinian hard-liners were more willing to consider recognizing the right of Israel to exist if the Israelis simply offered an official apology for Palestinian suffering in  the 1948 war. Similarly, Israeli respondents said they could live with a partition of Jerusalem and borders very close to those that existed before the 1967 war if Hamas and the other major Palestinian groups explicitly recognized Israel\xe2\x80\x99s right to exist.'b'Remarkably, our survey results were mirrored by our discussions with political leaders from both sides. For example, Mousa Abu Marzook (the deputy chairman of Hamas) said no when we proposed a trade-off for peace without granting a right of return. He became angry when we added in the idea of substantial American aid for  rebuilding: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, we do not sell ourselves for any amount.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But  when we mentioned a potential Israeli apology for 1948, he brightened: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, an apology is important, as a beginning. It\xe2\x80\x99s not enough because our houses and land were taken away from us and something has to be done about that.\xe2\x80\x9d His response suggested that progress on sacred values might open the way for negotiations on material issues, rather than the reverse.'b'We got a similar reaction from Benjamin Netanyahu, the hard-line former Israeli prime minister. We asked him whether he would seriously consider accepting a two-state solution following the 1967 borders if all major Palestinian factions, including Hamas, were to recognize the right of the Jewish people to an independent state in the region. He answered, \xe2\x80\x9cO.K., but the Palestinians would have to show that they sincerely mean it, change their textbooks and anti-Semitic characterizations.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Making these sorts of wholly intangible \xe2\x80\x9csymbolic\xe2\x80\x9d concessions, like an apology or recognition of a right to exist, simply doesn\xe2\x80\x99t compute on any utilitarian calculus. And yet the science says they may be the best way to start cutting the knot.'b'Providence, R.I.'b'NOW that Gov. David Paterson of New York has completed his operatic quest to  fill Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Senate seat and   Roland Burris, chosen by  the embattled Illinois governor to succeed Barack Obama, has made it past Capitol Hill security, we can safely conclude that appointing senators might not be such a good idea.'b'Actually, Americans came to that conclusion in 1913, when the 17th Amendment  mandated regular senatorial elections.  Reformers pushed the amendment as an antidote to the inevitable cronyism that surrounded the selections. In essence, however, it just allowed governors to pick replacements, as opposed to state legislatures.'b'The very problems the amendment was meant to address persist. Consider this: Nearly a quarter of the United States senators who have taken office since the 17th Amendment took effect have done so via appointment. Once Representative Kirsten Gillibrand, Mr. Paterson\xe2\x80\x99s choice, joins the Senate, she will be one of more than 180 senators  named by governors since 1913.'b'By contrast, the Constitution mandates special elections for all vacancies in the House  \xe2\x80\x94 even though representatives  are far less powerful than senators.'b'Yet only a handful of states routinely fill vacated Senate seats by special election. The result is a tyranny of appointments.'b'This is bad for the legislature, and the constituents. Even when appointments are not explicitly put up for sale, a governor\xe2\x80\x99s deliberations are surely informed by political expediency and personal ambition. (It would be impossible to look at the New York debacle and not think otherwise.) And even when the process is explicitly political and maybe even corrupt, as appears to be the case in Illinois, it seems as if there\xe2\x80\x99s not a lot anyone can do about it. After all, the Illinois Legislature was unable to wrest power from Gov. Rod  Blagojevich to force a special election.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s much talk of a \xe2\x80\x9cchange agenda\xe2\x80\x9d in Washington these days. We would do well to add another item to the list: We should stop letting governors appoint senators.'b'Last year, I sponsored legislation in Rhode Island to require vacancy elections for the United States Senate. Congress should now step in and push all states to do the same. Though Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power to force special elections is untested, it could surely create incentives for putting them in place  \xe2\x80\x94 or push for another constitutional amendment.'b'If Congress won\xe2\x80\x99t act, the states should move  forward on their own. Special elections have their difficulties \xe2\x80\x94 among them, clogged fields of candidates and time-consuming and expensive  runoffs.'b'But these challenges are surmountable. Instant runoff voting, which compresses runoffs into general elections by having voters rank candidates in order of preference, is one solution.'b'And, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned in Illinois and New York, elected officials provide a lot more hope for genuine democracy than their gubernatorially appointed alternatives.'b'To the Editor:'b'In \xe2\x80\x9cNew York Was So Much Older Then\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Jan. 18), Kevin Baker describes living in the city in the late 1970s. I, too, miss the independent movie theaters and bookstores, as well as the sense of possibility (which goes with being young).'b'But enough of these romanticized accounts of the grit and danger. Not every apartment on the Upper West Side or Lower East Side was broken into, and most of the people one saw on West End Avenue weren\xe2\x80\x99t prostitutes.

Jan. 20, 2009, marked the end of a conservative era.'b'Since Ronald Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s election in 1980, conservatives of various sorts, and conservatisms of various stripes, have generally been in the ascendancy. And a good thing, too! Conservatives have been right more often than not \xe2\x80\x94 and more often than liberals \xe2\x80\x94 about most of the important issues of the day: about Communism and jihadism, crime and welfare, education and the family. Conservative policies have on the whole worked \xe2\x80\x94 insofar as any set of policies can be said to \xe2\x80\x9cwork\xe2\x80\x9d in the real world. Conservatives of the Reagan-Bush-Gingrich-Bush years have a fair amount to be proud of.'b'They also have some regrets. They\xe2\x80\x99ll have time to ponder those as liberals now take their chance to govern.'b'Lest conservatives be too proud, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth recalling that conservatism\xe2\x80\x99s rise was decisively enabled by liberalism\xe2\x80\x99s weakness. That weakness was manifested by liberalism\xe2\x80\x99s limp reaction to the challenge from the New Left in the 1960s, became more broadly evident during the 1970s, and culminated in the fecklessness of the Carter administration at the end of that decade.'b'In 1978, the Harvard political philosopher Harvey Mansfield diagnosed the malady: \xe2\x80\x9cFrom having been the aggressive doctrine of vigorous, spirited men, liberalism has become hardly more than a trembling in the presence of illiberalism. ... Who today is called a liberal for strength and confidence in defense of liberty?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Over the next three decades, it was modern conservatism, led at the crucial moment by Ronald Reagan, that assumed the task of defending liberty with strength and confidence. Can a revived liberalism, faced with a new set of challenges, now pick up that mantle?'b'The answer lies in the hands of one man: the 44th president. If Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s policies had failed, or if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been politically successful, the conservative ascendancy would have been nipped in the bud. So with President Obama today. Liberalism\xe2\x80\x99s fate rests to an astonishing degree on his shoulders. If he governs successfully, we\xe2\x80\x99re in a new political era. If not, the country will be open to new conservative alternatives.'b'We don\xe2\x80\x99t really know how Barack Obama will govern. What we have so far, mainly, is an Inaugural Address, and it suggests that he may have learned more from Reagan than he has sometimes let on. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s speech was unabashedly pro-American and implicitly conservative.'b'Obama appealed to the authority of \xe2\x80\x9cour forebears,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cour founding documents,\xe2\x80\x9d even \xe2\x80\x94 political correctness alert! \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cour founding fathers.\xe2\x80\x9d He emphasized that \xe2\x80\x9cwe will not apologize for our way of life nor will we waver in its defense.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke almost not at all about rights (he had one mention of \xe2\x80\x9cthe rights of man,\xe2\x80\x9d paired with \xe2\x80\x9cthe rule of law\xe2\x80\x9d in the context of a discussion of the Constitution). He called for \xe2\x80\x9ca new era of responsibility.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And he appealed to \xe2\x80\x9cthe father of our nation,\xe2\x80\x9d who, before leading his army across the Delaware on Christmas night, 1776, allegedly \xe2\x80\x9cordered these words be read to the people: \xe2\x80\x98Let it be told to the future world that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive, that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet it.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For some reason, Obama didn\xe2\x80\x99t identify the author of \xe2\x80\x9cthese timeless words\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the only words quoted in the entire speech. He\xe2\x80\x99s Thomas Paine, and the passage comes from the first in his series of Revolutionary War tracts, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Crisis.\xe2\x80\x9d Obama chose to cloak his quotation from the sometimes intemperate Paine in the authority of the respectable George Washington.'b'Sixty-seven years ago, a couple of months after Pearl Harbor, at the close of a long radio address on the difficult course of the struggle we had just entered upon, another liberal president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, also told the story of Washington ordering that \xe2\x80\x9cThe Crisis\xe2\x80\x9d be read aloud, and also quoted Paine. But he turned to the more famous \xe2\x80\x94 and more stirring \xe2\x80\x94 passage with which Paine begins his essay:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThese are the times that try men\xe2\x80\x99s souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That exhortation was appropriate for World War II. Today, the dangers are less stark, and the conflicts less hard. Still, there will be trying times during Obama\xe2\x80\x99s presidency, and liberty will need staunch defenders. Can Obama reshape liberalism to be, as it was under F.D.R., a fighting faith, unapologetically patriotic and strong in the defense of liberty? That would be a service to our country.'b'As the debate over President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s economic stimulus plan gets under way, one thing is certain: many of the plan\xe2\x80\x99s opponents aren\xe2\x80\x99t arguing in good faith. Conservatives really, really don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see a second New Deal, and they certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see government activism vindicated. So they are reaching for any stick they can find with which to beat proposals for increased government spending.'b'Some of these arguments are obvious cheap shots. John Boehner, the House minority leader, has already made headlines with one such shot: looking at an $825 billion plan to rebuild infrastructure, sustain essential services and more, he derided a minor provision that would expand Medicaid family-planning services \xe2\x80\x94 and called it  a plan to \xe2\x80\x9cspend hundreds of millions of dollars on contraceptives.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But the obvious cheap shots don\xe2\x80\x99t pose as much danger to the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to get a plan through as arguments and assertions that are equally fraudulent but can seem superficially plausible to those who don\xe2\x80\x99t know their way around economic concepts and numbers. So as a public service, let me try to debunk some of the major antistimulus arguments that have already surfaced. Any time you hear someone reciting one of these arguments, write him or her off as a dishonest flack.'b'First, there\xe2\x80\x99s the bogus talking point that the Obama plan will cost $275,000 per job created. Why is it bogus? Because it involves taking the cost of a plan that will extend over several years, creating millions of jobs each year, and dividing it by the jobs created in just one of those years.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s as if an opponent of the school lunch program were to take an estimate of the cost of that program over the next five years, then divide it by the number of lunches provided in just one of those years, and assert that the program was hugely wasteful, because it cost $13 per lunch. (The actual cost of a free school lunch, by the way, is $2.57.)'b'The true cost per job of the Obama plan will probably be closer to $100,000 than $275,000 \xe2\x80\x94 and the net cost will be as little as $60,000 once you take into account the fact that a stronger economy means higher tax receipts.'b'Next, write off anyone who asserts that it\xe2\x80\x99s always better to cut taxes than to increase government spending because taxpayers, not bureaucrats, are the best judges of how to spend their money.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s how to think about this argument: it implies that we should shut down the air traffic control system. After all, that system is paid for with fees on air tickets \xe2\x80\x94 and surely it would be better to let the flying public keep its money rather than hand it over to government bureaucrats. If that would mean lots of midair collisions, hey, stuff happens.'b'The point is that nobody really believes that a dollar of tax cuts is always better than a dollar of public spending. Meanwhile, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that when it comes to economic stimulus, public spending provides much more bang for the buck than tax cuts \xe2\x80\x94 and therefore costs less per job created (see the previous fraudulent argument) \xe2\x80\x94 because a large fraction of any tax cut will simply be saved.'b'This suggests that public spending rather than tax cuts should be the core of any stimulus plan. But rather than accept that implication, conservatives take refuge in a nonsensical argument against public spending in general.'b'Finally, ignore anyone who tries to make something of the fact that the new administration\xe2\x80\x99s  chief economic adviser has  in the past favored monetary policy over fiscal policy as a response to recessions.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s true that the normal response to recessions is interest-rate cuts from the Fed, not government spending. And that might be the best option right now, if it were available. But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t, because we\xe2\x80\x99re in a situation not seen since the 1930s: the interest rates the Fed controls are already effectively at zero.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about large-scale fiscal stimulus: it\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s left  in the policy arsenal now that the Fed has shot its bolt. Anyone who cites  old arguments against fiscal stimulus without mentioning that either doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know much about the subject \xe2\x80\x94 and therefore has no business weighing in on the debate \xe2\x80\x94 or is being deliberately obtuse.'b'These are only some of the fundamentally fraudulent antistimulus arguments out there. Basically, conservatives are throwing any objection they can think of against the Obama plan, hoping that something will stick.'b'But here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing: Most Americans aren\xe2\x80\x99t listening. The most encouraging thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard lately is Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s reported response to Republican objections to a spending-oriented economic plan: \xe2\x80\x9cI won.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed he did \xe2\x80\x94 and he should disregard the huffing and puffing of those who lost.'b'If you have a 401(k) retirement plan at work, you don\xe2\x80\x99t need us to tell you that you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken a hit in the past year. The really bad news is that the damage to your retirement security is likely worse than what the numbers say on your statement.'b'Many Americans didn\xe2\x80\x99t have enough savings coming into the downturn. And employers are increasingly cutting back or suspending their 401(k) match. FedEx, Eastman Kodak, Motorola, General Motors and Ford, among others, have announced such moves.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s also no guarantee that today\xe2\x80\x99s battered 401(k)\xe2\x80\x99s will rebound powerfully. People close to retirement don\xe2\x80\x99t have time for a do-over. Even for those still far from retirement, there\xe2\x80\x99s no telling how stocks will perform in the future.'b'They could post impressive gains, especially in the near term, from their current low levels. But they could also struggle. The last 25 years was a time of low inflation rates and low interest rates, which boosted stock prices. Going forward, inflation and interest rates have nowhere to go but up, which would be bad for stocks.'b'It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to be this way. Over the last several decades, businesses and government used matching contributions and tax breaks to encourage the proliferation of 401(k)\xe2\x80\x99s. They lauded them as a way to harness the market to create wealth and increasingly viewed them as  replacements for traditional corporate pensions.'b'In 1983, 62 percent of workers with retirement coverage had a traditional pension only, while a mere 12 percent had 401(k)\xe2\x80\x99s. Today,  approximately 20 percent have a traditional pension and about two-thirds  have only 401(k)\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'The shift to 401(k)\xe2\x80\x99s also shifted investing risks and responsibilities from employers to employees, but as long as participants generally made money and recovered losses quickly, the risks seemed reasonable. Now many Americans are inevitably having second thoughts.'b'So far, the cumulative wipe-out of household retirement savings  totals about $2 trillion, and no one believes that the downturn is anywhere near over. As a result, participants in 401(k)\xe2\x80\x99s are in greater danger than ever of coming up short in retirement.'b'That grim reality calls for an expanded approach by policy makers to retirement issues. Traditionally \xe2\x80\x94 and correctly \xe2\x80\x94 an important focus has been on lower-income Americans who lack the means to save and tend to work for employers who do not offer retirement plans.'b'During the campaign, President Obama supported a better savers\xe2\x80\x99 tax credit to encourage savings among lower-income Americans. He also supported universal I.R.A.\xe2\x80\x99s, which would make a 401(k)-like account available to all workers. Those good ideas should be pursued. There are also good ideas for improving 401(k)\xe2\x80\x99s that deserve attention, such as helping people  manage their retirement withdrawals so that the money lasts a lifetime.'b'The wipeout in 401(k)\xe2\x80\x99s has made it clear that it is not enough to get more people to save more. There needs to be a better way to reasonably ensure that a lifetime of savings can\xe2\x80\x99t be undone by forces beyond one\xe2\x80\x99s control. The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, a leader in retirement policy, is advocating a new savings account \xe2\x80\x94 in addition to Social Security and  401(k)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 that would enable risks to be shared among workers, retirees and the government.'b'After decades of promoting and improving 401(k)\xe2\x80\x99s, in which employees bear substantial  risk, that\xe2\x80\x99s a new and difficult reality for policy makers to grapple with. The sooner Mr. Obama puts his team on the issue \xe2\x80\x94 his budget director, Peter Orszag, is one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s top retirement experts \xe2\x80\x94 the better.'b'President Obama used his Inaugural Address to summon the nation to \xe2\x80\x9ca new era of responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d and personal engagement to solve the nation\xe2\x80\x99s problems. He set an example by spending part of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday painting walls and furniture at a shelter for homeless teenagers.'b'As Mr. Obama recognizes, there are certain tasks that cannot be accomplished by volunteers showing up occasionally or contributing a few hours a week. Worthy service programs, like Teach for America, have too few slots to accommodate the rising number of applicants.'b'Now is the moment for the new president and Congress to harness the sense of idealism and unity evident amid the huge crowds that massed in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital by greatly expanding the opportunities for sustained and productive national and community service.'b'A smart blueprint for doing exactly that was just introduced in the Senate by Edward Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat, and Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah. Building on the ongoing success of AmeriCorps, Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s signature domestic service program, and relying on its administrative framework, their Serve America Act would rapidly expand the number of full-time and part-time national service volunteers eligible for minimal living expenses and a modest educational stipend at the end of an intensive year of work by 175,000 from the current level of 75,000.'b'The new positions would be devoted to meeting challenges in a handful of targeted areas: tackling the dropout crisis, strengthening schools, improving health care and economic opportunity in low-income communities, cleaning up parks, aiding efforts to boost energy efficiency, and responding to disasters and emergencies.'b'The Serve America Act is structured to invite participation by people of all income levels and ages, including retirees. It would offer tax incentives for employers who allow employees to take paid leave for full-time service, and permit older individuals to transfer their education awards to a child or grandchild. A new Volunteer Generation Fund would help nonprofit groups recruit and manage an expanding pool of volunteers.'b'Much as President Franklin Roosevelt created the Civilian Conservation Corps during the early days of his first term in 1933, Mr. Obama should tell Congress he considers the Serve America Act a top priority.'b'Truly, there is no reason for delay. The measure largely fleshes out ideas  that Mr. Obama promoted on the campaign trail and that  are currently posted on his White House Web site. In his previous job representing Illinois in the Senate, Mr. Obama co-sponsored the bill when it was proposed at the end of the last Congress.'b'Understandably, Mr. Obama is now concentrating on gaining quick passage of a $825  billion  stimulus package aimed at creating new jobs and aiding the nation\xe2\x80\x99s ailing economy. At a price tag of about $5 billion over five years, the Serve America Act is an apt companion piece.'b'Its prompt approval would create tens of thousands of meaningful new positions for people ready to work hard for the public good, making tangible the \xe2\x80\x9cspirit of service\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama spoke of in his Inaugural Address.'b'One would think that by now the teaching-evolution-in-schools debate was settled. But not in Texas, where the State Board of Education fumbled a decision on curriculum standards last week. The struggle will be resumed in March, when the board is scheduled to take its final votes on new science standards that will govern what is taught in the classroom and in textbooks.'b'Seven of the board\xe2\x80\x99s 15 members are deemed social conservatives. What the board decides could have an impact on many other states, because Texas is a huge market for textbooks and publishers are often reluctant to produce multiple versions of the same textbook.'b'The voting, a preliminary test of how the culture-war winds are blowing, concerned whether to approve or amend proposed new standards that had been carefully crafted by teams of educators and other experts. The new standards dropped a phrase that had been in previous ones requiring students to study the \xe2\x80\x9cstrengths and weaknesses\xe2\x80\x9d of all scientific theories. Although that language may seem innocuous, it has been construed in recent years as code words for introducing critiques of evolution theory put forth by advocates of creationism and its close cousin, intelligent design.'b'We were heartened when the board beat back, by a very narrow margin, efforts to reintroduce the language on \xe2\x80\x9cweaknesses.\xe2\x80\x9d But the conservative bloc immediately recouped by pushing through amendments that require students to assess the arguments \xe2\x80\x9cfor and against\xe2\x80\x9d common ancestry, a core element of evolution theory, and its \xe2\x80\x9csufficiency or insufficiency\xe2\x80\x9d to explain the fossil record. How that differs from the old language of \xe2\x80\x9cstrengths and weaknesses\xe2\x80\x9d is not readily apparent.'b'The lesson we draw from these shenanigans is that scientifically illiterate boards of education should leave the curriculum to educators and scientists who know what constitutes a sound education.'b'In America, there are foragers among us, out searching for morels in the spring, and there are hunters  too. Yet most of our food, except for fish caught from the sea, is farmed. We do not trap songbirds for savory pies. (We destroy too many of them through other means.)'b'Once you look beyond the parochial culinary habits of most Americans you discover that wildness, and the tastes associated with it, have a talismanic power that is very hard to eradicate. It is what keeps the Japanese whaling and keeps some Africans eating bush meat. And it is one of the things that helps explain the voracious and utterly destructive Chinese appetite for turtles.'b'As global wealth rises, so does global consumption of meat, which includes wild meat. Turtle meat used to be a rare delicacy in the Asian diet, but no longer. China, along with Hong Kong and Taiwan, has vacuumed the wild turtles out of most of Southeast Asia. Now, according to a recent report in The Los Angeles Times, they are consuming common soft-shell turtles from the American Southeast, especially Florida, at an alarming rate.'b'Some scientists estimate that two-thirds of the tortoise and freshwater turtle species on the planet are seriously threatened. Some of that is secondhand damage \xe2\x80\x94 loss of habitat, water pollution, climate change. But far too many turtles are being lost to the fork and the spoon.'b'In the United States, the solution is relatively straightforward. States should impose much tighter restrictions on the harvesting and export of wild turtles. Internationally, the problem is more complicated. There have been efforts to monitor the species of wild turtles found in Chinese markets, but as long as the appetite for turtles \xe2\x80\x94 and traditional medicines derived from them \xe2\x80\x94 persists, we fear it will be hard to curtail such a profitable and disastrous trade.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cEnergy Inefficient\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 19):'b'Yes, we must immediately improve efficiency in existing energy technologies even as we engineer new ones.

Today, more F.B.I. agents are assigned to public corruption than ever before, an increase of 38 percent since 2003. Over the past three years, the F.B.I. helped prosecute nearly 2,500 corrupt local, state and federal officials \xe2\x80\x94 a substantial increase over the previous three years and the highest number of prosecutions for such a period ever.'b'Second, after 9/11, with the F.B.I.\xe2\x80\x99s shift of some resources to fight terrorism, the larger white-collar crime program was restructured. Fewer cases were opened involving \xe2\x80\x9clow-hanging fruit\xe2\x80\x9d investigations and comparatively small amounts of money. State and local authorities have the jurisdiction to investigate these crimes. F.B.I. resources have targeted corporate and securities fraud, which poses the greatest threat to the nation\xe2\x80\x99s economic security.'b'Finally, today there are three times as many organized-crime task forces across the country and around the world than at the time of 9/11. Given the counterterrorism and counterintelligence demands, there are fewer F.B.I. agents dedicated to organized crime. But the impact has not diminished: More arrests were made last year than in any year since 2001.'b'Necessarily, following the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the F.B.I. shifted resources to strengthen national security.

Berlin was still raw, its past present at every turn, and so the miracle of Germany\xe2\x80\x99s post-war recovery was palpable.'b'A country in disgrace had fast-forwarded from ruin to peace and prosperity.'b'That miracle, of course, was in large measure a German-American achievement, from Marshall Plan reconstruction, through West Germany\xe2\x80\x99s insertion into NATO, culminating with the astute U.S. diplomacy that allowed the country\xe2\x80\x99s unification within the Western alliance.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to forget these days that solving \xe2\x80\x9cthe German question\xe2\x80\x9d took much of the 20th century. It\xe2\x80\x99s also easy to forget that the U.S. embassy in Bonn was once America\xe2\x80\x99s largest in the world, comparable, with its thousands of staff, to the Baghdad embassy today.'b'What a difference a couple of decades make. The U.S. alliance with Germany has soured. Donald Rumsfeld\xe2\x80\x99s comparison of the country to Libya was a low point illustrating how differences over Iraq poisoned a relationship already complicated by the disappearance of its strategic imperative.'b'Things have looked up a bit since then, but not a lot. The Germans still feel a little like jilted lovers. Many Americans have a vague notion of an ungrateful nation that\xe2\x80\x99s gone soft and smug.

Germany is important to the United States right now. It\xe2\x80\x99s time to rekindle a dormant relationship. While America is not at \xe2\x80\x9cStunde null,\xe2\x80\x9d it\xe2\x80\x99s at a moment of disarray when it has to rethink the nature and exercise of its power. Germany knows all about reinvention. It can help in four important areas: Europe, the economy, Iran and Afghanistan.'b'A strong Europe is essential to America\xe2\x80\x99s recovery. The United States is too stretched \xe2\x80\x94 militarily and economically \xe2\x80\x94 to do without the cohesion of its closest allies.'b'There are three major European powers: Britain, France and Germany. Britain is going through a meltdown so severe that the joke there is that the country\xe2\x80\x99s the next Iceland. That aside, its European credentials are always a little suspect.'b'In France, the notion of the European Union as a \xe2\x80\x9ccounterweight\xe2\x80\x9d to American power still lurks, although President Nicolas Sarkozy has done much to dispose of such Gallic intellectual baggage.'b'Only in Germany is a powerful commitment to the strength and effectiveness of the European Union matched by an equally powerful conviction that the trans-Atlantic relationship remains critical.'b'Through Germany, Obama should press the urgent need for the 27-nation E.U. to complete reforms that will give it a president and foreign minister with terms long enough to count. Germany, Europe\xe2\x80\x99s largest economy and the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest exporter, must also be a pivot of post-crash reforms.'b'The recession is severe in Germany, but the country still has a savings ratio of 11 percent (it\xe2\x80\x99s negative in the United States), a strong manufacturing sector and, after spending a staggering $1.8 trillion to integrate the Communist East, it has managed to get its budget close to balance.'b'Hence its much-criticized hesitation to join the socialist bandwagon (the Chinese are now referring to the U.S. economy as \xe2\x80\x9csocialism with American characteristics\xe2\x80\x9d) and pump billions into salvage operations. But Germany has now come through with a $110 billion stimulus package.'b'It is an essential American ally in turning the global economy around; expanding the G-8 to reflect today\xe2\x80\x99s realities by including at least Brazil, Mexico, India, China, South Africa and Indonesia; and pushing through global financial reforms to be discussed in London in April that should include minimum capital ratios for banks and measures to ensure risk and responsibility get enduringly reacquainted with each other.'b'In Iran, Germany has broad experience of negotiation in recent years, along with Britain and France. That experience has led to some important German convictions: that American leadership under Obama is essential; that no deal will work without a regional security arrangement that only the United States can underwrite and that must (at least tacitly) acknowledge the Israeli bomb; and that new avenues have to be found to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, because only he counts.'b'With 3,500 troops in Afghanistan, set to rise to 4,500 this year, Germany has the third-largest troop presence there.

Another reason to think Berlin.'b'A good start would be naming a vigorous, German-speaking ambassador to Berlin. The post is vacant. It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be for long.'b'Northampton, Mass.'b'THE Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s recent decision not to award the Purple Heart to veterans and soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress has caused great controversy. Historically, the medal has gone only to those who have been physically wounded on the battlefield as a result of enemy action. But with approximately one-third of veterans dealing with symptoms of combat stress or major depression, many Americans are disappointed with the Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s decision; many more are downright appalled. As a former Marine infantry officer and Iraq war veteran, I would urge the Pentagon to consider a different solution altogether.'b'First, let me say that both sides of the Purple Heart debate have expressed some reasonable concerns. Those who believe that the Purple Heart should be reserved strictly for the physically wounded hold a more traditional sense of the battlefield in which wounds are bloody and undeniable. The gashes of war carry an irrevocable purity that tends to make the issue concrete and uncomplicated.'b'And yet there have been complications. During the 2004 presidential election, John Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s Purple Hearts, awarded for his service in Vietnam, were labeled by his opponents \xe2\x80\x9cpurple owies\xe2\x80\x9d because the wounds he suffered were not considered dire enough. It was a petty episode, to be sure, but it demonstrated the disparate views of this medal. In the interests of guarding the nobility of the Purple Heart, many service members, including me, have suggested that not every last physical wound merits a decoration.'b'When I was in Iraq, the most common wound behind the many Purple Hearts we awarded was the \xe2\x80\x9cperforated eardrum,\xe2\x80\x9d an eardrum punctured by the concussion of a nearby explosion. In the vast majority of cases, no blood was ever shed. Seldom did these marines ever miss a day of full duty. And yet they were all awarded the coveted medal.'b'Admittedly, I was dubious about the \xe2\x80\x9crecognition\xe2\x80\x9d of these and other lesser wounds; I felt that in a way they subverted the obvious intent of the Purple Heart \xe2\x80\x94 honoring soldiers who have been seriously hurt. But where to draw the line? Perhaps it should be awarded only to those who required admittance into a combat support hospital. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Purple Heart deserves at least one night out of action,\xe2\x80\x9d I argued at the time. But my own commander stood fast by the rules, affirming: \xe2\x80\x9cA combat wound is a combat wound, no matter how small. So they get the medal.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A year later, back at Camp Lejeune, N.C., I was making calls to the families of wounded marines \xe2\x80\x94 a difficult duty even when the wounds were minor. But I noticed during that time that I never once made a call to a family about a marine\xe2\x80\x99s psychological wounds. I never got a casualty report for post-traumatic stress, despite the rising number of veteran suicides. Never once.'b'Why, I asked myself, if a combat wound is a combat wound no matter how small, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t those people suffering from the \xe2\x80\x9cinvisible wounds\xe2\x80\x9d of post-traumatic stress also receive the Purple Heart? Difficulty of diagnosis is one of the central justifications the Pentagon has given, citing the concern that fakers will tarnish the medal\xe2\x80\x99s image. Spilt blood cannot be faked.'b'But this seems an unconvincing argument not to honor those who actually do suffer from post-traumatic stress. For example, the possibility of fakers has not prevented the Department of Veterans Affairs from awarding disability payments to service members who have received a diagnosis. Why should the military itself be different?'b'The distinction, I suspect, lies in the deep-seated attitude toward psychological wounds. It is still difficult for many members of the military to truly believe that post-traumatic stress is, in fact, an injury and not the result of a weak or dysfunctional brain. The same culture that demands tough-mindedness also encourages skepticism toward the suggestion that the violence of war can hurt the healthiest of minds.'b'Still, almost all service members agree that veterans suffering from confirmed cases of post-traumatic stress should be cared for. The reality of psychological wounds is becoming harder and harder to deny. That post-traumatic stress can lead to suicide is no longer in question. That far too many of those returning from combat experience deep and long-lasting devastation is irrefutable.'b'So why not recognize the struggles of these many individuals with a medal? Why, for instance, if a veteran has been given a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress and awarded benefits, should he not also be awarded a Purple Heart? Sadly, as long as our military culture bears at least a quiet contempt for the psychological wounds of war, it is unlikely those veterans will ever see a Purple Heart. That is too bad, I think, because they do deserve all the honor the physically wounded receive.'b'But there may be another solution \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps a new decoration, a new medal, could be established specifically for those suffering from post-traumatic stress. It would be awarded to those whose minds and souls have been sundered by war.'b'I urge General Eric Shinseki, the new head of Veterans Affairs and former Army Chief of Staff, to work hand in hand with the Defense Department to bring about some form of official recognition for these wounded veterans. The current stigma of post-traumatic stress would likely prevent many soldiers from wearing the medal initially, but its mere existence would help crystallize in the American \xe2\x80\x94 and the American military \xe2\x80\x94 consciousness one of the more obscure human costs of war.'b'I suggest we call this medal the Black Heart. Certainly the hearts of these soldiers are black, with the terrible things they saw and did on the battlefield. Certainly the country should see these Black Hearts pinned on their chests.'b'Stanford, Calif.'b'THE American troops in Iraq daily face the risk of death or injury \xe2\x80\x94 to themselves or their fellow soldiers \xe2\x80\x94 by homemade bombs and suicide attackers. So it is not surprising that post-traumatic stress disorder is a common problem among returning soldiers. But how many, exactly, are affected?'b'This question is key to determining how large an investment the Department of Veterans Affairs needs to make in diagnosing and treating the problem. The United States Army\xe2\x80\x99s Mental Health Advisory Team, which conducted a survey of more than 1,000 soldiers and marines in September 2006, found that 17 percent suffered from P.T.S.D. Similarly, a Rand study put the number at 14 percent.'b'But these estimates do not take into account the many soldiers who will eventually suffer from P.T.S.D., because there is a lag between the time someone experiences trauma and the time he or she reports symptoms of post-traumatic stress. This can range from days to many years, and it is typically much longer while people are still in the military.'b'To get a better estimate of the rate of P.T.S.D. among Iraq war veterans, two graduate students, Michael Atkinson and Adam Guetz, and I constructed a mathematical model in which soldiers incur a random amount of stress during each month of deployment (based on monthly American casualty data), develop P.T.S.D. if their cumulative stress exceeds a certain threshold, and also develop symptoms of the disorder after an additional amount of time. We found that about 35 percent of soldiers and marines who deploy to Iraq will ultimately suffer from P.T.S.D. \xe2\x80\x94 about 300,000 people, with 20,000 new sufferers for each year the war lasts.'b'Consider that only 22 percent of recent veterans who may be at risk for P.T.S.D. (based on their answers to screening questions) were referred for a mental health evaluation. Less than 40 percent of service members who get a diagnosis of P.T.S.D. receive mental health services, and only slightly more than half of recent veterans who receive treatment get adequate care. Those who seek follow-up treatment run into delays of up to 90 days, which suggests there is a serious shortage of mental health professionals available to help them.'b'Proper P.T.S.D. care can lead to complete remission in 30 percent to 50 percent of cases, studies show. Thorough screening of every soldier upon departure  from the military, immediately followed by three to six months of treatment for those who need it, would reduce the stigma that is attached to current mental health referrals. The Rand study estimates that treatment would pay for itself within two years, largely by reducing the loss of productivity. This is the least we can do for our veterans.'b'O.K., you got me. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get voted into the 'b'Baseball Hall of Fame'b' the other week. A .277 batting average with 60 career home runs is cool, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t garner you any votes unless you led the world in some other category.'b'But I often wonder whether a player who gets into the Hall should be automatically considered successful. And whether one who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t should be seen as unsuccessful.'b'Two players were voted in for 2009. I had the pleasure of playing against one of them, Rickey Henderson. Rickey drove teams crazy by stealing bases and scoring runs. He wreaked havoc on defenses that could never relax for a second when he was on base. In effect, he ran teams out of house and home.'b'Also known for his quirkiness, Rickey often talked about himself in the third person. But take my word for it, playing against him made you feel like there was three of him on the bases anyway. His induction was a no-brainer: all-time leader in stolen bases and runs scored.'b'Jim Rice was a hitting machine, driving in runs like he was some sort of taxi service. Playing left field, in front of the Green Monster at Fenway Park, he was also a master of deception. When a ball was hit over his head, he would stand and watch without enthusiasm, and the batter would assume that the ball was going to end up somewhere on Lansdowne Street. Think again. Rice was just setting them up so he could throw them out at second base, after they\xe2\x80\x99d lost a crucial step admiring their shot. You could make a great video of all the shocked faces of base runners who were cut down at second because they fell for this trick.'b'When a career is over, we reflect. I reviewed mine like I had a 15-year video reel in my head. I\xe2\x80\x99d think about what I could have done better or how I would have handled a situation differently. Maybe I could have bunted more. Maybe I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have charged that pitcher in Double-A. Maybe I could have turned over a table or two in Joe Torre\xe2\x80\x99s office when the Yankees released me. But all in all, I feel good about my career. I know it could have been better, but I also know it could have been worse.'b'Still, somewhere in that internal dialogue you ask yourself, \xe2\x80\x9cWas I a success?\xe2\x80\x9d I suppose it is safe to say that if you are inducted into the Hall of Fame, you probably would answer \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d But I tend to believe that personal success is much more elusive than that.'b'Even personal success, however, is hard to define without input from the masses. Baseball has a love affair with numbers; it\xe2\x80\x99s how players are measured and, often, how they measure themselves. Their statistics are flipped around, analyzed to the nth degree, placed in boxes of homemade recipes. What did I hit on Astroturf? How many stolen bases did I have in day games? What did I hit against lefties from east of the Mississippi? Before long, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to find an angle that makes you the either the greatest player on the planet or the worst in history. I finished my career with a 293-game errorless streak on defense. I also hit .210 that last season. Still, can I get a vote?'b'But there are a few universally accepted measuring sticks that no one can escape. A World Series ring is one of them. Players come to spring training year in and year out obsessing about a championship season. It is hard to imagine, if you hang up the spikes without a ring on your finger, that you don\xe2\x80\x99t have that moment of \xe2\x80\x9cDid I fall short?\xe2\x80\x9d Even if you are about to enter the Hall.'b'The more years I played, the more essential that ring came to seem. In my first year of free agency (six years into my major-league march) I preferred a place where I would have the opportunity to play the most. So I headed to Texas. After I got that out of my system, two seasons later, I went to where I thought I had the best chance to win: the New York Yankees. I wanted to end my career with an exclamation point. Finish it off as a winner and enjoy the ticker-tape parade into retirement. That was the plan, until the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 plan didn\xe2\x80\x99t include my services.'b'Maybe I would have approached free agency differently if I\xe2\x80\x99d had more playoff success earlier, before I\xe2\x80\x99d earned the right to test the market. When all is said and done, I made it to the playoffs only once. There were a few second-place finishes, and a winter-league championship in Puerto Rico, but whenever my regular season hat featured an MLB logo, I was pretty much certain to be spending the off-season watching the playoffs on television.'b'I may not be on the committee that votes players into the Hall of Fame, but I can think of a lot of players who will never be inducted into the Hall, and who never were part of a World Championship team, but who nevertheless make you re-think what it means to be \xe2\x80\x9csuccessful.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For instance: I saw former Cub Mark DeRosa recently (just after he was traded to the Indians) at an Athletes Against Drugs function, where he was speaking about leadership. He mentioned that if he\xe2\x80\x99d ever won a World Series with the Cubs, he would first have celebrated with his teammates and family . . . and then looked to hug Ron Santo.'b'Santo is a Chicago Cub legend \xe2\x80\x94 an all-star third-baseman during the \xe2\x80\x9860s and early \xe2\x80\x9870s \xe2\x80\x94 who has become a rallying cry against the subjectivity of the Hall of Fame voting system. He has, so far, narrowly failed to be voted in (he will be eligible again in 2011), yet is recognized for his statistically amazing career, including being a nine-time all-star selection with five Gold Glove awards and more than 300 career home runs. If there is any criticism, it\xe2\x80\x99s that he never made the playoffs. Not necessarily his fault.'b'Santo may not (yet) be in the Hall, but listen to DeRosa and you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear a current player wax poetically about how Santo \xe2\x80\x94 retired now more than three decades \xe2\x80\x94 exemplifies success and passion. Santo has lost both his lower legs to diabetes, yet as an announcer for the Cubs he makes all the road trips and, when the team\xe2\x80\x99s at home, hikes to the top of Wrigley Field to get in the booth. The city of Chicago loves him. And it is safe to assume he went about the game in the same fashion that he goes about his business today. As my dad used to say, \xe2\x80\x9cHow you do one thing is how you do everything.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'So what is success? Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s Rico Brogna playing every day, generously and with a smile on his face, despite having a debilitating disease called Ankylosing Spondylitis. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s Terry Shumpert crediting his faith for his commitment to put his family first \xe2\x80\x94 to the point where even when he had a half day off in Triple-A, he would stop home in between games in Kansas City. Or maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s Tuffy Rhodes, from the rough side of Cincinnati, who didn\xe2\x80\x99t find what he was looking for here in the States and went to Japan \xe2\x80\x94 where he tied the single-season home run record and became fluent in Japanese.'b'Maybe you played drug-free and left it to nature despite what some players were choosing to do. Or you could be like my minor-league teammate, Scott Weiss, who walked away from the game to explore the power of his Stanford economics degree because a promise of advance wasn\xe2\x80\x99t kept. Or it could be someone like Amaury Telemaco, who grew up in the Dominican Republic without running water and a need to help take care of his siblings; he made it to the top as a pitcher and was one of the most honorable people I met in the game.'b'I will venture to say that gaining awards and accomplishments doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always mean you will sleep well at night. The players with the most internal peace are those who know who they are and, as a result, have found personal success more accessible than the players who chase the illusions of the quantifiable.'b'My hat goes off to Rickey and Jim for a phenomenal run on the game. Hall of Fame inductees are 1 percent of the 1 percent, and unquestionably the best players in our great game. Rare by any standard. But it is even rarer to find players who have the peace of personal success. Then again, when you let other people tell you what success is, you already have no chance of ever finding it.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cGay but Equal?,\xe2\x80\x9d by Mary Frances Berry (Op-Ed, Jan. 16):'b'We agree that the United States Civil Rights Commission should be transformed into a United States Commission on Civil and Human Rights.'b'In addition to addressing lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, a commission could address the pressing issues Americans are facing during this devastating economic downturn, like inequalities in access to housing, education, jobs and health care.'b'Americans overwhelmingly support the idea of human rights at home.

The stock markets and the value of the family home have collapsed, and there is virtual across-the-board agreement that the country is caught up in the worst economic disaster since at least World War II.'b'The Republican answer to this turmoil?'b'Tax cuts.'b'They need to go into rehab.'b'The question that I would like answered is why anyone listens to this crowd anymore. G.O.P. policies have been an absolute backbreaker for the middle class. (Forget the poor. Nobody talks about them anymore, not even the Democrats.) The G.O.P. has successfully engineered a wholesale redistribution of wealth to those already at the top of the income ladder and then, in a remarkable display of chutzpah, dared anyone to talk about class warfare.'b'A stark example of this unholy collaboration between the G.O.P. and the very wealthy was on display in the pages of this newspaper on Jan. 18. The Times\xe2\x80\x99s Mike McIntire wrote an article about the first wave of federal bailout money for the financial industry, which was handed over by the Bush administration with hardly any strings attached. (Congress, under the control of the Democrats, should never have allowed this to happen, but the Democrats are as committed to fecklessness as the Republicans are to tax cuts.)'b'The public was told that the money would be used to loosen the frozen credit markets and thus help revive the economy. But as the article pointed out, there were bankers with other ideas. John C. Hope III, the chairman of the Whitney National Bank in New Orleans, in an address to Wall Street fat cats gathered at the Palm Beach Ritz-Carlton, said:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMake more loans? We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to change our business model or our credit policies to accommodate the needs of the public sector as they see it to have us make more loans.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'How\xe2\x80\x99s that for arrogance and contempt for the public interest? Mr. Hope\xe2\x80\x99s bank received $300 million in taxpayer bailout money.'b'The same article quoted Walter M. Pressey, president of Boston Private Wealth Management, which Mr. McIntire described as a healthy bank with a mostly affluent clientele. It received $154 million in taxpayer money.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWith that capital in hand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pressey, \xe2\x80\x9cnot only do we feel comfortable that we can ride out the recession, but we also feel that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in a position to take advantage of opportunities that present themselves once this recession is sorted out.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Take advantage, indeed. That, in a nutshell, is what the plutocracy is all about: taking unfair advantage.'b'When the G.O.P. talks, nobody should listen. Republicans have argued, with the collaboration of much of the media, that they could radically cut taxes while simultaneously balancing the federal budget, when, in fact, big income-tax cuts inevitably lead to big budget deficits. We listened to the G.O.P. and what do we have now? A trillion-dollar-plus deficit and an economy in shambles.'b'This is the party that preached fiscal discipline and then cut taxes in time of war. This is the party that still wants to put the torch to Social Security and Medicare. This is a party that, given a choice between Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan, would choose Ronald Reagan in a heartbeat.'b'Why is anyone still listening?'b'Maxwell Air Force Base, Ala.'b'GEN. DAVID PETRAEUS, not Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, will shape American engagement with the Middle East for years to come. While Mrs. Clinton prepares to put together the State Department, the military is already reconsidering American policy in critical regions. The politically savvy General Petraeus has both a plan and the resources to see it through.'b'Unfortunately, Mrs. Clinton can\xe2\x80\x99t say the same. The State Department is supposed to direct American foreign policy, but it lacks the human and financial resources to fulfill its mission. R. Nicholas Burns, a foreign service veteran, may have summed up the problem best when he said that we have more musicians in the Pentagon than we have diplomats in the State Department. The department\xe2\x80\x99s budget for 2009 is $39 billion \xe2\x80\x94 less than 8 percent of the amount allotted to the Defense Department.'b'Not surprisingly, the State Department has trouble pulling its weight \xe2\x80\x94 and the Defense Department fills the void. Regional commanders like General Petraeus \xe2\x80\x94 or Gens. H. Norman Schwarzkopf and Anthony Zinni before him \xe2\x80\x94 have amassed great power and influence in the United States government and abroad since the 1991 Persian Gulf war.'b'General Petraeus oversees Central Command \xe2\x80\x94 America\xe2\x80\x99s military presence in the Middle East \xe2\x80\x94 and has assembled a task force to develop a strategy for the area that stretches from Egypt to Pakistan. This task force will not develop a traditional military strategy with a focus on offensive and defensive operations. Centcom will aim to help nations in the region govern effectively, build their economies and provide security to their people. It will also try to communicate America\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy intentions clearly.'b'Regional commanders oversee policy in their regions because no one else can. They have staffs of thousands, forces numbering in the tens of thousands and vast financial resources. These generals tower over civilians who share responsibility for securing American interests abroad: ambassadors, regional desk officers and assistant secretaries of state.'b'Defense Secretary Robert Gates recognizes the imbalance and has called for increasing the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s budget. But this is a long-term proposition. As he rebuilds his team in a new administration, Mr. Gates should see to it that every command has civilian officials to work alongside their military counterparts. He could, for instance, designate regional deputy defense secretaries to work with the regional commanders, just as Ambassador Ryan Crocker worked with General Petraeus on the successful surge strategy in Iraq.'b'As it stands, Defense Department civilians simply don\xe2\x80\x99t have the authority to hold their own with the regional commanders. They are ranked as deputy assistant secretaries of defense and are fourth-tier civilians within the secretary\xe2\x80\x99s office. They reside in small offices in the Pentagon and have even smaller staffs. Rarely do they engage with regional commanders.'b'Mr. Gates could promote these officials, give their staffs bigger budgets and more support, and coordinate their activities with the regional commanders so that they would have increased awareness and influence over American policy.'b'Reorganization of the Defense Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s office along these lines would not solve the structural problem of a weak State Department. But it would be a necessary first step toward more effective oversight of foreign policy, and it would put a civilian face on American engagement with the world.'b'MERRILL LYNCH lost $27 billion last year, and yet still managed to rush through $4 billion worth of year-end bonuses in the days before it was taken over by Bank of America.'b'Because both companies have been the beneficiaries of the Treasury\xe2\x80\x99s Troubled Asset Relief Program, news of these bonuses was met with predictable uproar: Attorney General Andrew Cuomo of New York threatened to investigate; any elected official with access to a microphone joined in a chorus of \xe2\x80\x9cshame on you\xe2\x80\x9d; and around every water cooler and on every cable channel, pundits offered up scathing commentaries of Wall Street greed.'b'Merrill Lynch is not the only irresponsible institution out there. Despite a year of record losses, despite all the taxpayer money being injected into our financial institutions, bonuses for 2008 were, in some cases, down less than 50 percent from those the previous year.'b'This is shocking, of course, but what\xe2\x80\x99s been missed in these discussions is how completely the culture of executive compensation has permeated the financial industry. One need not even be an executive to receive a bonus far in excess of the yearly salary of people in most other professions.'b'Bonuses, which typically consist of some multiple of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s base salary, are doled out to everyone from the 22-year-olds just out of college (these are called analysts) to managing directors (banker parlance for the most senior rank attainable).'b'I spent much of my early career at Merrill Lynch, and I can still remember how I yearned for the holiday season, because it signified bonus time. And by \xe2\x80\x9cbonus time,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean that brilliant 10-minute conversation during which you learned how many zeros would be on that year\xe2\x80\x99s check.'b'The euphoria that followed justified the days on end of working into the wee hours, the months on end without a single day off, the never-ending \xe2\x80\x9cfire drills\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 when a client wanted something and wanted it now, whether it was 7 p.m. or 7 a.m. \xe2\x80\x94 that kept the stress and adrenaline levels high.'b'For some, euphoria quickly gave way to anger and envy upon hearing what their colleagues got paid. Luckily for management and shareholders, that anger twisted itself into motivation to work even harder, get even less sleep and put up with even more in order to get a better bonus next year. For others, the days after bonus distribution were the perfect time to jump to another firm for more responsibility, authority and, no surprise, more money.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that bonuses are always bad. When I graduated from business school in early 2000 and returned to Wall Street, there was a war for talent raging. Without those bonuses, firms simply couldn\xe2\x80\x99t attract the best and brightest and certainly couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get 100-hour work weeks out of them. And when profit is created through ingenuity and hard work, it deserves to be rewarded handsomely \xe2\x80\x94 that is the American way.'b'But we\xe2\x80\x99ve come to the end of outsized paper profits generated from proprietary trading operations and 30-to-1 leverage. So too has the war for talent waned. Firms are disappearing or laying off thousands. In this environment of bleak job prospects, investment bankers who got a smaller bonus in 2008 than they did in 2007 won\xe2\x80\x99t be running for the exits and the greener pastures of Lehman or Bear Stearns.'b'Yet some institutions that begged for taxpayer aid to stave off bankruptcy \xe2\x80\x94 simply to stay alive \xe2\x80\x94 made 2008 compensation packages their first order of business after receiving their bailouts. This speaks to how completely foolhardy behavior has overtaken our industry. It certainly defies logic and sensible business practice. After all, it\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to reap great rewards when creditors are being repaid and shareholders are earning a return; it\xe2\x80\x99s quite another to reward failure almost as well.'b'Year-end bonuses also undermine the efforts of the troubled assets program. The whole point of the program was to bolster the equity capital bases of recipients. But any bonuses paid just reduce the earnings or increase the losses sustained by the firms paying them, which in turn decreases the equity capital base of those firms. Shareholders are justifiably angry and have plenty to sue about; the case could certainly be made that management and compensation committees ignored their fiduciary duty when 2008 bonuses were scheduled and paid.'b'Honestly, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if I should be more offended as a taxpayer or as a shareholder of Merrill Lynch. I suppose there\xe2\x80\x99s no difference nowadays, because we taxpayers are among the largest shareholders of many American financial institutions.'b'Regardless, financial institutions clearly relied on Uncle Sam\xe2\x80\x99s largess when they agreed to authorize 2008 incentive compensation packages. Politicians will continue to wag their fingers at the greedy executives, but Washington\xe2\x80\x99s actions enabled these bonuses to occur.'b'Without the United States government\xe2\x80\x99s open wallet, after all, these teetering companies would have had to decide between offering healthy bonuses and complete insolvency.'b'Luckily for them \xe2\x80\x94 and most unhappily for us \xe2\x80\x94 it was a choice they never had to make.'b'A few years ago, a faculty committee at Harvard produced a report on the purpose of education. \xe2\x80\x9cThe aim of a liberal education\xe2\x80\x9d the report declared, \xe2\x80\x9cis to unsettle presumptions, to defamiliarize the familiar, to reveal what is going on beneath and behind appearances, to disorient young people and to help them to find ways to reorient themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The report implied an entire way of living. Individuals should learn to think for themselves. They should be skeptical of pre-existing arrangements. They should break free from the way they were raised, examine life from the outside and discover their own values.'b'This approach is deeply consistent with the individualism of modern culture, with its emphasis on personal inquiry, personal self-discovery and personal happiness. But there is another, older way of living, and it was discussed in a neglected book that came out last summer called \xe2\x80\x9cOn Thinking Institutionally\xe2\x80\x9d by the political scientist Hugh Heclo.'b'In this way of living, to borrow an old phrase, we are not defined by what we ask of life. We are defined by what life asks of us. As we go through life, we travel through institutions \xe2\x80\x94 first family and school, then the institutions of a profession or a craft.'b'Each of these institutions comes with certain rules and obligations that tell us how to do what we\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to do. Journalism imposes habits that help reporters keep a mental distance from those they cover. Scientists have obligations to the community of researchers. In the process of absorbing the rules of the institutions we inhabit, we become who we are.'b'New generations don\xe2\x80\x99t invent institutional practices. These practices are passed down and evolve. So the institutionalist has a deep reverence for those who came before and built up the rules that he has temporarily taken delivery of. \xe2\x80\x9cIn taking delivery,\xe2\x80\x9d Heclo writes, \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutionalists see themselves as debtors who owe something, not creditors to whom something is owed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The rules of a profession or an institution are not like traffic regulations. They are deeply woven into the identity of the people who practice them. A teacher\xe2\x80\x99s relationship to the craft of teaching, an athlete\xe2\x80\x99s relationship to her sport, a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s relation to her land is not an individual choice that can be easily reversed when psychic losses exceed psychic profits. Her social function defines who she is. The connection is more like a covenant. There will be many long periods when you put more into your institutions than you get out.'b'In 2005, Ryne Sandberg was inducted into the baseball Hall of Fame. Heclo cites his speech as an example of how people talk when they are defined by their devotion to an institution:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was in awe every time I walked onto the field. That\xe2\x80\x99s respect. I was taught you never, ever disrespect your opponents or your teammates or your organization or your manager and never, ever your uniform. You make a great play, act like you\xe2\x80\x99ve done it before; get a big hit, look for the third base coach and get ready to run the bases.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Sandberg motioned to those inducted before him, \xe2\x80\x9cThese guys sitting up here did not pave the way for the rest of us so that players could swing for the fences every time up and forget how to move a runner over to third. It\xe2\x80\x99s disrespectful to them, to you and to the game of baseball that we all played growing up.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cRespect. A lot of people say this honor validates my career, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t work hard for validation. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t play the game right because I saw a reward at the end of the tunnel. I played it right because that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to do, play it right and with respect ... . If this validates anything, it\xe2\x80\x99s that guys who taught me the game ... did what they were supposed to do, and I did what I was supposed to do.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I thought it worth devoting a column to institutional thinking because I try to keep a list of the people in public life I admire most. Invariably, the people who make that list have subjugated themselves to their profession, social function or institution.'b'Second, institutional thinking is eroding. Faith in all institutions, including charities, has declined precipitously over the past generation, not only in the U.S. but around the world. Lack of institutional awareness has bred cynicism and undermined habits of behavior. Bankers, for example, used to have a code that made them a bit stodgy and which held them up for ridicule in movies like \xe2\x80\x9cMary Poppins.\xe2\x80\x9d But the banker\xe2\x80\x99s code has eroded, and the result was not liberation but self-destruction.'b'Institutions do all the things that are supposed to be bad. They impede personal exploration. They enforce conformity.'b'But they often save us from our weaknesses and give meaning to life.'b'After helping to fuel the horrific war in eastern Congo, Rwanda has created a potential opening for ending the conflict by arresting Gen. Laurent Nkunda, the rebel leader who once seemed untouchable. It is a surprising and positive move. But it is only a start.'b'Now the international community must keep the pressure on the Rwandan and the Congolese governments to take other steps that could eventually stabilize this traumatized region. That includes continuing to withhold aid to Rwanda and insisting that United Nations peacekeepers be allowed to operate in eastern Congo to discourage fighting and bear witness to atrocities on all sides.'b'Mr. Nkunda, whose troops have been accused of massacres as far back as 2002, was arrested on Thursday. It was a stunning turnabout since he had long been supported by Rwanda, which twice invaded Congo in pursuit of Hutu rebels who fled there after taking part in the 1994 genocide. We hope his arrest means an end to the proxy war between Rwanda and Congo.'b'It would be chilling if an even more brutal leader, Jean Bosco Ntaganda \xe2\x80\x94 who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes \xe2\x80\x94 succeeds him as leader of the rebel forces. (At some point, Mr. Nkunda must be brought to justice. The court is believed to be considering the case against him.) Some experts fear the two countries have struck a deal that would allow Rwandan commandos free rein to go after Hutu militants in eastern Congo. That is extremely risky.'b'A political settlement is the only hope for a durable peace. African leaders, the United Nations, the United States and China (a major new regional investor) must exert more pressure on all parties \xe2\x80\x94 starting with the Congolese president, Joseph Kabila, and the Rwandan president, Paul Kagame \xe2\x80\x94 to implement such an accord.'b'Over the past decade, as many as five million Congolese have died and one million have been displaced because of the fighting. It is past time for the suffering to end.'b'In one dramatic stroke, President Obama has removed any doubts that he intends to break sharply from President George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s policies on yet another vital issue \xe2\x80\x94 this time repudiating Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s passive approach to climate change. At a news conference on Monday, Mr. Obama directed the Environmental Protection Agency to consider immediately California\xe2\x80\x99s application to set its own rules on greenhouse-gas emissions from cars and trucks. Mr. Bush had rejected that application.'b'Once California receives permission to move ahead \xe2\x80\x94 as it surely will \xe2\x80\x94 13 states, and possibly more, are expected to impose similar rules. The result will be to force automakers here and overseas to begin producing cars and trucks that are considerably more fuel efficient than today\xe2\x80\x99s models and on a faster timetable.'b'The California decision is of great significance not only for that reason but for what it says about Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to the cause of reversing the rise in greenhouse gases. Mr. Bush began his tenure by breaking a campaign promise to regulate carbon dioxide and by withdrawing the United States from the Kyoto agreement on climate change. Mr. Obama begins his with a clear signal that he will not hesitate to use the regulatory levers provided by the Clean Air Act and other federal statutes to fight global warming.'b'California has long had the right to set stronger air pollution standards than the rest of the nation, provided it has federal permission. Its earlier requests to set stronger air pollution standards were routinely approved, but in this case the Bush administration said no, dredging up all manner of arguments to support its case. One was that California had not demonstrated \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary and compelling\xe2\x80\x9d reasons to limit greenhouse gases; another was that a national regulatory system was preferable to state-by-state laws \xe2\x80\x94 even though the administration itself had shown no interest whatsoever in a national system.'b'In a companion move, Mr. Obama directed the Transportation Department to finalize the interim nationwide fuel-efficiency standards called for in the 2007 energy bill. These standards would eventually require fuel-efficiency increases in the American car and light-truck fleet to roughly 35 miles per gallon by 2020 from the current average of 27 m.p.g. The California standards would require automakers to reach the same 35 m.p.g. target four years ahead of the federal timetable.'b'The California rules cannot by themselves stop the rise in greenhouse gases. In addition to regulatory controls, Mr. Obama must eventually embrace a broader strategy involving major federal investments in clean-energy technologies and, down the road, some effort to put a price on greenhouse-gas emissions in order to unlock private investment. But after eight years of inaction, this is a wonderful start.'b'A 10-year campaign to censor the Internet ended last week when the Supreme Court refused to step in and save the Child Online Protection Act. Everyone can agree on the need to protect children from sexually explicit online material, but this misguided law tried to do it in ways that infringed on too much constitutionally protected free speech.'b'Congress passed the Child Online Protection Act in 1998 after the Supreme Court had struck down an even broader law regulating online indecency. The 1998 act imposed civil and criminal penalties, including up to six months in prison, for offering commercial material online that was \xe2\x80\x9charmful to minors.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But the courts quickly blocked the law from taking effect, and it has been the subject of legal battles ever since. In July, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, struck down the act, which it found to violate the First Amendment in a number of ways. Among other things, the court ruled that the law\xe2\x80\x99s purpose could be better achieved, with less damage to free expression, if parents used filtering software to keep objectionable material away from children.'b'The Bush administration appealed that ruling, arguing that if it were allowed to stand, millions of children would be exposed to online pornography. But the American Civil Liberties Union, which had brought the original challenge, insisted that the act unconstitutionally stifled the free speech rights of adult Internet users \xe2\x80\x94 because it would cover more than just pornography that children may be seeing. The A.C.L.U. also has said that the act was ineffective since it did not regulate foreign Web sites, which are the source of much of the indecent material available to American Internet users.'b'In its ruling last week, the Supreme Court turned down the appeal of the federal appellate court\xe2\x80\x99s decision without comment. Without the Bush administration pushing for more restrictions on online pornography, even some supporters of greater regulation believe their cause may be lost for the foreseeable future.'b'Society has a legitimate interest in keeping sexually explicit material away from minors. But as the courts have repeatedly emphasized, it cannot be done through a sweeping censorship regime. It is not likely that Congress will rush to take up online indecency again. If it does, it needs to follow the courts\xe2\x80\x99 guidance and rely on methods \xe2\x80\x94 like filtering software \xe2\x80\x94 that keep indecent material away from children without infringing on the free expression rights of everyone else.'b'The Food and Drug Administration has been justly pilloried for grievous flaws in its regulation of foods and drugs. Now Congressional investigators, and some of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s own scientists, are charging that the F.D.A. has failed to adequately regulate medical devices.'b'The Government Accountability Office recently reported that the F.D.A. has failed \xe2\x80\x94 for decades \xe2\x80\x94 to subject some of the riskiest devices to a rigorous review mandated by Congress. A group of F.D.A. scientists complained to the Obama transition team \xe2\x80\x94 and before that to Congress and to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s commissioner \xe2\x80\x94 that during the Bush years, managers in charge of medical device reviews had corrupted and distorted the process in ways that put the public at risk.'b'Under a 1976 law, the F.D.A. is required to divide medical devices into three classes and to impose different levels of scrutiny. The riskiest Class III devices \xe2\x80\x94 such as implantable pacemakers and replacement heart valves \xe2\x80\x94 require the most stringent review, usually including clinical evidence that they are safe and effective.'b'Unfortunately, the law left a gaping loophole. Certain types of Class III devices already on the market, and later devices deemed substantially equivalent to them, could be approved for sale with the less stringent review \xe2\x80\x94 until the F.D.A. required them to pass a more rigorous test or put them into a lower class.'b'The agency made so little progress in closing the loophole that Congress in 1990 ordered it to quickly decide which classes the grandfathered devices should be in and to schedule rigorous reviews for those remaining in Class III. Although the agency has done that for most of the remaining devices, the G.A.O. found that it has still not completed the task.'b'In a recent five-year period, the F.D.A. used the less stringent procedures to clear 228 Class III devices, including certain types of metal hip joints and implanted blood access devices.'b'The Obama administration will have to send a clear signal to the bureaucracy that the days of neglect are over. Officials will also have to make clear that the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s practice of distorting science and weakening regulation to favor industry also is over.'b'We are pleased to hear that F.D.A. scientists have been raising the alarms. As Gardiner Harris reported in The Times, internal documents show that front-line scientists believe their managers have become too lenient with industry and, in one case, improperly forced them to alter reviews of a breast imaging device after Christopher Shays, a former Republican congressman from Connecticut, intervened on behalf of the manufacturer.'b'The G.A.O. has rightly urged the F.D.A. to make final decisions on all grandfathered Class III devices. That would be a good start \xe2\x80\x94 provided the reviews are honest and uncoerced \xe2\x80\x94 but not sufficient. The next F.D.A. commissioner should ensure that past decisions on medical devices were properly made. Given its sorry performance in so many areas important to public health and safety, the agency is ready for a major overhaul.'b'Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s column by Gail Collins misidentified the French official hospitalized after being attacked by his dog.

American newspapers shoulder the burden of considerable indebtedness with little cash on hand, as their profit margins have diminished or disappeared. Readers turn increasingly to the Internet for information \xe2\x80\x94 even though the Internet has the potential to be, in the words of  the chief executive of Google, Eric Schmidt, \xe2\x80\x9ca cesspool\xe2\x80\x9d of false information.  If Jefferson was right that a well-informed citizenry is the foundation of our democracy, then newspapers must be saved.'b'Although the problems that the newspaper industry faces are well known, no one has offered a satisfactory solution. But there is an option that might not only save newspapers but also make them stronger: Turn them into nonprofit, endowed institutions \xe2\x80\x94 like colleges and universities. Endowments would enhance newspapers\xe2\x80\x99 autonomy while shielding them from the economic forces that are now tearing them down.'b'In the standard business model, newspapers rely on revenues from circulation and advertising to pay for news coverage and generate healthy profits. In the past decade, however, as Americans embraced the Internet, newspaper circulation has declined every year. Advertising revenues, which are tied to circulation levels, fell even faster. Classified ads, in particular, suffered as the Web offered cheaper, easier and more effective alternatives.'b'America\xe2\x80\x99s pre-eminent papers exemplify the distress. Average profit margins at The Washington Post over the past five years have been about 25 percent less than what they had been in the previous 15 years. At The New York Times, the decline was more than 50 percent. The debt-laden Tribune Company, which operates The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times and six other daily papers, has filed for bankruptcy protection.'b'Newspapers nationwide, struggling to survive the economic turmoil, seek to refinance debt, issue equity and dispose of nonessential assets. These actions are short-term solutions to a systemic problem, Band-Aids for a gaping wound.'b'News organizations have cut costs, with grave consequences. Over the past three years, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times and The San Francisco Chronicle have trimmed their staffs. The number of American correspondents reporting from abroad fell by 25 percent from 2002 to 2006, and only a handful of American newspapers now operate foreign bureaus.'b'In a move that would have been unthinkable just last year, The New York Times recently began selling display advertising on its front page. Some papers have even shrunk  physically, eliminating sections and decreasing paper size.'b'As long as newspapers remain for-profit enterprises, they will find no refuge from their financial problems. The advertising revenues that newspaper Web sites generate are not enough to sustain robust news coverage. Though The New York Times Web site attracted 20 million unique users in  October, Web-driven revenues support only an estimated 20 percent of the paper\xe2\x80\x99s current staff.'b'As newspapers go digital, their business model erodes. A 2008 research report from Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company explained, \xe2\x80\x9cThe notion that the enormous cost of real news-gathering might be supported by the ad load of display advertising down the side of the page, or by the revenue share from having a Google search box in the corner of the page, or even by a 15-second teaser from Geico prior to a news clip, is idiotic on its face.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'By endowing our most valued sources of news we would free them from the strictures of an obsolete business model and offer them a permanent place in society, like that of America\xe2\x80\x99s colleges and universities. Endowments would transform newspapers into unshakable fixtures of American life, with greater stability and enhanced independence that would allow them to serve the public good more effectively.'b'As educational and literary organizations devoted to the \xe2\x80\x9cpromotion of social welfare,\xe2\x80\x9d endowed newspapers would benefit from Section 501(c)(3) of the I.R.S. code, which provides exemption from taxes on income and allows tax deductions for people who make contributions to eligible organizations.'b'One constraint on an endowed institution is the prohibition in the same law against trying to \xe2\x80\x9cinfluence legislation\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cparticipate in any campaign activity for or against political candidates.\xe2\x80\x9d While endowed newspapers would need to refrain from endorsing  candidates for public office, they would still be free to participate forcefully in the debate over issues of public importance. The loss of endorsements  seems minor in the context of the opinion-heavy Web.'b'Aside from providing  stability, an endowment  would promote journalistic independence. The best-run news organizations insulate reporters from pressures to produce profits or to placate advertisers.  But endowed news organizations would be in an ideal situation \xe2\x80\x94 with no pressure from stockholders or advertisers at all.'b'How large an endowment would a newspaper need? The news-gathering operations at The New York Times cost a little more than $200 million a year. Assuming some additional outlay for overhead, it would require an endowment of approximately $5 billion (assuming a 5 percent annual payout rate). Newspapers with smaller newsrooms would require  smaller endowments.'b'Note that just as endowed educational institutions charge tuition, endowed newspapers would generate incremental revenues from hard-copy sales and online subscriptions. If revenues were to exceed the costs of distribution, the endowment requirement  would decline.'b'Many newspapers will not weather the digital storm on their own. Only a handful of foundations and wealthy individuals have  the money required to endow, and thereby preserve, our nation\xe2\x80\x99s premier news-gathering organizations. Enlightened philanthropists must act now or watch a vital component of American democracy fade into irrelevance.'b'IT\xe2\x80\x99S disorienting to spend a lifetime hearing the praises of consuming less \xe2\x80\x94 and then, with the economic collapse, being forced to do so. On one hand, a big drop in consumption sounds like the advent of a new utopia where people stay at home to eat, play board games with neighbors and discover life\xe2\x80\x99s simpler pleasures.'b'On the other, it might mean a societal disaster to rival the fall of the Aztecs. One is left standing in a very scary place where lifelong homilies about the benefits of reduced shopping reveal themselves as dangerous, impossible, society-crippling fallacies. To make matters worse, capitalism doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be saving the day. We\xe2\x80\x99re left without the comfort of a familiar viewpoint to guide us forward.'b'So let\xe2\x80\x99s pull back a bit for perspective. How much less will we actually consume in 2009? Does the prospect of a 10 percent reduction in personal spending sound scary? Should we be figuring out a number in our heads we can agree on as being both plausible and survivable? Five percent? Eight? When do we say, \xe2\x80\x9cO.K., this kind of reminds me of \xe2\x80\x98The Waltons\xe2\x80\x99 and I can feel good about it\xe2\x80\x9d?'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s a question: How much less spending is a good thing? One percent? Three? And remember, everyone spends less in a different way. Person A decides not to buy a new car and, boom, that\xe2\x80\x99s 25 percent less spending in one gesture. Person B avoids restaurants and coffee \xe2\x80\x94 10 percent over a year. The economics of less probably don\xe2\x80\x99t spread themselves out across the board evenly. If I had to bet on anything right now, it\xe2\x80\x99d be Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s soup and the Wii. Everything else is iffy.'b'And let\xe2\x80\x99s also ask ourselves this: What if we actually do spend 10 percent less this year \xe2\x80\x94 and then decide to stay at that level? Is that healthy? Will China implode? What will be the next Iceland? The next Waterford Wedgwood?'b'Right now, it seems almost impossible to imagine ever spending more on things except, maybe, gasoline. And yet the prospect of less consumption fills us with dread. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the having less part that is frightening \xe2\x80\x94 people are generally happy as long as everybody\xe2\x80\x99s in the same boat. What\xe2\x80\x99s frightening is the fear that our system can\xe2\x80\x99t handle less, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if there\xe2\x80\x99s some other system out there shouting: \xe2\x80\x9cTry me!

I wish Mitchell could resume where he left off eight years ago, but the death of Arafat, the decline of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, the 2006 Hezbollah-Israel war in Lebanon, the 2009 Hamas-Israel war in Gaza, the continued expansion of colonial Israeli settlements and the deepening involvement of Iran with Hamas and Hezbollah have all created a new reality.'b'Specifically, the Palestinian Authority is in no position today to assume control of the West Bank, Hamas is incapable of managing Gaza and the introduction of rockets provided by Iran to Hamas has created a situation whereby Israel won\xe2\x80\x99t turn over the West Bank to any Palestinians now because it fears Hamas would use it to launch rockets on Israel\xe2\x80\x99s international airport. But if we do nothing, Zionist settlers would devour the rest of the West Bank and holy Jerusalem. What can be done?'b'I am proposing what I would call a five-state solution:'b'1. Israel agrees in principle to withdraw from every inch of the West Bank and Arab districts of East Jerusalem, as it has from Gaza. Any territories Israel might retain in the West Bank for its settlers would have to be swapped  \xe2\x80\x94  inch for inch  \xe2\x80\x94  with land from Israel proper.'b'2. The Palestinians  \xe2\x80\x94  Hamas and Fatah  \xe2\x80\x94  agree to form a national unity government. This government then agrees to accept a limited number of Egyptian troops and police to help Palestinians secure Gaza and monitor its borders, as well as Jordanian troops and police to do the same in the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority would agree to five-year \xe2\x80\x9csecurity assistance programs\xe2\x80\x9d with Egypt in Gaza and with Jordan in the West Bank.'b'With Egypt and Jordan helping to maintain order, Palestinians could focus on building their own credible security and political institutions to support their full independence at the end of five years.'b'3. Israel would engage in a phased withdrawal over these five years from all of its settlements in the West Bank and Arab Jerusalem  \xe2\x80\x94  except those agreed to be granted to Israel as part of land swaps  \xe2\x80\x94  at the same pace that the Palestinians meet the security and governance metrics agreed to in advance by all the parties. The U.S. would be the sole arbiter of whether the metrics have been met by both sides.'b'4. Saudi Arabia would pay all the costs of the Egyptian and Jordanian trustees, plus a $1 billion a year service fee to each country  \xe2\x80\x94  as well as all the budgetary needs of the Palestinian Authority. The entire plan would be based on U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338 and blessed by the U.N. Security Council.'b'The virtues of this five-state solution  \xe2\x80\x94  Palestine, Egypt, Jordan, Israel and Saudi Arabia  \xe2\x80\x94  are numerous: Egypt and Jordan, the Arab states that have peace treaties with Israel, would act as transition guarantors that any Israeli withdrawal would not leave a security vacuum in the West Bank, Gaza or Arab Jerusalem that could threaten Israel. Israel would have time for a phased withdrawal of its settlements, and Palestinians would have the chance to do nation-building in an orderly manner. This would be an Arab solution that would put a stop to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to Persianize the Palestinian issue.'b'President Obama, too much has been broken to go straight back to the two-state solution. It would be like trying to build a house with bricks but no cement. There\xe2\x80\x99s no trust and no framework to build it. Israelis and Palestinians need the kind of cement that only Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan can provide. It would give Israelis security and Palestinians a clear pathway to an independent state.'b'I hope you will give careful consideration to the five-state solution.'b'Peace be upon you,'b'Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz'b'WASHINGTON'b'As President Obama spreads his New Testament balm over the capital, I\xe2\x80\x99m longing for a bit of Old Testament wrath.'b'Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t he throw down his BlackBerry tablet and smash it in anger over the feckless financiers, the gods of gold and their idols \xe2\x80\x94  in this case not a gilt calf but an $87,000 area rug, a cache of diamond Tiffany and Cartier watches and a French-made luxury corporate jet?'b'Now that we\xe2\x80\x99re nationalizing, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t we fire any obtuse bankers and auto executives who cling to perks and bonuses even as the economy is following John Thain down his antique commode?'b'How could Citigroup be so dumb as to go ahead with plans to get a new $50 million corporate jet, the exclusive Dassault Falcon 7X seating 12, after losing $28.5 billion in the past 15 months and receiving $345 billion in government investments and guarantees?'b'(Now I get why a $400 payment I recently sent to pay off my Citibank Visa was mistakenly applied to my sister-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s Citibank Mastercard account.)'b'The \xe2\x80\x9cCitiboobs\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x94  as The New York Post, which broke the news, calls them  \xe2\x80\x94  watched as the car chieftains got in trouble for flying their private jets to Washington to ask for bailouts, and the A.I.G. moguls got dragged before Congress for spending their bailout on California spa treatments. But the boobs still didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the message.'b'The former masters of the universe don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to fully comprehend that their universe has crumbled and, thanks to them, so has ours. Real people are losing real jobs at Caterpillar, Home Depot and Sprint Nextel; these and other companies announced on Monday that they would cut more than 75,000 jobs in the U.S. and around the world, as consumer confidence and home prices swan-dived.'b'Prodded by an appalled Senator Carl Levin, Tim Geithner  \xe2\x80\x94 even as he was being confirmed as Treasury secretary  \xe2\x80\x94  directed Treasury officials to call the Citiboobs and tell them the new jet would not fly.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey woke up pretty quickly,\xe2\x80\x9d says a Treasury official, adding that they protested for a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cSix months ago, they would have kept the plane and flown it to Washington.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Senator Levin said that the financiers will not be able to change their warped mentality, but will have to be reined in by Geithner\xe2\x80\x99s new leashes. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no confidence that they intend or desire to change,\xe2\x80\x9d Levin told me. \xe2\x80\x9cThese bankers got away with murder, and it\xe2\x80\x99s obscene that close to nothing is being asked of financial institutions. I get incensed at the thought that a bank that\xe2\x80\x99s getting billions of dollars in taxpayer money is out there buying fancy new airplanes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'New York\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, always gratifying on the issue of clawing back money from the greedy creeps on Wall Street, on Tuesday subpoenaed Thain, the former Merrill Lynch chief executive, over $4 billion in bonuses he handed out as the failing firm was bought by Bank of America.'b'In an interview with Maria Bartiromo on CNBC, Thain used the specious, contemptible reasoning that other executives use to rationalize why they\xe2\x80\x99re keeping their bonuses as profits are plunging.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t pay your best people, you will destroy your franchise\xe2\x80\x9d and they\xe2\x80\x99ll go elsewhere, he said.'b'Hello? They destroyed the franchise. Let\xe2\x80\x99s call their bluff. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see what a great job market it is for the geniuses of capitalism who lost $15 billion in three months and helped usher in socialism.'b'Bartiromo also asked Thain to explain, when jobs and salaries were being cut at his firm, how he could justify spending $1 million to renovate his office. As The Daily Beast and CNBC reported, big-ticket items included curtains for $28,000, a pair of chairs for $87,000, fabric for a \xe2\x80\x9cRoman Shade\xe2\x80\x9d for $11,000, Regency chairs for $24,000, six wall sconces for $2,700, a $13,000 chandelier in the private dining room and six dining chairs for $37,000, a \xe2\x80\x9ccustom coffee table\xe2\x80\x9d for $16,000, an antique commode \xe2\x80\x9con legs\xe2\x80\x9d for $35,000, and a $1,400 \xe2\x80\x9cparchment waste can.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Does that mean you can only throw used parchment in it or is it made of parchment? It\xe2\x80\x99s psychopathic to spend a million redoing your office when the folks outside it are losing jobs, homes, pensions and savings.'b'Thain should never rise above the level of stocking the money in A.T.M.\xe2\x80\x99s again. Just think: This guy could well have been Treasury secretary if John McCain had won.'b'Bartiromo pressed: What was wrong with the office of his predecessor, Stanley O\xe2\x80\x99Neal?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell \xe2\x80\x94  his office was very different  \xe2\x80\x94  than  \xe2\x80\x94  the  \xe2\x80\x94  the general d\xc3\xa9cor of  \xe2\x80\x94  Merrill\xe2\x80\x99s offices,\xe2\x80\x9d Thain replied. \xe2\x80\x9cIt really would have been  \xe2\x80\x94  very difficult  \xe2\x80\x94 for  \xe2\x80\x94  me to use it in the form that it was in.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Did it have a desk and a phone?'b'How are these ruthless, careless ghouls who murdered the economy still walking around (not to mention that sociopathic sadist Bernie Madoff?)  \xe2\x80\x94  and not as perps?'b'Bring on the shackles. Let the show trials begin.'b'With more jobs being lost all the time across the board \xe2\x80\x94 more than 71,000 layoffs in the United States were announced on Monday and Tuesday alone \xe2\x80\x94 there should be comfort in the fact that one sector, health care, continues to add jobs. In December, employers added 32,000 health-related positions.'b'Unfortunately, one of the fastest-growing areas within the health care field \xe2\x80\x94 home care for the elderly \xe2\x80\x94 also is one of the lowest paid and most exploitable.'b'Outdated labor rules from 1975 allow home care aides to be defined as companions, which exempts their employers, usually private agencies, from federal standards governing overtime and minimum wages. As the population has aged, however, demand for home care has grown and the work has evolved far beyond companionship. It is not uncommon for home care workers to perform significant housekeeping chores and to help their elderly clients move, dress and eat, make sure they take their medicines and go to doctors\xe2\x80\x99 appointments.'b'In its last days in office in 2001, the Clinton administration proposed a revision to the labor rules to allow federal protections to apply to personal home care aides, but the Bush administration promptly threw that out and reasserted the status quo. A 2007 Supreme Court ruling upheld the rules, and a push that year by House and Senate Democrats to pass a bill to update the law went nowhere.'b'According to the Labor Department, personal and home care aides are expected to be the second fastest-growing occupation in the United States from 2006-2016, increasing by 51 percent, slightly behind the expected growth in systems and data communications analysts.'b'Most home care aides are women, low income and minority, and many of them are immigrants. Some states have taken steps to provide them with basic labor protections. Efforts to unionize home care workers in some states also has led to wage gains and better conditions. But the progress is incomplete without a federal law to recognize and protect the home care work force. It is unconscionable that workers who are entrusted with the care of some of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s most vulnerable citizens are themselves unprotected by basic labor standards.'b'It is also unwise, because poor pay for long hours leads to high turnover, which undermines the quality of care. Turnover also drives up the cost of providing home care \xe2\x80\x94 a needless drain on Medicaid, which pays for many home care services. And that is not the only way that poor quality home care jobs end up costing taxpayers. Nearly half of home care workers rely on food stamps or other public assistance, so taxpayers ultimately compensate for their low pay and inadequate benefits.'b'Of necessity, job creation and job quality will be the focus of the Obama administration in 2009, and, most likely, for many years. The Department of Labor could rewrite the rules to extend federal protections to home care workers. Or Congress and the White House could work together to pass a law granting those protections. Either way, the point is to ensure that home care, a 21st-century growth industry, creates good jobs.'b'Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales should have considered himself a lucky man when he was allowed to resign in disgrace in August 2007 without being hauled into Congress on perjury or contempt charges.'b'He was in the thick of President George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s most damaging attacks on the rule of law. As White House counsel, he helped to justify torture and illegal wiretapping. As attorney general, he politicized the Justice Department. And he misled Congress in both jobs.'b'He could have told the truth about those things. Or, he could have gone quietly away and waited for a subpoena from the Obama administration.'b'Instead, he is trying for some sort of bizarre comeback by painting himself as an upstanding man victimized by a \xe2\x80\x9cmean-spirited town.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In an interview with National Public Radio this week, Mr. Gonzales attacked President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s choice for attorney general, Eric Holder, for saying that waterboarding is torture. To hear Mr. Gonzales tell it, Mr. Holder was in the wrong \xe2\x80\x94 not the lawyers like Mr. Gonzales who tortured the law to justify torture, or the former defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, who approved its use, or the interrogators who actually subjected detainees to waterboarding and other inhumane and illegal interrogation techniques.'b'Making a \xe2\x80\x9cblanket pronouncement like that,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Gonzales warned, might affect \xe2\x80\x9cthe morale and dedication\xe2\x80\x9d of intelligence officials. He said agents at the Central Intelligence Agency \xe2\x80\x9cno longer have any interest in doing anything controversial.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re certainly glad to hear that.'b'No one in the Bush administration \xe2\x80\x94 certainly not Mr. Gonzales \xe2\x80\x94 has offered evidence that torturing prisoners produced reliable information. It did undermine the law, further endanger American soldiers who might be captured in the field and destroy the nation\xe2\x80\x99s image.'b'Mr. Gonzales did not stop there. He said it was his subordinates\xe2\x80\x99 fault that nine United States attorneys were fired for obviously political reasons. \xe2\x80\x9cI deeply regret some of the decisions made by my staff,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Mr. Gonzales had no regrets about the infamous visit he paid to the hospital room of then-Attorney General John Ashcroft in 2004 while he was White House counsel. Mr. Ashcroft was barely conscious after serious surgery, but Mr. Gonzales and Andrew Card, then the White House chief of staff, tried to get him to sign off on a program to eavesdrop on Americans without a warrant.'b'James Comey, then the deputy attorney general, rushed to the hospital and managed to thwart the plan. As for reports that the illegal eavesdropping program had prompted threats of a mass resignation by top Justice officials, Mr. Gonzales dismissed that with an airy \xe2\x80\x9clawyers often disagree about important legal issues.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Gonzales said he was not worried about being prosecuted for his actions because he was \xe2\x80\x9cacting in good faith\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x94 yes \xe2\x80\x94 following orders.'b'That smug self-assurance should be another powerful reminder to the White House of the need for an unsparing review of all of Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s policies on torture, wiretapping and executive power. Only by learning the details of those disastrous decisions can the nation hope to undo the damage and make sure these mistakes are not repeated.'b'Congress has given a significant boost to civil rights by approving legislation to overturn a notorious 2007 Supreme Court decision that made it much harder for employees to challenge unlawful pay discrimination based on gender, race, age and disability. Following its passage with a final House vote on Tuesday, the measure goes to the White House where President Obama is expected to sign it this week.'b'The 5-to-4 decision involved Lilly Ledbetter, a supervisor at a Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company plant in Alabama. She received much smaller raises over several years than men in comparable positions. Overriding longstanding legal precedents and government practice, the court\xe2\x80\x99s conservative majority decided she was entitled to nothing. In doing so, it imposed an unrealistic deadline for filing claims that rewarded employers who successfully disguise their discriminatory pay actions.'b'After signing the corrective measure, Mr. Obama ought to press Congress to continue the fight for equal pay for equal work by passing a second bill \xe2\x80\x94 the Paycheck Fairness Act \xe2\x80\x94 that would further strengthen current laws against gender-based wage discrimination. Among other things, this bill, which Mr. Obama co-sponsored while in the Senate, would make stronger remedies available under the existing Equal Pay Act; ensure that courts require employers to show that wage disparities are job-related, not sex-based, and consistent with business needs; and protect employees who discuss salary information from retaliation.'b'These changes may not please some business interests. But women still make, on average, only 78 cents for every dollar earned by men for performing substantially the same work. To narrow that yawning wage gap, tighter rules are plainly in order.'b'The House, to its credit, passed both bills. But Democratic leaders in the Senate peeled off the Paycheck Fairness Act after determining that pairing the two measures could jeopardize the chamber\xe2\x80\x99s approval of the more familiar Ledbetter bill.'b'The new president can play a useful role in helping to rally Senate Democrats not to rest on their Ledbetter laurels and to persuade Republicans to come on board. In the House, only three Republicans voted in favor of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. In the Senate, five did. By now, Republican opposition to civil rights and pay equity is not surprising. That makes it all the sadder.'b'Another week, another Albany scandal. This time New York\xe2\x80\x99s inspector general has accused Dr. Antonia Novello, the state health commissioner appointed by former Gov. George Pataki, of using state employees as her personal servants. According to the inspector general\xe2\x80\x99s report, Dr. Novello ordered state employees to take her on extended shopping trips, move her furniture around and even water her house plants. All this allegedly cost the state taxpayers at least $48,000 in overtime.'b'Dr. Novello, who was surgeon general for President George H.W. Bush, has denied the accusations through her attorney.'b'This latest Albany blockbuster comes less than a week after the indictment of Joseph Bruno, the former Senate majority leader, on charges of corruption. Only a year ago, former Gov. Eliot Spitzer resigned in disgrace. And, perhaps more to the point, the charges against Dr. Novello sound familiar \xe2\x80\x94 but even worse \xe2\x80\x94 than the abuse of office by the former comptroller, Alan Hevesi. He resigned two years ago after pleading guilty to a felony for using state drivers to assist his ailing wife.'b'Is it too much to hope that this latest chapter in the Albany sleaze series will finally persuade New York officials that they serve the taxpayers \xe2\x80\x94 not the other way around? It also stands as a pointed warning to Gov. David Paterson that he needs to name a tough enforcer to run the state\xe2\x80\x99s Commission on Public Integrity.'b'And he should push through many of the reforms that he once argued for so vigorously as the Senate minority leader. Even in the midst of the state\xe2\x80\x99s budget crisis, it would cost New York\xe2\x80\x99s politicians little to make cleaning up Albany a starting point, not an afterthought.'b'The chart accompanying Charles Blow\xe2\x80\x99s column on Saturday mislabeled a statistic. Twenty-three percent of the children who are victims of \xe2\x80\x9cmaltreatment\xe2\x80\x9d are black; that number does not refer to the percentage of black children who are victims.'b'An Op-Ed article on Tuesday, about the global role of the Defense Department, misspelled the surname of a retired general.

The world seems to grow emptier and emptier, depletion without replenishment, and now with the passing of 'b'John Updike'b' at the age of 76, death has taken perhaps its biggest prize.'b'Literature, of course, is not a contest. Still, that Stockholm did not ultimately embrace Mr. Updike \xe2\x80\x94 a Nobel, why not? \xe2\x80\x94 seems too bad, as it probably would have meant a lot to him, and to us as well to have his erudition and hard work and enthusiastic witnessing of postwar America honored on such a stage. The news that he died in a hospice not far from his house, and the new ordinariness of this current manner of death, made me wonder what he would have noticed and written about it \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure it will be discovered he was taking notes,\xe2\x80\x9d a friend said, hopefully \xe2\x80\x94 for he was gifted at describing everything.'b'Mr. Updike\xe2\x80\x99s novels wove an explicit and teeming tapestry of male and female appetites. He noticed astutely, precisely, unnervingly. His stories, some of the best ever written by anyone, were jewels of existential comedy, domestic anguish and restraint.'b'And his nonfiction! Even when his essays included a harsh criticism, he politely coiled it, tucked it inside, part snake, part rose, and the reader would feel the bite sprung silkily only at the end \xe2\x80\x94 in a balletic allegiance to both generosity and candor. Self-knowledge and self-forgiveness bestowed their own empiricism: he knew too what it was to create weak art.'b'Because his mother lived into her mid-80s, and because he seemed apple-cheeked and sparkling in his last interview with this paper in October, it was difficult to imagine not having another decade or so of him. His imagination was eager and intrepid; his sense of purpose, unflagging. When his impressive, underrated novel \xe2\x80\x9cTerrorist\xe2\x80\x9d was published in 2006, a younger writer said to me, \xe2\x80\x9cHere I am whining on about death, and he\xe2\x80\x99s gone out there at his age and learned everything there is to know about trucks!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When Mr. Updike discussed the range and quality of his literary output, \xe2\x80\x9cIs there something I\xe2\x80\x99ve left out?\xe2\x80\x9d seemed to be his concern, yet it was set forth merrily. I once saw him asked on stage what classic he had failed to read thus far, and he named \xe2\x80\x9cTristram Shandy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Though it would seem the sort of book he should like, he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to get through it. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I mean to finish it before I die,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and then added, \xe2\x80\x9cIt will probably be what kills me.\xe2\x80\x9d The audience laughed, and his face turned scarlet, as if this crowd, which loved him, was actually laughing at his death.'b'He was sometimes dismissed as a WASP, but his own extended family is almost as racially varied as President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s. In his children\xe2\x80\x99s book, \xe2\x80\x9cA Helpful Alphabet of Friendly Objects,\xe2\x80\x9d he gave \xe2\x80\x9cV\xe2\x80\x9d not to the usual violin but to \xe2\x80\x9cvacuum cleaner,\xe2\x80\x9d accompanied by a photograph of what looks to be Mr. Updike\xe2\x80\x99s young African-American grandson hoovering intently. My own son and I used to study it for long minutes, grateful for the thoughtfulness, newness and personal familiarity of the image, which seemed plucked from our very own lives.'b'That is what so many readers of his felt, I think: that he had reached in and grabbed a piece of their home \xe2\x80\x94 a home in flux and improvisation \xe2\x80\x94 and displayed it. Sometimes with glee, sometimes with sorrow. But always with interest. In a review of his early stories, I once quoted a Latvian acquaintance who said that when he encountered Mr. Updike\xe2\x80\x99s work he felt he was for the very first time reading a writer who \xe2\x80\x9cwasn\xe2\x80\x99t just making things up.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Later, I received a note from Mr. Updike. As with his other notes, his name and address were oddly hand-stamped on the envelope and at the end of the letter, with what looked to be a schoolboy\xe2\x80\x99s rubber stamp. \xe2\x80\x9cI loved your Latvian,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote.'b'President Obama is scheduled to sign the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law today.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so excited I can hardly stand it,\xe2\x80\x9d Ledbetter said recently after the bill passed the Senate.'b'Obama told her story over and over when he campaigned for president: How Ledbetter, now 70, spent years working as a plant supervisor at a tire factory in Alabama. How, when she neared retirement, someone slipped her a pay schedule that showed her male colleagues were making much more money than she was. A jury found her employer, the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, to be really, really guilty of pay discrimination. But the Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 decision led by the Bush appointees, threw out Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s case, ruling that she should have filed her suit within 180 days of the first time Goodyear paid her less than her peers.'b'(Let us pause briefly to contemplate the chances of figuring out your co-workers\xe2\x80\x99 salaries within the first six months on the job.)'b'Until the Supreme Court stepped in, courts generally presumed that the 180-day time limit began the last time an employee got a discriminatory pay check, not the first. In an attempt at bipartisan comity, the Senate decided to simply restore the status quo, rejecting House efforts to make the law tougher. Even then, only five Republican senators voted for it \xe2\x80\x94 four women and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who is currently the most threatened of the deeply endangered species known as moderate Republicans.'b'Ledbetter, who was widowed in December, won\xe2\x80\x99t get any restitution of her lost wages; her case can\xe2\x80\x99t be retried. She\xe2\x80\x99s now part of a long line of working women who went to court and changed a little bit of the world in fights that often brought them minimal personal benefit.'b'Another was Eulalie Cooper, a flight attendant who sued Delta Air Lines in the mid-\xe2\x80\x9960s when she was fired for being married. Not only did a Louisiana judge uphold the airline industry\xe2\x80\x99s bizarre rules requiring stewardesses to be young and single, Cooper was denied unemployment benefits on the grounds that by getting married she left her job \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But she began a pattern of litigation that eventually ended the industry\xe2\x80\x99s insistence that women needed to look like sex objects in order to properly care for passengers on airplanes. Next time you talk about US Airways Flight 1549\xe2\x80\x99s spectacular landing on the Hudson River, remember that the three flight attendants who kept calm in the ditched plane were all women in their 50s and give a nod to people like Eulalie Cooper.'b'Patricia Lorance, an Illinois factory worker, went to court after her union and employer secretly agreed to new seniority rules that discriminated against the women who had been promoted in the post-Civil Rights Act era of the 1970s. Like Ledbetter, she lost her court fight because of a ridiculous ruling about timing, which had to be fixed by Congress.'b'Working at a series of lower-paying jobs after the factory closed, and then disabled by physical ailments, Lorance lost track of her case long before it finally wound its way through the Supreme Court. \xe2\x80\x9cBut to this day, I am rather proud of myself because I was not a dumb person. I believe in just standing up and fighting for your own rights,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a phone interview.'b'Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s real soul sister is Lorena Weeks of Wadley, Ga. Weeks, now 80, had worked two jobs to support her orphaned siblings, then struggled with her husband to set enough money aside to assure their children would be able to go to college. A longtime telephone employee, she applied for a higher-paying job overseeing equipment at the central office. Both her union and the management said the job was unsuitable for a woman because it involved pushing 30-pound equipment on a dolly, even though Weeks regularly toted around a 34-pound typewriter at her clerical job.'b'Weeks v. Southern Bell helped smash employers\xe2\x80\x99 old dodge of keeping women out of higher-paying positions by claiming that they required qualifications only men could fulfill. But it was a long, painful fight during which Weeks was terrified that she might lose her job entirely. \xe2\x80\x9cI felt like I was so alone, and yet I knew I was doing what God wanted me to do. Going back to the fact my momma had died working so hard. And I knew women worked and needed a place in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a good day for the feisty working women who went to court to demand their rights and the frequently underpaid lawyers who championed them. They\xe2\x80\x99re strangers to one another; most of them made their stands and then returned to their ordinary lives. But they\xe2\x80\x99re a special sorority all the same. And Lilly Ledbetter got to go to the inauguration and dance with the new president.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTell her congratulations,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lorena Weeks.'b'President Obama is resisting calls for an investigation into torture and other abuses during the Bush years, so the chance to learn from our mistakes is slipping away.'b'Mr. Obama understandably wants to focus on economic recovery rather than a dissection of the past. Why fritter political capital on an inquest that would antagonize Republicans and imperil our economy and his agenda?'b'But as George Santayana, the eminent Harvard philosopher wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cThose who \ncannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\xe2\x80\x9d Rather than lose forever the chance to grow from our missteps, here\xe2\x80\x99s a two-step proposal for confronting the past without distracting from the work on the economic crisis.'b'The first step is to appoint a high-level commission  \xe2\x80\x94  perhaps a McCain-Scowcroft Commission?  \xe2\x80\x94  to investigate torture, secret detention and wiretapping during the Bush years, as well as to look ahead and offer recommendations for balancing national security and individual rights in the future.'b'This wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a bipartisan commission, with Democrats and Republicans offsetting each other in seething distrust. Rather, it would be nonpartisan, dominated by military and security experts.'b'It could be co-chaired by Brent Scowcroft and John McCain, with its conclusions written by Philip Zelikow, a former aide to Condoleezza Rice who wrote the best-selling report of the 9/11 commission.'b'If the three most prominent members were all Republicans, no one on the right could denounce it as a witch hunt  \xe2\x80\x94  and its criticisms would have far more credibility. The commission could be rounded out by former generals, top intelligence officials and outside experts without a strong partisan cast: people like Richard Haass, Anthony Zinni, Joseph Nye, James Dobbins and William Cohen.'b'Democrats might begrudge the heavy Republican presence on such a commission, but surely any panel is better than where we\xe2\x80\x99re headed:  which is no investigation at all. And the truth is that many generals are privately aghast at torture because it undermines their own \xe2\x80\x9chearts and minds\xe2\x80\x9d counterinsurgency efforts, and because it adds to the risk that our own troops will face the same in enemy hands. My bet, based on my conversations with military and intelligence experts, is that such a commission would issue a stinging repudiation of torture that no one could lightly dismiss.'b'As a nation, we\xe2\x80\x99ve repeatedly trampled on individual rights during moments of national fear  \xe2\x80\x94  the Palmer raids after World War I, the internment of Japanese-Americans, the McCarthy hearings at the dawn of the cold war. We may well do so again after the next major terror attack, particularly if it turns out to have been planned by people who were released from Guant\xc3\xa1namo.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ll be better off if we come to some consensus on these issues. The Kerner commission on race and the 9/11 commission are both examples of how we as a nation used such panels to gain a better understanding of our shortcomings. Such a commission would also help heal the divisions with the rest of the world and help renew America\xe2\x80\x99s reputation.'b'The second step has to do in particular with transforming Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay, Cuba. Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s pledge to close the prison there within a year is a big help, but even so the word \xe2\x80\x9cGuant\xc3\xa1namo\xe2\x80\x9d will live as a recruiting tool for Muslim terror groups.'b'So let\xe2\x80\x99s do more than just close the prison. The best move would be to hand Guant\xc3\xa1namo back to the Cubans.'b'Why spend tens of millions each year for a naval base that has very little military utility? We can project power in the region from Florida, and the main effect of the base has been to bolster Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s Communist regime by creating a nationalist backlash and a scapegoat for the Castros\xe2\x80\x99 repression and incompetence.'b'Granted, returning the base to Cuba may not be politically realistic. So here\xe2\x80\x99s a fallback alternative: turn the base into a research center for tropical diseases.'b'This was proposed in a medical journal, PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases,  a year ago, and it makes more sense now than ever.'b'In Latin America and the Caribbean, there are still more than half-a-million cases annually of dengue fever (which causes excruciating pain and sometimes death), nearly 50,000 new cases of leprosy and more than 700,000 cases of elephantiasis (which causes grotesque deformities). In addition, 50 million Latin Americans have hookworms inside them, often causing anemia and making it more difficult for children to concentrate in school.'b'Peter Hotez, the president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute at George Washington University and the editor of PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases, says that an international center on Guant\xc3\xa1namo could become a symbol of United States cooperation in the region.'b'Imagine if people around the world came to think of Guant\xc3\xa1namo as a place where America led a battle against hookworms and leprosy. That would help us fight terrorism far more effectively than the prison at Guant\xc3\xa1namo ever did.'b'The signature achievement of the $819 billion stimulus and recovery bill, passed on Wednesday by the House, is that it directs most of its resources where they would do the most good to stimulate the economy.'b'The bill is large because this deep recession is getting deeper, and the recovery, when it comes, is expected to be slow. President Obama and the lawmakers who wrote the bill are to be commended for not letting size distort the substance. Contrary to the claims of Republican opponents that the bill indiscriminately rains money down, the amounts and categories of spending have, for the most part, been calculated carefully and chosen well.'b'Nearly 30 percent is devoted to  unemployment benefits,  food stamps and  fiscal aid to states so that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to cut services, raise taxes and lay off employees and contractors. Evidence is overwhelming that such spending yields the biggest return for every dollar spent. The bill, however, takes into account that these areas cannot absorb unlimited money. In calculating the expanded food stamps, for instance, it provides a significant increase immediately that would otherwise have occurred over time in line with inflation. That way, ample funds are available when needed, but there is no sudden cut off down the road.'b'Aid to states also is well thought out. The single biggest chunk of spending \xe2\x80\x94 $87 billion for states to shore up Medicaid programs \xe2\x80\x94 would allow them to provide care to the neediest, whose ranks have been swelled by the deepening recession. Equally important, by taking on more of the states\xe2\x80\x99 Medicaid burden, the federal government frees up states to continue providing other services that would have had to have been cut.'b'One of those vulnerable areas, states\xe2\x80\x99 education budgets, is the main target of another $79 billion. The money would help to prevent lapses in early childhood education, which often cannot be made up later. It would also prevent cuts in the curriculum and in extracurricular activities in grade schools through college \xe2\x80\x94 while averting big layoffs in a sector that is among the largest employers in many states.'b'After jobless benefits, food stamps and aid to states, the most effective stimulus is to get money directly to low-  and middle-income Americans, who are likely to spend it quickly, boosting demand. The package expands the Earned Income Tax Credit temporarily to raise the pay of the working poor. There also is money to allow low-income workers to qualify for a tax credit of up to $1,000 per child, a break currently denied them. These are good tax policy and good stimulus.'b'The measure devotes $145 billion to Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cMaking Work Pay\xe2\x80\x9d tax credit for the next two years. The credit, up to $500 per worker, would be more effective as stimulus if the cutoff for eligibility were lower. The richer the recipient, the more likely it is that the money would be saved, not spent.'b'Having maxed out on the most powerful forms of stimulus and facing an economic downturn that requires still more government intervention to prevent a more disastrous downward spiral, lawmakers sensibly expanded the package into other areas. It contains $62 billion on infrastructure spending for highways, mass transit and school buildings, and tens of billions more for other projects. It also includes $40 billion to subsidize the cost of health coverage for the unemployed.'b'Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 objections are mostly ideological. They worry, in particular, that subsidizing health insurance may be a step toward universal coverage. They may be right. But that is an argument for another day. The government must act urgently to protect the vulnerable from what is shaping up to be the worst recession in modern history and to boost the economy at a time when consumer and business spending is slack. Besides, a lamentably large amount of money goes to business tax cuts dear to Republicans. That is folly as stimulus but more than enough for political compromise.'b'A more thoughtful criticism is that the package is not more transformative in scope. There is more money for fixing roads, but not for high-speed railroads; for Head Start, but not for curriculum reform. That, too, is a discussion for another day.'b'Indeed, even with an $819 billion package, the challenge for the Obama administration is to lower expectations, not raise them. The hole the economy is in is so deep that even the stimulus package will only dig us halfway out. According to recent testimony by Douglas Elmendorf, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, without the stimulus, the economy in 2010 could underperform its potential by an amount equal to 6.3 percent of gross domestic product. With the plan, the gap could be, at best, about half that.'b'It will be a long and unpleasant climb from the ruins of the economy. But the House stimulus package is a good first step. The Senate, which takes up its version next week, should follow suit.'b'New York City corrections officials have done a commendable job reducing the number of beatings, stabbings and other violent acts that have long plagued city jails. We are very concerned about recent events \xe2\x80\x94 including the death of an inmate \xe2\x80\x94 at the troubled youth facility at the Rikers Island jail. Clearly, the city needs to do a much better job of training and supervising corrections officers there.'b'Juvenile justice advocates and former inmates had been complaining about misconduct by the guards long before Christopher Robinson, 18, was found beaten to death in his cell last fall. They accused the guards of turning disciplinary responsibility over to roving gangs that beat, harassed and extorted money and valuables from other inmates. Some critics referred to the facility as a \xe2\x80\x9cgladiator school\xe2\x80\x9d where young people were encouraged to fight and damage one another.'b'The Bronx district attorney has now charged three corrections officers with conspiracy in connection with Mr. Robinson\xe2\x80\x99s death. This is the second indictment of its kind at the youth facility in less than a year. According to the new indictment,  guards used violent inmates to ride herd over others, sanctioned assaults on inmates and decided when, where and how they would take place. Prosecutors accused the guards of setting up a system of warning signals to protect gang members from being discovered when they administered beatings. They said the guards directed their \xe2\x80\x9cteams\xe2\x80\x9d to avoid hitting inmates in the face so that any injuries would not be readily apparent.'b'City corrections officials believe they can discourage misconduct by expanding the use of surveillance cameras. The indictments suggest the entire culture of the Rikers youth facility needs to be changed. That\xe2\x80\x99s the only way to ensure these horrors are never repeated.'b'In October, while Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska was campaigning to be vice president, the federal government added the beluga whales in the state\xe2\x80\x99s Cook Inlet to the endangered species list. At the time, Governor Palin opposed the listing, saying it would be \xe2\x80\x9cpremature.\xe2\x80\x9d (She said the same thing about protecting polar bears.) Now Ms. Palin has announced that she will sue to remove the whales from the protection of the Endangered Species Act.'b'In Governor Palin\xe2\x80\x99s view, what is really endangered is Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s economic growth. Cook Inlet, the long arm of water that reaches toward Anchorage from the Gulf of Alaska, is one of the busiest and fastest-developing regions in the state. There are plans for gas and oil development, an expansion of the Port of Anchorage, as well as a possible new bridge.'b'Ms. Palin argues that the state has already taken adequate measures to protect the belugas. The numbers certainly argue otherwise. The beluga population in Cook Inlet last year was estimated at 375, down from a high of 653 in 1994.'b'In explaining her intent to file suit, the governor has challenged virtually every aspect of the listing decision \xe2\x80\x94 including the scientific finding that these belugas are a separate and distinct genetic population seriously at risk. Former Senator Ted Stevens went so far as to call the listing \xe2\x80\x9ca deliberate targeting of an area vital to the Alaskan economy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There is no doubt that Cook Inlet is vital to Alaskans. But it is also vital to the species that live in its waters. Listing the belugas does not mean shutting down the economy of the Cook Inlet. It means adjusting it to accommodate species that cannot adapt or survive any other way.'b'If you had to choose a writer to report from the afterlife, could you do better than John Updike? Death needs no exaggeration, after all. I can imagine Updike \xe2\x80\x94 who died on Tuesday at age 76 \xe2\x80\x94 going to work joyously and methodically to describe his new surroundings. Those posthumous works would tell us something as round and substantial about the afterworld as Updike\xe2\x80\x99s Rabbit books did about a certain time in a certain place called Pennsylvania.'b'John Updike may well turn out to have been America\xe2\x80\x99s Anthony Trollope. This is high praise. They both wrote dozens of novels \xe2\x80\x94 including interlinked sets \xe2\x80\x94 and both worked at writing as if it were a kind of cobbling, a sometimes magical job to which they went deliberately each day. What we remember best from both Trollope and Updike is not so much the struggles of individual characters but the social and cultural webs in which their characters are caught.'b'Trollope never tried to capture the drama of his own self-consciousness. Updike did, and gloriously. (What Updike leaves us brooding about, in fact, is how he managed his own brooding.) Only a writer who could temper his self-consciousness and, in some cases, snuff it out entirely, could have published so much and so often. America likes its writers struggling. And if it\xe2\x80\x99s been at times puzzled by Updike, it\xe2\x80\x99s because his grace and his facility made him a little suspect in a culture that expects its writers \xe2\x80\x94 Hemingway, Mailer \xe2\x80\x94 to duke it out with the language and themselves.'b'I like Updike\xe2\x80\x99s nonfiction best, especially the volumes of criticism that added up like sand in a river delta. Reading those books, you never know what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to find. The reason is this: No matter what Updike\xe2\x80\x99s books accomplished, he was, above all, a maker of sentences, one of the very best. You can read him for his books, but it\xe2\x80\x99s better to read him for his sentences, any one of which \xe2\x80\x94 anywhere \xe2\x80\x94 can rise up to startle you with its wry perfection.

He said he would be \xe2\x80\x9cvery clear in distinguishing between organizations like Al Qaeda  \xe2\x80\x94  that espouse violence, espouse terror and act on it  \xe2\x80\x94  and people who may disagree with my administration and certain actions, or may have a particular viewpoint in terms of how their countries should develop. We can have legitimate disagreements but still be respectful.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Bush liked to distinguish between terrorists and the moderate, freedom-loving Muslims of his imagination. Obama makes a much more important distinction here: between those bent on the violent destruction of America and those who merely dislike, differ from or have been disappointed by America.'b'These days the great majority of the world\xe2\x80\x99s Muslims fall into the latter category. Obama is right to take his case to them through the Arabic-language Al Arabiya network.'b'His tone represented a startling departure. He was subtle, respectful, self-critical and balanced where the Bush administration had been blunt, offensive, bombastic and one-sided in its embrace of an Israel-can-do-no-wrong policy.'b'Speaking as his Middle East envoy, George Mitchell, began an eight-day visit to the region, Obama described the mission as one of listening \xe2\x80\x9cbecause all too often the United States starts by dictating.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Obama went further. Citing Muslim members of his own family and his experience of life in a Muslim country (Indonesia), he repositioned the national interest and his own role.'b'He defined his task as convincing Muslims that \xe2\x80\x9cAmericans are not your enemy\xe2\x80\x9d and persuading Americans that respect for a Muslim world is essential. His objective, he said, was to promote not only American interests but those of ordinary people  \xe2\x80\x94  read Muslims  \xe2\x80\x94  suffering from \xe2\x80\x9cpoverty and a lack of opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s a significant ideological leap for an American leader, from the post-cold-war doctrine of supremacy to a new doctrine of inclusiveness dictated by globalization  \xe2\x80\x94  from \xe2\x80\x9cthe decider\xe2\x80\x9d to something close to \xe2\x80\x9cmediator-in-chief.\xe2\x80\x9d I applaud this shift because it is based in realism; a changed world is susceptible to American persuasion, not to American diktat.'b'Still, words do not alter the fact that the post-Gaza challenge facing Obama is immense. Here in Iran, where anti-American rhetoric is too significant a pillar of the 30-year-old Islamic Revolution to be lightly sacrificed, the response to the president\xe2\x80\x99s interview was cool. It came as the government, citing the Israeli assault on Gaza, approved a bill to investigate and prosecute alleged war crimes anywhere in the world.'b'President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad said change under Obama was good but would only be credible if America apologized to Iran for its role in the 1953 coup, among other things. The hard-line daily Kayhan said: \xe2\x80\x9cObama follows Bush\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In fact, Obama said he would pursue dialogue with Iran and praised the greatness of Persian civilization even as he deplored Iranian threats against Israel, its nuclear program and \xe2\x80\x9csupport of terrorist organizations in the past.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Any U.S.-Iranian dialogue will have to be rooted in a word Obama favors: respect. The United States has underestimated Iranian pride and the fierce attachment to its independence of a nation that has known its share of Western meddling.'b'Carrots and sticks will lead nowhere. Nor will an exclusive focus on the nuclear issue that fails to examine the whole range of American and Iranian interests, some shared, some hotly contested.'b'What is certain, with Iran as with the rest of the Middle East, is that there will be setbacks. Terrorists will attack. Obama will be denounced. But as Mitchell knows from his experience of bringing peace to Northern Ireland, the critical thing is perseverance.'b'Tony Blair, now also a Middle East envoy and Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s partner in Belfast, once put it to me this way: \xe2\x80\x9cThe only reason we got the breakthrough in Northern Ireland was we did in the end focus on it with such intensity over such a period that every little thing that went wrong  \xe2\x80\x94  and everything that could go wrong did at some point  \xe2\x80\x94  was all the time being managed and rectified.\xe2\x80\x9d He described the approach as: \xe2\x80\x9cAny time we can\xe2\x80\x99t solve it, we have to manage it, until we can start to solve it again.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Bush had the ideological framework wrong. Obama has righted it by ending the war on terror. Now comes the hard Middle Eastern slog of solve-manage-solve. It will need the president\xe2\x80\x99s unswerving focus.'b'An Op-Ed article on Jan. 8, on misperceptions of Gaza, included an unverified quotation. A former Israeli Defense Forces chief of staff, Moshe Yaalon, was quoted as saying in 2002 that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Palestinians must be made to understand in the deepest recesses of their consciousness that they are a defeated people.\xe2\x80\x9d This quotation, while cited widely, does not appear in the Israeli newspaper interview to which it is usually attributed. Its original source has not been found, and thus it should not have appeared in the article.'b'President George W.  Bush,  and his aides, could hardly wait to get rid of all those tiresome arms-control treaties when they took office. They tore up the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty to make way for a still largely pie-in-the-sky missile defense system. They opposed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and never made a serious effort to win a ban on the production of fissile material (the core of a nuclear weapon).'b'Mr. Bush grudgingly signed his one and only arms-reduction treaty with the Russians in 2002. That means that today \xe2\x80\x94 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall \xe2\x80\x94 the United States and Russia still have more than 20,000 nuclear weapons, with thousands ready to launch within minutes.'b'The bad news, of course, didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop there.'b'While Mr. Bush and his team were ridiculing treaties and arms control negotiations as \xe2\x80\x9cold think,\xe2\x80\x9d North Korea tested a nuclear device, Iran has been working overtime to produce nuclear fuel (usable for a reactor or a bomb) and many other countries are weighing whether they need to get into the nuclear game.'b'President Obama pledged to address these dangers when he was campaigning. In her recent confirmation hearing, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton  argued that this country\xe2\x80\x99s best hope of doing that is to restore treaties and a rules-based system. Now they have to translate that lofty intent into urgent action.'b'The first challenge is Russia, the only other country besides the United States with enough weapons to blow up the planet. The administration can start by negotiating a follow-on to the 1991 Start Treaty, which is set to expire in December. The pact contains the only rules for verifying any nuclear agreement, and it provides an opportunity for making even deeper cuts.'b'The two sides could easily go to 1,000 weapons each in this next round, down from the 1,700 to 2,200 deployed weapons agreed on in the 2002 Moscow treaty. Without any negotiations, the two can immediately take their weapons off  hair-trigger alert.'b'We applaud the administration\xe2\x80\x99s pledge to work for Senate ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and to revive negotiations on a fissile material production ban. Neither will be easy to achieve, but both are essential if Mr. Obama is serious about reining in a frightening new world of ever-expanding nuclear appetites.'b'During the campaign, Mr. Obama opposed plans to build a new nuclear warhead. He was right. There is no military or scientific need. Defense Secretary Robert Gates is a strong advocate of the program. Mr. Obama should resist. If the United States is going to have any credibility in arguing that others must restrain their nuclear ambitions, it must restrain its own.'b'Mr. Bush repeatedly warned about the dangers of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists. He was right. But he never put in place the strategy needed to ensure that that never happens. And he weakened some of this country\xe2\x80\x99s most fundamental defenses, including its credibility.'b'President Obama must do better. He can start by restoring the rules of the game.'b'The Supreme Court issued a strong ruling this week in favor of employees who are retaliated against for complaining about being harassed. The justices unanimously sided with a woman who was fired after answering questions in her company\xe2\x80\x99s investigation of a sexual harassment claim. The ruling should give more employees the courage to speak up when they see civil rights laws being broken in their workplaces.'b'Vicky Crawford, who worked for the Nashville school system, was questioned by her employer as part of an internal investigation of the system\xe2\x80\x99s employee relations director. Ms. Crawford told an investigator of several instances of sexually harassing conduct.'b'At the end of the inquiry, the employee relations director kept his job. Ms. Crawford was fired for embezzlement, although the charges against her were not pursued. She sued, charging that her firing was retaliatory.'b'The school system argued that Ms. Crawford was not covered by the anti-retaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because she did not file the complaint against the employee relations director. She simply answered questions that were put to her. Ms. Crawford insisted that her participation in the internal investigation was enough to win her protection.'b'The Supreme Court has taken a hard line on retaliation against workers who complain of civil rights violations. In 2006, it ruled 9-to-0 in favor of a woman who was transferred to less desirable duties after complaining of sexual harassment. The justices overturned a standard many courts had used that made it almost  impossible for workers to win a retaliation case unless they were fired.'b'This week, the court went further, ruling that even employees who merely answer questions as part of an internal investigation are protected against retaliation. Justice David Souter, in an opinion joined by six of his colleagues, noted that Title VII protects workers who have \xe2\x80\x9copposed any practice\xe2\x80\x9d that the act makes illegal. By answering her employer\xe2\x80\x99s questions as she did, Justice Souter said, Ms. Crawford had opposed sexual harassment, and was therefore covered by the law.'b'If workers had to worry about retaliation, civil rights laws would lose much of their force. The Supreme Court, in its second major ruling on retaliation in three years, has made clear that if employers are going to punish anyone, it must be the employees who break the law \xe2\x80\x94 not the ones who speak out against them.'b'After a strain of salmonella in peanut products sickened more than 500 people and contributed to eight deaths, government investigators finally took a hard look at a peanut producer in southwest Georgia.'b'What they discovered was alarming and shameful. Since 2007, the Peanut Corporation of America has found salmonella in its products at least a dozen times. Instead of dumping the tainted foods, it retested and got the results it wanted. Then it sent the product out to companies across the country for cookies and crackers and institutional peanut butter used in schools.'b'The stomach-turning reports on the peanut processing facility in Blakely, Ga., have resulted in one of the largest recalls in the history of the Food and Drug Administration. A long and growing list of those products now being recalled is available at 'b'the agency\xe2\x80\x99s Web site'b', 'b'www.fda.gov'b'.'b'As 400 or more peanut products are being pulled from the nation\xe2\x80\x99s grocery shelves and institutional cupboards, this scare should finally hit home \xe2\x80\x94 in America\xe2\x80\x99s kitchens and in Washington, where Congress and the White House need to modernize and secure the nation\xe2\x80\x99s food safety system.'b'Consumers have faced far too many food-supply emergencies in the last few years. Some of the staples of the American diet \xe2\x80\x94 tomatoes, peppers, spinach, shrimp, to name a few \xe2\x80\x94 have caused illnesses and even deaths. The F.D.A., an important agency charged with protecting the food supply, was one of many hobbled by the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s antiregulatory efforts.'b'President Obama has promised to do more to protect consumers. The White House and Congress need to work together to provide more resources and clout for the guardians of the food supply \xe2\x80\x94 and to demand more accountability.'b'One proposal worth studying comes from Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut. She wants to separate food and drugs, which  she says don\xe2\x80\x99t belong under one regulatory roof. Advocates have long said that food safety has played second string to the medical side of the F.D.A. One proposal that should be acted on immediately would require more technologically advanced methods of tracking foods so that the F.D.A. could trace tainted products at the first sign of trouble.'b'The government and industry need to quickly find a better way to inspect the nation\xe2\x80\x99s food production plants.'b'The peanut recall is a case in point. The last time an F.D.A. inspector looked at the Blakely plant was about eight years ago. Since then, the Georgia Department of Agriculture was commissioned to do the inspections. Apparently, everyone missed a lot.'b'In his days of disgrace as Illinois governor, Rod Blagojevich openly identified with the Frank Capra characters Mr. Smith and Mr. Deeds, hoping to tug populist heartstrings as a misunderstood victim. Mercifully for Illinois taxpayers, the State Senate didn\xe2\x80\x99t buy that for a minute on Thursday in convicting Mr. Blagojevich of gross abuse of his executive powers and voting unanimously to remove him from office.'b'The cocky governor grandstanded to the last, melodramatically ending his boycott of his impeachment trial to offer a closing argument.

This, despite tape-recorded evidence of his bullying pay-for-play tribute from state favor-seekers.'b'The prosecution aptly described the two faces of the governor: the public one, ever invoking reverence for \xe2\x80\x9cthe little people.\xe2\x80\x9d And the off-camera one \xe2\x80\x94 excerpted in 60 tape-recordings \xe2\x80\x94 wallowing in narcissistic, profanity-laced rants for campaign money and power.'b'Mr. Blagojevich delivered this new helping of bombast about imagined achievements  rather than submitting to an oath and answering direct questions from senators deciding his fate. He denied all wrongdoing and never came close to an honest accounting. He even argued that impeachment should wait on hard evidence of his fate in criminal court \xe2\x80\x94 as if voters must settle in for years more of his besotted capering while their government flat-lined.'b'Whatever comes of the criminal charges, Mr. Blagojevich convicted himself at the impeachment trial.

And high unemployment means a sharp rise in the number of Americans without health insurance.'b'After the economy slumped at the beginning of this decade, five million people joined the ranks of the uninsured  \xe2\x80\x94  and that was with the unemployment rate peaking at only 6.3 percent.

But let me address three arguments that I suspect Mr. Obama is hearing against moving on health care, and explain why they\xe2\x80\x99re wrong.'b'First, some people are arguing that a major expansion of health care access would just be too expensive right now, given the vast sums we\xe2\x80\x99re about to spend trying to rescue the economy.'b'But research sponsored by the Commonwealth Fund shows that achieving universal coverage with a plan similar to Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s campaign proposals would add \xe2\x80\x9conly\xe2\x80\x9d about $104 billion to federal spending in 2010 \xe2\x80\x94 not a small sum, of course, but not large compared with, say, the tax cuts in the Obama stimulus plan.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s true that the cost of universal health care will be a continuing expense, reaching far into the future. But that has always been true, and Mr. Obama has always claimed that his health care plan was affordable. The temporary expenses of his stimulus plan shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t change that calculation.'b'Second, some people in Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s circle may be arguing that health care reform isn\xe2\x80\x99t a priority right now, in the face of economic crisis.'b'But helping families purchase health insurance as part of a universal coverage plan would be at least as effective a way of boosting the economy as the tax breaks that make up roughly a third of the stimulus plan \xe2\x80\x94 and it would have the added benefit of directly helping families get through the crisis, ending one of the major sources of Americans\xe2\x80\x99 current anxiety.'b'Finally \xe2\x80\x94 and this is, I suspect, the real reason for the administration\xe2\x80\x99s health care silence \xe2\x80\x94 there\xe2\x80\x99s the political argument that this is a bad time to be pushing fundamental health care reform, because the nation\xe2\x80\x99s attention is focused on the economic crisis.

And the current crisis presents a real opportunity to fix the gaping holes that remain in that safety net, especially with regard to health care.'b'And Mr. Obama really, really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to repeat the mistakes of Bill Clinton, whose health care push failed politically partly because he moved too slowly: by the time his administration was ready to submit legislation, the economy was recovering from recession and the sense of urgency was fading.'b'One more thing. There\xe2\x80\x99s a populist rage building in this country, as Americans see bankers getting huge bailouts while ordinary citizens suffer.'b'I agree with administration officials who argue that these financial bailouts are necessary (though I have problems with the specifics). But I also agree with Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, who argues that  \xe2\x80\x94  as a matter of political necessity as well as social justice  \xe2\x80\x94 aid to bankers has to be linked to a strengthening of the social safety net, so that Americans can see that the government is ready to help everyone, not just the rich and powerful.'b'The bottom line, then, is that this is no time to let campaign promises of guaranteed health care be quietly forgotten. It is, instead, a time to put the push for universal care front and center. Health care now!'b'Throughout 2008, Larry Summers, the Harvard economist, built the case for a big but surgical stimulus package. Summers warned that a \xe2\x80\x9cpoorly provided fiscal stimulus can have worse side effects than the disease that is to be cured.\xe2\x80\x9d So his proposal had three clear guidelines.'b'First, the stimulus should be timely. The money should go out \xe2\x80\x9calmost immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d Second, it should be targeted. It should help low-  and middle-income people. Third, it should be temporary. Stimulus measures should not raise the deficits \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond a short horizon of a year or at most two.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Summers was proposing bold action, but his concept came with safeguards: focus on the task at hand, prevent the usual Washington splurge and limit long-term fiscal damage.'b'Now Barack Obama is president, and Summers has become a top economic adviser. Yet the stimulus approach that has emerged on Capitol Hill abandoned the Summers parameters.'b'In a fateful decision, Democratic leaders merged the temporary stimulus measure with their permanent domestic agenda \xe2\x80\x94 including big increases for Pell Grants, alternative energy subsidies and health and entitlement spending. The resulting package is part temporary and part permanent, part timely and part untimely, part targeted and part untargeted.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to see why Democrats decided to do this. They could rush through permanent policies they believe in. Plus, they could pay for them with borrowed money. By putting a little of everything in the stimulus package, they avoid the pay-as-you-go rules that might otherwise apply to recurring costs.'b'But they\xe2\x80\x99ve created a sprawling, undisciplined smorgasbord, which has spun off a series of unintended consequences. First, by trying to do everything all it once, the bill does nothing well. The money spent on long-term domestic programs means there may not be enough to jolt the economy now (about $290 billion in spending is pushed off into 2011 and later). The money spent on stimulus, meanwhile, means there\xe2\x80\x99s not enough to truly reform domestic programs like health technology, schools and infrastructure. The measure mostly pumps more money into old arrangements.'b'Second, by pumping so much money through government programs, the bill unleashes a tidal wave on state governments. A governor with a few-hundred-million-dollar shortfall will suddenly have to administer an additional $4 billion or $5 billion. That money will be corrosive both when washing in, and when it disappears in a few years time.'b'Third, the muddle assures ideological confrontation. A stimulus package was always going to be controversial, because economists differ widely about whether or how a stimulus can work. But this bill also permanently alters the role of the federal government, thus guaranteeing a polarizing brawl at the very start of the Obama presidency.'b'Fourth, Summers\xe2\x80\x99s warnings about deficits have been put aside. There is no fiscal exit strategy. Instead, permanent spending commitments are entailed with no permanent funding stream to pay for them.'b'Fifth, new government expenditures on complex matters are being designed on a hasty, reckless timetable. As readers may know, the policy I am most passionate about is pre-K education. Yet I fervently hope that the Head Start expansion is dropped from this bill. A slapdash and shambolic expansion could discredit the whole idea.'b'Wise heads are now trying to restore structure and safeguards to the enterprise. In testimony this week, Alice Rivlin, Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s former budget director, raised the possibility of separating the temporary from the permanent measures and focusing independently on each. \xe2\x80\x9cA long-term investment program should not be put together hastily and lumped in with the anti-recession package,\xe2\x80\x9d Rivlin testified. \xe2\x80\x9cThe elements of the investment program must be carefully planned and will not create many jobs right away.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The best course is to return to the original Summers parameters \xe2\x80\x94 temporary, targeted and timely \xe2\x80\x94 thus making the stimulus cleaner and faster.'b'Strip out the permanent government programs. Many of them are worthy, but we can have that debate another day. Make the short-term stimulus bigger. Many liberal economists have been complaining it is too small, so replace the permanent programs with something like a big payroll tax cut, which would help the working class.'b'Add in a fiscal exit strategy so the whole thing is budget neutral over the medium term. Finally, coordinate the stimulus package with plans to shore up the housing and financial markets. Until those come to life, no amount of stimulus will do any good.'b'This recession is scary and complicated. It\xe2\x80\x99s insane to try to tackle it and dozens of other complicated problems, all in one piece of legislation. Leadership involves prioritizing. Those who try to do everything at once will end up with a sprawling, lobbyist-driven mess that does nothing well.'b'IF it were not for his hatred of Islam, Geert Wilders would have remained a provincial Dutch parliamentarian of little note.'b'He is now world-famous, mainly for wanting the Koran to be banned in his country, \xe2\x80\x9clike Mein Kampf is banned,\xe2\x80\x9d and for making a crude short film that depicted Islam as a terrorist faith \xe2\x80\x94 or, as he puts it, \xe2\x80\x9cthat sick ideology of Allah and Muhammad.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Last year the Dutch government decided that such views, though coarse, were an acceptable contribution to political debate. Yet last week an Amsterdam court decided that Mr. Wilders should be prosecuted for \xe2\x80\x9cinsulting\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cspreading hatred\xe2\x80\x9d against Muslims. Dutch criminal law can be invoked against anyone who \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately insults people on the grounds of their race, religion, beliefs or sexual orientation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Whether Mr. Wilders has deliberately insulted Muslim people is for the judges to decide. But for a man who calls for a ban on the Koran to act as the champion of free speech is a bit rich. When the British Parliament refused to screen Mr. Wilders\xe2\x80\x99s film at Westminster this week, he cited this as \xe2\x80\x9cyet more proof that Europe is losing its freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d His defenders, by no means all right-wingers, also claim to be standing up for freedom. A Dutch law professor said he found it \xe2\x80\x9cstrange\xe2\x80\x9d that a man should be prosecuted for \xe2\x80\x9ccriticizing a book.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This seems a trifle obtuse. Comparing a book that billions hold sacred to Hitler\xe2\x80\x99s murderous tract is more than an exercise in literary criticism; it suggests that those who believe in the Koran are like Nazis, and an all-out war against them would be justified. This kind of thinking, presumably, is what the Dutch law court is seeking to check.'b'One of the misconceptions that muddle the West\xe2\x80\x99s debate over Islam and free speech is the idea that people should be totally free to insult. Free speech is never that absolute. Even \xe2\x80\x94 or perhaps especially \xe2\x80\x94 in America, where citizens are protected by the First Amendment, there are certain words and opinions that no civilized person would utter, and others that open the speaker to civil charges.'b'This does not mean that religious beliefs should be above criticism. And sometimes criticism will be taken as an insult where none is intended. In that case the critic should get the benefit of the doubt. Likening the Koran to \xe2\x80\x9cMein Kampf\xe2\x80\x9d would not seem to fall into that category.'b'If Mr. Wilders were to confine his remarks to those Muslims who do harm freedom of speech by using violence against critics and apostates, he would have a valid point. This is indeed a serious problem, not just in the West, but especially in countries where Muslims are in the majority. Mr. Wilders, however, refuses to make such fine distinctions. He believes that there is no such thing as a moderate Muslim. His aim is to stop \xe2\x80\x9cthe Islamic invasion of Holland.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There are others who share this fear and speak of \xe2\x80\x9cIslamicization,\xe2\x80\x9d as though not just Holland but all Europe were in danger of being engulfed by fascism once again. Since Muslims still constitute a relatively small minority, and most are not extremists, this seems an exaggerated fear, even though the danger of Islamist violence must be taken seriously.'b'However, a closer look at the rhetoric of Mr. Wilders and his defenders shows that Muslims are not the only enemies in their sights. Equally dangerous are the people whom Mr. Wilders and others refer to obsessively as \xe2\x80\x9cthe cultural elite.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What they mean are liberals who are so concerned about Western racism that they find it hard to tolerate any criticism of non-Western people or non-Western faiths. There are such people, to be sure, but even among my fellow Dutch citizens political correctitude of this kind is becoming increasingly rare.'b'In the past, it is true, legitimate debates about cultural and religious tensions arising from the poor integration of ethnic minorities were often stifled by an excess of liberal zeal. Doubts about the official drive toward pan-European unity and over liberal policies over guest workers and refugees were too often dismissed as ultra-nationalism or worse.'b'In a bewildering world of global economics, multinational institutions and mass migration, many people are anxious about losing their sense of place; they feel abandoned by their own elites. Right-wing populists like Geert Wilders are tapping into these fears.'b'Since raw nativism is out of fashion in the Netherlands, Mr. Wilders does not speak of race, but of freedom. His method is to expose the intolerance of Muslims by provoking them. If they react to his insults, he can claim that they are a threat to our native liberties. And if anyone should point out that deliberately giving offense to Muslims is neither the best way to lower social tensions nor to protect our freedoms, Mr. Wilders will denounce him as a typical cultural elitist collaborating with \xe2\x80\x9cIslamo-fascism.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The lawsuit against Mr. Wilders has been hailed in the Netherlands as a good thing for democracy. I am not so sure. It makes him look more important than he should be. In fact, the response of Dutch Muslims to his film last year was exemplary: most said nothing at all. And when a small Dutch Muslim TV station offered to broadcast the film, after all other stations had refused, the grand champion of free speech resolutely turned the offer down.'b'DEMOCRATS will probably get their way on most policy matters over the next two years, but bipartisan accomplishments won\xe2\x80\x99t be easy. Congressional Republicans won their elections too, and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t do so by promising to agree to everything that Democrats want. Yes, Democrats have the votes to muscle through a lot of bills without much Republican support \xe2\x80\x94 or any, as the stimulus package passed by the House this week shows. But on some occasions Republican support could be useful.'b'Take Social Security, which President Obama has suggested he wants to reform. A strategy that is supported only by Democrats could result in their having to take full responsibility for a tax-heavy bill, and some would balk at that prospect. This means that the most likely result is inaction.'b'This, after all, is what happened when Republicans tried to reform Social Security. President George W. Bush proposed restraining the growth in benefits and allowing young workers to invest some of their payroll-tax contributions for themselves. In 2005, Democrats almost unanimously believed that personal accounts \xe2\x80\x9ccarved out\xe2\x80\x9d of Social Security were a deal-breaker.'b'Instead, they wanted to raise taxes, especially on high earners. They also thought that young people, especially those with low or moderate incomes, should be encouraged to build capital in savings accounts \xe2\x80\x94 but only if these accounts were \xe2\x80\x9cadded on\xe2\x80\x9d to Social Security and seeded with tax credits. Congressional Democrats were not willing to cooperate with Mr. Bush, and Congressional Republicans did not want to take full responsibility for reforming Social Security. So nothing was done.'b'The stalemate continues today. To break it, each side will have to give up at least one cherished goal. Republicans must accept that Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s dream of letting individuals invest Social Security funds is dead. In return, Democrats will need to take tax increases off the table.'b'This compromise seems more likely than other solutions (though less likely than further stalemate), in part because both sides should agree that solvency will require reductions in the growth of benefits. Progressive price indexing is a good option. Under current policy, tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s retirees get greater benefits than today\xe2\x80\x99s. Progressive indexing would keep that rule for low-income workers.'b'Benefits for high-income workers would, on the other hand, keep up only with inflation. This policy should be palatable to Democrats. If they agree to take the remaining steps to make the program solvent without tax increases, then Republicans should agree to finance the \xe2\x80\x9cadd-on\xe2\x80\x9d savings accounts that Democrats favor.'b'This deal has something for everyone. Incumbents in both parties would be able to campaign on having saved the program. Republicans would get a big spending cut and avoid tax increases. Democrats would have blocked Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s personal accounts, and put most of the burden of rescuing Social Security on the affluent.'b'Mr. Obama would also be able to make good on a campaign promise. During his debates with John McCain, he said Americans would see a \xe2\x80\x9cnet spending cut\xe2\x80\x9d under his presidency. Given the amount of stimulus spending that Mr. Obama envisions over the next few years, this kind of large, long-term spending reduction is the only way for that net cut to happen. Mr. Obama could demonstrate that his pledges to get past the stale partisan debates of the past weren\xe2\x80\x99t just talk.'b'Most important, this compromise would result in good policy. Social Security needs to be brought into balance, and reasonable spending cuts would do less economic damage than tax increases. Long-term investment is still a good idea for young people. Besides, the ideological divide over \xe2\x80\x9ccarve-out\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cadd-on\xe2\x80\x9d accounts is absurd: whether the accounts are inside or outside Social Security is largely a question of accounting.'b'And who knows? Cooperation on Social Security could pave the way for bipartisan solutions on everything from tax reform to Medicare, by building good will and showing that such accomplishments are possible.'b''b'Sources: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fabric of Memory,\xe2\x80\x9d Eleanor Belmont; \xe2\x80\x9cA Pictorial History of the American Theater,\xe2\x80\x9d Daniel Blum; \xe2\x80\x9cManhattan in Maps, 1527-1995,\xe2\x80\x9d Paul E.

As she goes around listening to New York, it is just as critical for New York to listen intently to her.'b'What we have seen so far adds up to the same riddle she posed when Gov. David Paterson picked her: Can she represent a constituency beyond the narrow politics of her district, where she has been a bullet-headed opponent of gun control, proudly basking in the extremist affections of the National Rifle Association?'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not that Ms. Gillibrand is never willing to step out on a limb as a Democrat from a rural, Republican district. She has been a stout defender of women\xe2\x80\x99s rights. And there was the speed, startling to say the least, with which she came around to embrace gay marriage.'b'Gay marriage is a nonstarter even among liberal Democrats like Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles Schumer, but it is firmly supported by the one person whose vote Ms. Gillibrand needed to win her Senate seat: Governor Paterson.'b'Hmmm. There\xe2\x80\x99s flexibility, and then there is rootlessness. We doubt New Yorkers want to send someone to Washington carrying a bag of random principles determined mostly by constituents\xe2\x80\x99 angry phone calls and her patron\xe2\x80\x99s personal priorities.'b'Ms. Gillibrand has pledged herself to studying the issues to better represent all of New York. She should start with immigration. New York is huge; it contains multitudes, including millions of newcomers who perpetually renew it. It is Hempstead and Elmira, Watertown and Montauk. And it is New York City: the glory of the No. 7 subway, the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island and its 21st-century counterpart, Kennedy International Airport.'b'Ms. Gillibrand\xe2\x80\x99s House votes on immigration amounted to a repudiation of New York\xe2\x80\x99s special gift to America. She allied herself solidly with expulsionist Republicans, who reject assimilation in favor of locking down the border, deporting 12 million illegal immigrants and enshrining English as America\xe2\x80\x99s one true tongue. She has favored enforcement rigidity over common sense; she was one of the first to denounce former Gov. Eliot Spitzer\xe2\x80\x99s well-meaning effort to make sure illegal immigrants drive with licenses and insurance.'b'Ms. Gillibrand has not shown that she understands the ineffectiveness and moral bankruptcy of enforcement-only schemes. To take one example: The SAVE Act, which she co-sponsored, was all about border fencing and requiring everyone in America to prove legal status before being allowed to work. Nothing in it required or allowed immigrants to come forward and legalize. It was meant to seem tough, but was actually a weak reassertion of the status quo, in which undocumented immigrants are denied hope of legal status while the government tries to make them so miserable that they go home. That is a recipe for creating and exploiting a cheap, docile underclass.'b'Ms. Gillibrand does understand that the country needs to increase and streamline legal immigration. But defending immigration should be an absolute minimum qualification for a political leader from this state. New Yorkers should expect much more.'b'Congress is moving rapidly to rectify the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s shameful refusal to expand the State Children\xe2\x80\x99s Health Insurance Program, or S-chip, to cover substantially more low- and middle-income children. That is especially important now when so many workers are losing their jobs and health benefits.'b'A changed political environment has finally made enlargement of this joint federal-state program possible. In 2007, Congress attempted unsuccessfully to expand the insurance program only to have its efforts stymied by two vetoes by then-President George Bush. But now there are more Democrats in Congress, and President Obama has enthusiastically endorsed the legislation.'b'Bills that have passed the House and the Senate would continue coverage for an estimated seven million children already enrolled in health insurance program and extend coverage to another four million children who are currently uninsured. (The House is expected to approve the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s version next week and send it to the president for his signature.)'b'The primary target would remain what it has always been \xe2\x80\x94 children from working-poor families with incomes too high to qualify for Medicaid but not high enough to afford private health insurance. That typically means families at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, or $44,000 for a family of four.'b'However, many states also enroll children with family incomes above that level, an especially important feature where medical and insurance costs are high. The pending bills would cover children up to 300 percent of poverty and allow states to seek waivers to go even higher, albeit at a reduced federal matching rate. The bills would cost the federal government about $32 billion in new money over four and a half years, primarily paid for by an increase in tobacco taxes.'b'Many Republicans object to expanding the program to children from higher-income families. They also are critical of a provision that allows states to eliminate a five-year waiting period for Medicaid and S-chip that is now imposed on immigrant children who are here legally. That provision makes good sense to us since the alternative might be forcing them to rely on costly emergency rooms.'b'President Bush opposed the expansion of S-chip as a dangerous step toward a government-run health care system. It\xe2\x80\x99s hardly that.'b'It is a good step toward universal health coverage through a combination of public and private plans, as proposed by President Obama. And there is no question that it will help millions of uninsured children.'b'It seemed that every chance he got, President Bush ignored or flat out refused to address the problem of climate change. So we were greatly encouraged by President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s swift announcement that he is likely to approve California\xe2\x80\x99s request to regulate greenhouse gases from vehicles \xe2\x80\x94 a request the Bush administration denied.'b'The logical next step would be for Mr. Obama to quickly address the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s 2007 decision ordering the Environmental Protection Agency to examine the effects of greenhouse gases and to regulate them if necessary. Mr. Bush dodged that one, too.'b'The court instructed the agency to first determine whether global warming pollution threatened public health and welfare \xe2\x80\x94 known as an \xe2\x80\x9cendangerment finding\xe2\x80\x9d under the Clean Air Act \xe2\x80\x94 and, if so, to devise emissions standards for vehicles.'b'Lisa Jackson, the agency\xe2\x80\x99s new administrator, said in a memo to her employees last week that she intended to honor her \xe2\x80\x9cobligation to address climate change under the Clean Air Act.\xe2\x80\x9d But there is resistance from some members of Congress and parts of the business community who fear that regulating vehicle emissions of greenhouse gases will lead to economy-wide controls on greenhouse gases from all sources, including industry.'b'Stephen Johnson, Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s E.P.A. administrator, initially tried to do the right thing. He ordered his staff to write an endangerment finding and craft regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. In December 2007, he sent the entire package to the White House, which not only chose to ignore the findings but refused to open the e-mail message that contained them.'b'Mr. Johnson then ordered up a laborious public rule-making process that essentially went nowhere and allowed Mr. Bush to retire to Texas without having done much of anything. Ms. Jackson is eager to get the process back on track.'b'Nobody, including the administrator, is under any illusions that the E.P.A. alone can solve climate change. Congress will have to take ownership of the issue by authorizing major public investments in clean-energy technologies and by putting a price on greenhouse-gas emissions in order to unlock private investment.'b'But smart regulation can begin to advance the ball. For starters, it would force industry to look for ways to make cars that are much more fuel-efficient. It would help goad Congress into action. It is also, as the Supreme Court has pointed out, the law.'b'Programs that give drug addicts access to clean needles have been shown the world over to slow the spread of deadly diseases including H.I.V./AIDS and hepatitis. Public health experts were relieved when President Obama announced his support for ending a ban on federal funding for such programs.'b'Unfortunately, Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s message seems not to have reached the American delegation to a United Nations drug policy summit in Vienna, where progress is stalled on a plan that would guide global drug control and AIDS prevention efforts for years to come. The delegation has angered allies, especially the European Union, by blocking efforts to incorporate references to the concept of \xe2\x80\x9charm reduction\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 of which needle exchange is a prime example \xe2\x80\x94 into the plan.'b'State Department officials said that they were resisting the harm-reduction language because it could also be interpreted as endorsing legalized drugs or providing addicts with a place to inject drugs. But the Vienna plan does not require any country to adopt policies it finds inappropriate. And by resisting the harm-reduction language, the American delegation is alienating allies and sending precisely the wrong message to developing nations, which must do a lot more to control AIDS and other addiction-related diseases.'b'Some members of Congress are rightly angry about the impasse in Vienna. On Wednesday, three members fired off a letter to Susan Rice, the new American ambassador to the United Nations, urging that the United States\xe2\x80\x99 delegation in Vienna be given new marching orders on the harm-reduction language. If that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, the letter warns, \xe2\x80\x9cwe risk crafting a U.N. declaration that is at odds with our own national policies and interests, even as we needlessly alienate our nation\xe2\x80\x99s allies in Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cNews You Can Endow,\xe2\x80\x9d by David Swensen and Michael Schmidt (Op-Ed, Jan. 28), which says endangered newspapers can be saved if we \xe2\x80\x9cturn them into nonprofit, endowed institutions \xe2\x80\x94 like colleges and universities\xe2\x80\x9d:'b'The writers don\xe2\x80\x99t seem troubled by the rule that endowed status would prevent newspapers from attempting to \xe2\x80\x9cinfluence legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d Candidate endorsements are not the only thing this would suppress.

Matching their donor contributions would greatly increase the vibrancy of public-affairs journalism, and it would back the journalism that people are willing to support.'b'Joel Kramer 'b'\n Minneapolis, Jan. 28, 2009'b''b''b'The writer, former publisher of The Minneapolis Star Tribune, is chief executive and editor of 'b'MinnPost.com'b'.'b''b'\xc2\x95'b'To the Editor:'b'Why not move over to the well-established British system in which a small universal fee paid by all citizens finances a public media system. Today the British Broadcasting Corporation is a towering example of journalism, freed from the constraints faced by commercial media companies. So great is the BBC that it has recently begun invading our borders with BBC America, though that channel is not allowed to use the citizen fees.'b'There is a demand for the good, thorough and informative coverage that can be delivered by a nonprofit media institution. But it is a shame that this demand is being met by the British, instead of us.'b'Jessica Wanke'b'\n  New York, Jan. 28, 2009'b''b'\xc2\x95'b'To the Editor:'b'We certainly cannot afford to lose the careful reporting offered by American newspapers, but sending a check is not the answer.'b'Even if we were able to financially ensure the continued existence of American newspapers, how can we ensure citizen engagement? It is far easier to browse oversimplified headlines on the Internet than it is to pick up a newspaper and read an article in depth.'b'This is why only a small handful of students at my boarding school read newspapers. The failing newspapers are a reflection of our failure to keep my generation interested in issues of national and international importance.'b'Louise Dufresne'b'\n   Charlotte, N.C., Jan. 28, 2009'b''b'On Feb. 17, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s TV broadcasters are scheduled to go all-digital, and Americans with unconverted analog televisions will get their reception cut off. Perhaps you are one of them. Perhaps you are in such a pathetic state of denial that you are not actually sure if you\xe2\x80\x99re an analog person or not. Perhaps you think an analog is a rare burrowing creature found mainly in Australia.'b'All I can say is, shape up people. We are post-inauguration now. It\xe2\x80\x99s all about the issues. You can\xe2\x80\x99t palm yourself off as an informed citizen just because you know how many electoral votes Montana has.'b'In 2005, Congress voted to end analog broadcasting. The impetus was to raise money for the Bush tax cuts by selling off the emptied space. (Bad) But it also freed up lots of room for better Internet reception and public safety communication. (Good)'b'Other countries are doing the same thing. The Netherlands and Finland have already gone all-digital. In fact, the most unnerving thing about our Feb. 17 deadline is that the United States would be clocking in third. What are the odds that the Bush administration could pull off a complicated public initiative more efficiently than anybody but the Dutch and the Finns?'b'Everybody agrees that consumers shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t suffer from the transition. So people who get analog reception \xe2\x80\x94 mainly those who use a rooftop antenna or indoor rabbit ears \xe2\x80\x94 are supposed to get converter boxes that allow them to get digital signals. In places like Britain, the government figures out which households are affected and then sends somebody to install the needed equipment.'b'Needless to say, the Republican-controlled Congress did not consider anything that socialistic in 2005. No, our plan was so deeply privatized that one DTV converter box retailer hired Joe the Plumber as a spokesman.'b'People who needed a converter box were supposed to request a $40 coupon, which could be used toward the purchase. The coupon was then sent to them by third-class mail \xe2\x80\x94 an interesting choice which sometimes meant the coupons, which expire in three months, did not arrive for four to eight weeks. The lucky recipient could then go to an electronics store, find the right kind of box, take it home and install it. (Just for fun, imagine the oldest member of your family doing this.)'b'Meanwhile, a public awareness campaign was under way. The Federal Communications Commission decided to spend $350,000 sponsoring a race car named \xe2\x80\x9cThe Digital TV Transition.\xe2\x80\x9d Government officials no doubt imagined the golden moment when a Nascar announcer cried: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the Digital TV Transition \xe2\x80\x94 over the finish line in record time.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the first race, the car hit a wall. In the second, it crashed and burned. Fans got to hear commentary along the line of: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it looks like the Digital TV Transition is going to have to be towed off the track.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Still, thanks to public service announcements on TV, an estimated 90 percent of TV owners now know something is up. Unfortunately, the announcements created a deep unease among people who were not affected by the transition at all, like cable or satellite subscribers.'b'Attention must be paid! The TV is in danger! Some folks thought they needed to buy a new set. Others may have been digging shelters in their backyards. Quite a few applied for those coupons even though they didn\xe2\x80\x99t need them, creating a shortage.'b'Did I mention that once the government ran out of coupons, no new ones could be issued until the old ones expired? Or that people who didn\xe2\x80\x99t manage to cash their coupons in before the expiration date couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask for a replacement?'b'At this point there are an estimated 6.5 million families still relying on unconverted televisions, and a waiting list for coupons. The Obama administration has asked for more time to straighten things out, and the Senate voted unanimously to postpone the deadline for four months. This shows that legislators of good will (Democrat Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia and Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas) can work in a bipartisan manner when the issue at hand is every American\xe2\x80\x99s God-given right to television reception.'b'Then the bill moved to the House, where quick action required permission of a two-thirds majority. For once, the Republicans got a chance to make their presence felt, and they instantly sprang into action and refused to allow anybody to do anything. This shows you why Nancy Pelosi always seems a little irritable.'b'How could the Republicans not be worried about this? A disproportionate number of the endangered TV viewers are senior citizens. Bill O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s entire audience is in danger!'b'The House is going to take another crack at the delay proposal soon. If they act, Obama officials will have another four months to resolve all the problems. As if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have enough to do.'b'In the documentary film \xe2\x80\x9cPray the Devil Back to Hell,\xe2\x80\x9d a woman whose family had endured the agony of civil war in Liberia talks about a dream she had in 2003 in which someone urged her to organize the women of her church to pray for peace.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a crazy dream,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'Prayer seemed like a flimsy counterweight to the forces of Charles Taylor, the tyrannical president at the time, and the brutally predatory rebels who were trying to oust him from power. The violence was excruciating. People were dying by the tens of thousands. Rape had become commonplace. Children were starving. Scenes from the film showed even small children whose limbs had been amputated.'b'The movie, for me, was about much more than the tragic, and then ultimately uplifting events in Liberia. It was about the power of ordinary people to intervene in their own fate.'b'The first thing that struck me about the film, which is playing in select theaters around the country now, was the way it captured the almost unimaginable horror that war imposes on noncombatants: the looks of terror on the faces of people fleeing gunfire in the streets; children crouching and flinching, almost paralyzed with fear by the sound of nearby explosions; homes engulfed in flames.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of environment that breeds feelings of helplessness. But Leymah Gbowee, the woman who had the crazy dream, would have none of that, and she should be a lesson to all of us.'b'The filmmakers Abigail Disney and Gini Reticker show us how Ms. Gbowee not only rallied the women at her Lutheran church to pray for peace, but organized them into a full-blown, all-women peace initiative that spread to other Christian churches \xe2\x80\x94  and then to women of the Muslim faith.'b'They wanted the madness stopped. They wanted an end to the maiming and the killing, especially the destruction of a generation of children. They wanted to eradicate the plague of rape. They wanted all the things that noncombatants crave whenever the warrior crowd  \xe2\x80\x94  in the U.S., the Middle East, Asia, wherever  \xe2\x80\x94  decides it\xe2\x80\x99s time once again to break out the bombs and guns and let the mindless killing begin.'b'When the Liberian Christians reached out to \xe2\x80\x9ctheir Muslim sisters,\xe2\x80\x9d there was some fear on both sides that such an alliance could result in a dilution of faith. But the chaos and the killing had reached such extremes that the religious concerns were set aside in the interest of raising a powerful collective voice.'b'The women prayed, yes, but they also moved outside of the churches and the mosques to demonstrate, to protest, to enlist all who would listen in the cause of peace. Working with hardly any resources, save their extraordinary will and intense desire to end the conflict, the women\xe2\x80\x99s initial efforts evolved into a movement, the Liberian Mass Action for Peace.'b'Their headquarters was an open-air fish market in the capital, Monrovia. Thousands of women responded to the call, broadcast over a Catholic radio station, to demonstrate at the market for peace. The women showed up day after day, praying, waving signs, singing, dancing, chanting and agitating for peace.'b'They called on the two sides in the conflict to begin peace talks and their calls coincided with international efforts to have the two sides sit down and begin to negotiate.'b'Nothing could stop the rallies at the market, not the fierce heat of the sun, nor drenching rainstorms, nor the publicly expressed anger of Mr. Taylor, who was embarrassed by the protests. Public support for the women grew and eventually Mr. Taylor, and soon afterward the rebel leaders, felt obliged to meet with them and hear their grievances.'b'The moral authority of this movement that seemed to have arisen from nowhere had become one of the significant factors pushing the warring sides to the peace table. Peace talks were eventually held in Accra, the capital of Ghana, and when it looked as if they were about to break down, Ms. Gbowee and nearly 200 of her followers staged a sit-in at the site of the talks, demanding that the two sides stay put until an agreement was reached.'b'A tentative peace was established, and Mr. Taylor went into exile in Nigeria. The women continued their activism. Three years ago, on Jan. 16, 2006, in an absolutely thrilling triumph for the mothers and wives and sisters and aunts and grandmothers who had worked so courageously for peace, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf was sworn in as the president of Liberia \xe2\x80\x94  the first woman ever elected president of a country in Africa.'b'Liberia is hardly the world\xe2\x80\x99s most stable society. But \xe2\x80\x9cPray the Devil Back to Hell\xe2\x80\x9d reminds us of the incredible power available to the most ordinary of people if they are willing to act with courage and unwavering commitment.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cStudy Sees an Obama Effect as Lifting Black Test-Takers\xe2\x80\x9d (news article, Jan. 23) and \xe2\x80\x9cNo More Excuses?,\xe2\x80\x9d by Charles M.
