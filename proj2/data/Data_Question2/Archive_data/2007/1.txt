b'The heavy winds that blew through the Northeast a couple of weeks ago mostly missed our place. They took only the dead boughs, which now lie scattered along the edges of the pastures like porous old bones. The farmers up here will have a lot of cleaning to do along the fencelines before they bale hay next June or they will be baling kindling. In the woods across from our house, the wind snapped off the top of a sugar maple. The crown lies jagged, uneven, on the ground, not yet weighed down by gravity or moss. It exaggerates the disorder of nature, which seems so apparent in the absence of snow this time of year.'b'Nearly every image of nature I have ever come across misses the sense of intricate confusion underfoot in the woods, the thickets of goldenrod collapsing into each other along the roadsides, the rotting tusks of fallen beeches broken against the western hillside. It almost never makes sense to talk about the purpose of nature. But now \xe2\x80\x94 until the snow comes at last \xe2\x80\x94 I could easily believe that the purpose of nature is to create edges, if only because every edge, no matter how small, is a new habitation. As purposes go, that could hardly be more different from my own, which is to reduce the number of edges here, so that the big pasture is bounded by four clean lines only, free of interruptions from sumac or knotweed or shattered maple limbs. Left to itself, nature is all interruption.'b'These are the thoughts that crowd around during the shortest days of the year, when the sky is the color of flint and the sun, when it appears, seems to have lost its candlepower. Even the feeling of dormancy \xe2\x80\x94 a harvest of rest \xe2\x80\x94 is incomplete without snow. But disorder is as much in the mind as order. I drive across the county, brooding on confusion, and come upon a towering single oak, stripped of leaves but still symmetrical, mocking the sawmill that lies across the road. The sight of that one tree is enough to banish sorrow.'b'Last night, sorting through photos I took in Kansas a couple of months ago, I found some digital snapshots of an ornate box turtle (Terrapene ornata) making its way across a gravel road. I had stopped the car and moved the turtle, in the direction it was pointed, to the other side of the road. Having written a book in the voice of a tortoise, I was of course all courtesy and did not peer closely. But last night I did look closely at the photos I took. And there is the turtle, gazing at me with a vivid orange eye, its pebbled forelimbs dotted with orange, its domed shell inscribed in an unknown cuneiform, as if to remind me that order is where you find it.'b''b'VERLYN KLINKENBORG'b''b'New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day is the simplest holiday in the calendar, a Champagne cork of a day after all the effervescence of the evening before. There is no civic agenda, no liturgical content, only the sense of something ended, something begun. It is a good day to clean the ashes out of the wood stove, to consider the possibilities of next summer\xe2\x80\x99s garden, to wonder how many weeks into the new year you will be before you marvel at how quickly 2007 is going. \xe2\x80\x9cThis will be the year ...,\xe2\x80\x9d you find yourself thinking, but before you can finish the thought you remember what all the previous years have taught you \xe2\x80\x94 that there\xe2\x80\x99s just no telling.'b'We are supposed to believe in the fresh start of a new year, and who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t love the thought of it? But we are just as likely to feel the pull of the old ways on this holiday, to acknowledge the solid comfort \xe2\x80\x94 like it or not \xe2\x80\x94 of the self we happen to have become over the years. We may not say, like Charles Lamb in 1820, that we would no more alter the shape of our lives \xe2\x80\x9cthan the incidents of some well-contrived novel.\xe2\x80\x9d But we know what he means.'b'No one has faced the prospect of New Year\xe2\x80\x99s time more honestly than Lamb. He knew that its real theme was what he called \xe2\x80\x9can intolerable disinclination to dying,\xe2\x80\x9d something he felt especially sharply in the dead of winter, awaiting the peal of bells ringing in the new year. It was an inescapable syllogism for him \xe2\x80\x94 New Year, the passing of time, the certainty of death.'b'What it forced from him was the very thing it should force from all of us \xe2\x80\x94 a renewal of our pleasure in life itself. \xe2\x80\x9cI am in love,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cwith this green earth; the face of town and country; the unspeakable rural solitudes, and the sweet security of streets.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The long history of Congressional bipartisan cooperation on environmental issues dating back to Richard Nixon has been seriously challenged only twice. The first time was in 1995, when the Gingrich Republicans swept into Washington determined to roll back environmental laws, a threat averted by President Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s veto pen and the exertions of a group of moderate Republicans. The second challenge occurred during the Congress that has now thankfully drawn to a close.'b'The Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 return to power in both houses has raised hopes that some of the old cooperative spirit can be restored and progress made on vital matters like global warming, oil dependency, national parks and threatened wetlands.'b'Environmentalists in the House will certainly have more time to work on positive legislation, since they will no longer have to play defense against Richard Pombo, the California Republican who produced a stream of destructive schemes to open up protected public lands for commercial exploitation, rescind a longstanding moratorium on offshore drilling and undermine the Endangered Species Act. Mr. Pombo has been ushered into well-deserved retirement by California voters.'b'On the Senate side, there have been striking changes in leadership. Barbara Boxer, who cares about global warming, replaces James Inhofe, who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, as head of the Environment and Public Works Committee. Jeff Bingaman, who emphasizes conservation as the appropriate response to oil dependency, replaces Pete Domenici, who tends to favor greater production of America\xe2\x80\x99s dwindling supplies of oil and natural gas, as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.'b'Although he\xe2\x80\x99ll need Mr. Domenici\xe2\x80\x99s help, Mr. Bingaman will almost certainly make a major push for new energy legislation, based on proposals that already have broad bipartisan support and would offer a menu of loans, direct subsidies and tax breaks to encourage the production of fuel-efficient cars as well as alternatives to gasoline.'b'The main legislative responsibility for shaping a national policy on warming falls to Ms. Boxer, who has promised early consideration of various measures aimed at imposing mandatory limits on carbon dioxide emissions. Absent any support whatsoever from the White House and the Republican leadership, these measures have languished for years even as the problem has grown steadily worse.'b'Our own wish list would include several other measures, all within reach. One would be to amend the Clean Air Act to require meaningful reductions in mercury from power plants, overriding the administration\xe2\x80\x99s weak regulations. Another would provide robust financing for the national parks.'b'Finally, the new Congress needs to amend the Clean Water Act to clear up the confusion caused by several court decisions involving federal protection of wetlands. It should assert, in unmistakable terms, that the act protects all the waters of the United States, large and small, permanent or seasonal, navigable or isolated.'b'Thousands of handicapped immigrants who received asylum to enter the United States are beginning the new year caught up in the immense backlog of background checks that now chokes government administration in the wake of 9/11. The glut of all cases from years past is 2.7 million and growing, according to the F.B.I., as investigators receive a weekly torrent of 67,000 new requests \xe2\x80\x94 half of them from the immigration services dealing with the normal flood of mostly healthy newcomers.'b'Congress understood the special plight of handicapped immigrants who are granted asylum and made sure they are entitled to monthly disability benefits of $603 each as they go through the citizenship process. But it turns out that more than 6,000 people, including some who are amputees or blind, have already found their benefits cut off, and tens of thousands more face a similar fate, because they exceeded the seven-year deadline Congress originally considered adequate for obtaining citizenship.'b'Lawyers for the handicapped are suing the government, pointing out that these cases increasingly are victims of the background backlog. Unless a solution is ordered, officials estimate another 46,000 will have their benefits cut off by 2012 as they become delayed in the pipeline.'b'Here is a classic problem of overstrained bureaucracy in which culpability is diffuse and the results are all too poignant. Social Security officials say that there is no way around the law\xe2\x80\x99s seven-year deadline, while background investigators are overwhelmed by security checks with no relief in sight. One solution is to flag the handicapped immigrants as special cases who don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve a loss of benefits in the crush of antiterrorist concerns. The immigration law has a host of problems to be tackled by the new Congress, and handicapped newcomers should be among the first to get some attention.'b'Paris'b'IN one of his last books, Romain Gary tells how, as a lover at 59 of a Russian woman of 20, he decided to end the relationship because of the age difference. But, deeply in love, he hesitated. In the cafe where he went to write a letter breaking off the liaison, the server asked him what he wanted. \xe2\x80\x9cJe prendrai une d\xc3\xa9cision,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, I will have a decision. As the server, philosophically, waited for him to place his proper order, he corrected himself. \xe2\x80\x9cJe prendrai une infusion,\xe2\x80\x9d I will have an  herbal tea.'b'The practice of making New Year\xe2\x80\x99s resolutions is growing rare in France, perhaps because we spread them out from January to December, a demonstration of a delicate balance between good will and willpower. Descendants of the spiritual exercises of the ancients, resolutions are both educational and therapeutic.'b'In declaring resolutions, if possible before witnesses, we nourish the illusion that changing our lifestyles will change our lives: \xe2\x80\x9cThis year, I will read Proust.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThis year, I will not invade Iraq.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThis year, I will be faithful to my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThis year, I will reduce unemployment in France.\xe2\x80\x9d Or, more prosaically, \xe2\x80\x9cI will exercise three times a week, I will finally try to stop  smoking, I will cut back on sugar,\xe2\x80\x9d etc. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sort of collective drunkenness for people to make vows that nobody expects to keep.'b'Westerners are athletes of introspection \xe2\x80\x94 we never stop analyzing ourselves. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is never too   late or too early to care for the well-being of the soul,\xe2\x80\x9d Epicurus said, and so we make our lives a study of ourselves. We need a moment in the year when we look at ourselves, weigh our good and bad habits, evaluate our conduct as a doctor evaluates our health during an annual examination, so we can strive for a way of life that is wiser and more responsible.'b'There are two types of resolutions: those that are reasonable, and those that are not. The day I took communion, when I was an adolescent and still believed in God, I would decide to be good to everyone, to smile at my family, to spread charity and goodwill. This love for my neighbors, even the ones who annoyed me, lasted two days, and then I returned to being an ordinary human, neither good nor bad, with my moods and my preferences. I could not make myself someone I was not.'b'Similarly, to declare that in 2007 we resolve to be happy is unreasonable. We can\xe2\x80\x99t determine to be happy: it is in our power to avoid certain evils, to stay away from conflict, to not bankrupt ourselves, to not throw ourselves out the window or under a train, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t order up happiness as we order a dish in a restaurant or command a dog to come at our call. Happiness eludes the rendezvous we fix, arrives when we least expect it, disappears when we think we have it in hand.'b'In other words, those people who are unhappy about not being happy forget that happiness has a knack for indirection, coming in the middle of the most ordinary day or disappearing at the height of one\xe2\x80\x99s career. It is a matter of luck, almost of grace, a visitor who enters the house unexpectedly and vanishes on tiptoe. \xe2\x80\x9cI recognize happiness by the sound it makes when it leaves,\xe2\x80\x9d said the poet Jacques Pr\xc3\xa9vert.'b'In contrast, let\xe2\x80\x99s imagine someone who sets out on Dec. 31 to ruin his life. It\xe2\x80\x99s not certain that ruin will arrive easily: it is no less difficult to destroy one\xe2\x80\x99s life than to improve it. Catastrophe is a delicate art that also requires chance. Hell is just as hard to get into as heaven.'b'If the end of the year brings a flood of resolutions to change, it is because we are faced with an existence that is invaded by the routine, by the rush of demands. We can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it. We know that another life exists, more beautiful, more passionate, one that laziness and apathy keeps us from attaining.'b'I have to break with time to overcome my obstacles, to rediscover myself, to be myself in all innocence. I can change my life, at least in some small way. Making resolutions demonstrates optimism, the desire to make oneself better, a faith, na\xc3\xafve and beautiful at once, that declarations can spontaneously become actions, that saying means doing.'b'Oh, the glorious day of making a resolution, the belief that starting tomorrow I will be the pilot of my existence, that I will stop being the plaything of external circumstances, that I will govern myself. I\xe2\x80\x99m better than I seem to be \xe2\x80\x94 a person obsessed by little irritants, addicted to talking nonsense \xe2\x80\x94 and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to prove it to the world. The certainty that soon, thanks to my willpower, I will no longer be someone who is habitually late, a slave to my cellphone, a glutton, a distracted driver... that can galvanize me, prompt me to change, tear away my imperfect personality. Real life starts now; I can immediately free myself of my neuroses, correct myself. I can rid myself of the fear of failure and of the specter of the failures of the past.'b'Knowing that you can change your behavior, even by an iota, is essential for holding yourself in esteem. We\xe2\x80\x99re often cynical about how resolutions are never kept, but we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be. Resolutions are perhaps lies, but they\xe2\x80\x99re lies of good faith, necessary illusions. As long as we can make them, we are saved, we can control the chaos of destiny; it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter that we break them and that others view us with skepticism. Every resolution is good simply because it is declared. It is a comedy, perhaps, but it keeps us sane.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the concern expressed dozens of times by New Orleans residents who are poor and black and still living in enforced exile from their wounded city: 'b'Maybe they don\xe2\x80\x99t want us back.'b''b'You hear it again and again and again, the tone of voice varying from sadness to anger to resignation, but always laced with the unmistakable pain of feeling unwelcome in one\xe2\x80\x99s own home. I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to think of it as the New Orleans lament.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey are not trying to bring us home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Geraldine Craig, who is living in a federally sponsored trailer encampment in Baton Rouge. \xe2\x80\x9cJust the opposite. They\xe2\x80\x99re telling us to find housing here.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt hurts,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mimi Adams, a woman who wore out her welcome with relatives in Houston and Atlanta but has no idea when she might return to New Orleans. \xe2\x80\x9cEven if I could find a place, the rents are too high,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve gone up a lot. I\xe2\x80\x99m told they don\xe2\x80\x99t want us poor folks back, that they\xe2\x80\x99re making it a city for the well-to-do. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Sixteen months have passed since the apocalyptic flood that followed Hurricane Katrina. More than 13,000 residents who were displaced by the storm are still living in trailers provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Another 100,000 to 200,000 evacuees \xe2\x80\x94 most of whom want to return home \xe2\x80\x94 are scattered throughout the United States.'b'The undeniable neglect of this population fuels the suspicion among the poor and the black, who constitute a majority of the evacuees, that the city is being handed over to the well-to-do and the white.'b'If you talk to public officials, you will hear about billions of dollars in aid being funneled through this program or that. The maze of bureaucratic initiatives is dizzying. But when you talk to the people most in need of help \xe2\x80\x94 the poor, the elderly, the disabled, the children \xe2\x80\x94 you will find in most cases that the help is not reaching them. There is no massive effort, no master plan, to bring back the people who were driven from the city and left destitute by Katrina.'b'Only the federal government could finance such an effort. Neither the city of New Orleans nor the state of Louisiana has anywhere near the kind of money that would be required. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of people who don\xe2\x80\x99t have a place to stay,\xe2\x80\x9d Gov. Kathleen Blanco told me in an interview on Friday, \xe2\x80\x9cand they\xe2\x80\x99re spread all over creation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The federal government has not come close to meeting the challenge of this overwhelming humanitarian crisis. Instead of a concerted, creative effort to develop housing and organize the return to New Orleans of the poor and working-class families who were the heart and soul of the city, the government focused to a large extent on rolling out travel trailers to temporarily house an embarrassingly small percentage of the people in need.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFEMA spent a lot on trailers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Governor Blanco, \xe2\x80\x9ctrailers that are falling apart right now. And they spent as much money on those trailers in many cases as you would on putting a new house in place.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The simple fact is that no one at any level of government, city, state or federal, has shown the leadership that was needed in response to this astounding tragedy. I tried to talk about this last week with the mayor of New Orleans, C. Ray Nagin, but he and his chief press aide were on vacation.'b'The most candid official I spoke with was Raymond Jetson, the chief executive of the Louisiana Family Recovery Corps, an independent, nonprofit group set up by the state in the wake of the storm.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe most daunting aspect of the recovery is the human recovery,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand at this point it has certainly not received the resources or the attention that it needs.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What was readily apparent in the aftermath of the botched rescue was the damage to the levees, the ruined homes and the city\xe2\x80\x99s devastated infrastructure. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jetson, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the reality of what was happening in the lives of people and families was as apparent.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The situation remains desperate for thousands of displaced residents. \xe2\x80\x9cWorking families are finding it difficult to re-establish their households,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Jetson said. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople who are out of state want to come back home. The clock is ticking on the people who are living in the FEMA trailer communities. You have some people who are totally isolated from resources. And the emotional well-being of a significant number of people and families is literally in peril.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is how the new year is starting out for the victims of the great flood of 2005.'b'MANY signs point to a growing historical consciousness among the American people. I trust that this is so. It is useful to remember that history is to the nation as memory is to the individual. As persons deprived of memory become disoriented and lost, not knowing where they have been and where they are going, so a nation denied a conception of the past will be disabled in dealing with its present and its future. \xe2\x80\x9cThe longer you look back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Winston Churchill, \xe2\x80\x9cthe farther you can look forward.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But all historians are prisoners of their own experience. We bring to history the preconceptions of our personalities and of our age. We cannot seize on ultimate and absolute truths. So the historian is committed to a doomed enterprise \xe2\x80\x94 the quest for an unattainable objectivity.'b'Conceptions of the past are far from stable. They are perennially revised by the urgencies of the present. When new urgencies arise in our own times and lives, the historian\xe2\x80\x99s spotlight shifts, probing at last into the darkness, throwing into sharp relief things that were always there but that earlier historians had carelessly excised from the collective memory. New voices ring out of the historical dark and demand to be heard.'b'One has only to note how in the last half-century the movements for women\xe2\x80\x99s rights and civil rights have reformulated and renewed American history. Thus the present incessantly reinvents the past. In this sense, all history, as Benedetto Croce said, is contemporary history. It is these permutations of consciousness that make history so endlessly fascinating an intellectual adventure. \xe2\x80\x9cThe one duty we owe to history,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oscar Wilde, \xe2\x80\x9cis to rewrite it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We are the world\xe2\x80\x99s dominant military power, and I believe a consciousness of history is a moral necessity for a nation possessed of overweening power. History verifies John F. Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s proposition, stated in the first year of his thousand days: \xe2\x80\x9cWe must face the fact that the United States is neither omnipotent or omniscient \xe2\x80\x94 that we are only 6 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s population; that we cannot impose our will upon the other 94 percent of mankind; that we cannot right every wrong or reverse each adversity; and therefore there cannot be an American solution to every world problem.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'History is the best antidote to delusions of omnipotence and omniscience. Self-knowledge is the indispensable prelude to self-control, for the nation as well as for the individual, and history should forever remind us of the limits of our passing perspectives. It should strengthen us to resist the pressure to convert momentary impulses into moral absolutes. It should lead us to acknowledge our profound and chastening frailty as human beings \xe2\x80\x94 to a recognition of the fact, so often and so sadly displayed, that the future outwits all our certitudes and that the possibilities of the future are more various than the human intellect is designed to conceive.'b'Sometimes, when I am particularly depressed, I ascribe our behavior to stupidity \xe2\x80\x94 the stupidity of our leadership, the stupidity of our culture. Three decades ago, we suffered defeat in an unwinnable war against tribalism, the most fanatic of political emotions, fighting against a country about which we knew nothing and in which we had no vital interests. Vietnam was hopeless enough, but to repeat the same arrogant folly 30  years later in Iraq is unforgivable. The Swedish statesman Axel Oxenstierna famously said, \xe2\x80\x9cBehold, my son, with how little wisdom the world is governed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A nation informed by a vivid understanding of the ironies of history is, I believe, best equipped to manage the tragic temptations of military power. Let us not bully our way through life, but let a growing sensitivity to history temper and civilize our use of power. In the meantime, let a thousand historical flowers bloom. History is never a closed book or a final verdict. It is forever in the making. Let historians never forsake the quest for knowledge in the interests of an ideology, a religion, a race, a nation.'b'The great strength of history in a free society is its capacity for self-correction. This is the endless excitement of historical writing \xe2\x80\x94 the search to reconstruct what went before, a quest illuminated by those ever-changing prisms that continually place old questions in a new light.'b'History is a doomed enterprise that we happily pursue because of the thrill of the hunt, because exploring the past is such fun, because of the intellectual challenges involved, because a nation needs to know its own history. Or so we historians insist. Because in the end, a nation\xe2\x80\x99s history must be both the guide and the domain not so much of its historians as its citizens.'b'The U.S. health care system is a scandal and a disgrace. But maybe, just maybe, 2007 will be the year we start the move toward universal coverage.'b'In 2005, almost 47 million Americans \xe2\x80\x94 including more than 8 million children \xe2\x80\x94 were uninsured, and many more had inadequate insurance.'b'Apologists for our system try to minimize the significance of these numbers. Many of the uninsured, asserted the 2004 Economic Report of the President, \xe2\x80\x9cremain uninsured as a matter of choice.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And then you wake up. A scathing article in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Los Angeles Times described how insurers refuse to cover anyone with even the slightest hint of a pre-existing condition. People have been denied insurance for reasons that range from childhood asthma to a \xe2\x80\x9cpast bout of jock itch.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some say that we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford universal health care, even though every year lack of insurance plunges millions of Americans into severe financial distress and sends thousands to an early grave. But every other advanced country somehow manages to provide all its citizens with essential care. The only reason universal coverage seems hard to achieve here is the spectacular inefficiency of the U.S. health care system.'b'Americans spend more on health care per person than anyone else \xe2\x80\x94 almost twice as much as the French, whose medical care is among the best in the world. Yet we have the highest infant mortality and close to the lowest life expectancy of any wealthy nation. How do we do it?'b'Part of the answer is that our fragmented system has much higher administrative costs than the straightforward government insurance systems prevalent in the rest of the advanced world. As Anna Bernasek pointed out in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s New York Times, besides the overhead of private insurance companies, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s an enormous amount of paperwork required of American doctors and hospitals that simply doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist in countries like Canada or Britain.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In addition, insurers often refuse to pay for preventive care, even though such care saves a lot of money in the long run, because those long-run savings won\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily redound to their benefit. And the fragmentation of the American system explains why we lag far behind other nations in the use of electronic medical records, which both reduce costs and save lives by preventing many medical errors.'b'The truth is that we can afford to cover the uninsured. What we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford is to keep going without a universal health care system.'b'If it were up to me, we\xe2\x80\x99d have a Medicare-like system for everyone, paid for by a dedicated tax that for most people would be less than they or their employers currently pay in insurance premiums. This would, at a stroke, cover the uninsured, greatly reduce administrative costs and make it much easier to work on preventive care.'b'Such a system would leave people with the right to choose their own doctors, and with other choices as well: Medicare currently lets people apply their benefits to H.M.O.\xe2\x80\x99s run by private insurance companies, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why similar options shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be available in a system of Medicare for all. But everyone would be in the system, one way or another.'b'Can we get there from here? Health care reform is in the air. Democrats in Congress are talking about providing health insurance to all children. John Edwards began his presidential campaign with a call for universal health care.'b'And there\xe2\x80\x99s real action at the state level. Inspired by the Massachusetts plan to cover all its uninsured residents, politicians in other states are talking about adopting similar plans. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon has introduced a Massachusetts-type plan for the nation as a whole.'b'But now is the time to warn against plans that try to cover the uninsured without taking on the fundamental sources of our health system\xe2\x80\x99s inefficiency. What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with both the Massachusetts plan and Senator Wyden\xe2\x80\x99s plan is that they don\xe2\x80\x99t operate like Medicare; instead, they funnel the money through private insurance companies.'b'Everyone knows why: would-be reformers are trying to avoid too strong a backlash from the insurance industry and other players who profit from our current system\xe2\x80\x99s irrationality.'b'But look at what happened to Bill Clinton.

Every year, according to the World Tourism Organization, some 700  million people leave for foreign lands. They spend more than $575 billion, making tourism the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading item of foreign trade.'b'Fifteen million of those travelers, mainly from North America, head for the Caribbean, which is by far the most tourist dependent region of the world. On smaller islands like St. Lucia, tourism\xe2\x80\x99s contribution to the economy exceeds 70 percent, and the annual number of visitors far exceeds the resident population: Antigua\xe2\x80\x99s 64,000 residents put out the welcome mat for 231,000 visitors one recent year.'b'Why do the tourists come? Most analysts cite the three S\xe2\x80\x99s: Sun, Sand and Sea. Others add a fourth: Sex.  The sex part is gender neutral, as a stroll though Ocho Rios immediately confirms. Wickedly handsome young men with flowing dreadlocks, some dyed blond, provide rent-a-dread services for women of every nationality. For most, it is a four-day fling; for a few, there is the hope that life will imitate art and, like Stella, they\xe2\x80\x99ll get their groove back.'b'What do the islands gain? Tourism generates desperately needed foreign revenue for the government, creates employment (as high as 60 percent of the jobs in the Bahamas), and makes possible a wide range of support services and industries. For many of the smaller islands, it is a godsend, especially in the face of the collapsing traditional banana and sugar industries.'b'Nonetheless, the literature on Caribbean tourism is surprisingly critical. Foreign anthropologists complain about the \xe2\x80\x9ctourist gaze\xe2\x80\x9d and the distortion of local cultures; local chauvinists declaim that \xe2\x80\x9ctourism is whorism.\xe2\x80\x9d These criticisms are largely puerile. In Jamaica, it\xe2\x80\x99s the locals who do the gazing while the tourists are busy baking themselves behind the high walls of all-inclusive hotels. If anything, tourism enhances residents\xe2\x80\x99 awareness of indigenous cultures,  and it supports large numbers of entertainers. Reggae artists have no problem singing dated versions of Harry Belafonte\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cDay-oh! Day da light an\xe2\x80\x99 me wan\xe2\x80\x99 go \xe2\x80\x99ome\xe2\x80\x9d if it allows them to get nasty and ragamuffin the next night in the thriving dance hall music culture.'b'The criticisms of economists seem more substantial. The two buzzwords are linkages and leakages. On most islands, most of the money spent by tourists leaks right back out of the country to pay for supplies for the tourists, or for the repatriation of profits and salaries. Thus there is little linkage, or integration, with the rest of the economy, leaving the islands solely dependent on a fickle industry. Leakage runs as high as 80 percent on the smaller islands.'b'Here is the critics\xe2\x80\x99 problem: The islands with the highest leakage and tourist dependence are all doing better, per capita, than the larger islands with more integrated economies. The Bahamas and Antigua have almost no unemployment and per-capita incomes three times that of Jamaica. And  these islands have substantially higher human development indexes,  the gold standard of how well a country is meeting a broad range of basic needs. Barbados\xe2\x80\x99s index of .864 approaches European levels.'b'The main cost of tourism is its effects on the environment. The disposal of solid waste from cruise ships and the poor treatment of hotel sewage threaten marine fauna, and degrade coral reefs and fishing grounds. Water sports are a menace. Beaches are eroded and landscape violated by bad architectural planning. Noise pollution is often unbearable. Corrective efforts have had limited success.'b'However, the industry is too often criticized for the wrong reasons. In Jamaica, tourism is booming, and 2007 promises to be the industry\xe2\x80\x99s best year. Most American tourists go to the all-inclusives, which are criticized for greedily gating them off from the rest of the local economy. The real situation is more complex, as explained by Dr. Noel Lyon, a Harvard-trained economist and entrepreneur experienced in both farming and tourism.'b'Jamaica has terrible crime rates, but that has little effect on tourism because travelers know they are safe inside the all-inclusives. Furthermore, the all-inclusives draw substantially on local suppliers. Over all, Jamaica, with a high ratio of local ownership and management, has relatively lower leakage. All-inclusives are actually a nimble adaptation to a volatile social environment. Jamaica\xe2\x80\x99s socioeconomic failures cannot be linked to tourism, without which it would be in even more dire straits.'b'Crawford, Colo.'b'A FEW years back, while traveling in the Sierra Madre Occidental of northern Mexico, I came upon a canyon packed with cliff dwellings no one had lived in since before the time of Christopher Columbus. On the ground were discarded artifacts, pieces of frayed baskets, broken pottery and hundreds of desiccated corn cobs \xe2\x80\x94 the ruins of an ancient civilization.'b'I reached down to pick up what I thought was a dry gourd, and instead found myself cradling the skull of a human child. As I turned it in my hands, I noticed a deliberate hole in the back of the skull, directly above the spine. The skull was not cracked around the hole, which means the child had most likely been alive when a spike or some other implement had been slammed into his or her head from behind.'b'This is not the only skull like this. Excavations from elsewhere in northern Mexico have turned up other children killed the same way, human sacrifices to an ancient water deity, their bodies buried under pre-Columbian ball courts or at the foot of pillars in important rooms.'b'With knowledge of such widespread ferocity, I recently saw Mel Gibson\xe2\x80\x99s movie \xe2\x80\x9cApocalypto,\xe2\x80\x9d which deals with the gore of the Mayan civilization. I had heard that the movie\xe2\x80\x99s violence was wildly out of control. But even as I winced at many of the scenes, as a writer and researcher in ancient American archaeology, I found little technical fault with the film other than ridiculous Hollywood ploys and niggling archaeological details.'b'Indeed, parts of the archaeological record of the Americas read like a war-crimes indictment, with charred skeletons stacked like cordwood and innumerable human remains missing heads, legs and arms. In the American Southwest, which is my area of research, human tissue has been found cooked to the insides of kitchen jars and stained into a ceramic serving ladle. A grinding stone was found full of crushed human finger bones. A sample of human feces came up containing the remains of a cannibal\xe2\x80\x99s meal.'b'It could be argued that \xe2\x80\x9cApocalypto\xe2\x80\x9d dehumanizes Native Americans, turning their ancestors into savage monsters, but I think it does the opposite. Oppressed hunter-gatherers in the movie are presented as people with the same, universal emotions all humans share. And urban Mayans are portrayed as politically and religiously savvy, having made of themselves a monumental, Neolithic empire, something more akin to ancient Egypt than the trouble-free agrarians who come to most people\xe2\x80\x99s minds when they think of native America.'b'To further shatter that popular notion of Native Americans, there\xe2\x80\x99s the scene in which a turquoise-jeweled priest stands atop a staggering temple yanking out one beating human heart after the next. That\xe2\x80\x99s an image that nearly every archaeologist working in Central America has played in his or her head many times, only now it\xe2\x80\x99s on the big screen for everyone to see.'b'Being told by screenwriters and archaeologists that their ancestors engaged in death cults tends to make many Native Americans uneasy. In Arizona, Hopi elders turn their eyes to the ground when they hear about their own past stained with overt brutality. The name Hopi means people of peace, which is what they strive to be. Meanwhile, excavators keep digging up evidence of cannibalism and ritualized violence among their ancestors.'b'How do we rectify the age-old perception of noble and peaceful native America with the reality that at times violence was coordinated on a scale never before witnessed by humanity? The answer is simple. We don\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'Prior to 1492 it was a complex cultural landscape with civilization ebbing and flowing, the spaces in between traversed by ancient lineages of hunters and gatherers. To the religious core of pre-Columbian Mayans, a beating heart ripped from someone\xe2\x80\x99s chest was a thing of supreme sacredness and not prosaic violence.'b'If \xe2\x80\x9cApocalypto\xe2\x80\x9d has a fault, it is not with its brutality, but with us in the audience who cringe, thinking the Mayans little more than a barbaric people. The fault lies in our misunderstanding of a complicated history, thinking we can lump a whole civilization into a single response and walk out of the movie saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThat was disgusting.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To the Editor:'b'I was heartened by \xe2\x80\x9cNo Sanctuary\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Dec. 23), in which you urge long-overdue action on Sudan.'b'Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s sending United Nations peacekeepers into Darfur; freezing the assets of all Sudanese officials involved in the genocide; imposing a no-flight zone over Darfur; or using all three measures, we can no longer remain innocent bystanders to genocide.'b'(Rabbi) H.

By amending this law and, at the same time, encouraging the development of domestic coastal shipping, Congress could help restore America\xe2\x80\x99s status as a great and proud maritime nation.'b'The slump in American shipping is especially surprising when you consider that it was American entrepreneurs who, in the mid-20th century, revolutionized oceanic transport by creating both the standard-size steel shipping container and the supership capable of transporting 50 times as much cargo as a World War II-era merchant ship could.'b'Shipping has always been the most economically efficient way to carry goods from place to place; it requires no investment in highways or rails, and thanks to the relatively frictionless ease with which ships move across water, fuel costs per ton are low. The arrival of containerized shipping pushed transport costs even lower, swelling world trade and expanding global wealth.'b'The export-driven economies of Pacific Asia built much of their enormous success upon the new maritime technologies. The United States did not. The Merchant Marine Acts of the 1920s and \xe2\x80\x9930s are one reason why.'b'Intended to protect the domestic shipbuilding industry, the acts decreed that the only ships allowed to call on two or more consecutive American ports would be those built in the United States, owned by American companies, flying the American flag and operated by American crews.'b'At the time, the United States still had a large merchant marine. But the acts\xe2\x80\x99 restrictions handicapped coastal shipping within American waters, opening the way for the growth of the trucking and freight-rail industries.'b'To revive the maritime trade, Congress should give shipping companies as much choice in buying ships as their land-based rivals have when buying trucks and train cars.'b'Freed from the restraints of the Merchant Marine Acts, commercial shippers could not only begin to resume their position in global trade but also handle much more of the freight that moves within our borders. Before railroads and highways were developed, a network of water transportation routes connected America\xe2\x80\x99s port cities and towns. Today coastal shipping handles only 2 percent of domestic freight, even though coastal counties hold more than half of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s population.'b'The trucks that carry nearly a third of our cargo clog the highways. That is one reason why Americans now lose at least 3.7 billion hours and 2.3 billion gallons of fuel each year sitting in traffic. Ships could take on a larger share of this freight \xe2\x80\x94 and even some of the passengers now traveling by highway and rail \xe2\x80\x94 and carry it at lower cost.'b'Congress could further encourage domestic shipping by improving port facilities, just as it maintains interstate highways. And it could invest in developing ship propulsion technologies \xe2\x80\x94 to increase still further maritime savings in fuel costs and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.'b'Americans are rightfully concerned about security, but part of protecting the nation is generating a strong economy. Revitalized coastal shipping could shorten our morning commutes as it begins to rejuvenate America\xe2\x80\x99s wider maritime economy.'b''b'\n'b''b'\n'b''b'The old year was certainly a boom one for American business, with record profits for companies and record bonuses on Wall Street. But in the background a major accounting scandal has quietly spread, now encompassing more than 120 companies. Fudging the grant date for stock options doesn\xe2\x80\x99t quite have the spotlight-grabbing immediacy of Enron\xe2\x80\x99s collapse, but it is still gaming the system at the expense of shareholders.'b'A study sponsored by Harvard Law School suggests that a large number of board members, instead of watching out for self-enriching tricks, were sharing in the lucre. As Eric Dash reported in The Times recently, the study found that board members at roughly 460 companies, around 1,400 outside directors, likely received stock options that were manipulated, unnaturally boosting their value. In other words, many directors saw their stock holdings goosed along with executives\xe2\x80\x99. So much for independent oversight.'b'What is particularly disturbing is that the news of this malfeasance, far from leading to full-throated calls for investigation and punishment, has coincided with a broad-based effort from business advocates to roll back the stiffer regime of enforcement devised in the wake of Enron and WorldCom.'b'There is no legislative push to loosen laws and reverse rule changes precisely because there is little support for it among voters at a time when executive pay is skyrocketing and traders are bemoaning the fact that the Ferrari dealer is fresh out of quarter-million-dollar cars.'b'Some logical tweaks were needed. The Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s prosecution tactics in corporate cases had become a little too aggressive, and small companies deserved a break on requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley law \xe2\x80\x94 a reform inspired by the malfeasance of large, complicated companies. But the relaxation of a few miscalibrated, onerous provisions is where this effort should end.'b'Steilacoom, Wash.'b'TWO weeks ago, President Bush called for a long-term plan to increase the size of the armed forces. As our leaders consider various options for carrying out Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s vision, one issue likely to generate fierce debate is \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d the policy that bars openly gay service members from the military. Indeed, leaders in the new Congress are planning to re-introduce a bill to repeal the policy next year.'b'As was the case in 1993 \xe2\x80\x94 the last time the American people thoroughly debated the question of whether openly gay men and lesbians should serve in the military \xe2\x80\x94 the issue will give rise to passionate feelings on both sides. The debate must be conducted with sensitivity, but it must also consider the evidence that has emerged over the last 14 years.'b'When I was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I supported the current policy because I believed that implementing a change in the rules at that time would have been too burdensome for our troops and commanders. I still believe that to have been true. The concern among many in the military was that given the longstanding view that homosexuality was incompatible with service, letting people who were openly gay serve would lower morale, harm recruitment and undermine unit cohesion.'b'In the early 1990s, large numbers of military personnel were opposed to letting openly gay men and lesbians serve. President Bill Clinton, who promised to lift the ban during his campaign, was overwhelmed by the strength of the opposition, which threatened to overturn any executive action he might take. The compromise that came to be known as \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d was thus a useful speed bump that allowed temperatures to cool for a period of time while the culture continued to evolve.'b'The question before us now is whether enough time has gone by to give this policy serious reconsideration. Much evidence suggests that it has.'b'Last year I held a number of meetings with gay soldiers and marines, including some with combat experience in Iraq, and an openly gay senior sailor who was serving effectively as a member of a nuclear submarine crew. These conversations showed me just how much the military has changed, and that gays and lesbians can be accepted by their peers.'b'This perception is supported by a new Zogby poll of more than 500 service members returning from Afghanistan and Iraq, three quarters of whom said they were comfortable interacting with gay people. And 24 foreign nations, including Israel, Britain and other allies in the fight against terrorism, let gays serve openly, with none reporting morale or recruitment problems.'b'I now believe that if gay men and lesbians served openly in the United States military, they would not undermine the efficacy of the armed forces. Our military has been stretched thin by our deployments in the Middle East, and we must welcome the service of any American who is willing and able to do the job.'b'But if America is ready for a military policy of nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation, the timing of the change should be carefully considered. As the 110th Congress opens for business, some of its most urgent priorities, like developing a more effective strategy in Iraq, share widespread support that spans political affiliations. Addressing such issues could help heal the divisions that cleave our country. Fighting early in this Congress to lift the ban on openly gay service members is not likely to add to that healing, and it risks alienating people whose support is needed to get this country on the right track.'b'By taking a measured, prudent approach to change, political and military leaders can focus on solving the nation\xe2\x80\x99s most pressing problems while remaining genuinely open to the eventual and inevitable lifting of the ban. When that day comes, gay men and lesbians will no longer have to conceal who they are, and the military will no longer need to sacrifice those whose service it cannot afford to lose.'b'When Paul Wolfowitz speaks publicly these days, he is usually making good sense. The head of the World Bank (formerly No. 2 at the Pentagon) has criticized Chinese banks for ignoring environmental and human rights standards when they lend to Africa, told the White House it needs to do more to alleviate African poverty,  and has vowed that corrupt officials won\xe2\x80\x99t be allowed to siphon off money from projects that are supposed to benefit the poor.'b'So why do so many people at the bank mistrust him \xe2\x80\x94 including many of the leading shareholders? At last fall\xe2\x80\x99s annual meeting, European ministers insisted that the bank\xe2\x80\x99s board would oversee  Mr. Wolfowitz\xe2\x80\x99s anticorruption program,  to ensure that no country was punished arbitrarily.'b'That is not a vote of confidence and not a healthy state of affairs. Mr. Wolfowitz needs to figure out how to earn more than just the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s trust.'b'Some of his critics will never forgive him for championing the disastrous Iraq war. But he has compounded their suspicions, surrounding himself with a tight group of former Bush administration officials who \xe2\x80\x94 true to their roots \xe2\x80\x94 have little patience for explaining themselves and even less for criticism.'b'Mr. Wolfowitz and his aides did an especially poor job explaining their decisions to suspend or delay hundreds of millions of dollars in loans because of alleged corruption, feeding fears that they were settling scores. When Hilary Benn, Britain\xe2\x80\x99s top aid official, publicly questioned bank policies,  an unidentified senior bank official dismissed Mr. Benn to The Financial Times as \xe2\x80\x9can ambitious political climber.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s no way to win friends or donors. Mr. Wolfowitz wrote to the paper to say that was not his view and has since visited London to patch things up, but relations remain cool.'b'Mr. Wolfowitz has yet to outline a broader vision for the bank, which might inspire his staff and rally international support. There are certainly a host of issues that need his leadership. The bank needs to give more of a voice to less wealthy and poor countries. It needs to find new ways to mobilize private sector financing. And it needs to get more deeply \xe2\x80\x94 and more systematically \xe2\x80\x94 involved in addressing global challenges like epidemics, sustainable energy and post-conflict reconstruction.'b'Mr. Wolfowitz deserves praise for championing debt relief for the world\xe2\x80\x99s poorest countries. And he is right that the bank needs to do a lot more to fight corruption, which can cripple any development effort.  To be heard on these subjects, Mr. Wolfowitz will have to work harder to earn the trust of his staff, his shareholders and everyone who cares about development. He needs a more inclusive management style and a more diplomatic inner circle, and to articulate broader goals beyond stopping corruption. That way he would have the credibility to fight the good fight.'b'Nothing in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Jungle\xe2\x80\x9d sticks with the reader quite like what went into the sausages. There was the rotting ham that could no longer be sold as ham. There were the rat droppings, rat poison and whole poisoned rats. Most chilling, there were the unnamed things \xe2\x80\x9cin comparison with which a poisoned rat was a tidbit.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Upton Sinclair wrote \xe2\x80\x9cThe Jungle\xe2\x80\x9d as a labor expos\xc3\xa9. He hoped that the book, which was billed as \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98Uncle Tom\xe2\x80\x99s Cabin\xe2\x80\x99 of wage slavery,\xe2\x80\x9d would lead to improvements for the people to whom he dedicated it, \xe2\x80\x9cthe workingmen of America.\xe2\x80\x9d But readers of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Jungle\xe2\x80\x9d were less appalled by Sinclair\xe2\x80\x99s accounts of horrific working conditions than by what they learned about their food. \xe2\x80\x9cI aimed at the public\xe2\x80\x99s heart,\xe2\x80\x9d he famously declared, \xe2\x80\x9cand by accident I hit it in the stomach.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Jungle,\xe2\x80\x9d and the campaign that Sinclair waged after its publication, led directly to passage of a landmark federal food safety law, which took effect 100 years ago this week. Sinclair awakened a nation not just to the dangers in the food supply, but to the central role government has to play in keeping it safe. But as the poisonings of spinach eaters and Taco Bell customers recently made clear, the battle is far from over \xe2\x80\x94 and in recent years, we have been moving in the wrong direction.'b'When \xe2\x80\x9cThe Jungle\xe2\x80\x9d was published, the public reaction was instantaneous. Outraged readers deluged President Theodore Roosevelt with letters. Roosevelt was ambivalent, but he invited Sinclair to the White House for lunch, and promised to send his labor commissioner and assistant Treasury secretary to Chicago to investigate.'b'Sinclair settled into a New York City hotel and started a publicity campaign. He wrote articles with titles like \xe2\x80\x9cCampaign Against the Wholesale Poisoners of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s Food,\xe2\x80\x9d and released more stomach-churning details. Armour made its potted hams, he charged, by taking nubs of smoked beef, \xe2\x80\x9cmoldy and full of maggots,\xe2\x80\x9d and grinding them with ham trimmings. In a newspaper letter to the editor, he dared J. Ogden Armour, the meatpacking magnate, to sue for libel.'b'Sinclair suspected Roosevelt\xe2\x80\x99s team would do a whitewash. But its report strongly reinforced the allegations of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Jungle.\xe2\x80\x9d It included an array of Sinclarian images, like workers using privies without soap or toilet paper and returning \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly from these places to plunge their unwashed hands into the meat.\xe2\x80\x9d Popular outrage continued to grow, and the momentum for reform became unstoppable.'b'As a result of Sinclair\xe2\x80\x99s crusade, Congress passed the Food and Drug Act, which had been effectively blocked by industry. At the start of 1907, it became a federal crime to sell adulterated food or drugs, and the new law set up a system of federal inspections. Food had to be labeled, and it was illegal to misstate the contents. Future laws would expand on this newly declared government responsibility to ensure the safety of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s food supply.'b'In recent years, the momentum has shifted. Since the Reagan era, conservatives have tried to turn \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment regulation\xe2\x80\x9d into an epithet. Books like \xe2\x80\x9cThe Death of Common Sense,\xe2\x80\x9d a 1990\xe2\x80\x99s best-seller, have twisted the facts to argue that laws like a New York ordinance requiring restaurants to clean dishes in a way that kills salmonella are somehow an infringement on liberty.'b'Food safety has been particularly hard-hit by this anti-regulatory climate. Harmful bacteria are rampant in meatpacking plants and in produce fields, but government oversight is eroding. The Bush administration has slashed the number of Food and Drug Administration inspectors, and it has installed a former lobbyist for the cattle industry as the Agriculture Department\xe2\x80\x99s chief of staff.'b'But this is an unusually promising moment for food safety. Wide media attention was given to last fall\xe2\x80\x99s spinach contamination, which killed three and injured more than 200 in 26 states, and to the Taco Bell food poisonings, which made dozens of people ill. And Democrats have recaptured  Congress, which should  hold hearings to get to the bottom of those recent food disasters and to explore what the next ones are likely to be. It should push for larger budgets for food inspections and, as one Democratic-sponsored bill calls for, create a single federal agency with responsibility for food safety.'b'The powerful meat and produce industries can be counted on to call on their allies in Congress and the White House for help in resisting. That would come as no surprise to Sinclair, who was already complaining loudly in 1906 that Armour &amp; Co. had contributed $50,000 to the Republican Party, and that the meatpackers had hired a prominent government official \xe2\x80\x9cas confidential adviser as to federal inspection problems.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The answer, Sinclair believed, was always the same: providing the American people with the gritty truth that they needed to protect themselves. \xe2\x80\x9cThe source and fountain-head of genuine reform in this matter,\xe2\x80\x9d Sinclair insisted, \xe2\x80\x9cis an enlightened public opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cBumping in Schools\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Dec. 27):'b'As a veteran teacher in private schools, I was delighted when the school district in Philadelphia negotiated to allow some schools to practice on-site selection of teachers instead of the seniority placement system described in your editorial.'b'What had kept me out of public urban education was the prospect of teaching at a school whose faculty and administration were not reform-minded.

Mr. Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat, has served for 30 years; Mr. Oxley, an Ohio Republican, for 26 \xe2\x80\x94 and their main legacy will be their joint attack on corporate corruption, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.'b'The act, which was passed hastily in the wake of the Enron scandal, was surely well intentioned. But it has proven counterproductive in the extreme, and Congress would best honor the departing lawmakers by repealing it.'b'Sarbanes-Oxley has seriously harmed American corporations and financial markets without increasing investor confidence. The section of the law requiring companies to perform internal audits has turned out to be far more costly than proponents projected, especially for smaller firms. These costs have led some small companies to go private, hardly a victory for public oversight, and some foreign firms to withdraw their stocks from American exchanges.'b'In addition, the average \xe2\x80\x9clisting premium\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the benefit that companies receive by listing their stocks on American exchanges \xe2\x80\x94 has declined by 19 percentage points since 2002. This explains why the percentage of worldwide initial public offerings on our exchanges dropped to 5 percent last year, from 50 percent in 2000.'b'Other costs associated with the act may turn out to be more important. For example, more stringent financial regulations and increased penalties for accounting errors may make senior managers too risk-averse. Most chief executives are not accountants, so the requirement that they personally affirm audits and accounts \xe2\x80\x94 at the risk of jail time should anything be amiss \xe2\x80\x94 may make them reluctant to partake in perfectly legitimate activities.'b'Paradoxically, Sarbanes-Oxley\xe2\x80\x99s strict rules on oversight by boards of directors would have been insufficient to prevent the collapse of Enron. By the act\xe2\x80\x99s standards, Enron had a model board; most members were distinguished professionals. The chairman of the audit committee was a former accounting professor and dean of the Stanford Business School.'b'Nor would the act\xe2\x80\x99s provisions to create a stronger Securities and Exchange Commission have made a difference. The commission had been aware of Enron\xe2\x80\x99s accounting techniques since 1992 and had never thought to question them.'b'Nor was Sarbanes-Oxley necessary in prosecuting the senior managers of Enron, WorldCom and other corporations where fraud was committed \xe2\x80\x94 all have been convicted of accounting fraud under laws predating the act.'b'The negative repercussions of the act on businesses might have been worth it if the act had achieved its primary goal: substantially increasing the confidence of investors in the accuracy of the accounts of firms listed on the exchanges. But that does not seem to have happened.'b'The best measure of investor confidence is the price-earnings ratio \xe2\x80\x94 the price that investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company\xe2\x80\x99s reported earnings. The overall price-earnings ratio for the Standard &amp; Poor\xe2\x80\x99s 500-stock index, however, has declined continuously since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was being drafted in the spring of 2002.'b'Several leaders of the new Democratic Congressional majority have endorsed a relaxation of the audit requirements and other parts of the act. That is encouraging, but it is not enough. The basic structure of Sarbanes-Oxley is unsound.'b'One big problem is that the act nationalized the rules for corporate governance, reducing the value of the competition among the states for setting such rules. In addition, the act failed to resolve the major conflict of interest created when auditing firms are paid by the companies they audit. Rather than creating a regulation to change the system, Sarbanes-Oxley created an expensive and arguably unconstitutional new regulatory agency to regulate the audit firms\xe2\x80\x99 activities.'b'And, as is too often the case, Congress has rewarded the failures of the very bureaucracies that failed to keep up with Enron \xe2\x80\x94 doubling the budget of the Securities and Exchange Commission.'b'Tinkering is not enough. Sarbanes-Oxley continues to discourage smaller companies from trading publicly and foreign companies from listing their stocks on American exchanges. In the eyes of investors, it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t cleaned up any corruption, it has only forced companies to jump through hoops. As Senator Sarbanes and Representative Oxley drift into retirement, their act should retire with them.'b'Bad habits can be hard to break. So it\xe2\x80\x99s great news that Wal-Mart is putting its considerable heft behind one of the easiest ways to reduce energy consumption and the production of global-warming gases: the corkscrew-shaped light bulbs of the future.'b'Light bulbs don\xe2\x80\x99t have tailpipes to remind us that their use adds to pollution. But more than half of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s electricity comes from coal-burning plants. Switching from familiar bulbs to longer-lasting, energy-saving compact fluorescent lamps makes sense economically and environmentally.'b'As Michael Barbaro reported in The Times yesterday,  Wal-Mart is pushing to sell 100 million compact fluorescents a year. Because they use 75 percent less electricity, that would save customers $3 billion on their electricity bills and save the world from 20 million metric tons of greenhouse gases.'b'But it will also take a lot of work to persuade consumers to make the change. There\xe2\x80\x99s the strange shape and the general lack of familiarity, of course, but probably the biggest impediment is that while the bulbs are cheaper to use, they cost more to buy. Compact fluorescents are often eight times more expensive, but each one saves consumers $30 over its lifespan because they last longer and use less electricity. It\xe2\x80\x99s a quirk of our human brains that people generally have a hard time paying more for something today even if it\xe2\x80\x99s a better deal in the long run. That will take some work to overcome.'b'The poorest consumers \xe2\x80\x94 those who are behind on their bills and living paycheck to paycheck \xe2\x80\x94  may not be able to absorb the extra cost upfront. Every effort should be made to get the bulbs for those who need them most, including expanding programs to distribute them to recipients of energy-assistance programs for the poor.'b'A year after Russia put the gas squeeze on Ukraine, it was Belarus\xe2\x80\x99s turn. Unlike Ukraine, Belarus blinked two minutes before the Jan. 1 deadline and Russia had its booty: a 50 percent share of Belarus\xe2\x80\x99s pipeline network and a more than doubling of the price Belarus will now pay for Russian gas.'b'There was no global outcry this time. President Aleksandr Lukashenko, the utterly Soviet boss of Belarus, has no friends in the West. But this latest squeeze is another warning that the Kremlin will let nothing \xe2\x80\x94 personal loyalty, contracts, the law \xe2\x80\x94 halt its drive to reimpose state control on Russia\xe2\x80\x99s energy sector. It is also another reminder that the West, a big consumer of Russian energy, remains vulnerable to President Vladimir Putin\xe2\x80\x99s whims.'b'The Belarus deal came less than two weeks after Royal Dutch Shell gave in to the Kremlin\xe2\x80\x99s pressure and sold a controlling share in the Sakhalin-2 oil and gas project to Gazprom, Russia\xe2\x80\x99s state gas monopoly. Moscow is now leaning on the British-Russian joint venture, TNK-BP, to give Gazprom a large and possibly controlling stake.'b'A year ago, when the democratic revolutions in Georgia and Ukraine were seen as serious threats to the Kremlin\xe2\x80\x99s influence, Mr. Putin was eager to prop up Mr. Lukashenko. But once Mr. Lukashenko successfully stole the March presidential election, the new gas bill arrived in Minsk. That included half ownership for the Kremlin of Beltransgaz, the state pipeline operator that not only fuels Belarus but also supplies a fifth of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s gas.'b'Russia\xe2\x80\x99s European customers could increase their leverage \xe2\x80\x94  and possibly improve the Kremlin\xe2\x80\x99s behavior \xe2\x80\x94 if they negotiated jointly with Gazprom, rather than scurrying to cut separate deals. Western companies and governments also need to warn Moscow that its leverage has limits. Russia will need the expertise and capital of foreign companies if it wants to keep developing its natural resources. No one wants to do business with a bully.'b'The mood at Eliot Spitzer\xe2\x80\x99s Jan. 1 inauguration was exuberant, and that was hardly surprising. Few politicians are offered the opportunity that greets Mr. Spitzer as he becomes New York\xe2\x80\x99s 54th governor.'b'Mr. Spitzer, who has built his career on reform, is arriving in a state capital that desperately needs it. The comptroller was forced to resign after pleading guilty to a felony. The Senate majority leader is being investigated by the F.B.I. for his outside consulting work. Another state senator is charged with stealing state money, and it took a state judge to force legislators to reveal how they spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year in taxpayer money.'b'New York\xe2\x80\x99s government has slipped from a beacon for other states into a cautionary tale. So when Mr. Spitzer spoke of change in his inaugural address \xe2\x80\x94 an end to government \xe2\x80\x9cthat works for those who hold office, not those who put them there\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 he hit precisely the right note. With a passion and energy that Albany has not seen in years, this governor has promised to wake what he has labeled the \xe2\x80\x9cRip van Winkle\xe2\x80\x9d government of the last decade.'b'Mr. Spitzer started on the right foot by issuing five executive orders to upgrade the ethics of the executive branch with rules that should go without saying, but in Albany never do \xe2\x80\x94 like not using state property or personnel for personal use, and not taking gifts from people who do business with the state.'b'By cleaning his own house first, Mr. Spitzer will have the moral high ground as he does battle to get New York\xe2\x80\x99s recalcitrant lawmakers to do the same. After years of mostly dozing off, they require a long list: redistricting reform, campaign finance reform, ethics reform, and budget reform, including more sunlight on how $114 billion a year is being spent.'b'Getting reform through the Legislature will be hard enough, but Mr. Spitzer faces equally tough challenges in dealing with budget deficits and education needs and keeping the state\xe2\x80\x99s high taxes in check. In his inaugural address, he pointedly said that he does not believe in \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment as a heavy hand that can cure all our ills,\xe2\x80\x9d a sign that some of his Democratic allies might not have as much clout as they are expecting.'b'Mr. Spitzer began setting his new tone on day one, with his \xe2\x80\x9cpeople\xe2\x80\x99s inauguration.\xe2\x80\x9d The official swearing-in was outdoors, public invited. He threw open the governor\xe2\x80\x99s mansion for the first time since most people waiting in line could remember. Instead of a fancy ball for fat-cat contributors, he spent the night of his inauguration at a free concert by James Taylor and other crowd favorites.'b'For the first time in years, we see a figure poised to rattle Albany\xe2\x80\x99s do-little establishment, to air out a dark, closed government and to try to convert New York\xe2\x80\x99s Legislature to the higher purposes of public service. New Yorkers can only hope Mr. Spitzer makes it all happen.'b'San Francisco'b'WHEN releasing last week\xe2\x80\x99s Monitoring the Future survey on drug use, John P. Walters, the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, boasted that \xe2\x80\x9cbroad\xe2\x80\x9d declines in teenage drug use promise \xe2\x80\x9cenormous beneficial consequences not only for our children now, but for the rest of their lives.\xe2\x80\x9d Actually, anybody who has looked carefully at the report and other recent federal studies would see a dramatically different picture: skyrocketing illicit drug abuse and related deaths among teenagers and adults alike.'b'While Monitoring the Future, an annual study that depends on teenagers to self-report on their behavior, showed that drug use dropped sharply in the last decade, the National Center for Health Statistics has reported that teenage deaths from illicit drug abuse have tripled over the same period. This reverses 25 years of declining overdose fatalities among youths, suggesting that teenagers are now joining older generations in increased drug use.'b'What the Monitoring the Future report does have right is that teenagers remain the least part of America\xe2\x80\x99s burgeoning drug abuse crisis. Today, after 20 years, hundreds of billions of dollars, and millions of arrests and imprisonments in the war on drugs, America\xe2\x80\x99s rate of drug-related deaths, hospital emergencies, crime and social ills stand at record highs.'b'According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of Americans dying from the abuse of illegal drugs has leaped by 400 percent in the last two decades, reaching a record 28,000 in 2004. The F.B.I. reported that drug arrests reached an all-time high of 1.8 million in 2005. The Drug Abuse Warning Network, a federal agency that compiles statistics on hospital emergency cases caused by illicit drug abuse, says that number rose to 940,000 in 2004 \xe2\x80\x94 a huge increase over the last quarter century.'b'Why are so few Americans aware of these troubling trends? One reason is that today\xe2\x80\x99s drug abusers are simply the \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d group. As David   Musto, a psychiatry professor at Yale and historian of drug abuse, points out, wars on drugs have traditionally depended on \xe2\x80\x9clinkage between a drug and a feared or rejected group within society.\xe2\x80\x9d Today, however, the fastest-growing population of drug abusers is white, middle-aged Americans. This is a powerful mainstream constituency, and unlike with teenagers or urban minorities, it is hard for the government or the news media to present these drug users as a grave threat to the nation.'b'Among Americans in their 40s and 50s, deaths from illicit-drug overdoses have risen by 800 percent since 1980, including 300 percent in the last decade. In 2004, American hospital emergency rooms treated 400,000 patients between the ages 35 and 64 for abusing heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, marijuana, hallucinogens and \xe2\x80\x9cclub drugs\xe2\x80\x9d like ecstasy.'b'Equally surprising, graying baby boomers have become America\xe2\x80\x99s fastest-growing crime scourge. The F.B.I. reports that last year the number of Americans over the age of 40 arrested for violent and property felonies rose to 420,000, up from 170,000 in 1980. Arrests for drug offenses among those over 40 rose to 360,000 last year, up from 22,000 in 1980. The Bureau of Justice Statistics found that 440,000 Americans ages 40 and older were incarcerated in 2005, triple the number in 1990.'b'Yet drug officials seem fixated on paper-and-pencil surveys of drug use by teens. In releasing its survey last week, the Office of Drug Control Policy trumpeted that \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s balanced strategy to reduce drug use is working.\xe2\x80\x9d Representative Mark Souder, an Indiana Republican who has been a top supporter of federal antidrug efforts, says \xe2\x80\x9cthe Bush administration is doing very well\xe2\x80\x9d on this front because \xe2\x80\x9cdrug use, particularly among young people, is down.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But, some may say, don\xe2\x80\x99t teenage drug use rates predict future drug problems? To the contrary: 30 years of  experience shows that fluctuations in the percentage of youths who report using drugs on surveys has almost nothing to do with the harm that drug abuse causes (addiction, disease, injury, death, crime, family and community distress), either in adolescence or later in life.'b'I compared teenage drug use trends reported annually by Monitoring the Future since the 1970s with trends for other behaviors and with federal crime, health and education statistics. In years in which a higher percentage of high school seniors told the survey takers they used illicit drugs, teenagers consistently reported and experienced lower rates of crime, murder, drug-related hospital emergencies and deaths, suicides, H.I.V. infection, school dropouts, delinquency, pregnancy, violence, theft in and outside of school, and fights with parents, employers and teachers.'b'The data also contradict Mr. Walters\xe2\x80\x99s claim that generations reporting lower rates of drug use enjoy \xe2\x80\x9cless addiction, less suffering, less crime, lower health costs and higher achievement.\xe2\x80\x9d For example, baby boomers rarely used illegal drugs as youths.'b'In 1972, the University of Michigan researchers who carry out Monitoring the Future found that just 22 percent of high school seniors had ever used illegal drugs, compared to 48 percent of the class of 2005. Yet as that generation has aged, it has been afflicted by drug abuse and its related ills \xe2\x80\x94 overdoses, hospitalizations, drug-related crime \xe2\x80\x94 at far higher rates than those experienced by later generations at the same ages.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s time to end the obsession with hyping teenage drug use. The meaningless surveys that policy makers now rely on should be replaced with a comprehensive \xe2\x80\x9cdrug abuse index\xe2\x80\x9d that pulls together largely ignored data on drug-related deaths, hospital emergencies, crime, diseases and similar practical measures.'b'A good model is the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs\xe2\x80\x99 fledgling drug abuse index, which I helped compile and which aims to pinpoint which populations and areas are most harmed by drugs, both legal and illicit.'b'Few experts would have suspected that the biggest contributors to California\xe2\x80\x99s drug abuse, death and injury toll are educated, middle-aged women living in the Central Valley and rural areas, while the fastest-declining, lowest-risk populations are urban black and Latino teenagers. Yet the index found exactly that. These are the sorts of trends we need to understand if we are to design effective policies.'b'The United States\xe2\x80\x99 drug abuse crisis has exploded out of control. Scientifically designed strategies are urgently needed to target the manifest drug-caused damage that current policies are failing miserably to address.'b'Last Saturday was a strange day. It started with the hanging of Saddam Hussein. The more I read about the hasty, quasi-legal maneuvers used by Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s Shiite leaders to rush Saddam to the gallows on a Muslim holiday, Id al-Adha, and the more I watched the grainy cellphone video of the event, in which a guard is heard taunting Saddam with chants of \xe2\x80\x9cMoktada! Moktada!\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x94 the Shiite cleric whose death squads have killed hundreds of Sunnis \xe2\x80\x94  and the more I read of the insults Saddam spat back, the more it resembled a tribal revenge ritual rather than the culmination of a constitutional process in which America should be proud to have participated.'b'Bassam al-Husseini, an aide to Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s Shiite prime minister, was quoted by the BBC as saying Saddam\xe2\x80\x99s execution was \xe2\x80\x9can Id gift to the Iraqi people.\xe2\x80\x9d Many Sunnis would not share that view. For his part, Saddam, a Sunni, used his last breaths to spew vitriol against \xe2\x80\x9cthe traitors, the Americans, the spies and the Persians.\xe2\x80\x9d For Persians, read Shiites.'b'No wonder the BBC\xe2\x80\x99s world affairs editor, John Simpson, reported from Baghdad: \xe2\x80\x9cAltogether, the execution as we now see it is shown to be an ugly, degrading business, which is more reminiscent of a public hanging in the 18th century than a considered act of 21st-century official justice. Under Saddam Hussein, prisoners were regularly taunted and mistreated in their last hours. The most disturbing thing about the new video of Saddam\xe2\x80\x99s execution for crimes precisely like this is that it is all much too reminiscent of what used to happen here.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But as I said, Saturday was a strange day. After watching Saddam\xe2\x80\x99s hanging in the morning, I was sitting at my computer late in the afternoon and suddenly heard the strains of \xe2\x80\x9cMy country \xe2\x80\x98tis of thee, sweet land of liberty\xe2\x80\x9d being played on the TV in the next room. When I checked what was going on, I saw President Ford\xe2\x80\x99s coffin being unloaded  from Air Force One.'b'I have to admit I got a lump in my throat watching that scene and listening to that stirring melody. Saddam\xe2\x80\x99s execution was a snapshot of a country divided. Gerald Ford\xe2\x80\x99s funeral was a snapshot of a country united \xe2\x80\x94 political supporters and opponents alike paying tribute to a president, who was surrounded by an honor guard representing every color of the American rainbow and whose place in history was secured by an act of pardon and national healing.'b'How fortunate to live in a country where this is the political norm, built up over generations.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBecause of our basic unity, we can afford to be divided on specific issues,\xe2\x80\x9d said Michael Mandelbaum, author of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Case for Goliath.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDemocracy is about differences and contesting them in the public sphere, and it only works when there is basic agreement about the fundamentals. We should feel fortunate that we have a democratic history and set of beliefs. Those beliefs can be imported by those who want them and don\xe2\x80\x99t have them, but they can\xe2\x80\x99t be exported. We can only create a context where others would want to import them.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The raw tribal theatrics of Saddam\xe2\x80\x99s hanging highlight just how few of these values Iraq has imported. We are to blame for not creating the security needed for those values to take hold. But not enough of our Iraqi allies have risen to the occasion, either. It was our closest Iraqi partners who oversaw Saddam\xe2\x80\x99s tribal hanging. We have to look that in the eye.'b'Saddam deserved to die 100 deaths. But imagine if Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s Shiite leaders had surprised everyone, declared that there had been enough killing in Iraq and commuted Saddam\xe2\x80\x99s sentence to life in prison \xe2\x80\x94 sparing his life in hopes of uniting the country rather than executing him and dividing it further. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it would have helped, but I do know Iraqis have rarely surprised us with gestures of reconciliation \xe2\x80\x94 only with new ways to kill each other.'b'Now President Bush wants a \xe2\x80\x9csurge\xe2\x80\x9d of more U.S. troops to Baghdad, in one last attempt to bring order. Whenever I hear this surge idea, I think of a couple who recently got married but the marriage was never very solid. Then one day they say to each other, \xe2\x80\x9cHey, let\xe2\x80\x99s have a baby, that will bring us together.\xe2\x80\x9d It never works.'b'If the underlying union is not there, adding a baby won\xe2\x80\x99t help. And if the underlying willingness to share power and resources is not present among the major communities in Iraq, adding more U.S. troops won\xe2\x80\x99t help either. Adding more troops makes sense only if it\xe2\x80\x99s to buy more time for positive trends that have already begun to appear on the horizon. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see them.'b'As Saddam\xe2\x80\x99s hanging underscored, Iraqis are doing things their way. So maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s time to get out of their way.'b'Washington'b'It was a scene that Mary McCarthy could have written the devil out of: a funeral for a fine, bland fellow that filled everybody with unfine, unbland thoughts. The formal serenity of the service disguised, but only barely, the virulent rivalries and envies and grudges and grievances that have roiled this group for many decades.'b'None of the eulogists noted the irony that the man who ushered out one long national nightmare had ushered in another, the one we\xe2\x80\x99re living in now. It was Gerald Ford, after all, who gave America the gift of Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld  \xe2\x80\x94 the gift that keeps on taking.'b'The two former Ford administration officials, who doomed Iraq to civil war and despoiled American values, were honorary pallbearers yesterday, as was that other slippery and solipsistic courtier, Henry Kissinger.'b'The group was even more on edge because of a remarkable trellis of peppery opinions that had tumbled out of the man in the coffin,  posthumously. The late president, hailed as the most understated and decent guy in the world, had given a series of interviews on the condition that they be held until his death  \xe2\x80\x94 a belated but bracing smackdown of many of his distinguished mourners.'b'It was impossible not to wonder what the luminaries were truly thinking, as they sat listening to fugues of Bach and Brahms and encomiums to the ordinary-guy leader.'b'Nancy Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s imperturbable expression behind her big sunglasses did not disguise the gloating words visible in the bubble over her head: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they call 'b'this'b'  a funeral?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It could not compare, of course, to the incredible Princess of Wales treatment that her husband had for his state funeral. And Nancy, hypersensitive to any slights to her Ronnie, would not have been pleased with Mr. Ford\xe2\x80\x99s interview with Michael Beschloss published in Newsweek, in which he blamed Ronald Reagan for costing him the 1976 election by challenging his nomination and then failing to hit the trail for him.'b'It was good of Mr. Ford to bring 41 and 43 together in a solemn respite from their uneasy competition over Iraq.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTold you so, you sons of guns  \xe2\x80\x94 we were right to stop at Safwan and stay out of Baghdad,\xe2\x80\x9d the father\xe2\x80\x99s bubble read, as he watched Rummy and Henry the K, both of whom had treated Poppy with such veiled contempt, as though he were a feather duster. \xe2\x80\x9cThose vicious Moktada-loving Shiites dancing around Saddam\xe2\x80\x99s dead body prove that Brent and I were right.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Lynne Cheney glared at Poppy as he gave his eulogy, knowing that he privately thinks that the vice president has destroyed not only Iraq and American foreign policy, but the Bush family name. Her storm cloud of a bubble is expurgated.'b'Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s bubble was full of mockery for another New Yorker in the National Cathedral: \xe2\x80\x9cYou think you\xe2\x80\x99re so smart, Rudy, but you leave your entire presidential battle plan in a hotel room for your rivals to find? The victim role doesn\xe2\x80\x99t suit you.\xe2\x80\x9d Condi\xe2\x80\x99s bubble was as opaquely dark as Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s was risibly light  \xe2\x80\x94 drooping with the inchoate fear that her nearby erstwhile mentor, Brent Scowcroft, had been right about Iraq after all.'b'As Poppy spoke from the altar, praising Mr. Ford\xe2\x80\x99s generosity, he must have been mulling that his predecessor was ungenerous in spitting on him from the grave. Mr. Ford told Mr. Beschloss that Bush Senior  had sold out the party to the hard right and had taken a phony, pandering position on abortion.'b'Poppy had to have enjoyed watching Dr. K get up and lavish praise on his old boss, after Mr. Ford had sniggered to Bob Woodward that the \xe2\x80\x9ccoy\xe2\x80\x9d Bavarian diva had \xe2\x80\x9cthe thinnest skin of any public figure I ever knew.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'W. graciously walked Betty Ford down the aisle, even as he must have curdled inside about her husband\xe2\x80\x99s telling Mr. Woodward that it had been \xe2\x80\x9ca big mistake\xe2\x80\x9d on the part of W., Dick Cheney and Rummy to justify the Iraq war with nonexistent W.M.D. \xe2\x80\x9cI just don\xe2\x80\x99t think we should go hellfire damnation around the globe freeing people, unless it is directly related to our own national security,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Ex-presidents weren\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to criticize sitting presidents. Adding insult to injury, Woodward himself was in the cathedral.

The good news is that Robert Nardelli, the imperious chief executive who had presided over a difficult, stagnant period for the company, has resigned. The bad news is that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be taking $210 million worth of compensation with him, one of the highest severance packages ever, which is saying a lot in this era of runaway executive pay.'b'Mr. Nardelli may be best known for his shocking performance at the company\xe2\x80\x99s annual meeting in May, which has become a symbol of the arrogance of overpaid, out-of-touch, and unresponsive executives.'b'As Joe Nocera reported in The Times after attending the meeting, Mr. Nardelli restricted shareholder comments to one minute and one question each \xe2\x80\x94 enforced with large digital timers. When one shareholder asked about perceived conflicts of interest for the board of directors, Mr. Nardelli refused to answer, declaring, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not the forum in which to address these comments.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The meeting, of course, was exactly the forum for shareholders to voice concerns about the board of directors they were being asked to elect.'b'Top executives, like Mr. Nardelli, have been coddled to the point that they expect and receive \xe2\x80\x9cgolden hellos\xe2\x80\x9d worth millions on their way in, golden parachutes worth even more on their way out, and the equivalent of golden seat cushions to park on comfortably throughout their tenure \xe2\x80\x94 often largely unrelated to their actual performance.'b'While the fortune Mr. Nardelli is taking with him \xe2\x80\x94 including a $20 million cash severance payment \xe2\x80\x94 sticks in the craw, we hope this will be the beginning of a new era of accountable management for Home Depot. Robert Monks, the longtime corporate governance advocate, calls it \xe2\x80\x9cthe scars of progress.\xe2\x80\x9d There is no question that Mr. Nardelli\xe2\x80\x99s departure is a victory for the activist groups that attacked the status quo at Home Depot, and all those who would follow in their footsteps.'b'Washington'b'THE Iraq Study Group report was released into a sea of unrealistic expectations. Inevitably, it disappointed hopes for a clear path through the morass of Iraq, because there is no \xe2\x80\x9csilver bullet\xe2\x80\x9d solution to the difficulties in which we find ourselves.'b'But the report accomplished a great deal. It brought together some of America\xe2\x80\x99s best minds across party lines, and it outlined with clarity and precision the key factors at issue in Iraq. In doing so, it helped catalyze the debate about our Iraq policy and crystallize the choices we face. Above all, it emphasized the importance of focusing on American national interests, not only in Iraq but in the region.'b'However, the report, which calls the situation in Iraq \xe2\x80\x9cgrave and deteriorating,\xe2\x80\x9d does not focus on what could be the most likely outcome of its analysis. Should the Iraqis be unable or unwilling to play the role required of them, the report implies that we would have no choice but to withdraw, and then blame our withdrawal on Iraqi failures. But here the report essentially stops.'b'An American withdrawal before Iraq can, in the words of the president, \xe2\x80\x9cgovern itself, sustain itself, and defend itself\xe2\x80\x9d would be a strategic defeat for American interests, with potentially catastrophic consequences both in the region and beyond. Our opponents would be hugely emboldened, our friends deeply demoralized.'b'Iran, heady with the withdrawal of its principal adversary, would expand its influence through Hezbollah and Hamas more deeply into Syria, Lebanon, the Palestinian territories and Jordan. Our Arab friends would rightly feel we had abandoned them to face alone a radicalism that has been greatly inflamed by American actions in the region and which could pose a serious threat to their own governments.'b'The effects would not be confined to Iraq and the Middle East. Energy resources and transit choke points vital to the global economy would be subjected to greatly increased risk. Terrorists and extremists elsewhere would be emboldened. And the perception, worldwide, would be that the American colossus had stumbled, was losing its resolve and could no longer be considered a reliable ally or friend \xe2\x80\x94 or the guarantor of peace and stability in this critical region.'b'To avoid these dire consequences, we need to secure the support of the countries of the region themselves. It is greatly in their self-interest to give that support,  just as they did in the 1991 Persian Gulf conflict. Unfortunately, in recent years they have come to see it as dangerous to identify with the United States, and so they have largely stood on the sidelines.'b'A vigorously renewed effort to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict could fundamentally change both the dynamics in the region and the strategic calculus of key leaders. Real progress would push Iran into a more defensive posture. Hezbollah and Hamas would lose their rallying principle. American allies like Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the gulf states would be liberated to assist in stabilizing Iraq. And Iraq would finally be seen by all as a key country that had to be set right in the pursuit of regional security.'b'Arab leaders are now keen to resolve the 50-year-old dispute. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel may be as well. His nation\xe2\x80\x99s long-term security can only be assured by resolving this issue once and for all. However, only the American president can bring them to the same table.'b'Resuming the Arab-Israeli peace process is not a matter of forcing concessions from Israel or dragooning the Palestinians into surrender. Most of the elements of a settlement are already agreed as a result of the negotiations of 2000 and the \xe2\x80\x9croad map\xe2\x80\x9d of 2002. What is required is to summon the will of Arab and Israeli leaders, led by a determined American president, to forge the various elements into a conclusion that all parties have already publicly accepted in principle.'b'As for Syria and Iran, we should not be afraid of opening channels of communication, but neither should we rush to engage them as negotiating \xe2\x80\x9cpartners.\xe2\x80\x9d Moreover, these two countries have differing interests, expectations and points of leverage and should not be treated as though they are indistinguishable.'b'Syria cannot be comfortable clutched solely in the embrace of Iran, and thus prying it away may be possible. Syria also has much to gain from a settlement with Israel and internal problems that such a deal might greatly ease. If we can make progress on the Palestinian front before adding Syria to the mix, it would both avoid overloading Israel\xe2\x80\x99s negotiating capacity and increase the incentives for Damascus to negotiate seriously.'b'Iran is different. It may not be wise to make Iran integral to the regional strategy at the outset. And the nuclear issue should be dealt with on a separate track. In its present state of euphoria, Iran has little interest in making things easier for us. If, however, we make clear our determination, and if the other regional states become more engaged in stabilizing Iraq, the Iranians might grow more inclined to negotiate seriously.'b'WHILE negotiations on the Arab-Israel peace process are under way, we should establish some political parameters inside Iraq that encourage moves toward reconciliation and unified government in Iraq. Other suggested options, such as an \xe2\x80\x9c80 percent solution\xe2\x80\x9d that excludes the Sunnis, or the division of the country into three parts, are not only inconsistent with reconciliation but would almost certainly pave the way to broader regional conflict and must be avoided.'b'American combat troops should be gradually redeployed away from intervening in sectarian conflict. That necessarily is a task for Iraqi troops, however poorly prepared they may be. Our troops should be redirected toward training the Iraqi Army, providing support and backup, combating insurgents, attenuating outside intervention and assisting in major infrastructure protection.'b'That does not mean the American presence should be reduced. Indeed, in the immediate future, the opposite may be true, though any increase in troop strength should be directed at accomplishing specific, defined missions. A generalized increase would be unlikely to demonstrably change the situation and, consequently, could result in increased clamor for withdrawal. But the central point is that withdrawing combat forces should not be a policy objective, but rather, the result of changes in our strategy and success in our efforts.'b'As we work our way through this seemingly intractable problem in Iraq, we must constantly remember that this is not just a troublesome issue from which we can walk away if it seems too costly to continue. What is at stake is not only Iraq and the stability of the Middle East, but the global perception of the reliability of the United States as a partner in a deeply troubled world. We cannot afford to fail that test.'b'How long can this go on?'b'Saddam is dead. The weapons of mass destruction were a mirage. More than 3,000 American G.I.s and scores of thousands of Iraqis have been killed. Voters in the United States have made it clear that they no longer support American involvement in this exercise in sustained barbarism. Incredibly, the U.S. military itself is turning against the war.'b'And yet the president, against the counsel of his commanders on the ground, apparently is ready to escalate \xe2\x80\x94 to send more American lives into the fire he set in Iraq.'b'In a devastating critique of the war, the newsweekly Army Times led its current edition with the headline: \xe2\x80\x9cAbout-Face on the War \xe2\x80\x94 After 3 years of support, troops sour on Iraq.\xe2\x80\x9d The article detailed a Military Times Poll that found, for the first time, that \xe2\x80\x9cmore troops disapprove of the president\xe2\x80\x99s handling of the war than approve of it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Only a third of the service members surveyed approved of the president\xe2\x80\x99s conduct of the war, while 42 percent disapproved. Perhaps worse was the finding that only half of the troops believed that success in Iraq was likely.'b'The service members made it clear that they were not attacking their commander in chief personally. His overall approval rating remained high. What has turned them off has been the wretched reality of the war. In the article, David Segal, director of the Center for Research on Military Organization at the University of Maryland, said, \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re seeing more casualties and fatalities and less progress.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In other words, they\xe2\x80\x99re seeing the same thing everybody else is seeing \xe2\x80\x94 except, perhaps, Mr. Bush.'b'On New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, readers of The New York Times could see the excruciating photo layout of the latest 1,000 American service members to die in Iraq. As in all wars, most of them were young. Many of them were smiling in the photos. All of them died unnecessarily.'b'The war has been an exercise in futility and mind-boggling incompetence, and yet our involvement continues \xe2\x80\x94 with no end in sight, no plans for withdrawal, no idea of where we might be headed \xe2\x80\x94 as if the U.S. had fallen into some kind of bizarrely destructive trance from which it is unable to awaken.'b'And who is paying the price for this insanity \xe2\x80\x94 apart from ordinary Iraqis, who are paying the most grievous price of all? The burden of the war in the U.S. is being shouldered overwhelmingly by a contingent of Americans whom no one would categorize as economically privileged.'b'As Lizette Alvarez and Andrew Lehren wrote in Monday\xe2\x80\x99s Times:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe service members who died during this latest period fit an unchanging profile. They were mostly white men from rural areas, soldiers so young they still held fresh memories of high school football heroics and teenage escapades. Many men and women were in Iraq for the second or third time. Some were going on their fourth, fifth or sixth deployment.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There is no way that this can be justified. It is just wrong.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times that if a war is worth fighting the way to do it is to mobilize the entire country, drawing the warriors from as wide a swath of the population as possible and raising taxes on everyone as part of an all-out effort to defeat a common enemy.'b'This war is not worth fighting. And if there were ever serious talk about enacting a draft or raising taxes to fight it, you\xe2\x80\x99d see quickly enough that the vast majority of Americans would not find it worth fighting.'b'There must be a leader somewhere who can shake the U.S. out of this tragic hypnotic state, who can see that it is beyond crazy to continue our involvement in this war indefinitely, to sacrifice another 1,000 young lives, and then another thousand after that.'b'All of the tortured, twisted rationales for this war \xe2\x80\x94 all of the fatuous intellectual pyrotechnics dreamed up to justify it \xe2\x80\x94 have vaporized, and we\xe2\x80\x99re left with just the mad, mindless, meaningless and apparently endless slaughter.'b'Shakespeare, in \xe2\x80\x9cHenry VI,\xe2\x80\x9d said: \xe2\x80\x9cNow thou art come unto a feast of death.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We should end our participation in the feast of death in Iraq. It is criminal to continue feeding our troops into the slaughter.'b'If there were politicians here at home with some of the courage of the troops in the field, we could begin saving lives rather than watching helplessly as the Bush White House continues to sacrifice them. Three thousand and counting is enough.'b'I have a dream, my friends. I have a dream that we are approaching the day when a ranch-owning millionaire Republican like George Bush will make peace with a vineyard-owning millionaire Democrat like Nancy Pelosi.'b'I have a dream that Pelosi, who was chauffeured to school as a child and who, with her investor husband,  owns minority shares in the Auberge du Soleil resort hotel and the CordeValle Golf Club, will look over her famous strand of South Sea Tahitian pearls and forge bonds of understanding with the zillionaire corporate barons in the opposing party.'b'Furthermore, I dream of a great harmonic convergence among the obscenely rich  \xe2\x80\x94 between Randian hedge fund managers on the right and helipad environmentalists on the left. I dream that the big-money people who seem to dominate our politics will put aside their partisan fury and discover the class solidarity that Karl Marx always said they shared, and their newfound civility will trickle down to the rest of us. I dream that Berkeley will make peace with Buckhead, Streisand with DeVos, Huffington with O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly.'b'I have my dreams, but of course, I am realistic too, for I am aware that at present there is no peace among the secluded island villas. I look out across the second homes of America and its surrounding tropical regions and I see polarization among the Kate Spade devotees and bitterness among the Rolexes. And I know that both Bush and Pelosi are part of an upper-income whirlwind of strife.'b'Some people believe that Pelosi is an airhead, but that is wrong. Some people believe she is a radical San Francisco liberal, but that, too, is wrong. The main fact to know about Pelosi is that she is a creature of the modern fund-raising system. Some politicians rise because they run political machines. Some rise because they are great communicators. Pelosi has risen because she is a master of the thousand-dollar-a-plate fundraising circuit.'b'Living amid a web of investors, venture capitalists and West Coast technology tycoons, she raised heroic amounts of money for the Democratic Party before she ever thought of running for anything herself. In 1984, she was the state party chairwoman. In 1986, she was the national fund-raising chairwoman for the Senate Democrats.'b'Since coming to the House, she has discovered what many a savvy pol has discovered  \xe2\x80\x94 that the fastest way to ascend in Congress is to raise a lot of money and give it to your peers.'b'She paid her dues selecting party favors, arranging seating charts (after that, legislation is easy), and laying thick dollops of obsequiousness on cranky old moguls and their helmet hair spa-spouses. She has done what all political fund-raisers do: tell rich people things they already believe, demonize the other side, motivate the giving with Manichaean tales of good versus evil.'b'It is no wonder The Los Angeles Times calls her a \xe2\x80\x9crabid Democrat\xe2\x80\x9d or that Time magazine calls her \xe2\x80\x9chyperpartisan.\xe2\x80\x9d It is not a surprise, as The Washington Post reported this week, that despite campaign promises about changing the tone in Washington, Pelosi has decided to exclude Republicans from the first burst of legislation  \xe2\x80\x94 to forbid them to offer amendments or alternatives.'b'She is part of the clash of the rival elites, with the dollars from Brookline battling dollars from Dallas, causing upper-class strife that even diminutive dogs, vibrant velvets and petite salades can\xe2\x80\x99t fully soothe.'b'It pains me to see plutocrats fight, because it sets such a poor example for those of us in the lower orders who fly commercial. It pains me even more because politicians from the rival blueblood clans go to embarrassing lengths to try to prove they are most authentically connected with working Americans.'b'Think of John Kerry visiting a Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s or Bill Frist impersonating a Bible thumper. This week, witness Pelosi going on her all-about-me inauguration tour, which is designed to rebrand her as a regular Catholic grandma from Baltimore. Members of the middle classes never have to mount campaign swings to prove how regular they are, but these upper-bracket types can\xe2\x80\x99t help themselves, and they always lay it on too thick.'b'So I harbor my dreams of reconciliation, but in the meantime, why oh  why can\xe2\x80\x99t we have a decent overclass in this country  \xe2\x80\x94 a group of highly attractive dimwits who spread bland but worthy stability over our political scene. Why oh why do we have to have this endless canap\xc3\xa9 war \xe2\x80\x94 the people of the vineyard against the people of the ranch.'b'The nation should welcome the ambitious agenda being offered today by the new Congress\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic majority, from raising the minimum wage to advancing stem cell research to restoring oversight of the executive branch. But the real test for the 110th Congress will be its willingness to clean up its own act by adopting forceful and credible ethics reform. That is what the Democratic leadership promised voters. Any hesitation will be rightly seen as a cynical re-endorsement of the Capitol\xe2\x80\x99s lobbyist-enabling, corruption-steeped business as usual.'b'Congress\xe2\x80\x99s ethics rules have been rife with loopholes and wrist-slapping punishments that grease rather than police the quid pro quo world of Washington. Fixing some of these problems requires nothing more than a majority vote on the House or Senate rules.'b'House Democrats appear ready to start with a firm, and long needed, ban on gifts, entertainment and junket travel \xe2\x80\x94 including low-cost V.I.P. rides on corporate jets \xe2\x80\x94 arranged by lobbyists or their clients. The ban should cover staffers as well, and the Senate should match it. Even that will require wary monitoring, particularly of a provision that  would allow members preapproved day trips for speeches, with travel paid by non-lobbying groups.'b'Both houses should also bar Congressional alumni and other lobbyists from the debating floors and other Capitol inner sanctums. And members of Congress with other ambitions should be blocked from slyly negotiating lucrative private jobs while they\xe2\x80\x99re still on the public\xe2\x80\x99s payroll and sworn to defend the public\xe2\x80\x99s interest. There should be early disclosure of all job feelers.'b'The back-scratching closeness of politicians seeking campaign donations and deep-pocket interests seeking favors is a capital disgrace. Part of the solution is to douse their dealings with sunshine through prompt and detailed filing disclosures. And there should be full disclosure of the cornucopia of \xe2\x80\x9cearmarks\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 costly favors inserted without debate or any requirement to disclose authorship in mammoth spending bills. Earmark authors and beneficiaries should be unmasked in time to be mocked by taxpayers.'b'Broader reforms will require longer legislative debate, not just a rule change. Paramount is the need to create an independent office for ethics enforcement to end the clubbiness that more often than not covers up or excuses abuses. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has ordered a bipartisan study of this vital proposal by March. We expect this overdue step to receive the forceful support of Ms. Pelosi and Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader. The voters are watching, and lawmakers dare not slip away from the promise to clean up their act.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cA Healthy New Year,\xe2\x80\x9d by Paul Krugman (column, Jan. 1):'b'Yes!

Among the dossiers bearing names like Alger Hiss, Theodore Hall and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg will be one labeled \xe2\x80\x9cFrigyes Klein\xe2\x80\x9d: my father, Fred Klein.'b'My father was never a spy, never a member of the Communist Party. He came by ship to the United States in 1956, fleeing Communism during the Hungarian revolution to pursue the American dream. He worked on a Ford automobile assembly line in Cincinnati by day and moonlighted sharpening lawnmowers at night, saving enough money in a few years to buy a small house. To him, treasonous behavior meant buying a car made outside of America. Nonetheless, as I discovered recently, the F.B.I. kept a file on him from the day he arrived in the United States.'b'J. Edgar Hoover sent a personal memo to the C.I.A. director calling my father a person of current interest; the case was handled by Alan Belmont, a top bureau official who was instrumental in the case against the Rosenbergs. I discovered this after filing a Freedom of Information Act inquiry as part of some family research for a book. I was shocked to receive 50 F.B.I. pages riddled with my father\xe2\x80\x99s name, the edges dotted with weathered stamps marked \xe2\x80\x9cSECRET.\xe2\x80\x9d I matched what I read with stories I remembered from when he was alive, and began piecing the case together.'b'My father once mentioned that during the voyage over, he got into an altercation with another refugee, a man he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know from a town he had never visited.

As with my father, the informant had a vendetta and had lied to the authorities.'b'My father\xe2\x80\x99s case remained open for more than a decade.

Betsy Gotbaum'b'Public Advocate'b'New York, Dec. 22, 2006'b'As the minimum wage moves to the top of the new Congress\xe2\x80\x99s agenda, some politicians \xe2\x80\x94 mainly President Bush and Senate Republicans \xe2\x80\x94 seem incapable of viewing the issue as anything other than a pretext for more tax cuts. This time the lucky recipients would be small-business owners, who the politicians contend will be unduly harmed by having to pay higher wages. So much for ringing in the new.'b'It has been more than nine years since the government last increased the federal minimum wage, currently $5.15 an hour. During that period inflation has severely eroded the wage\xe2\x80\x99s value. Arguing that it is only fair to cut taxes on business owners when the minimum wage goes up is akin to arguing that taxes should have been raised as the wage fell because of inflation. Instead, as the minimum wage has eroded over the past decade, taxes have been cut sharply.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s even doubtful that the wage increase  under discussion \xe2\x80\x94 a $2.10 increase over roughly two years, to $7.25 \xe2\x80\x94 would impair business. Eighty-six percent of small-business owners surveyed by the Wells Fargo/Gallup Small Business Index said the minimum wage had no effect on their businesses.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s also no reason to believe that the proposed tax cuts would be aimed at employers of low-wage workers. In 2006, when Congress tried to link the minimum wage to tax cuts, the proposals included an estate-tax cut for America\xe2\x80\x99s wealthiest families. One proposal now being considered would allow small businesses to write off a larger part of their attorney fees when they go to court to challenge federal regulations. It sounds like a stretch to us that typical employers of minimum-wage workers \xe2\x80\x94 say, restaurants and small factories \xe2\x80\x94 are in any great need of relief from the high cost of federal litigation.'b'And then there\xe2\x80\x99s the probability that tax cuts would cost the government far more than a wage increase would ever cost employers, driving up the budget deficit. The Economic Policy Institute analyzed the tax cuts that were linked to an unsuccessful attempt to raise the minimum wage in 2000. Those cuts would have cost $123 billion over 10  years, versus $11.2 billion for the wage increase.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s that sort of idiocy the new Congress was elected to stop. Chances are good the House of Representatives will eschew tax cuts and pass a clean bill to raise the minimum wage. The Senate should follow suit. And President Bush should sign it.'b'Universal health care, much as we need it, won\xe2\x80\x99t happen until there\xe2\x80\x99s a change of management in the White House. In the meantime, however, Congress can take an important step toward making our health care system less wasteful, by fixing the Medicare Middleman Multiplication Act of 2003.'b'Officially, of course, it was the Medicare Modernization Act. But as we learned during the debate over Social Security, in Bushspeak \xe2\x80\x9cmodernize\xe2\x80\x9d is a synonym for \xe2\x80\x9cprivatize.\xe2\x80\x9d And one of the main features of the legislation was an effort to bring private-sector fragmentation and inefficiency to one of America\xe2\x80\x99s most important public programs.'b'The process actually started in the 1990s, when Medicare began allowing recipients to replace traditional Medicare  \xe2\x80\x94 in which the government pays doctors and hospitals  \xe2\x80\x94 with private managed-care plans, in which the government pays a fee to an H.M.O. The magic of the marketplace was supposed to cut Medicare\xe2\x80\x99s costs.'b'The plan backfired. H.M.O.\xe2\x80\x99s received fees reflecting the medical costs of the average Medicare recipient, but to maximize profits they selectively enrolled only healthier seniors, leaving sicker, more expensive people in traditional Medicare. Once Medicare became aware of this cream-skimming and started adjusting payments to reflect beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x99 health, the H.M.O.\xe2\x80\x99s began dropping out: their extra layer of bureaucracy meant that they had higher costs than traditional Medicare and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t compete on a financially fair basis.'b'That should have been the end of the story. But for the Bush administration and its Congressional allies, privatization isn\xe2\x80\x99t a way to deliver better government services  \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s an end in itself. So the 2003 legislation increased payments to Medicare-supported H.M.O.\xe2\x80\x99s, which were renamed Medicare Advantage plans. These plans are now heavily subsidized.'b'According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent federal body that advises Congress on Medicare issues, Medicare Advantage now costs 11 percent more per beneficiary than traditional Medicare. According to the Commonwealth Fund, which has a similar estimate of the excess cost, the subsidy to private H.M.O.\xe2\x80\x99s cost Medicare $5.4 billion in 2005.'b'The inability of private middlemen to win a fair competition against traditional Medicare was embarrassing to those who sing the praises of privatization. Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s why the Bush administration made sure that there is no competition at all in Part D, the drug program. There\xe2\x80\x99s no traditional Medicare version of Part D, in which the government pays drug costs directly. Instead, the elderly must get coverage from a private insurance company, which then receives a government subsidy.'b'As a result, Part D is highly confusing. It\xe2\x80\x99s also needlessly expensive, for two reasons: the insurance companies add an extra layer of bureaucracy, and they have limited ability to bargain with drug companies for lower prices (and Medicare is prohibited from bargaining on their behalf). One indicator of how much Medicare is overspending is the sharp rise in prices paid by millions of low-income seniors whose drug coverage has been switched from Medicaid, which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rely on middlemen and does bargain over prices, to the new Medicare program.'b'The costs imposed on Medicare by gratuitous privatization are almost certainly higher than the cost of providing health insurance to the eight  million children in the United States who lack coverage. But recent news analyses have suggested that Democrats may not be able to guarantee coverage to all children because this would conflict with their pledge to be fiscally responsible. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it strange how fiscal responsibility is a big concern when Congress is trying to help children, but a nonissue when Congress is subsidizing drug and insurance companies?'b'What should Congress do? The new Democratic majority is poised to reduce drug prices by allowing  \xe2\x80\x94 and, probably, requiring  \xe2\x80\x94 Medicare to negotiate prices on behalf of the private drug plans. But it should go further, and force Medicare to offer direct drug coverage that competes on a financially fair basis with the private plans. And it should end the subsidy  to Medicare Advantage, forcing H.M.O.\xe2\x80\x99s to engage in fair competition with traditional Medicare.'b'Conservatives will fight fiercely against these moves. They say they believe in competition  \xe2\x80\x94 but they\xe2\x80\x99re against competition that might show the public sector doing a better job than the private sector. Progressives should support these moves for the same reason. Ending the subsidies to middlemen, in addition to saving a lot of money, would point the way to broader health care reform.'b'EVERY year anniversaries of significant historic events provide opportunities for scholars, pundits, bloggers and even less voluble Americans to reflect on the past as well as the present.

I would suggest the Gerald Ford Energy Independence Act.'b'Few people remember today, but \xe2\x80\x9cGerald Ford was the first U.S. president to really use the levers of the presidency to try to break our addiction to oil,\xe2\x80\x9d said the energy economist Philip Verleger Jr. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was way ahead of his time.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Well, his time has come again  \xe2\x80\x94 and then some.'b'The greatest thing George Bush could do  \xe2\x80\x94 for President Ford\xe2\x80\x99s legacy and his own  \xe2\x80\x94 would be to dedicate his coming State of the Union address to completing the energy independence agenda that Mr. Ford initiated 32 years ago in the wake of the 1973 Arab oil embargo and energy shock.'b'As the page titled \xe2\x80\x9cEnergy\xe2\x80\x9d from the Ford presidential library Web site reminds us: \xe2\x80\x9cEarly in his administration, President Ford said that he would not sit by and watch the nation continue to talk about an energy crisis and do nothing about it. Nor, he said, would he accept halfway measures which failed to change the direction that has made our nation so vulnerable to foreign economic interests. The president proposed firm but necessary measures designed to achieve energy independence for the U.S. by 1985, and to regain our position of world leadership in energy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In his 1975 State of the Union speech, President Ford laid out his vision: \xe2\x80\x9cI have a very deep belief in America\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities. Within the next 10 years, my program envisions: 200 major nuclear power plants; 250 major new coal mines; 150 major coal-fired power plants; 30 major new [oil] refineries; 20 major new synthetic fuel plants; the drilling of many thousands of new oil wells; the insulation of 18 million homes; and the manufacturing and the sale of millions of new automobiles, trucks and buses that use much less fuel. ... In another crisis  \xe2\x80\x94 the one in 1942  \xe2\x80\x94 President Franklin D. Roosevelt said this country would build 60,000 military aircraft. By 1943, production in that program had reached 125,000 aircraft annually. They did it then. We can do it now.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Obviously, President Ford\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on coal and domestic oil came in an age when most people were unaware of climate change. Still, Mr. Ford wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just all talk on energy. He used his presidential powers to impose a $3-a-barrel fee on imported oil to reduce consumption. That was a big deal, noted Mr. Verleger, because the average cost of imported crude at the time was only $10.76 a barrel.'b'Yes, you read that right. A Republican president actually imposed an import fee on oil to curb consumption! Yes, President Bush, it can be done! The republic survived!'b'Thanks to the Energy Policy Conservation Act of 1975 and other measures, Mr. Ford\xe2\x80\x99s energy legacy includes: the creation of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for use in an emergency; the phasing out of domestic price controls on oil to encourage more exploration; major investment in alternative energy research; assistance to states in developing energy conservation programs; and, most important, the creation of the first compulsory mileage standards for U.S. automobiles.'b'Those mileage standards have barely been tightened since 1975  \xe2\x80\x94 because some idiotic congressmen from Michigan, who thought they were protecting Detroit, have blocked efforts to raise them. So, Japanese automakers innovated more in that area, and the rest is history \xe2\x80\x94  or in the case of Detroit, obituary.'b'Every 10 years we say to ourselves, \xe2\x80\x9cIf only we had done the right thing 10 years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d Well, President Bush has a chance in his State of the Union to call on Americans to honor Mr. Ford by completing his vision. But it means asking Americans to do some  hard things: accepting a gasoline or carbon tax; inducing Detroit to make more fuel-efficient cars, trucks and plug-in hybrids; setting a national requirement for utilities to provide 20 percent of their electricity from renewable wind, solar, hydro or nuclear power by 2015; and, finally, making large-scale investments in mass transit.'b'It is stunning that since 9/11 the Bush team has never mounted a campaign to get Americans to conserve energy.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFord called for zero oil imports by 1985,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Verleger. \xe2\x80\x9cInstead, we imported five million barrels a day then. In 2006, imports will average almost 14 million barrels a day. Had we achieved everything Ford proposed, the price of oil today would be $20 a barrel, not $60, the polar ice caps might not be melting, the polar bear might still have a chance, and our children would have a future.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'New Jersey could take the lead among states in abolishing the death penalty if it follows the recommendation that a legislative commission made this week. It is the right thing to do, and not just because capital punishment is barbaric and a poor deterrent. It has become increasingly clear  as the use of DNA evidence has grown that there is simply too great a risk of making an irreversible mistake.'b'While we would have used stronger language, we applaud the 13-member panel for having the courage to recommend that New Jersey become the first state to abolish the death penalty since states began reinstating it 35 years ago. The commission included two prosecutors, a police chief, members of the clergy and a man whose daughter was murdered in 2000. Only one member, a former state senator who wrote the death penalty law, dissented.'b'Although it has nine people on death row, New Jersey has had a moratorium on executions since 2005 and has not put anyone to death since 1963. Nevertheless, the panel\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation that the death penalty be replaced with life imprisonment without parole is likely to have significant influence both inside and outside the state. It comes as about 10 of the 38 states with death penalties, including New York, have suspended executions and as recent developments, like DNA exonerations and a botched lethal injection in Florida last month, have created a growing unease about executions.'b'With Gov. Jon Corzine opposed to the death penalty, and substantial numbers of capital punishment opponents in both houses of the Legislature, there is a reasonable chance the commission\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations will become law. That would make New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s criminal justice system more civilized and fair. It could also prod other states to abandon their own use of what Justice Harry Blackmun called the \xe2\x80\x9cmachinery of death.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The No. 2 job in the State Department is technically a step down from John Negroponte\xe2\x80\x99s present post of director of national intelligence. But the reported return to the foreign policy fold of this former ambassador to Baghdad, and, before that, to the United Nations, has a certain logic to it.'b'The diplomacy-challenged Bush administration could surely use the help. We hope that Mr. Negroponte can provide Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice with the intellectual and bureaucratic reinforcement she so desperately needs to help guide the administration to a wiser course on Iraq.'b'Mr. Negroponte certainly has experience. In a 40-plus-year career \xe2\x80\x94 including an early stint as a political officer in Vietnam \xe2\x80\x94 he has also served as ambassador to Honduras (during Ronald Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s contra war), Mexico and the Philippines. He is known as a canny, and sometimes ruthless, bureaucratic player. What he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have, unfortunately, is much of a reputation for challenging the unwise policy presumptions of his bosses.'b'In his 10 months in Baghdad from mid-2004 to mid-2005, Mr. Negroponte undoubtedly saw the yawning gap between Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s grim reality and the delusional claims of success issuing from Washington. While President Bush and other top officials trumpeted effective military training programs, a flowering Iraqi democracy and an insurgency ever on its last legs, anyone on the ground had to see paper Iraqi battalions, the rise of sectarian militias and ever-expanding chaos.'b'If Mr. Negroponte made a serious effort to jolt his bosses back to the real world, there is no public record of it. That will have to change if he is to have any chance of improving things. Before confirming him, the Senate should make sure he understands that asking hard and unwelcome questions is an essential part of the job.'b'Mr. Negroponte\xe2\x80\x99s switch will mean another wrenching shift in the top ranks of America\xe2\x80\x99s deeply troubled intelligence agencies. One of the main problems that the national intelligence director\xe2\x80\x99s job was created to solve was the destructive rivalries between intelligence agencies run by the Defense Department and their civilian counterparts.'b'That infighting reached a crescendo during the reign of Donald Rumsfeld at the Pentagon. Mr. Rumsfeld\xe2\x80\x99s replacement, Robert Gates, a former director of central intelligence, will have the credibility \xe2\x80\x94 and we hope the will \xe2\x80\x94 to calm those rivalries and improve interagency coordination. Even then, Mr. Bush must quickly find a credible replacement for Mr. Negroponte, preferably one who is willing to jolt his bosses with the truth. This administration\xe2\x80\x99s record of failures in Iraq is matched only by its failures on intelligence.'b'Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. is embracing with gusto a cause championed by his predecessor, William Rehnquist: the need for a substantial pay raise for federal judges. Justice Roberts devoted his second annual year-end report to this issue, and it should be required reading in Congress.'b'Getting Congress to act promptly on judicial salaries may not be easy, if history is any guide. But Mr. Roberts is right to note the link between maintaining an adequate standard of judicial compensation and preserving the quality and independence of the judiciary, and to prod Congress on this issue.'b'For starters, an immediate increase in the neighborhood of 30 percent would help make up for dual blows of inflation and Congress\xe2\x80\x99s periodic withholding of cost-of-living adjustments. The last time federal judges received a substantial pay raise was 1989.'b'By statute, a sitting federal trial judge makes $165,200 a year. That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of money, the same pay as a member of Congress. But as the chief justice notes in his report, judges have fallen well behind the American labor force as a whole in keeping up with inflation. Since 1969, a judge\xe2\x80\x99s pay has declined by 23.9 percent, adjusted for inflation, while the national average for all wages rose by 17.8 percent.'b'Federal judges at every level earn significantly less than law school deans, senior law school professors, and even junior associates at some big-time law firms. There is no definitive study, but it cannot be just coincidental that federal judges are leaving the bench at an increasing rate, thereby \xe2\x80\x9cthreatening the viability of life tenure,\xe2\x80\x9d as Justice Roberts put it. Considering the impact on a future job could make judges less willing to issue unpopular rulings upholding important rights.'b'It is tempting to dismiss as hyperbole the chief justice\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of this issue as a \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional crisis.\xe2\x80\x9d But the salary issue is a serious one, touching as it does on the two constitutional provisions designed to ensure an independent judiciary \xe2\x80\x94 the one granting life tenure, and the other ensuring no reduction in judicial pay.'b'The chief justice\xe2\x80\x99s focus on judicial pay has drawn praise from Senator Patrick Leahy, the new Judiciary Committee chairman and a longtime champion of improved judicial salaries. The nation would be well-served by a comprehensive bipartisan package that grants federal judges a sizable raise, ends the linkage between judicial and Congressional salaries, and requires judges to forgo privately financed junkets that cast an ethical cloud on the courts.'b'To the Editor:'b'In  \xe2\x80\x9cEnvironmental Harmony\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 1), you fault the Bush administration for doing nothing to create or enforce a national policy on global warming, including production of fuel-efficient cars.'b'Yet the administration may be more in touch with the electorate than not, for little is done on a local level to recognize these realities.'b'In my state, billions are devoted to accommodating increased traffic without regard to global warming, fossil-fuel consumption, air pollution, land loss, road deaths, debt to foreign nations or even war to ensure access to oil.'b'But whenever there is planning for public transportation, expense is cited as the obstacle.

Bill Schrier'b'Carmel, Calif., Jan. 3, 2007'b'London'b'ONE of the pop heroes of the Iraq war was undoubtedly Muhammad Said al-Sahhaf, the unfortunate Iraqi information minister who, in his daily press conferences during the invasion, heroically denied even the most evident facts and stuck to the Iraqi line. Even with American tanks only a few hundred yards from his office, he continued to claim that the televised shots of tanks on the Baghdad streets were just Hollywood special effects.'b'In his very performance as an excessive caricature, Mr. Sahhaf thereby revealed the hidden truth of the \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d reporting: there were no refined spins in his comments, just a plain denial. There was something refreshingly liberating about his interventions, which displayed a striving to be liberated from the hold of facts and thus of the need to spin away their unpleasant aspects: his stance was, \xe2\x80\x9cWhom do you believe, your eyes or my words?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Furthermore, sometimes, he even struck a strange truth \xe2\x80\x94 when confronted with claims that Americans were in control of parts of Baghdad, he snapped back: \xe2\x80\x9cThey are not in control of anything \xe2\x80\x94 they don\xe2\x80\x99t even control themselves!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What, exactly, do they not control? Back in 1979, in her essay \xe2\x80\x9cDictatorship and Double Standards,\xe2\x80\x9d published in Commentary, Jeane J. Kirkpatrick elaborated the distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cauthoritarian\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctotalitarian\xe2\x80\x9d regimes. This concept served as the justification of the American policy of collaborating with right-wing dictators while treating Communist regimes much more harshly: authoritarian dictators are pragmatic rulers who care about their power and wealth and are indifferent toward ideological issues, even if they pay lip service to some big cause; in contrast, totalitarian leaders are selfless fanatics who believe in their ideology and are ready to put everything at stake for their ideals.'b'Her point was that, while one can deal with authoritarian rulers who react rationally and predictably to material and military threats, totalitarian leaders are much more dangerous and have to be directly confronted.'b'The irony is that this distinction encapsulates perfectly what went wrong with the United States occupation of Iraq: Saddam Hussein was a corrupt authoritarian dictator striving to keep his hold on power and guided by brutal pragmatic considerations (which led him to collaborate with the United States in the 1980s). The ultimate proof of his regime\xe2\x80\x99s secular nature is the fact that in the Iraqi elections of October 2002 \xe2\x80\x94 in which Saddam Hussein got a 100 percent endorsement, and thus overdid the best Stalinist results of 99.95 percent \xe2\x80\x94 the campaign song played again and again on all the state media was Whitney Houston\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cI Will Always Love You.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'One outcome of the American invasion is that it has generated a much more uncompromising \xe2\x80\x9cfundamentalist\xe2\x80\x9d politico-ideological constellation in Iraq. This has led to a predominance of the pro-Iranian political forces there \xe2\x80\x94 the intervention basically delivered Iraq to Iranian influence. One can imagine how, if President Bush were to be court-martialed by a Stalinist judge, he would be instantly condemned as an \xe2\x80\x9cIranian agent.\xe2\x80\x9d The violent outbursts of the recent Bush politics are thus not exercises in power, but rather exercises in panic.'b'Recall the old story about the factory worker suspected of stealing: every evening, when he was leaving work, the wheelbarrow he rolled in front of him was carefully inspected, but the guards could not find anything, it was always empty. Finally, they got the point: what the worker was stealing were the wheelbarrows themselves.'b'This is the trick being attempted by those who claim today, \xe2\x80\x9cBut the world is nonetheless better off without Saddam!\xe2\x80\x9d They forget to factor into the account the effects of the very military intervention against him. Yes, the world is better without Saddam Hussein \xe2\x80\x94 but is it better if we include into the overall picture the ideological and political effects of this very occupation?'b'The United States as a global policeman \xe2\x80\x94 why not? The post-cold-war situation effectively called for some global power to fill the void. The problem resides elsewhere: recall the common perception of the United States as a new Roman Empire. The problem with today\xe2\x80\x99s America is not that it is a new global empire, but that it is 'b'not'b' one. That is, while pretending to be an empire, it continues to act like a nation-state, ruthlessly pursuing its interests. It is as if the guiding vision of recent American politics is a weird reversal of the well-known motto of the ecologists \xe2\x80\x94 act globally, think locally.'b'After 9/11, the United States was given the opportunity to realize what kind of world it was part of. It might have used the opportunity \xe2\x80\x94 but it did not, instead opting to reassert its traditional ideological commitments: out with the responsibility and guilt with respect to the impoverished third world \xe2\x80\x94 'b'we'b' are the victims now!'b'Apropos of the Hague tribunal, the British writer Timothy Garton Ash pathetically claimed: \xe2\x80\x9cNo F\xc3\xbchrer or Duce, no Pinochet, Amin or Pol Pot, should ever again feel themselves protected from the reach of international law by the palace gates of sovereignty.\xe2\x80\x9d One should simply take note of what is missing in this series of names which, apart from the standard couple of Hitler and Mussolini, contains three third world dictators: where is at least one name from the major powers who might sleep a bit uneasily?'b'Or, closer to the standard list of the bad guys, why was there little talk of delivering Saddam Hussein or, say, Manuel Noriega to The Hague? Why was the only trial against Mr. Noriega for drug trafficking, rather than for his murderous abuses as a dictator? Was it because he would have disclosed his past ties with the C.I.A.?'b'In a similar way, Saddam Hussein\xe2\x80\x99s regime was an abominable authoritarian state, guilty of many crimes, mostly toward its own people. However, one should note the strange but key fact that, when the United States representatives and the Iraqi prosecutors were enumerating his evil deeds, they systematically omitted what was undoubtedly his greatest crime in terms of human suffering and of violating international justice: his invasion of Iran. Why? Because the United States and the majority of foreign states were actively helping Iraq in this aggression.'b'And now the United States is continuing, through other means, this greatest crime of Saddam Hussein: his never-ending attempt to topple the Iranian government. This is the price you have to pay when the struggle against the enemies is the struggle against the evil ghosts in your own closet: you don\xe2\x80\x99t even control yourself.'b'1.

Judging by Mr. Ban\xe2\x80\x99s early moves, the world has gotten exactly that.'b'Expect no Kofi Annan-style exhortations to live up to the values of the U.N. charter. In commenting on the sordid execution of Saddam Hussein, Mr. Ban even managed to forget that the U.N. opposes the death penalty on principle. Expect no shift from patronage to selection based on merit for key staff positions. The top jobs in peacekeeping, political affairs and humanitarian relief are already being doled out to the favored candidates of London, Paris and Washington (three of Mr. Ban\xe2\x80\x99s backers).'b'And expect no serious drive for much-needed administrative reform.

Under President Bush, relations between Washington and the U.N. were driven to their lowest point ever, following the twin blows of the Iraq war and the destructive presence of the former ambassador, John Bolton. The White House  reportedly plans to nominate a new ambassador, Zalmay Khalilzad, who actually believes in diplomacy.'b'Mr. Khalilzad is currently the ambassador in Baghdad, where he is one of the few American officials to try to reach out to Sunni Muslims and curb the divisively sectarian policies of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. Unfortunately, the White House \xe2\x80\x94 desperate to make Mr. Maliki look like a leader \xe2\x80\x94 decided it did not want such an activist ambassador. We hope that choosing Mr. Khalilzad for the United Nations is at least a sign that Mr. Bush is learning the importance of diplomacy and cooperation, if not the importance of a powerful U.N. leader or a strong-minded ambassador in Baghdad.'b'IN recent days, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been bombarded by requests to comment on my relationship with President Gerald Ford.

You see, I made a reputation for myself 30 years ago on \xe2\x80\x9cSaturday Night Live\xe2\x80\x9d in part because of a number of sketches and \xe2\x80\x9cWeekend Updates\xe2\x80\x9d that I wrote or appeared in ridiculing Mr. Ford for his apparent \xe2\x80\x9cstumble-bumbling\xe2\x80\x9d (though he was perhaps the best athlete to have been president) and making fun of his presidency.'b'Luckily for me, Mr. Ford had a sense of humor.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve often thought how odd it was that we became linked together. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like we had a lot in common. After all, Mr. Ford had never been helped for any problems with \xe2\x80\x9cself-medication\xe2\x80\x9d in a facility that has helped so many throughout these past decades. And he had never been castigated by the press for such atrocities as \xe2\x80\x9cOh! Heavenly Dog\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cCops and Robbersons,\xe2\x80\x9d among other slightly awful films I had made in Hollywood.'b'But linked together we were. And not just in the obvious ways. If it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for the courage of Mr. Ford\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Betty, for admitting to an alcohol problem, I would never have received the help I needed in the early 1980s at the Betty Ford clinic, located not far from the Ford residence near Palm Springs. During my short stay there, I often saw Mrs. Ford personally surveying the clinic and generously offering a helping hand to those who were lucky enough to face their problems and, with the learned help of the clinic staff, appraise their behavior and their lifestyles.'b'One day when my wife, Jayni, came to visit me at the clinic, the Fords invited us to lunch. As it happened, Mrs. Ford had become so beloved and respected by many for her earlier openness about breast cancer and her alcoholism that a television network was in preproduction on a special bio-pic about her. Mr. Ford suggested that while we ate lunch, the four of us could view the videotape of various performances by actors being considered to play the part of the president.'b'Seated at a small table set for four in a simple dining room also containing a somewhat complicated videotape recorder and TV set were the former commander in chief and I making friendly small talk before lunch was brought in. And on all fours, literally on their hands and knees in front of the bulky and confusing tape machine, were Mrs. Ford and Jayni trying their best to figure out the wiring of the playback machine and the way the whole system worked, so we could watch the screen tests. Noting the effort the ladies were putting into getting the VCR to work, I suggested to Mr. Ford that perhaps we might help them out.'b'As I began to stand up from my chair, he took gentle hold of my arm, sat me back down and said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Chevy. Don\xe2\x80\x99t even think about it.

Like many decisions on the cutting edge of agricultural technology, it was hurried along in a way that is more sensitive to political and economic pressure than to the long-term welfare of animals, humans and the world they inhabit. Asking whether cloned meat and milk are safe is not even the right question.

It marks a revolutionary shift \xe2\x80\x94 from the relative randomness of sexual reproduction to the apparent uniformity of asexual reproduction.

Talk about the recovery of threatened ethnic heritage was everywhere, the beginnings of what later evolved into the multicultural and identity movement. Politicians had been quick to grasp the movement\xe2\x80\x99s potential, and it would become a controversial issue in the subsequent presidential election.'b'I gathered from our conversation that the unusual nature of Ford\xe2\x80\x99s ascent to the presidency had prevented the normal electoral process of learning that transformed local politicians into potential statesmen, and that the discussions were a crash course substitute. The other members of the ethnicity session would be Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the future senator from New York, Nat Glazer, my colleague at Harvard, Michael Novak, a  writer and public speaker who had recently emerged as the leading ideologist of the revival, and John Higham, the historian of immigration. I was flattered to be so honored, but felt it necessary to point out that I was then the friend of and special adviser to the second most radical leader in the hemisphere, Prime Minister Michael Manley of Jamaica, who at the time was very much on the radar screen of the C.I.A. and State Department. They already knew that, but my associations were deemed irrelevant. I was impressed.'b'We met one Saturday in an airy, informal part of the White House, the room flooded with the late-morning light of early fall. The president\xe2\x80\x99s golf game had gone on a bit longer than anticipated, and as we waited I mused to myself that we were being asked to perform the intellectual version of a medieval jousting tournament. Novak would passionately defend the ethnic revival; I was strongly against it. Higham was more of my persuasion. Moynihan and Glazer were presumably the moderates, but since their recently published text, \xe2\x80\x9cBeyond the Melting Pot,\xe2\x80\x9d had rapidly become the locus classicus of the new ethnicity, it was hardly an even match.'b'The president\xe2\x80\x99s entry was refreshingly lacking in drama. There was no sudden hush, no ego filling up the room, not the slightest whiff of alpha male testosterone. He was a fine-looking man, in a Lake Wobegon sort of way. Casually dressed and relaxed in manner, he shook hands firmly, apologized for being late with a self-effacing remark about his game, then invited us to have drinks with him. He finished two martinis before lunch. Moynihan and I happily joined him, while the others discreetly held glasses filled with something else.'b'Accompanying the president was the soft-spoken young aide who had initiated and made this all possible. His shoulders hunched in a confiding way as he addressed us, and his thoughtful, collegial manner put us instantly at ease. This was Dick Cheney, the chief of staff, and I will never be able to reconcile the open, intellectually broad-minded person I met that day with the secretive \xc3\xa9minence grise of today.'b'During the discussion\xe2\x80\x99s more formal phase, I told the president that I had been drawn to America by the cosmopolitanism of its mainstream, not to seek sanctuary in an atavistic cocoon. I argued that all ethnic movements are two-edged swords. Beginning benignly, and sometimes necessary to repair injured collective psyches, they often end in tragedy, especially when they turn political, as illustrated by German history.'b'I also argued that the ethnic revival was partly a reaction against the recent gains of black Americans. Sadly, black leaders\xe2\x80\x99 shift to separatism and identity politics had legitimized this reactionary backlash against them. Whatever the president\xe2\x80\x99s personal position, I urged him to keep the state out of it.'b'Throughout our discussion the president listened attentively. He occasionally asked a question \xe2\x80\x94 nothing profound, but enough to suggest that he was following it all quite closely. As we talked over lunch it slowly dawned on me that the president\xe2\x80\x99s behavior was the most inspiring display of self-assured humility I had ever witnessed. Here he sat, the most powerful man in the world, eager to learn about his own society, even from a recent immigrant.'b'He was a man at peace with himself. Uncomplicated but without a trace of shallowness; calm, dignified and quietly engaging, a person you would like to be your friend.'b'An Op-Ed article on Friday about notable anniversaries this year misspelled the name of a former Soviet premier.

California\xe2\x80\x99s Barbara Boxer is the new chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, replacing James Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who regards global warming as an elaborate hoax drummed up by environmentalists and scientists in search of money. Ms. Boxer has already scheduled hearings, and there will be no shortage of legislative remedies to consider. All share one objective, which is to attach a cost to carbon dioxide through a cap on emissions.'b'The underlying logic is that if people and industries are made to pay for the privilege of pumping these gases into the atmosphere, they will inevitably be driven to developer cleaner fuels, cleaner cars and cleaner factories.'b'This is the path most developed countries have chosen. Europe has imposed caps on industrial emissions, and European companies have begun investing in new technologies and cleaner factories in places like China, partly as a way to meet their own obligations to cut emissions and partly as a way to lead China to a greener future.'b'These hearings need to be conducted in a thoughtful manner. There has been enough noise, from the Inhofe right and from the doomsayers who see each hurricane as a sign the apocalypse is upon us.

Rasooly'b'Silver Spring, Md., Dec. 26, 2006'b'ONCE again, I am driving, under the blazing equatorial sun, down an uncomfortable, rutty relic of a road into the interior of central Borneo. With me are two uniformed police men, one armed with a machine gun. The landscape is bleak, no trees, no shade as far as the eye can see. Our mission is to confiscate orangutan orphans whose mothers have been killed as a result of the sweeping forest clearance taking place throughout Borneo.'b'Many years ago, Louis Leakey, the great paleo-anthropologist whose work at Olduvai Gorge and other sites in East Africa revolutionized our knowledge of human origins, encouraged me to study wild orangutans  \xe2\x80\x94 just as he had encouraged Jane Goodall to study chimpanzees and Dian Fossey to study gorillas. Later, he laughingly called us the \xe2\x80\x9ctrimates,\xe2\x80\x9d or the three primates.'b'Orangutans are not as well known as chimpanzees and gorillas. But like their African cousins, orangutans are great apes, our closest living relatives in the animal kingdom, and the most intelligent animals, with the exception of humans, to have evolved on land. Orangutans are reclusive, semi-solitary, quiet, highly arboreal and red, facts that come as a surprise to some people. Their name is derived from the Malay words \xe2\x80\x9corang hutan,\xe2\x80\x9d which literally mean \xe2\x80\x9cperson of the forest.\xe2\x80\x9d And it is the orangutan\xe2\x80\x99s profound connection to the forest that is driving it to extinction.'b'Without forests, orangutans cannot survive. They spend more than 95 percent of their time in the trees, which, along with vines and termites, provide more than 99 percent of their food. Two forests  form their only habitat, and they are the tropical rain forests of Borneo and Sumatra.'b'Sumatra is exclusively Indonesian, as is the two thirds of the island of Borneo known as Kalimantan. That places 80 to 90 percent of the orangutan population, which numbers only 40,000 to 50,000, in Indonesia, with the remainder in Malaysian Borneo. What happens in Indonesia, particularly Kalimantan, will determine the orangutan\xe2\x80\x99s future.'b'When I first arrived in Central Kalimantan in 1971, orangutans were already endangered because of poaching (for the pet trade and for the cooking pot) and deforestation (by loggers and by villagers making way for gardens and rice fields).'b'But it was all relatively small-time. The forests of Kalimantan were vast \xe2\x80\x94 Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s are the second largest tropical rain forests in the world, after Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 and forest conversion rates small. People still used axes and saws to cut down trees and traveled by dugout canoes or small boats with inboard engines.'b'I went straight to work, beginning a wild orangutan study that continues to this day, and establishing an orangutan rehabilitation program, the first in Kalimantan, which has returned more than 300 ex-captive orangutans to the wild.'b'But the wild is increasingly difficult to find. In the late 1980s, as it entered the global economy, Indonesia decided to become a major producer and exporter of palm oil, pulp and paper. Before this, the government had endorsed selective logging. Now vast areas of forest were slated for conversion to plantations to grow trees for palm oil and paper production. Monster-sized bulldozers, replacing the chain saws of the early logging boom, tore up the forest, clear-cutting as many as 250,000 acres at once for palm oil plantations.'b'At the same time, the price of wood, particularly the valuable hardwoods that grow in Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s rain forests and fetch a high price on the black market, increased. Illegal logging became rampant, even in national parks and reserves.'b'While illegal logging degrades the forest, plantations absolutely destroy it. And the destruction is not only immediate, but also long-term. Forest-clearing leaves huge amounts of dry branches and other wood litter on forest floors; a small spark can ignite enormous forest fires, particularly in times of drought. During the 1997 El Ni\xc3\xb1o drought, approximately 25 million acres, an area about half the size of Oklahoma, burned in Indonesia. Thousands of orangutans died.'b'Indonesia has achieved its goal of becoming one of the two largest palm-oil producers and exporters in the world. But at what cost? At least half of the world\xe2\x80\x99s wild orangutans have disappeared in the last 20 years; biologically viable populations of orangutans have been radically reduced in size and number; and 80 percent of the orangutan habitat has either been depopulated or totally destroyed. The trend shows no sign of abating: government maps of future planned land use show more of the same, on an increasing scale.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re back in the jeep. The police view the trip inland as a success. They confiscated five orangutans and one woman volunteered her crab-eating macaque, an unprotected species. Two of the orangutan owners, both women, shed tears, but we invited them to visit their \xe2\x80\x9cpets\xe2\x80\x9d at the Orangutan Foundation International\xe2\x80\x99s Care Center and Quarantine, where they will be rehabilitated and eventually released to the wild.'b'I am pleased to think that five more orphan orangutans will once again feel the branches and leaves under their feet as they swing through the trees. Yet I am somewhat melancholy. The fragile forests that make orangutan life possible are fast disappearing. Where, I wonder, are the billionaire philanthropists and the international policies that will prevent orangutans \xe2\x80\x94 and all great apes \xe2\x80\x94 from going extinct?'b'Indonesia is a vast, densely populated country where millions live in or near poverty. The temptation to exploit natural resources to feed people today, never mind tomorrow, and to expand the economy, is great. And the plantations are but one example. Surface-mining of gold in the alluvial fans of white sand has been practiced for two decades, leaving virtual moonscapes near the National Park where I work. Now zircon mining has entrenched itself all over Central Kalimantan, with each zircon mine obliterating 1,000 acres of rain forest. Two years ago nobody, myself included, even knew what zircon was.'b'The international community must recognize that it has some responsibility for what happens to the great rain forests of Indonesian Borneo. Foreign investment in local development programs needs to be expanded. Village level projects, like the one financed by the United States Agency for International Development and run by Boston-based World Education near where I work, have empowered farmers, strengthened village economies and employed local people, giving them a stake in preserving the forest.'b'We need more of these programs. Indonesia could also impose a special tax on companies that profit from rain forest destruction, with the revenues dedicated to forest and orangutan conservation. Proper labeling of palm oil content could allow a consumer boycott of soap, crackers, cookies and other products that contain it. Finally, Indonesia needs to be more vigorous in enforcing the excellent laws it already has to protect its forests.'b'When I arrived in 1971, Borneo was almost a Garden of Eden, the most remote place on earth. Now it has been drawn into the global economy, one government decision, one business plan at a time. But the destruction of Borneo\xe2\x80\x99s forests and the extinction of the orangutans are not inevitable. It is possible to protect our ancient heritage and closest of kin \xe2\x80\x94 one orangutan, one national park, one piece of irreplaceable forest at a time. We only need to decide to do it.'b'Gov. Eliot Spitzer is fond of saying that you can\xe2\x80\x99t change the world by whispering. What New Yorkers saw in his first week in office was a governor in full trumpet about how to overhaul their state government. While some veterans of state politics saw Mr. Spitzer\xe2\x80\x99s State of the State speech on Wednesday as too ambitious, former Gov.  Hugh Carey got it just right. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very big agenda,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s not too big for New York.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We are still in the promising stage, of course, and the real test will begin later this month with Mr. Spitzer\xe2\x80\x99s first executive budget. But he has begun by laying down a number of important, and sensible, markers. On health care, he wants insurance for all children. He hopes to find some of the money to do this by consolidating hospitals and shifting patients from nursing homes to at-home care.'b'On education, Mr. Spitzer says he wants to spread money out more fairly to students who most need it. Suburban lawmakers whose schools are favored by the current formula will object. But he may win them over with his plan to lower property taxes that fall heavily on middle-class suburbanites.'b'He made a strong pitch for economic revitalization upstate, a familiar but elusive goal of a long line of New York politicians.'b'Mr. Spitzer also proposed a series of reforms that are certain to rile legislators accustomed to lifetime tenure in Albany. He intends to create a nonpartisan redistricting commission and vowed to veto any future district lines that are gerrymandered to make elections uncompetitive. And he wants to \xe2\x80\x9creplace the weakest campaign finance laws in the nation with the strongest.\xe2\x80\x9d That means lowering contribution limits and providing public financing so that moneyed interests can no longer buy political clout.'b'Also on Mr. Spitzer\xe2\x80\x99s ambitious to-do list, and appropriately so, are restructuring the courts and organizing the overlapping local governments across the state.'b'Mr. Spitzer faces two major hurdles. One is finding top-flight appointees to make these proposals a reality. One of the most important sales jobs he has now is convincing enough good people that working for government wages is worth it to help reinvent such a powerful state government. Mr. Spitzer\xe2\x80\x99s other challenge will be getting the Legislature to go along. Much of his speech was met with an odd silence from lawmakers. Perhaps it was the way Mr. Spitzer carved out new political territory that does not entirely cater to upstate Republicans or downstate Democrats. But it may simply be that they do not yet know what to make of all that urgency, all those promises, all that work.'b'Mr. Spitzer certainly acts like a man ready to go forward quickly. The goals he has set may be daunting to the old guard in Albany, but anything less from this governor would have been a grave disappointment.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c100 Years Later, the Food Industry Is Still \xe2\x80\x98The Jungle\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d (Editorial Observer, Jan. 2):'b'I take issue with Adam Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of my book \xe2\x80\x9cThe Death of Common Sense\xe2\x80\x9d when he suggests that it argues \xe2\x80\x9cthat laws like a New York ordinance requiring restaurants to clean dishes in a way that kills salmonella are somehow an infringement on liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d The book argues not against regulation but for more flexible regulation that allows the use of judgment by government officials.'b'Far from being a tract for conservatives, the book was embraced by leaders of both parties, including Vice President Al Gore in his reinventing government initiative.

This newspaper ran a story comparing Domino\xe2\x80\x99s mass-produced creation with the legendary coal-oven pies made by Totonno\xe2\x80\x99s in Coney Island. Food blogs were filled with indignant commentary about what makes a real Brooklyn pizza.'b'At Brooklyn Law School, our first reaction was to speculate that perhaps our borough\xe2\x80\x99s cuisine deserved to be protected with laws similar to those that protect unique regional foods in Europe. Champagne can be made only in a certain region in France, just as Parmesan can be made only in a certain part of Italy. Sparkling wine from Spain cannot be called Champagne, no matter how good it is, and cheese from Holland cannot be called Parmesan, even if no one could distinguish it from the real thing.'b'But the truth is, pizza in Brooklyn is not like these foods or wines. To gain special protections for the names of their places of origin, gastronomic products must be produced in a certain way, often with ingredients from a certain locale. Pizza that receives the approval of the Associazione Vera Pizza Napoletana need not come from Naples (at least one restaurant in New York has been approved), but it must be made a certain way, and its mozzarella, for example, must come from water buffalo in the region between Naples and Rome.'b'Pizza in Brooklyn, on the other hand, is extremely diverse. Some of it is sublime, and some of it is merely average. There is no single feature that characterizes it (not even the use of a coal-fired oven). We\xe2\x80\x99d like to think that what defines Brooklyn-style pizza is that it is simply good pizza.'b'And that is just the point. No one in Brooklyn has claimed that the borough is home to its own pizza varietal; Domino\xe2\x80\x99s, based in Ann Arbor, Mich., invented that idea with its ad campaign. And in order to get that campaign to work, Domino\xe2\x80\x99s had to invent an entire ersatz Brooklyn.'b'According to Domino\xe2\x80\x99s Web site and television ads, the essence of a Brooklyn-style pizza is twofold: first, the people who eat it embody crude ethnic stereotypes, and second, its slices are so large that they must be folded to be eaten. The part of the Web site devoted to teaching America the three Brooklyn \xe2\x80\x9cmethods\xe2\x80\x9d of folding a slice is obviously supposed to be parody, not anthropology. But parody of what?'b'Since it had nothing authentic to use as a context for its new pizza, Domino\xe2\x80\x99s took advantage of a handful of canned stereotypes: loud Italian-Americans, a boom-box-listening African-American and a cabdriver with a vaguely foreign accent who says things like, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re the boss, boss!\xe2\x80\x9d These characters are supposed to \xe2\x80\x9cteach\xe2\x80\x9d you how to eat pizza like \xe2\x80\x9cyou were from the neighborhood.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'One might say that the turn to stereotyping was inevitable. Domino\xe2\x80\x99s wanted to market a product that had the look and feel of something deeply rooted in place and tradition, and in the case of pizza, that just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist in Brooklyn. Brooklyn is too complex and diverse to produce a food shared by every neighborhood.'b'The truth is, today there is no single Brooklyn style for anything, and that is one of Brooklyn\xe2\x80\x99s strengths. Excluded from the Domino\xe2\x80\x99s distillation of Brooklyn\xe2\x80\x99s essence are a lot of people: the artists of Williamsburg and Red Hook, the Haitian-Americans of Flatbush and young families fleeing Manhattan in search of backyards, to take but a few examples. Efforts to capitalize on Brooklyn\xe2\x80\x99s name that do not recognize the borough\xe2\x80\x99s diversity are not just silly. They show a certain degree of disrespect for Brooklyn.'b'If one looks at this from the perspective of cultural respect, then the law might actually play a role. Federal trademark legislation prohibits the registration of disparaging symbols. If Domino\xe2\x80\x99s were to register \xe2\x80\x9cBrooklyn Style\xe2\x80\x9d pizza and the symbolism that accompanies it, the borough could respond with the same kind of outrage as prompted a petition to cancel registration of the Washington Redskins trademark on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9credskins\xe2\x80\x9d stereotyped Native Americans as \xe2\x80\x9caggressive savages or buffoons.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The test is this: Does a substantial portion of the designated group find the symbolism degrading? For Domino\xe2\x80\x99s stereotypes, Brooklynites\xe2\x80\x99 answer may well be a resounding \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Minneapolis'b'THE Senate has been seated, and we have a new senator, Amy Klobuchar.

There was a huge turnout in Minnesota.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge Bush hit the trifecta,\xe2\x80\x9d I say. \xe2\x80\x9cIraq, corruption and incompetence.\xe2\x80\x9d I dig into my huevos. \xe2\x80\x9cFailure follows failure. The Republic Party will take years to recover from this. Al Franken thinks George Bush won\xe2\x80\x99t even be invited to the 2008 convention. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.

They\xe2\x80\x99ve calmed down a little.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I speak up. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, there\xe2\x80\x99s no winter here; the roads are clear.

It\xe2\x80\x99s creepy.

A big part of the problem: property taxes.'b'Unlike New York, Connecticut has no county governments. As a result, its towns rely more heavily on property taxes than perhaps any others in the nation. This may be fine for New Yorkers who are wealthy enough to invest in weekend homes within driving range of Manhattan, but it creates a heavy financial burden on low-income families. This inequity could be greatly ameliorated if Connecticut were to adopt a resident homeowner tax exemption like those already in place in other states, including Massachusetts, Texas, Illinois and Georgia.'b'A homeowner tax exemption is usually a fixed amount that is deducted from the assessment of every eligible property before its real estate tax is set. The initial impact of a Connecticut town adopting a resident homeowner tax exemption would be to reduce the town\xe2\x80\x99s grand list, or tax base, by the total amount of the exemptions. Then, because exemptions don\xe2\x80\x99t reduce the town\xe2\x80\x99s budget, the property tax rate must be raised to cover town expenses unless the state provides aid to compensate the town for the exemptions.'b'An across-the-board homeowner exemption would lower the relative burden of property taxes on lower-valued properties. Because the owners of lower-valued properties also tend to have low incomes, much of the benefit from any homeowner tax exemption would flow to low-income homeowners.'b'The benefit can be enhanced by targeting the exemptions on residents with low incomes. This would be especially appropriate in Connecticut because the state\xe2\x80\x99s income tax law already provides a tax credit of up to $500  to anyone who pays at least that much in real estate taxes. To benefit from this credit, a taxpayer must owe at least as much income tax as the credit.  But families with incomes below $24,000 are exempt from income taxes, and thus get no benefit from the state\xe2\x80\x99s property tax credit. A targeted homeowner tax exemption would help compensate for this omission.'b'Before Connecticut towns could adopt a resident homeowner tax exemption, the State Legislature would have to enact enabling legislation. There are many forms that such legislation might take, but the most feasible would be a law that allowed \xe2\x80\x9chome rule,\xe2\x80\x9d which essentially allows localities discretion in whether to accept a homeowner tax exemption. Thus, a town could offer a homeowner tax exemption only if its residents voted to do so.'b'How would a homeowner tax exemption work in Connecticut? As a test, I calculated how it might apply to Cornwall, the small rural town where I live. I used data from the town\xe2\x80\x99s grand list and the mill rate, which is the property tax rate voted on by the town\xe2\x80\x99s finance board to support the town budget. Cornwall has about 800 dwellings, about 600 occupied on a year-round basis and the others by weekenders. I assumed that a homeowner tax exemption of $50,000 would be targeted so as to apply only to the 150 lowest-assessed properties occupied year-round.'b'The exemption would cut the annual property tax on the median of these lowest-assessed properties in half, from just over $2,000 to about $1,000. It would cost the state about $150,000 to provide financial aid to Cornwall to compensate for the benefit. However, if state aid was not forthcoming, the town would have to distribute the cost of the exemption among all taxpayers, which would mean a 3 percent increase in taxes.'b'Cornwall has a property tax rate that is among the lowest in Connecticut (just over 21 mills, or about 2 percent of the assessment). It also has a substantial number of generally well-off weekend and year-round residents who would probably not strongly oppose a 3 percent increase in their taxes. Cornwall is a fairly typical town for the northwest corner of Litchfield County, but other towns in the state might not choose to adopt a homeowner tax exemption, or might adopt it in a less targeted form \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s why home rule is essential.'b'Inevitably, rural towns across Connecticut are going to continue to rely heavily on property taxes to meet their budget needs, and as a result low-income families are going to continue to suffer. Giving the towns some independence by allowing them to implement a targeted homeowner tax exemption would help make rural towns more affordable for their more hard-pressed residents.'b'The Long Island Rail Road concourse at Pennsylvania Station has at least a dozen places where a commuter can get liquored up for the ride home. Two are saloons, one is a wine shop, and the rest are simple ice-filled plastic bins next to the magazine racks and popcorn machines. The bins overflow with cans, bottles and, for the powerhouse drinker, 24-ounce aluminum hogsheads. A $10 bill will buy you so many supersize Budweisers that the clerk has to double the plastic shopping bag, leaving just enough change for popcorn.'b'The easy abundance of alcohol makes the Long Island Rail Road\xe2\x80\x99s old tradition of selling beer and mixed drinks on train platforms look hopelessly redundant \xe2\x80\x94 not so much a needed convenience as an all-out effort to make sure absolutely no one gets on board without the opportunity for a good, early buzz. If you ride the railroad often, you know how little \xe2\x80\x94 or how seldom \xe2\x80\x94 it seems to think of you, the customer. But in this one area \xe2\x80\x94 unlike those having to do with lateness, dirty cars, broken toilets and cellphone idiots \xe2\x80\x94 the railroad is quite sensitive to a rider\xe2\x80\x99s needs. A drinking rider\xe2\x80\x99s, that is.'b'Which raises a question: What about everyone else, especially those who hate riding in filthy cars with loud, sloppy drunks, hearing the ugly slurch of shoe soles on sticky train floors and dodging rolling bottles and tributaries of beer foam? There seems to be enough alcohol spilling around without the railroad adding to it.'b'Mitch Pally, a Metropolitan Transportation Authority board member, recently floated the idea of banning alcohol outright on the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North. His concern was for safety, since drunken riders presumably turn into drunken drivers. His proposal has been banished to task-force land, where it will presumably die. The idea of a dry commuter railroad has many enemies, particularly at Metro-North, which has a longstanding fleet of bar cars and recently ordered new ones.'b'It may be impossible to turn the commuter railroads, like the New York City subways, into alcohol-free zones. Too many riders treasure a cold beer (or two or three) as a small balm for the indignities of a hard workday and long commuting trip.'b'Going dry would be a huge cultural shift. But the same used to be said about smoking cars, and we doubt that many riders nowadays pine for the return of those rolling hazmat wagons, except for the jittery people who cluster by the doors long before their stops, fingering their lighters and cigarette packs.'b'Yes, the commuting life is saturated in alcohol. But there is no compelling reason that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority should be part of it. It should forgo the paltry income from its liquor operations \xe2\x80\x94 about $350,000 a year \xe2\x80\x94 and focus on improving its other operations. To put it another way: a railroad that cannot keep its bathrooms clean should probably not be selling  beer.'b'ALTHOUGH the New York State Department of Education bans corporal punishment, each year it uses taxpayer money to send dozens of children with emotional or learning disabilities to schools that use physically and mentally abusive forms of behavior modification. These include electric shocks, seclusion and sleep and food deprivation. Because these punishments are euphemized as \xe2\x80\x9caversive therapy,\xe2\x80\x9d they have until recently stayed under the department\xe2\x80\x99s radar.'b'But this summer, the New York State Board of Regents decided to regulate the use of such measures. Thankfully, the proposed new rules, which the Regents are scheduled to enact this week, ban aversive treatment after 2009. Unfortunately, however, for this school year and the two that follow, young New Yorkers who receive a \xe2\x80\x9cchild specific exemption\xe2\x80\x9d will still be subject to some of these therapies, and those who get this treatment now could continue to receive it after 2009.'b'This is a mistake. Aversive therapy for children should be banned immediately here in New York and nationwide. Though corporal punishment can sometimes produce compliance among unruly children, history shows that regulators cannot prevent it from being applied dangerously and inappropriately.'b'The new regulation was spurred by a $10 million lawsuit filed by a Long Island mother last spring. Her teenage son, who has learning disabilities, had been placed by the state in the Judge Rotenberg Center, a private boarding school for special-education students in Massachusetts that uses electric shocks delivered directly to the skin to change behavior. After leaving the center, the boy was hospitalized for post-traumatic stress disorder, which the lawsuit alleges resulted from his treatment at the school.'b'In May, New York investigators made an unannounced visit to Rotenberg, where about 150 New Yorkers are enrolled. There, they found that shocks were being administered for such minor infractions as \xe2\x80\x9cnagging\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfailing to maintain a neat appearance.\xe2\x80\x9d A state survey discovered that nine schools used by the state for troubled children also use aversive therapy.'b'Proponents of these institutions claim that they have no alternative. Testimonials describe Rotenberg as \xe2\x80\x9clife-saving.\xe2\x80\x9d In one instance, family members said it ended the daily self-destructive behavior of a child who once needed brain surgery after deliberately slamming his skull into a sharp object; in others, parents say it stopped head-banging so severe that it had caused near-blindness.'b'If aversive therapies were limited to extreme cases and backed by strong evidence, they might make sense. But no controlled research supports aversive therapy over positive alternatives like medical and reward-based treatments. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, it\xe2\x80\x99s far from given that these schools are staffed by highly trained professionals. For instance, Rotenberg was fined late last year by the state of Massachusetts for falsely reporting some staff qualifications.'b'At a cost of more than $200,000 a year per student, it arguably makes more sense for the state to pay for live-in aides to treat children with gentler and proven alternatives at home.'b'More to the point, New York faces a tremendous challenge in policing these schools, particularly those that are out of state. Take the Elan School in Poland, Maine, which New York uses as an emergency placement for emotionally and learning-disabled students and which has applied to the state for permission to use aversive therapy.'b'At Elan, which was founded by a former heroin addict and a psychiatrist in 1970, counseling involves attack therapy \xe2\x80\x9cencounter groups\xe2\x80\x9d led by students. Three former students who attended Elan in the last five years told me that participants physically discipline one another and are often made to stay up all night.'b'Elan is probably best known for allegedly having produced a murder confession from Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel in the late 70s after he was subjected to a \xe2\x80\x9ctherapy\xe2\x80\x9d called the ring, in which the victim is given boxing gloves, hemmed in by a circle of students and pounded by fresh opponents until he or she submits.'b'Elan officials told Maine regulators that it stopped using \xe2\x80\x9cthe ring\xe2\x80\x9d in 2000, but Daniel Grossman, who attended Elan from 1999 to 2002, said he witnessed it after that time. Through its lawyer, Elan said that any charges of abuse from former students are \xe2\x80\x9cnot accurate.\xe2\x80\x9d A state investigation by Maine in 2002 cleared the school. New York officials recently conducted an unannounced inspection, but the results are not yet public.'b'Nonetheless, the fact that any school serving disturbed children would consider electric shocks, beatings,  isolation, restraints and food deprivation as  appropriate punishments illustrates the inherent danger in allowing aversive tactics. Once permitted, they tend to expand from emergency measures to everyday abuse.'b'According to the New York Department of Education, the state will be able to educate troubled children by 2009 with nonaversive measures. But since proven alternatives exist, there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to risk another minute \xe2\x80\x94 let alone two years \xe2\x80\x94 of abuse.'b'Connecticut prides itself on being green, but falls short when it comes to recycling. To its credit, the State Department of Environmental Protection updated Connecticut\xe2\x80\x99s solid waste management plan last month for the first time since 1991. The result is a report that recommends that the state nearly double its recycling rate by 2024, to 58 percent from 30 percent.'b'It will not be easy. The state has a mishmash of garbage collection systems, with various private haulers collecting most towns\xe2\x80\x99 trash. The towns complain that the burden of trash disposal falls on local shoulders, and that the state does not help much. That should not continue.'b'The report conveys how much more could be done to improve and increase recycling. A mere 7 percent of Connecticut\xe2\x80\x99s bulky waste, composed largely of construction debris, is recycled; nearly three-quarters is sent to Ohio or Pennsylvania. Also, there is no recycling program for electronics, so the mountain of junk that households accumulate \xe2\x80\x94 like broken cellphones and old computers \xe2\x80\x94 just takes up landfill space. Finally, the state must do a better job of helping local governments instead of handing down mandates, then tying everyone up in red tape.'b'The report has many good suggestions, but two need emphasis:'b'\xc2\xb6Institute pay-per-bag systems for trash collection. These measures are often unpopular because they force residents to purchase special bags for trash. But they increase recycling significantly because paying fees for trash bags brings out the tightwad in just about everyone.'b'\xc2\xb6The state should apply unclaimed bottle deposits, which amount to millions of dollars, to recycling, instead of giving them to the industry as it has done for more than 25 years. Bottling companies claim that it costs them 7 cents to collect each used beer and soda container returned to stores, and the uncollected deposits help offset those costs.'b'The legislature has for years refused to revisit this issue with anything other than unrecorded voice votes for fear of angering the powerful lobby involved. But members last year found the gumption to oppose the bottling interests in banning soda from public schools. They should reconsider using the uncollected bottle deposits as a way to pay for increased recycling, as other states do.'b'For nearly five years, the Diocese of Bridgeport has been fighting to keep secret thousands of documents that detail how it handled 23 sex-abuse cases settled in 2001. Several newspapers, among them The Times, have gone to court repeatedly to argue that the documents involved should be public. Last month Judge Jon Alander of the Superior Court dismissed the diocese\xe2\x80\x99s latest attempt to keep the cases sealed. The diocese announced it would appeal Judge Alander\xe2\x80\x99s ruling on 19 different grounds.'b'In a democracy, any person or institution can appeal almost anything, so this case may not be resolved for years. But the diocese\xe2\x80\x99s sanctimonious statement in reply to Judge Alander\xe2\x80\x99s decision is so outrageous it should not go unanswered.'b'In that brief response, the diocese justified its campaign to keep the records closed on the basis of promoting the privacy and well-being of the 'b'victims'b'. It also said, \xe2\x80\x9creopening and exposing long-settled cases, extensively covered by the media, to renewed public scrutiny is not a productive way to achieve the healing and resolution that the community seeks.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yet the lawyer for the victims has told the court, as early as 2002, that none of them \xe2\x80\x94 not one \xe2\x80\x94 objected to release of the more than 900 documents involved. That the diocese would dare to use the welfare of the victims to justify keeping secret the crimes of the clergy against them is downright Orwellian.'b'Church officials have also taken pains to point out that releasing the records could threaten the right to a fair trial of defendants in two of the cases in which there is pending litigation. But, as Judge Alander wrote, reasonable alternatives exist to adequately protect such rights short of keeping secret all 23 cases and more than 12,000 pages of information.'b'The Diocese of Bridgeport covers all of Fairfield County, where 51 percent of the population \xe2\x80\x94 more than 450,000 people \xe2\x80\x94 is Catholic. The diocese is spending enormous amounts of time and money to keep from its own the shameful details of how it sheltered child molesters. If there is any justice, the State Supreme Court should quickly dispense with this latest appeal. The diocese should not be allowed to lock out the public indefinitely. And common decency should have prevented the diocese from attempting to justify its actions in the name of caring for victims whom its clergy molested.'b'After years of live and let thrive in the back rooms of New York\xe2\x80\x99s state capital, there is suddenly a pack of official watchdogs on full alert for scandal. The test will be whether all this high-minded energy produces real reform of Albany\xe2\x80\x99s undemocratic and unethical ways instead of the windy press releases to which we have grown accustomed.'b'In recent months, almost any time a real gumshoe has scratched beneath the surface of New York\xe2\x80\x99s state lawmaking business, somebody has gotten into trouble. The comptroller has been forced to resign. The Senate majority leader is under investigation. Another state senator has been indicted.'b'There are two big reasons for this investigative fever. One is the new governor himself. Eliot Spitzer won by a landslide last year largely on promises of reform and openness and a new day. The other is that the landscape is suddenly chockablock with local, state and federal investigators who seem to be gaining momentum by the hour.'b'One key figure to have emerged from the shadows is the Albany County district attorney, David Soares, a Democrat elected in 2004. After a slow start, Mr. Soares trained his searchlight on Albany\xe2\x80\x99s secretive state offices a few months ago, and he played an important role in Alan Hevesi\xe2\x80\x99s resignation as state comptroller.'b'A replacement for Mr. Hevesi must now be found. One hopes that Sheldon Silver and other bigwigs remember that this is not a patronage job and that it demands someone of courage and independence. Mr. Soares, meanwhile, has made it clear that despite a thin staff he intends to take a harder look at business as usual in the State Capitol.'b'Andrew Cuomo, the new attorney general, also campaigned on cleaning up Albany\xe2\x80\x99s legislative stables. A few days after taking office, Mr. Cuomo announced plans to investigate member items, the hidden pots of cash that members of the Legislature dip into for personal favors and pet projects. A judge has now ordered legislators to release details of how these funds, amounting to $170 million a year, are actually distributed, which should provide some idea of who has been using tax money to further legitimate public purposes and who has been using it to reward special friends and corporate donors.'b'Then there is David Grandeau, executive director of the Temporary State Commission on Lobbying, who has already made his name investigating abuses of the state\xe2\x80\x99s porous lobbying laws. He has laid about him with nonpartisan zeal, pursuing politicians in both parties, and until the day he is succeeded by somebody even more fearless and independent, he must continue his crusade.'b'All this enthusiasm for reform makes it important to distinguish real reformers from the charlatans. Albany is full of Potemkin offices staffed by toothless investigators who keep their jobs by basically not doing them. And the ethics committees for the legislative and executive branches are basically self-policing groups that seldom get around to doing the necessary police work.'b'Equally useless is the State Commission on Investigation, which theoretically has broad powers to investigate \xe2\x80\x9cany matter concerning public peace, public safety and public justice.\xe2\x80\x9d In practice the commission is a sham, its members consisting largely of cronies of the politically powerful who do little to earn their annual salaries of $100,000 a year.'b'The newest member of the commission is John Cahill, George Pataki\xe2\x80\x99s loyal chief of staff, whom the former governor named to the commission as he was headed out the door. The energetic Mr. Cahill insists that he will take his part-time job seriously, and if this is so he could well add an important Republican voice to the reform chorus, which is now largely Democratic.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s obvious that lots of people have the power to look under the rocks in Albany. They just haven\xe2\x80\x99t been doing enough of the heavy lifting until now.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Second Thoughts on Gays in the Military'b',\xe2\x80\x9d by Gen. John M.

They were there because Mr. Tester, campaigning for government honesty and attention to the concerns of \xe2\x80\x9cregular folks,\xe2\x80\x9d had unseated the Republican incumbent, Conrad Burns, in a cliffhanger that helped deliver the Senate to the Democratic Party.'b'And now what?'b'Undoubtedly, Mr. Tester\xe2\x80\x99s rhetoric and style \xe2\x80\x94 he might always look a little wrong in a business suit \xe2\x80\x94 will tempt continuing comparisons to the barmy screen version of the gentleman from Montana.

But I think we can be forgiven for anticipating the exceptional. After all, we sent lean and plain-spoken Mike Mansfield, the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s longest-serving majority leader and a pivotal force behind civil rights legislation, the Watergate investigation and opposition to the Vietnam War. Decades earlier, we sent Congress its first female member, Republican Jeannette Rankin, the only person to vote against United States entry into not one, but two, world wars. We sent Thomas J.

Out of the tunnel, out in the lit-up day, it\xe2\x80\x99s different.

Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney then embarked on an expansion of presidential power chilling both in its sweep and in the damage it did to the constitutional system of checks and balances.'b'In 2006, the voters sent Mr. Bush a powerful message that it was time to rein in his imperial ambitions. But we have yet to see any sign that Mr. Bush understands that \xe2\x80\x94 or even realizes that the Democrats are now in control of the Congress. Indeed, he seems to have interpreted his party\xe2\x80\x99s drubbing as a mandate to keep pursuing his fantasy of victory in Iraq and to press ahead undaunted with his assault on civil liberties and the judicial system. Just before the Christmas break, the Justice Department served notice to Senator Patrick Leahy \xe2\x80\x94 the new chairman of the Judiciary Committee \xe2\x80\x94 that it intended to keep stonewalling Congressional inquiries into Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s inhumane and unconstitutional treatment of prisoners taken in anti-terrorist campaigns. It refused to hand over two documents, including one in which Mr. Bush authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to establish secret prisons beyond the reach of American law or international treaties. The other set forth the interrogation methods authorized in these prisons \xe2\x80\x94 which we now know ranged from abuse to outright torture.'b'Also last month, Mr. Bush issued another of his infamous \xe2\x80\x9cpresidential signing statements,\xe2\x80\x9d which he has used scores of times to make clear he does not intend to respect the requirements of a particular law \xe2\x80\x94 in this case a little-noticed Postal Service bill. The statement suggested that Mr. Bush does not believe the government must obtain a court order before opening Americans\xe2\x80\x99 first-class mail. It said the administration had the right to \xe2\x80\x9cconduct searches in exigent circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d which include not only protecting lives, but also unspecified \xe2\x80\x9cforeign intelligence collection.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The law is clear on this. A warrant is required to open Americans\xe2\x80\x99 mail under a statute that was passed to stop just this sort of abuse using just this sort of pretext. But then again, the law is also clear on the need to obtain a warrant before intercepting Americans\xe2\x80\x99 telephone calls and e-mail. Mr. Bush began openly defying that law after Sept. 11, 2001, authorizing the National Security Agency to eavesdrop without a court order on calls and e-mail between the United States and other countries.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2'b'News accounts have also reminded us of the shameful state of American military prisons, where supposed terrorist suspects are kept without respect for civil or human rights, and on the basis of evidence so deeply tainted by abuse, hearsay or secrecy that it is essentially worthless.'b'Deborah Sontag wrote in The Times last week about the sorry excuse for a criminal case that the administration whipped up against Jose Padilla, who was once \xe2\x80\x94 but no longer is \xe2\x80\x94 accused of plotting to explode a radioactive \xe2\x80\x9cdirty bomb\xe2\x80\x9d in the United States. Mr. Padilla was held for two years without charges or access to a lawyer. Then, to avoid having the Supreme Court review Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s power grab, the administration dropped those accusations and charged Mr. Padilla in a criminal court on hazy counts of lending financial support to terrorists.'b'But just as the government abandoned the \xe2\x80\x9cdirty bomb\xe2\x80\x9d case against Mr. Padilla, it quietly charged an Ethiopian-born man, Binyam Mohamed, with conspiring with Mr. Padilla to commit that very crime. Unlike Mr. Padilla, Mr. Mohamed is not a United States citizen, so the administration threw him into Guant\xc3\xa1namo. Now 28, he is still being held there as an \xe2\x80\x9cillegal enemy combatant\xe2\x80\x9d under the anti-constitutional military tribunals act that was rushed through the Republican-controlled Congress just before last November\xe2\x80\x99s elections.'b'Mr. Mohamed was a target of another favorite Bush administration practice: \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary rendition,\xe2\x80\x9d in which foreign citizens are snatched off the streets of their hometowns and secretly shipped to countries where they can be abused and tortured on behalf of the American government. Mr. Mohamed \xe2\x80\x94 whose name appears nowhere in either of the cases against Mr. Padilla \xe2\x80\x94 has said he was tortured in Morocco until he signed a confession that he conspired with Mr. Padilla. The Bush administration clearly has no intention of answering that claim, and plans to keep Mr. Mohamed in extralegal detention indefinitely.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2'b'The Democratic majority in Congress has a moral responsibility to address all these issues: fixing the profound flaws in the military tribunals act, restoring the rule of law over Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s rogue intelligence operations and restoring the balance of powers between Congress and the executive branch. So far, key Democrats, including Mr. Leahy and Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois, chairman of a new subcommittee on human rights, have said these issues are high priorities for them.'b'We would lend such efforts our enthusiastic backing and hope Mr. Leahy, Mr. Durbin and other Democratic leaders are not swayed by the absurd notion circulating in Washington that the Democrats should now \xe2\x80\x9clook ahead\xe2\x80\x9d rather than use their new majority to right the dangerous wrongs of the last six years of Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s one-party rule.'b'This is a false choice. Dealing with these issues is not about the past. The administration\xe2\x80\x99s assault on some of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s founding principles continues unabated. If the Democrats were to shirk their responsibility to stop it, that would make them no better than the Republicans who formed and enabled these policies in the first place.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Panel Seeks End to Death Penalty for New Jersey'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 3):'b'I have always opposed the death penalty because its existence means that innocent people will sometimes be executed, a punishment that is irreversible.'b'But capital punishment also sends the wrong message \xe2\x80\x94 that it is acceptable for the state to kill people, but not for individual citizens to do the same.'b'It is not an accident that most civilized nations have rejected the death penalty.

Despite his loss, he was quickly nominated by James Carville to challenge Howard Dean for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee. He declined, but sooner or later there is going to be a fight for the leadership of the party, and Mr. Ford has likely earned himself a pivotal role in any effort to move Democrats away from reflexive Deaniac liberalism.'b'Ironic as it may sound, what Mr. Ford did prove in his defeat was that he is electable. As it turned out, race didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to hold the Memphis congressman back \xe2\x80\x94 the exit polls made it pretty clear that he probably did as well as any white Democrat could have done, given the growing conservative bent of Tennessee.'b'In talking with my Republican friends and neighbors, I too have concluded that his color was far less important than his family\xe2\x80\x99s long record of graft and political strong-arming. Of course, my fellow Tennesseans had their reservations, but, as it turned out, their concerns were not based on the fact that Mr. Ford is a black man or on his voting record, but on the baggage he bears with his lineage.'b'As one of my neighbors said to me, \xe2\x80\x9cI just kept wanting him to say something more than \xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t choose your family.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d The neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s big disappointment was that Mr. Ford wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t actively support Steve Cohen, the Democratic nominee for the Congressional seat he vacated, over Mr. Ford\xe2\x80\x99s brother Jake, who ran a write-in campaign after losing the Democratic primary.'b'And the other night I was having dinner with Welling LaGrone, one of Nashville\xe2\x80\x99s civic leaders and a Republican if there ever was one, and even he said he had to admit that Mr. Ford was impressive on all fronts, other than that he was raised in a den of thieves.'b'I say all this to make the point that despite not being able to choose \xe2\x80\x94 or cut loose from \xe2\x80\x94 his family, his race or his party, Harold Ford has emerged as a serious politician, a gracious loser, a gentleman worthy of respect and with a solid foundation to build a future on, not only for himself but, I hope, for those remaining yellow dog Democrats like myself.'b'So what does the future look like? Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat, will begin a well-deserved second term. Senators Alexander and Corker seem set to infuse Washington\xe2\x80\x99s newly minority party with the spirit of moderation. And Harold Ford looks likely to find the door that will lead him to best serve his party and the nation.'b'In an era when elections leave so many Americans of both parties frustrated and bitter, I think Tennessee voters across the spectrum are feeling they can congratulate themselves on a job well done.'b'The House\xe2\x80\x99s new Democratic majority is mounting a legislative blitzkrieg meant to leave the displaced Republicans gasping in the dust. In successive working days, the Democrats plan to enact legislation to bolster homeland security, raise the minimum wage, encourage embryonic stem cell research, require the government to bargain for lower Medicare drug prices, recoup lost royalties on offshore oil and gas leases, and lower interest rates on student loans.'b'These are all commendable goals. Equally commendable is the pledge by the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to restore some pay-as-you-go fiscal discipline to a budget process bloated out of control by President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s deficit spending. But what is sorely lacking is the oft-invoked, more often abused ideal of bipartisanship \xe2\x80\x94 despite the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 campaign pledge to end the practice of relegating minority lawmakers to the legislative wilderness.'b'The Democrats have the votes to impose their way. But quickly turning any of these measures into law is dicier given the more complicated rules in the Senate and the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 blade-thin majority there. In scoring early political notches, House Democrats had better keep in mind the promise of bipartisanship for securing larger victories.'b'For years, bipartisanship has been the missing ingredient in the sour stew of Washington. It was lacking during the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 long House reign that ended in 1994. But during the last 12 years, the Republicans virtually eliminated Democratic participation. Chronically invoked by President Bush, this political ideal has been reduced to rhetorical ashes.'b'Of necessity, perhaps, the new Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, is making a considerable show of promising to reach across the aisle. In the House, Ms. Pelosi promises bipartisanship will be in evidence after the Democrats get past their opening agenda. That is like saying the checks and balances are in the mail.

That goes for New York City, too, especially when a rosy budget forecast seems to promise unlimited opportunites. Here are some achievable goals that must not get lost.'b''b'Campaign Finance Reform.'b' Council Speaker Christine Quinn should work harder with the Campaign Finance Board to strengthen and improve the local campaign finance law. The program, though perhaps the best in the country, is flawed. It allows candidates without real competition to collect public funds for campaigns. A recent appellate court decision weakened the law\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement mechanisms, which must now be reinforced.'b'Ms. Quinn has showed a healthy interest in curtailing the influence of special-interest lobbyists, but the larger task of bringing integrity to the political process is nowhere near complete. One major priority should be ending pay to play, in which political donors are awarded city contracts.'b''b'Traffic Congestion. 'b'Mayor Michael Bloomberg has offered a dazzling and hopeful plan to prepare the city for what is expected to be a substantial rise in population during the next quarter century, but unless the number of motorists is reduced, New Yorkers will choke on their own gridlock. Mr. Bloomberg needs to produce a major traffic study, move quickly to create new express bus routes and give serious thought to congestion pricing.'b''b'Law Enforcement. 'b'The use of excessive firepower by the police is a continuing concern made more vivid by the shooting last November of Sean Bell on his wedding day in Queens. Commissioner Ray Kelly was right to ask last week for an independent review of how police use their firearms. It is also time to take a closer look at how to improve the department\xe2\x80\x99s response to the Civilian Complaint Review Board, which investigates questionable police conduct.'b''b'The Budget. 'b'Mr. Bloomberg, who inherited multibillion-dollar budget gaps, now enjoys a surplus that could amount to more than a half billion dollars. This surplus is best applied toward future obligations, and should not be regarded as mad money to be used for reducing property taxes and unnecessary spending.'b''b'Affordable Housing.'b' The Mayor and the City Council passed useful new legislation aimed at forcing developers to build more units for low- and middle-income New Yorkers if they wanted certain tax breaks provided by law. The task now is to win Albany\xe2\x80\x99s approval before the law expires at the end of the year.'b''b'The Poor. 'b' About one-fifth of New Yorkers live below the poverty line. The Mayor has committed $150 million to his antipoverty program, but he could also make a huge difference by insuring that people who are eligible for food stamps actually get them by easing their way through the bureaucratic maze.'b'In our legal system, justice costs money, which means lots of poor people have to get along without it. Government has a critical obligation to provide adequate civil legal services for the poor, who would otherwise lack access to lawyers to resolve problems that could easily upend already tenuous lives, in areas like spousal and elderly abuse, child support, housing and disability issues.'b'Money spent on legal services ends up benefiting all taxpayers. Families that can\xe2\x80\x99t fight unfair evictions, after all, end up in homeless shelters, right next to the children and spouses of deadbeat fathers. People rejected for Medicaid wind up in emergency rooms.  New York State recognized this long ago, but its legal safety net happens to be more threadbare than others.'b'This is partly because of the relative meagerness of state financing \xe2\x80\x94 about $17.5 million in a state where 2.7 million people live in poverty \xe2\x80\x94 and the way it is allocated. The system is supported not by a general budget appropriation but through member items, the secret river of cash controlled by individual lawmakers and doled out in annual bursts of ad-hoc generosity. Other funding for legal help is spread around among 10 or more agencies.'b'The issue is particularly relevant in Westchester, where legal advocates for the poor once had a friend in State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a powerful Republican who in recent years treated legal aid as an important constituent service. Mr. Spano is gone now, of course, which could be bad news for Legal Services of the Hudson Valley, the only nonprofit organization in the region that provides free, high-quality legal help to low-income people.'b'The organization  is stretched over seven counties \xe2\x80\x94 Westchester, Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan and Ulster \xe2\x80\x94 and, like other nonprofit legal-assistance organizations, estimates that it turns away about half the people who come to it for help.'b'The Westchester executive, Board of Legislators and county bar association should make sure that life after Mr. Spano does not create short-term hardship for Legal Services of the Hudson Valley. And in the longer run, there should be a better system. Advocates  for the poor have urged Gov. Eliot Spitzer to make adequate, dependable financing of legal services for the poor a priority of his new administration. They say an ideal amount would be about $50 million a year, on top of what the state already spends.'b'That figure would put New York\xe2\x80\x99s per capita legal spending for its poor into the range set by progressive states like Massachusetts and Minnesota. It is a worthy   goal, and one Mr. Spitzer would do well to pursue.'b'Cleveland'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCongratulations!\xe2\x80\x9d cries Dolly, our Republican neighbor, a few days after the election, and my wife and I pause warily on the sidewalk outside her house.

Same-sex couples hoping to marry were not the only ones disappointed at that jarring sound; businesses too have been left at the altar.'b'From an economic perspective, opening up full-fledged marriage to same-sex couples makes sense. More marriages mean more weddings, and weddings are a big business. According to industry reports, the typical New Jersey wedding costs more than $35,000. Even if gay couples spend only a fraction of that average, the huge pent-up demand from couples in the state and across the country adds up to a lot of money. Florists, caterers, hotels, photographers and restaurants would share in a marriage windfall that could easily top $300 million  over the first few years of marriage equality for same-sex couples.'b'Marriage rights for gay couples would also generate other economic benefits for New Jersey businesses. Recent research shows that equal treatment improves gay, lesbian and bisexual employees\xe2\x80\x99 mental health and happiness in the workplace, which means greater job satisfaction and lower turnover.'b'While it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to put a specific dollar value on those benefits, companies know that good health and low turnover save them money. The fact that more than half of Fortune 500 companies have already implemented domestic partner benefits on their own suggests that equality pays off.'b'Becoming the second state after Massachusetts to let gay couples marry would also raise New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s profile among gays and lesbians looking for welcoming places to relocate and work, and for companies seeking a tolerant and open climate. And the state\xe2\x80\x99s businesses might get a bonus since recent data suggest that many heterosexuals also want to work in places that treat gay and lesbian people equally.'b'New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s economy would get these work-force advantages at virtually no cost to the state\xe2\x80\x99s businesses. Even though equality means allowing new spouses of gay and lesbian employees to claim costly health care benefits, the roughly 2,500 newlyweds whose spouses have employer coverage would be easily absorbed by the more than 100,000 employers in New Jersey. Only the largest companies are likely to see a noticeable but small impact on health care enrollment, and the vast majority of employers will have no new spouses to cover.'b'Just one question remains: Are civil unions equal enough to marriage to generate these economic gains?'b'If civil unions are truly generic marriage without the label, New Jersey might still experience a wedding windfall. Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s introduction of civil unions in 2000 lured thousands of same-sex couples from across the country and created a cottage industry for celebrations.'b'But New Jersey is too late to reap the same business benefit seven years later, and new competition from Connecticut and California have reduced the out-of-state demand for legal recognition that stops short of marriage. Travel in search of marriage-like relationships has clearly dried up \xe2\x80\x94 only 2 percent of California\xe2\x80\x99s registered domestic partners come from other states. Marriage alone remains the big draw as demonstrated by the gay couples from 46 states who flocked to San Francisco in the one month they could marry there in 2005.   (Macy\xe2\x80\x99s reportedly ran out of wedding rings.)'b'Some of New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s own gay and lesbian couples also appear less than enthusiastic about civil unions. Raised hopes have made civil unions a distant second best for same-sex couples who would prefer to marry. In fact, some gay couples in Connecticut are boycotting civil unions \xe2\x80\x94 only 15 percent of the state\xe2\x80\x99s same-sex couples entered civil unions in the first year that status was available. So don\xe2\x80\x99t count on being invited to a big fancy civil union ceremony; many same-sex couples will hold out for the real thing.'b'The good news for New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s economy is that civil unions are rare enough that businesses will probably still gain in less direct ways, even if the luster of equal rights is a bit tarnished. The prospect of equal benefits for employees in civil unions will make New Jersey look good as a place to live and work for gay men and lesbians.'b'Of course, cashing in on equality might not be the top motive for policymakers concerned about the treatment of same-sex couples. But the economic angle reveals at least two important lessons for lawmakers about the right to marry.'b'First, equality will benefit a much wider sector than just same-sex couples, namely the state\xe2\x80\x99s business owners and workers. And second, the market makes a good equality detector. It remains to be seen whether same-sex couples vote against civil unions with their feet and save their wedding dollars for the real thing.'b'Picture the person you love most in the world. Now imagine that person shredded by a bomb or dropped off one morning in the gutter with holes drilled through the back of the head. Imagine your lifelong rage, and the terror of not knowing who will die next. Now imagine this has happened to someone in nearly every family on your block, and on the next block, and in the whole town.'b'This is Iraqi society.'b'And yet Gen. George Casey and Gen. John Abizaid wanted to put the burden of nation-building on the victims and initiators of this maelstrom. U.S. war strategy for the past three years has been to lighten the American footprint in Iraq and compel Iraqis to undertake the policing tasks we ourselves couldn\xe2\x80\x99t accomplish.'b'Over this time a chorus has arisen to oppose this strategy. The members of this chorus \xe2\x80\x94 John McCain, The Weekly Standard, whispering dissenters in the middling rankings of the military \xe2\x80\x94 argue that it\xe2\x80\x99s simply unrealistic to expect human beings in these circumstances to become impartial nation-builders. These dissenters have argued, since the summer of 2003, that the U.S. must commit more troops to establish security before anything else becomes possible.'b'For over three years, President Bush sided with the light-footprint school. He did so for personal reasons, not military ones. Casey and Abizaid are impressive men, and Bush deferred to their judgment.'b'But sometimes good men make bad choices, and it is now clear that the light-footprint approach has been a disaster. If the U.S. had committed more troops and established security back in 2003, when, as Fareed Zakaria of Newsweek recently reminded us, the Coalition Provisional Authority had 70 percent approval ratings, history would be different.'b'It is now 2007, and President Bush has finally replaced Donald Rumsfeld, Casey and Abizaid. The question now is whether the policy that should have been implemented in 2003 can still be implemented four years on \xe2\x80\x94 after so many thousands have died.'b'Many in and out of the administration think so, hence all the talk about a surge \xe2\x80\x94 putting 20,000 more troops into Baghdad, finally occupying the dangerous neighborhoods, finally starting a jobs program, finally forcing national reconciliation.'b'Unfortunately, if the goal is to create a stable, unified Iraq, the surge is a good policy three years too late. For that surge to succeed now, it would have to accomplish the following tasks: compel the Maliki government to deliver public services in a nonsectarian way; convert the Shiite theocrats who now dominate the Iraqi government into ecumenical multiculturalists; persuade the rabid Sunni leaders to accept a dependent role in the new Iraq; induce the traumatized Iraqi people to hang together as the blood flows; sustain, over 18 months, American political support for an arduous policy that begins with a 17 percent approval rating.'b'The odds that the surge can accomplish these tasks are vanishingly small. The tragic truth is that the social context for this military strategy has changed since 2003.'b'But another surge may be realistic. This surge would begin by giving up the dream of national reconciliation and acknowledging that Iraq is in the process of dividing itself.'b'As the best reporting from Baghdad makes clear, today\xe2\x80\x99s Iraqi leaders have little interest in healing the Sunni-Shiite divide. People are retreating to their sectarian homelands by the tens of thousands. In an ever-radicalizing climate, the Sadrs are supplanting the Sistanis, and genocidal Sunni leaders are replacing the merely racist ones.'b'Perhaps, in other words, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to merge the military Plan B \xe2\x80\x94 the surge \xe2\x80\x94 with a political Plan B \xe2\x80\x94 flexible decentralization. That would mean using adequate force levels (finally!) to help those who are returning to sectarian homelands. It would mean erecting buffers between populations where possible and establishing order in areas that remain mixed. It would mean finding decentralized governing structures that reflect the social and psychological facts on the ground.'b'The record shows that in sufficient numbers and with sufficient staying power, U.S. troops can suppress violence. Perhaps more U.S. troops can create a climate in which decentralized arrangements can evolve.'b'We can\xe2\x80\x99t turn back time. But if the disintegration of Iraqi society would be a political and humanitarian disaster, perhaps we should finally commit military resources, and create a political strategy, commensurate with the task of salvaging something.'b'To the Editor:'b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'The George Pataki Era'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Dec. 31) reminds me of Nero before the collapse of the Roman Empire.

As a National Heritage Area with world-class cultural, scenic and natural resources, it is also where the stakes are highest and failure is not an option. So here are some things Mr. Spitzer should consider:'b''b'HUDSON VALLEY CITIES'b' Many cities, like Yonkers, Newburgh, Beacon, Kingston and Poughkeepsie, share the same economic challenges as upstate municipalities like Buffalo and Rochester. These include contaminated former industrial sites, the out-migration of young people and salaries up to 25 percent below the national average. The governor\xe2\x80\x99s proposals for catalyzing an \xe2\x80\x9cinnovation economy\xe2\x80\x9d should begin here.'b'His promise of property-tax relief and increased investment in schools and community needs like roads and waste-water treatment plants  will boost tourist-based economic development on these cities\xe2\x80\x99 waterfronts and spur commerce in their downtowns. The Hudson Valley Economic Development Corporation, a regional marketing organization, is already attracting \xe2\x80\x9cgreen\xe2\x80\x9d businesses to the valley because of the beauty and quality of life in the region. The corporation is eager to begin working with the new administration.'b'Governor Spitzer demanded that increased state aid to cities be dependent on better fiscal management. He also pledged to provide zoning incentives to encourage construction of affordable housing. He should require zoning that concentrates development in urban and town centers, protecting waterfronts as a public and natural resource and curbing the sprawling development that increases traffic and air pollution.'b''b'SMART TRANSPORTATION 'b'Mr. Spitzer raised hopes \xe2\x80\x94 and concerns \xe2\x80\x94 by pledging to \xe2\x80\x9cbreak through the political gridlock\xe2\x80\x9d to complete transportation projects, including the replacement of the Tappan Zee Bridge and the expansion of Stewart Airport as the fourth major downstate airport. Both projects could yield benefits if they are planned and implemented with the \xe2\x80\x9csmart growth\xe2\x80\x9d principles the governor says are essential \xe2\x80\x9cto alleviate environmental degradation, instead of contributing to it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Particularly in the case of Stewart Airport, the governor\xe2\x80\x99s ability to work with regional development and environmental constituencies will be crucial in stemming the sprawl around the airport. We cannot allow a drastic increase in jet traffic along the river to destroy the very foundation of the region\xe2\x80\x99s future prosperity, its beauty and tranquillity.'b''b'GLOBAL WARMING'b' To tackle global climate change and reduce energy costs, Governor Spitzer pledged to expand clean energy generating capacity and to implement aggressive conservation measures, starting with state energy consumption. This will be important to achieving another of his campaign pledges: closing Indian Point.'b'Smart development will also be critical in reducing greenhouse gases. On Beacon\xe2\x80\x99s waterfront, my group, Scenic Hudson, and a private developer are moving ahead on plans for the country\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgreenest\xe2\x80\x9d hotel and conference center. This project will use new energy technologies while preserving two-thirds of the 25-acre property as public parkland. Governor Spitzer should establish waterfront-development standards for the entire Hudson Valley based on this environmentally sensitive, energy-efficient design pioneered with community input.'b''b'LAND PRESERVATION'b' Mr. Spitzer has pledged to increase the Environmental Protection Fund with proceeds from an expanded bottle bill to help protect farmland and open space across the state. The Hudson Valley contains an estimated 100,000 acres of \xe2\x80\x9clegacy landscapes\xe2\x80\x9d that should be preserved as we approach the 400th anniversary of Henry Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s sail up the river.'b'By leading the effort to protect the state\xe2\x80\x99s priceless heritage, the governor will ensure that the land that binds us together and makes us \xe2\x80\x9cone New York\xe2\x80\x9d will be the basis for prosperity for generations to come.'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Truth, Justice, Abortion and The Times Magazine'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Dec. 31):'b'I see the problems with the April 9 Jack Hitt article as part of a larger problem facing reporters.

For a reporter to get on the front page, or for a freelancer to get in the magazine, he or she needs the fist-slamming anecdote.'b'The question is, would Mr. Hitt\xe2\x80\x99s piece have gotten in The New York Times without the drama of the 30-year jail sentence? Would The Times have purchased \xe2\x80\x9ca broad and intriguing look\xe2\x80\x9d on any subject, for that matter, that didn\xe2\x80\x99t have either celebrity, outrage or some kind of goodness-gracious hook?'b'Every reporter knows this drill.

It is one way of measuring the health of a society in that dimension so that it can be compared with others.'b'It also implies that every time there is a pregnancy, wanted or not, a woman\xe2\x80\x99s health and her very life are at risk. There is no comparable paternal mortality or morbidity rate.

It\xe2\x80\x99s a safe bet that the Ford funeral attracted far fewer viewers than the most consequential death video of the New Year\xe2\x80\x99s weekend, the lynching of Saddam Hussein. But those two deaths were inextricably related: it was in tandem that they created a funereal mood that left us mourning for our own historical moment more than for Mr. Ford.'b'What the Ford obsequies were most about was the Beltway establishment\xe2\x80\x99s grim verdict on George W. Bush and his war in Iraq. Every Ford attribute, big and small, was trotted out by Washington eulogists with a wink, as an implicit rebuke of the White House\xe2\x80\x99s current occupant. Mr. Ford was a healer, not a partisan divider. He was an all-American football star, 'b'not a cheerleader'b'. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t fritter away time on pranks at his college fraternity, Delta Kappa Epsilon, because he had to work his way through school as a dishwasher. He was in the top third of his class at Yale Law. He fought his way into dangerous combat service during World War II rather than accept his cushy original posting. He was pals with reporters and Democrats. He encouraged dissent in his inner circle. He had no enemies, no ego, no agenda, no ideology, no concern for his image. He described himself as \xe2\x80\x9ca Ford, not a Lincoln,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than likening himself to, say, Truman.'b'Under the guise of not speaking ill of a dead president, the bevy of bloviators so relentlessly trashed the living incumbent that it bordered on farce. No wonder President Bush, who once hustled from Crawford to Washington 'b'to sign a bill interfering in Terri Schiavo\xe2\x80\x99s medical treatment'b', remained at his ranch last weekend rather than join Betty Ford and Dick Cheney for the 'b'state ceremony in the Capitol rotunda'b'.'b'Yet for all the media acreage bestowed on the funeral, the day in Mr. Ford\xe2\x80\x99s presidency that most stalks Mr. Bush was given surprisingly short shrift \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps because it was the most painful. That day was not Sept. 8, 1974, when Mr. Ford 'b'pardoned his predecessor'b', but April 30, 1975, when the last American helicopters hightailed it out of Saigon, 'b'ending our involvement in a catastrophic war'b'. Mr. Ford had been a consistent Vietnam hawk, but upon inheriting the  final throes of the fiasco, he recognized reality when he saw it.'b'Just how much so can be found in a prescient speech that Mr. Ford gave a week before our clamorous Saigon exit. (And a speech prescient on other fronts, too:  he called making \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica independent of foreign energy sources by 1985\xe2\x80\x9d an urgent priority.) 'b'Speaking at Tulane University'b', Mr. Ford said,  \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica can regain the sense of pride that existed before Vietnam\xe2\x80\x9d but not \xe2\x80\x9cby refighting a war that is finished as far as America is concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d He added: \xe2\x80\x9cWe, of course, are saddened indeed by the events in Indochina. But these events, tragic as they are, portend neither the end of the world nor of America\xe2\x80\x99s leadership in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'All of this proved correct, and though Mr. Ford made a 'b'doomed last-ditch effort'b' to secure more financial aid for Saigon, he could and did do nothing to stop the inevitable. He knew it was way too late to make the symbolic gesture of trying to toss fresh American troops on the pyre. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can and we should help others to help themselves,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in New Orleans. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the fate of responsible men and women everywhere, in the final decision, rests in their own hands, not in ours.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Though Mr. Ford was hardly the unalloyed saint of last week\xe2\x80\x99s pageantry, his words and actions in 1975 should weigh heavily upon us even as our current president remains oblivious. As Mr. Ford\xe2\x80\x99s presidential history is hard to separate from the Bush inversion of it, so it is difficult to separate that indelible melee in Saigon from the 'b'Hussein video'b'. Both are terrifying, and for the same reason.'b'The awful power of the Hussein snuff film derives not just from its illustration of the barbarity of capital punishment, even in a case where the condemned is a mass murderer undeserving of pity. What really makes the video terrifying is its glimpse into the abyss of an irreversible and lethal breakdown in civic order. It sends the same message as those 'b'images of helicopters fleeing our embassy in April 1975'b': Iraq, like Vietnam before it, is in chaos, beyond the control of our government or the regime we\xe2\x80\x99re desperately trying to prop up. The security apparatus of  Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cunity government\xe2\x80\x9d was powerless to prevent the video, let alone the chaos, and can\xe2\x80\x99t even get its story straight about what happened and why.'b'Actually, it\xe2\x80\x99s even worse than that. Perhaps the video\xe2\x80\x99s most chilling notes are the chants of \xe2\x80\x9cMoktada! Moktada! Moktada!\xe2\x80\x9d They are further confirmation, as if any were needed, that our principal achievement in Iraq over four years has been to empower a jihadist mini-Saddam in place of the  secular original. The radical cleric 'b'Moktada al-Sadr'b', an ally of Hezbollah and Hamas, is a thug responsible for the deaths of untold Iraqis and Americans alike. It was his forces, to take just one representative example, that killed Cindy Sheehan\xe2\x80\x99s son, among many others, in one of two 'b'Shiite uprisings in 2004'b'.'b'The 'b'day after Casey Sheehan\xe2\x80\x99s slaughter'b', Dan Senor, the spokesman for the American occupation, presided over a 'b'Green Zone news conference'b' promising Mr. Sadr\xe2\x80\x99s woefully belated arrest on a months-old warrant for his likely role in the earlier assassination of Abdel Majid al-Khoei, a rival Shiite who had fiercely opposed Saddam. Today Mr. Sadr and his forces control 30 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, 'b'four government ministries'b', and death squads (a k a militias) more powerful than the nominal Iraqi army. He is the puppetmaster who really controls Nuri al-Maliki \xe2\x80\x94  the Iraqi prime minister embraced by Mr. Bush \xe2\x80\x94 even to the point of inducing Mr. Maliki to shut down a search for an American soldier kidnapped at gunpoint in Sadr City in the fall. (And, you might ask, whatever happened to Mr. Senor? He\xe2\x80\x99s a Fox News talking head calling for a \xe2\x80\x9csurge\xe2\x80\x9d of American troops to clean up the botch he and his cohort left behind.) Only Joseph Heller could find the gallows humor in a moral disaster of these proportions.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s against the backdrop of both the Hussein video and the Ford presidency that we must examine the prospect of that much-previewed \xe2\x80\x9csurge\xe2\x80\x9d in Iraq \xe2\x80\x94 a surge, by the way, that the press should start calling by its rightful name, escalation. As Mr. Ford had it, America cannot regain its pride by refighting a war that is finished as far as America is concerned  and, for that matter, as far as Iraq is concerned. By large margins, the citizens of both countries want us not to escalate but to start disengaging. So do America\xe2\x80\x99s top military commanders, who are now being cast aside just as Gen. Eric Shinseki was when he dared assert before the invasion that securing Iraq would require 'b'several hundred thousand troops'b'.'b'It would still take that many troops, not the 20,000 we might scrape together now. Last month the Army and Marines issued an 'b'updated field manual on counterinsurgency (PDF)'b' supervised by none other than Lt. Gen. David Petraeus, the next top American military commander in Iraq. It endorsed the formula that \xe2\x80\x9c20 counterinsurgents per 1,000 residents\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cthe minimum troop density required.\xe2\x80\x9d By that yardstick, it would take the addition of 100,000-plus troops to secure Baghdad alone.'b'The \xe2\x80\x9csurge,\xe2\x80\x9d then, is a sham.

In the early \xe2\x80\x9990s, Lindy and I hauled the dogs and horses west every summer, and when we got there we found ourselves among people who made a living hauling horses all across the country.'b'For these people, five days in any one spot was a good, long time. But if you asked around, it was almost as easy to find people who had never been out of the county, born and raised practically within earshot of where they still lived.'b'I try to imagine what it would have been like driving cross-country about the time I was born \xe2\x80\x94 1952. I find that I cannot. Once, when I was 7 or 8, I rode home from my grandparents\xe2\x80\x99 house in my grandparents\xe2\x80\x99 car \xe2\x80\x94 100 miles with my grandfather behind the wheel. His top speed was 35 miles an hour. It nearly killed me.'b'I wanted to be anywhere but the back seat of that old Dodge plodding down the highway. Now, of course, I would love to see all over again what I must have seen on that trip, the hogs in the fields, the creek-bottom pastures, the windmills and farmhouses. Iowa was not yet a tyranny of soybeans and corn.'b'I am struck this time by the change in how I imagine the trip across the country. It has become so easy to look down the road. The last time we made this trip \xe2\x80\x94 two years ago \xe2\x80\x94 I spent what seemed like weeks staring at the road atlas, pondering the mysteries of the American highway system. We set off with a clear sense of how we were going to go \xe2\x80\x94 south-southeast out of the winter and then due west \xe2\x80\x94 only to be pushed off course by a major ice storm in Arkansas.'b'The weather is still the major variable. Now, instead of the road atlas, I find myself contemplating the National Weather Service Web site \xe2\x80\x94 the page displaying a map, updated every five minutes, of all the weather warnings, watches, alerts and advisories across the country. Right now, the only good weather slot across the West is near El Paso.'b'Just this morning I ran through the whole trip on the G.P.S., mile by mile, turn by turn. I plotted out some driving distances on Google Maps, wondering how long we\xe2\x80\x99ll want to drive each day.'b'I scouted a couple of Web sites that list dog-friendly lodgings along the way. Between the G.P.S. and the BlackBerry, I realize that we\xe2\x80\x99re driving west this time in a cloud of information \xe2\x80\x94 the exact opposite, I suppose, of that trip with my grandparents, when all the information worth gleaning would have come in conversation with the two old people in the front seat, born in the late 1880s after all, and with the world that lay beyond the highway ditches.'b'For New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s policy makers, the key to success in 2007 hangs on two words: property taxes. If the Democratic-controlled Legislature and Gov. Jon Corzine can reduce and stabilize property taxes for the foreseeable future, they will be hailed for an achievement that has eluded Trenton for years. If they do not, they will create even more dissatisfaction and cynicism from New Jerseyans long fed up with high taxes and official corruption.'b'On paper, 2006 was a year of significant accomplishments. Mr. Corzine and the Democrats enacted a long-stalled measure establishing a stem cell research program financed primarily through bonds, established civil unions for gays, and finally, after years of indifference, joined the 49 other states in approving a system of clean needle exchange to help drug addicts avoid the additional peril of AIDS. Nevertheless, 2006 has to be considered a disappointment because the state did nothing about its crushing property taxes, which remain the highest in the country.'b'To get an idea of how bad things are, consider that 45 percent of the state\xe2\x80\x99s total tax revenue is raised from property taxes, compared with an average of about 30 percent for the rest of the nation. The owner of just a modest home in New Jersey pays $6,000 a year or more in property taxes.'b'After boldly promising property tax reform by the end of the year, Mr. Corzine and the Legislature failed to do much of anything. Much of the fault lay with the governor himself. After challenging legislators to be bold in coming up with ways to cut spending, he undercut his party\xe2\x80\x99s leaders just as they were applying pressure to reluctant legislators to support a savings package that would help pay for tax reductions.'b'The package included proposed cuts in pension and health benefits for state employes. When Mr. Corzine announced that he would prefer to handle these matters through collective bargaining with the state employees\xe2\x80\x99 union, the legislation stalled and, with it, any momentum for tax reform by the governor\xe2\x80\x99s original Dec. 31 deadline.'b'Mr. Corzine has set a new deadline of Feb. 27. The challenge of reducing state employee pension and health benefits is now his alone. But unless he can persuade state employee representatives at the bargaining table to commit to some lasting cuts, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to see how he can stabilize property taxes for more than a year or two, if that.'b'Both houses of the Legislature are scheduled to reconvene tomorrow to consider other bills essential for property tax reduction, all of them controversial. For starters, there are bills to impose about a 4 percent ceiling on annual property tax increases, which many local officials and teacher representatives do not like, and to establish a state comptroller to monitor all state spending.  Mr. Corzine says both measures must pass before he will go along with the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s wish for property tax rebates starting at 20 percent for families earning $100,000 or less. Democratic leaders said last week that they would support the proposals.'b'Other measures aimed at saving money would change the formula for state aid to school districts, encourage the consolidation of school districts and municipal services, and give county school superintendents greater powers to control spending by school districts.'b'Obviously, there are other pressing needs that must be addressed in 2007. One is the urgency to replenish the soon-to-be-exhausted bond fund for purchasing tracts of open space. Mr. Corzine, though supportive of preserving open space, understandably had hoped to defer action on this until he could bring order to the state\xe2\x80\x99s overall fiscal mess. But unless New Jersey, the most densely populated state in the nation, moves quickly to buy available land, there will be no desirable tracts left to save.'b'The Legislature must also give renewed attention to ethics reform, which the governor singled out for priority in his inaugural address but which has made little progress since then. Despite a continuing scandal at the state\xe2\x80\x99s medical college and the jailing of one of the state\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful Democratic political leaders, several essential bills, including those to ban dual office-holding by elected officials and take away the pensions of public officials convicted of corruption, remain bottled up.'b'Then there is the need for the state to give support to Newark\xe2\x80\x99s newly elected reform mayor, Cory Booker, who represents the city\xe2\x80\x99s best and probably last chance for resurgence. Mr. Corzine can help him immensely by making sure that any new state school aid formula does not undercut the current emphasis on giving financial help to urban schools and their students.'b'For the next two months, however, Mr. Corzine and the Legislature must focus on property tax reform. There are promising signs, including Mr. Corzine\xe2\x80\x99s frank confession that his record for 2006 was \xe2\x80\x9cincomplete,\xe2\x80\x9d thereby suggesting a willingness to learn from past mistakes; and another is that his Democratic Party has large enough majorities in both the Senate and Assembly to pass a tax reform package.

In fact, I\xe2\x80\x99ve told friends, only half-jokingly, that if they are ever charged with a serious criminal offense, the first thing they should do is give all their assets to charity, in an effort to qualify for public defender representation.'b'So when two economists from Emory University, Paul Rubin and Joanna Shepherd, agreed last year to collaborate with me on an econometric study of how effective public defenders really are, I had to guard against confirmation bias. I was positive that public defenders would prove more effective than their private counterparts. Mr. Rubin and Ms. Shepherd, with their occupational faith in markets, were equally positive of just the opposite. In the end, the economists were right, though with an interesting twist. (The full study has been published in the Ohio State Journal of Criminal Law.)'b'We looked at all 5,224 felony criminal cases filed in Denver in 2002. Most other studies measure lawyer effectiveness through indicators like acquittal rates, but we used the one thing criminal defendants care about most: the amount of jail or prison time they receive. Thus, acquittals counted as zero. Probationary sentences likewise counted as zero, unless the probation was combined with some jail time.'b'We counted halfway-house sentences as 120 days, which is typical for Denver defendants. We counted the initial length of a prison sentence without decreasing it for early release or increasing it for parole violations. Life sentences we arbitrarily counted as 110 years.'b'My economist friends were able to use regression analyses to control for other variables (such as whether a case was plea bargained or went to trial), to minimize the chance that the differences we found were caused by factors other than effectiveness. They also used regressions with different combinations of variables, to ensure that our results were not sensitive to a particular variable.'b'The results were surprising. The average sentence for clients of public defenders was almost three years longer than the average for clients of private lawyers.'b'But our most notable finding was hidden in one of the variables we had controlled \xe2\x80\x94 the seriousness of the case. We had assumed that public defenders on average handled more serious cases than private lawyers, if for no other reason than that such cases carry higher bonds, and defendants who can\xe2\x80\x99t make those bonds are often rendered indigent by their pretrial incarceration. The length of their clients\xe2\x80\x99 sentences would of course be distorted by the fact that they handle more serious cases with longer potential sentences.'b'But when we removed the control for the seriousness of the crime, public defenders performed relatively worse, not better (five years more incarceration versus three years more).'b'When we examined the seriousness of the cases handled by each type of lawyer, we discovered not only that private lawyers tend to handle more serious cases, but also that as the seriousness of the case increases, the chances that a private lawyer is handling it also increases. What in the world could explain such a result?'b'It turns out that the explanation, at least in part, is one that should put a smile on the face of all free-marketers and rational choice theorists: criminal defendants, just like any other consumers of services, appear to be making choices based on their rational assessments of costs and benefits. But, you might ask, do criminal defendants ever really have a choice between public defenders and private counsel? It appears many do.'b'Our data suggested that, contrary to the law\xe2\x80\x99s rather binary notion of indigency, a large chunk of felony criminal defendants are what we have called \xe2\x80\x9cmarginally indigent.\xe2\x80\x9d They could, if they had to, tap hidden resources, or the resources of family and friends, to retain private lawyers. But what drives that decision? Just what you\xe2\x80\x99d expect from any rational consumer of criminal defense services: a combination of the seriousness of the offense and the likelihood of conviction.'b'Imagine a guilty, marginally indigent defendant facing a relatively minor felony (for which he will most likely get probation). Now add to the mix the fact that his crime was captured on videotape, meaning he has a small chance of avoiding conviction. It is unlikely such a defendant would deplete his and his family\xe2\x80\x99s and friends\xe2\x80\x99 resources to hire a private lawyer when he could get a free public defender to achieve the same result.'b'At the other end of the spectrum, imagine a marginally indigent defendant charged with first degree murder, and imagine that he is innocent. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that defendant do everything in his power to marshal the resources to hire a private lawyer, if he believed, rightly or wrongly, that the private lawyer were more likely to achieve an acquittal?'b'In other words, marginally indigent defendants who choose public defenders tend to be guilty. And of course if that\xe2\x80\x99s true, it\xe2\x80\x99s not at all surprising that public defenders would achieve less favorable outcomes.'b'More work needs to be done to confirm these results. But if they hold, and hold nationally, they could have important policy implications. Roughly one-third of all states have formal statewide public defender systems, and several others have regional or local systems. Current debates about improving these systems tend to revolve around two poles: increased financing (for which public defenders have been clamoring since the 1980s, when per client spending in most systems, in real dollars, took a nose dive from which it has never recovered) and, more recently, privatization.'b'If it is true that public defenders achieve substantially worse results for their clients than private lawyers, that fact should be troubling to us all, quite apart from whether the difference is the product of underfinancing, government inefficiencies or both.'b'But our results suggest a more benign explanation, and a less drastic solution than spending more on public defenders or privatizing the system. If self-selection by guilty, marginally indigent defendants is driving a big part of this effectiveness difference, the remedy may simply be to tighten the mechanisms we use to determine indigency. This solution would not only reduce the outcome differences between public defenders and private defense lawyers, but it would also give taxpayers more bang for their public defender buck.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cWisconsin City\xe2\x80\x99s Revival of Downtown Has a Downside\xe2\x80\x9d (news article, Jan. 1):'b'Our national research involving 120 colleges in 40 states has shown that the greater the number of alcohol outlets near colleges, the higher the rate of student binge drinking, and the higher the rate of secondhand effects in neighborhoods surrounding the college.'b'These effects include noise, vandalism, assaults, littering and other activities that degrade neighborhood life.

But special recognition is due California\xe2\x80\x99s governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is reportedly ready to begin his new term with an actual proposal that his state insure all children. And by all, he means undocumented immigrants, too.'b'The proposal seems a challenge to fellow Republicans, and even to much of the state\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic leadership. Predictably, anti-immigrant groups said that including all children would cost billions more than the $400 million experts estimate. In truth, the idea is economical and, if anything, quite modest.'b'Several states, including Illinois, Maine and New Jersey, already have programs that cover all youngsters, including undocumented children who might not have access to government-subsidized care. California has what may be the biggest number of uninsured young people, more than 750,000. Most were born in the United States and are citizens.'b'Children, however, cannot take themselves in for medical care. That responsibility falls to parents and other caregivers, and when these adults are undocumented, they are often reluctant to take advantage of a child\xe2\x80\x99s birthright. California\xe2\x80\x99s array of programs to help the poor obtain health care has heavy enrollment in most communities, except among Hispanics. The state\xe2\x80\x99s history of discrimination against Latinos leaves many suspicious of government.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to believe that a push, even from an immigrant governor like Mr. Schwarzenegger, would alone solve that problem. But the governor\xe2\x80\x99s efforts should infect the national health care debate. Insurance has become a luxury that eludes 47 million people in this country. Putting children first is a good start, because they are usually healthy and cheaper to cover. That\xe2\x80\x99s a reason to do the job the right way, without exceptions.'b'There is by now no doubt that there are serious problems with electronic voting machines: they fail to record votes, and even flip votes from one candidate to another.

But the certification process has long been deeply flawed, and last week there was even more disturbing news \xe2\x80\x94 that the leading testing lab has been unable to meet the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s standards.'b'Since last summer, Ciber Inc., the largest tester of voting machine software, has been unable to meet federal quality standards that will take effect later this year.'b'It is disturbing that if Christopher Drew had not reported this in The Times, the public still would not know. The Election Assistance Commission, the agency that evaluates the labs, did not reveal that Ciber fell short, and is still not saying what is wrong. Ciber, which is still working on meeting the standards, did not return our phone call.'b'Many Americans are using electronic voting machines that were certified by Ciber. Were those certifications done properly? Did whatever deficiencies Ciber has now exist then? No one is saying.'b'Since many jurisdictions, and some whole states, now use electronic voting machines that do not produce a paper record, certification is extremely important. It is one of the few ways of determining whether a machine wrongly records votes, either by accident or by design.'b'Even before the news about Ciber, certification was a troubled process. The biggest problem is that the voting machine manufacturers pay the labs to do the examination and certification. This is a conflict of interest. If a lab raises too many concerns, it risks losing a client to a more compliant competitor.'b'There is also too little transparency. The labs, which see themselves as working for the voting machine companies, do not tell the public when they find problems or what those problems are.'b'Congress should pass legislation fixing the system. The vendors should continue to pay the costs, but the government should choose and pay the labs. That would make the labs responsive to the correct customer \xe2\x80\x94 the public.'b'It should also enact strong transparency rules. Voters should know how testing is done, and have full and timely access to the results. Congress should also require the Election Assistance Commission to be more open about how it evaluates the labs. If a lab falls short, the public \xe2\x80\x94 which may currently be using machines certified by that lab \xe2\x80\x94 should be told right away what the deficiencies are.'b'The veil of secrecy that hangs over certification is good for the companies that make voting machines and for the ones that test them. The government should not be protecting those private interests.'b'It should be protecting the voting public.'b'The only real question about the planned \xe2\x80\x9csurge\xe2\x80\x9d in Iraq \xe2\x80\x94 which is better described as a Vietnam-style escalation \xe2\x80\x94 is whether its proponents are cynical or delusional.'b'Senator Joseph Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, thinks they\xe2\x80\x99re cynical.

Either way, what\xe2\x80\x99s clear is the enormous price our nation is paying for President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s character flaws.'b'I began writing about the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s infallibility complex, the president\xe2\x80\x99s Captain Queeg-like inability to own up to mistakes, almost a year before the invasion of Iraq. When you put a man like that in a position of power \xe2\x80\x94 the kind of position where he can punish people who tell him what he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear, and base policy decisions on the advice of people who play to his vanity \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s a recipe for disaster.'b'Consider, on one side, the case of the C.I.A.\xe2\x80\x99s Baghdad station chief during 2004, who provided accurate assessments of the deteriorating situation in Iraq. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he, some kind of defeatist?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the president \xe2\x80\x94 and according to The Washington Post, at the end of his tour, the station chief \xe2\x80\x9cwas punished with a poor assignment.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'On the other side, consider the men Mr. Bush has turned to since the midterm election. They constitute a remarkable coalition of the unwilling \xe2\x80\x94 men who have been wrong about Iraq every step of the way, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t willing to admit it.'b'The principal proponents of the \xe2\x80\x9csurge\xe2\x80\x9d are William Kristol of The Weekly Standard and Frederick Kagan of the American Enterprise Institute. Now, even if the Joint Chiefs of Staff hadn\xe2\x80\x99t given the surge a thumbs down, Mr. Kristol\xe2\x80\x99s track record should have been reason enough to ignore his advice. For example, early in the war, Mr. Kristol dismissed as \xe2\x80\x9cpop sociology\xe2\x80\x9d warnings that there would be conflict between Sunnis and Shiites and that the Shiites might try to create an Islamic fundamentalist state. He assured National Public Radio listeners that \xe2\x80\x9cIraq\xe2\x80\x99s always been very secular.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But Mr. Kristol and Mr. Kagan appealed to Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s ego, suggesting that he might yet be able to rescue his signature war. And am I the only person to notice that after all the Oedipal innuendo surrounding the Iraq Study Group \xe2\x80\x94 Daddy\xe2\x80\x99s men coming in to fix Junior\xe2\x80\x99s mess, etc. \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Bush turned for advice to two other sons of famous and more successful fathers?'b'Not that Mr. Bush rejects all advice from elder statesmen. We now know that he has been talking to Henry Kissinger. But Mr. Kissinger is a kindred spirit. In remarks published after his death, Gerald Ford said of his secretary of state, \xe2\x80\x9cHenry in his mind never made a mistake, so whatever policies there were that he implemented, in retrospect he would defend.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Oh, and Senator John McCain, the first major political figure to advocate a surge, is another man who can\xe2\x80\x99t admit mistakes. Mr. McCain now says that he always knew that the conflict was \xe2\x80\x9cprobably going to be long and hard and tough\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 but back in 2002, before the Senate voted on the resolution authorizing the use of force, he declared that a war with Iraq would be \xe2\x80\x9cfairly easy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Bush is expected to announce his plan for escalation in the next few days. According to the BBC, the theme of his speech will be \xe2\x80\x9csacrifice.\xe2\x80\x9d But sacrifice for what? Not for the national interest, which would be best served by withdrawing before the strain of the war breaks our ground forces.

The company handed him a breathtaking $210 million to take a hike. What would he have been worth if he\xe2\x80\x99d done a good job?'b'Data recently compiled by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston offers a startling look at just how out of whack executive compensation has become. Some of the Wall Street Christmas bonuses last month were fabulous enough to resurrect an adult\xe2\x80\x99s belief in Santa Claus. Morgan Stanley\xe2\x80\x99s John Mack got stock and options worth in excess of $40 million. Lloyd Blankfein at Goldman Sachs did even better \xe2\x80\x94 $53.4 million.'b'According to the center\xe2\x80\x99s director, Andrew Sum, the top five Wall Street firms (Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley) were expected to award an estimated $36 billion to $44 billion worth of bonuses to their 173,000 employees, an average of between $208,000 and $254,000, \xe2\x80\x9cwith the bulk of the gains accruing to the top 1,000 or so highest-paid managers.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Now consider what\xe2\x80\x99s been happening to the bulk of the American population, the ordinary men and women who have to work for a living somewhere below the stratosphere of the top corporate executives. Between 2000 and 2006, labor productivity in the nonfarm sector of the economy rose by an impressive 18 percent. But workers were not paid for that impressive effort. During that period, according to Mr. Sum, the inflation-adjusted weekly wages of workers increased by just 1 percent.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s $3.20 a week. As Mr. Sum wryly observed, that won\xe2\x80\x99t even buy you a six-pack of Bud Light. Joe Six-Pack has been downsized. Three bucks ain\xe2\x80\x99t what it used to be.'b'There are 93 million production and nonsupervisory workers (exclusive of farmworkers) in the U.S. Their combined real annual earnings from 2000 to 2006 rose by $15.4 billion, which is less than half of the combined bonuses awarded by the five Wall Street firms for just one year.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cJust these bonuses \xe2\x80\x94 'b'for one year'b' \xe2\x80\x94 overwhelmingly exceed all the pay increases received by these workers over the entire six-year period,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sum.'b'In a development described by Mr. Sum as \xe2\x80\x9cquite stark and rather bleak for the economic well-being of the average worker,\xe2\x80\x9d the once strong link between productivity gains and real wage increases has been severed. The mystery to me is why workers aren\xe2\x80\x99t more scandalized. If your productivity increases by 18 percent and your pay goes up by 1 percent, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been dealt a hand full of jokers in a game in which jokers aren\xe2\x80\x99t wild.'b'Workers have received some modest increases in benefits over the past six years, but most of the money from their productivity gains \xe2\x80\x94 by far, it\xe2\x80\x99s not even a close call \xe2\x80\x94 has gone into profits and the salaries of top executives.'b'Fairness plays no role in this system. The corporate elite control it, and they have turned it to their ends.'b'Mr. Sum, a longtime expert on the economic life of the American worker, said he is astonished at the degree to which ordinary workers have been shortchanged over the past several years. \xe2\x80\x9cProductivity has been exceptional,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd for most of my life, the way to get wages up was to be more productive. That\xe2\x80\x99s how our economy was supposed to work.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The productivity gains in the go-go decades that followed World War II were broadly shared, and the result was a dramatic, sustained increase in the quality of life for most Americans. Nowadays workers have to be more productive just to maintain their economic status quo. Productivity gains are no longer broadly shared. They\xe2\x80\x99re barely shared at all.'b'The pervasive unfairness in the way the great wealth of the United States is distributed should be seen for what it is, an insidious disease eating away at the structure of the society and undermining its future. The middle class is hurting, propped up by the wobbly crutches of personal debt. The safety net, not just for the poor, but for the middle class as well, is disappearing. The savings rate has dropped to below zero, and more Americans are filing for bankruptcy than for divorce.'b'Your pension? Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a reason why the power elite get bent out of shape at the merest mention of a class conflict in the U.S. The fear is that the cringing majority that has taken it on the chin for so long will wise up and begin to fight back.'b'Newport, R.I.'b'SOMALIA\xe2\x80\x99S internationally recognized government pulled off a stunning military victory over its Islamist rivals, taking control of the capital, Mogadishu, and the key port city of Kismayo last week. This may appear to bode well for the containment of Islamism on the Horn of Africa. But unless America plays a constructive role in Somalia\xe2\x80\x99s next stage, the conflict could become a regional war and a new field of jihad.'b'The success of the Transitional Federal Government and its current prevalence were made possible entirely through the help of troops from neighboring Ethiopia, many of them trained and equipped by the United States. Nevertheless, Ethiopia cannot be expected to act as the government\xe2\x80\x99s main force indefinitely. Nor, eventually, will Somalis, who are almost all Sunni Muslims, tolerate an open-ended occupation by Ethiopians, who are predominantly Christians.'b'Enforcing peace in a politically atomized territory is remarkably difficult, as was painfully demonstrated by the American intervention in Somalia in the early 1990s. Turning a humanitarian mission into a coercive state-building effort angered local militia bosses, leading to the now-infamous \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Hawk Down\xe2\x80\x9d attack.'b'The Ethiopians, being thoroughly familiar with the American experience and the Somalis\xe2\x80\x99 historical tendency to resist external influence, are already talking about pulling out within a few months.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s more, the American invasion of Iraq illuminates some drawbacks to any extended Ethiopian military presence in Somalia. Al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s leadership would inevitably cast such a commitment as the non-Muslim occupation of a Muslim land. This would draw foreign jihadists into the conflict and lead to greater Islamic radicalization of Somalis themselves.'b'Indeed, Ethiopia\xe2\x80\x99s intervention and the United Nations Security Council\xe2\x80\x99s authorization of a notional peacekeeping force have already prompted the Islamic Courts Council to declare jihad. Once bitten, twice shy, the United States should be loath to perpetuate this kind of blowback. Similar considerations also argue against a peacekeeping force led by a major power \xe2\x80\x94 even if one could be marshaled, which at present looks unlikely.'b'The upshot is that there is no military solution to the quandary of Somalia. Robust diplomacy, with an eye toward creating some sort of power-sharing agreement between the transitional government and the Islamic Courts Council, appears to be the only hope. Given the recent struggles in Darfur, Congo and elsewhere, the idea of bringing Africans to the negotiating table might cause Westerners to roll their eyes. But there are a few hopeful signs that, in Somalia, diplomacy has a chance.'b'For one thing, the European Union has shown an interest in becoming an honest broker among the main Somali factions. And Kenya, alarmed by the prospect of tens of thousands of Somali refugees pouring across its northern border, may feel compelled to resume its longstanding diplomatic role in Somali conflict resolution.'b'Finally, neither the transitional government nor the Islamic courts are in a position to take over wholesale governance of the country: the various clan leaders, tribal elders and militia bosses around Somalia together control the pulse of power. In fact, it was the decision by dozens of local clan elders to withdraw their political and military backing that made it impossible for the Islamic Courts Council to defend Mogadishu and Kismayo.'b'This parlay underscored how central the elders are to Somalia\xe2\x80\x99s tenuous political equilibrium, especially those of the four main clans \xe2\x80\x94 the Darod, Hawiye, Dir and Digil-Mirifle  \xe2\x80\x94 and their various sub-clans. These leaders must be included in any peace negotiation, and any deal with their backing would be hard for the Islamists or the transitional government to walk away from.'b'The knottiest substantive issue would likely be deciding to what extent Islamic sharia law would apply in Somalia. Naturally, the Islamic courts have insisted on universal religious law, while the secular transitional government has refused to entertain it. But there is recent African precedent for breaking the deadlock.'b'In January 2005, persistent negotiations overseen by the United States, European powers and Kenya produced a power-sharing compromise between southern Sudanese Christians and Sudan\xe2\x80\x99s Arab Muslim government. The deal was that sharia would apply in the northern part of the country and not in the south, and that its applicability in the capital, Khartoum, was to be decided by an elected assembly. While the unrelated violence in Sudan\xe2\x80\x99s Darfur region has overshadowed this deal, it was a major breakthrough between two groups far more religiously divided than the two Muslim Somali sides.'b'The temptation in Washington will be to keep its distance and rely on Ethiopia, the European Union and Kenya for as long as possible. This attitude is myopic. Neither the American public nor the world believe that the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s predominantly military approach to counterterrorism is working. Relying primarily on Ethiopian troops to tamp down Somali Islamism would represent a continuation of that flawed model, and of the corresponding risk of fueling the jihad.'b'The United States\xe2\x80\x99 full participation in a diplomatic process in the Horn of Africa, on the other hand, would constitute a relatively low-cost way of signaling a new American approach to Islam and a re-engagement in sub-Saharan Africa, which has largely been left out of Washington\xe2\x80\x99s post-9/11 calculus. A result could be a small political victory in the Muslim world that would deprive Osama bin Laden and his followers of a new grievance rather than supplying them with one.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cLock the Library!

Left to herself, she would have carried on, so deep was her hunger to help the people from whom she had just risen. I thought then that this woman would go far.'b'She did.

At stake is the accuracy of the next count and, with it, the legitimacy of important decisions that are rooted in the census, including the drawing of electoral districts and the allocation of government resources.'b'Various steps must be taken now to ensure an accurate count, starting with an investigation by the committees that oversee the bureau \xe2\x80\x94 Oversight and Government Reform in the House, and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs in the Senate  \xe2\x80\x94 into why the men quit. This will clear up a distracting mystery and is necessary  to ensure that the new directors  do not confront the same obstacles.'b'Equally important, the appropriations committees in the House and Senate must quickly act to restore the roughly $50 million cut by the previous Congress from President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s 2007 budget request for the bureau. Otherwise, the agency may have to forgo using hand-held computers for the next census, relying instead on paper and pencil, which is less accurate and would probably be more expensive in the long run because of its inefficiency.'b'An alternative and equally unacceptable way to cut costs would be to delay the economic census, which is currently conducted every five years and which serves as the benchmark for dozens of other government surveys, including reports on inflation, construction activity and retail sales.'b'Carlos Gutierrez, the secretary of commerce, should be pounding the tables in Congress to get this money; failure to do so would suggest that the administration is trying to undermine the census. For his part, Mr. Bush must swiftly nominate a new director \xe2\x80\x94 a nonpartisan, professional statistician with solid management experience.'b'Mr. Kincannon has graciously agreed to remain until his replacement is confirmed, but moving forward requires a new director.

There was one of 20,000 troops in early 2004, a similar one in the fall of 2005, and one a bit smaller in the summer of 2006.'b'As recently as July, Mr. Bush cheerily described a plan \xe2\x80\x9cto deploy additional American troops and Iraqi security personnel in Baghdad in the coming weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d He explained that this would \xe2\x80\x9cbring greater security to the Iraqi capital ...

Trying to replicate that (limited) success in Baghdad is a fool\xe2\x80\x99s errand.'b'In Tal Afar, there was one U.S. soldier for every 40 residents. Using the same ratio in Baghdad would require 150,000 troops,  sustained for more than a year.

Indeed, any expansion of our military presence is likely to bolster anti-American radicals, like Moktada al-Sadr.'b'Sure, Iraq promises to help in the crackdown. But my bet is that  \xe2\x80\x94 once again  \xe2\x80\x94 Iraqi leaders will make big pledges and then let us do the heavy lifting.'b'In any case,  sending in even more young Americans won\xe2\x80\x99t help counterinsurgency efforts when, according to an American-sponsored poll conducted in September, 78 percent of Iraqis believe that the American troop presence is \xe2\x80\x9cprovoking more conflict than it is preventing.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s why Iraqis overwhelmingly favor a timetable for a U.S. withdrawal, and it\xe2\x80\x99s one reason I do as well.'b'Mr. Bush is right about the risks of withdrawal: our pullout could be followed by a vast bloodbath and by a regional war in which Iran backs Iraqi Shiite militias and Saudi Arabia and Jordan back Iraqi Sunnis (with Turkey marching into Kurdistan). But all that may unfold anyway, and the prospect of withdrawal may be the best hope to galvanize Iraqi factions to take steps to avert such a catastrophe.'b'If Mr. Bush succeeds in escalating our military involvement, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost inevitable that many more Americans will be killed and injured. The focus has been on fatalities, but by some counts there have been 16 American service injuries for every death. That\xe2\x80\x99s partly a tribute to improvements in military medicine, for in Vietnam there were 2.6 injuries per American fatality.'b'All told, between 22,000 and 50,000 Americans have been injured so far in Iraq (depending on who does the counting); the higher number is one-third as many as in the entire Vietnam War. Linda Bilmes, a Harvard scholar who has written a new report on the war injuries, notes that the backlog for veterans\xe2\x80\x99 disability claims has risen more than fivefold since 2000, and she cites horror stories like that of a staff sergeant who suffered severe brain injuries and then had his pay stopped and utilities cut because of a bureaucratic error.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf the new Congress really wants to support our troops,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Bilmes writes, \xe2\x80\x9cit should start by spending a few more pennies on the ones who have already fought and come home.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s a responsibility Mr. Bush should assume as well. And when he speaks to the nation to urge more troops in Iraq, he needs to explain why the back alleys of Baghdad are the best places to invest additional buckets of American blood.'b'The news last Friday of the death of the ramen noodle guy surprised those of us who had never suspected that there was 'b' 'b'such an individual. It was easy to assume that instant noodle soup was a team invention, one of those depersonalized corporate miracles, like the Honda Civic, the Sony Walkman and Hello Kitty, that sprang from that ingenious consumer-product collective known as postwar Japan.'b'But no. Momofuku Ando, who died in Ikeda, near Osaka, at 96, was looking for cheap, decent food for the working class when he invented ramen noodles all by himself in 1958. His product \xe2\x80\x94 fried, dried and sold in little plastic-wrapped bricks or foam cups \xe2\x80\x94 turned the company he founded, Nissin Foods, into a global giant. According to the company\xe2\x80\x99s Web site, instant ramen satisfies more than 100 million people a day. Aggregate servings of the company\xe2\x80\x99s signature brand, Cup Noodles, reached 25 billion worldwide in 2006.'b'There are other versions of fast noodles. There is spaghetti in a can. It is sweetish and gloppy and a first cousin of dog food. Macaroni and cheese in a box is a convenience product requiring several inconvenient steps. You have to boil the macaroni, stir it to prevent sticking and determine through some previously obtained expertise when it is \xe2\x80\x9cdone.\xe2\x80\x9d You must separate water from noodles using a specialized tool, a colander, and to complete the dish \xe2\x80\x94 such an insult \xe2\x80\x94 you have to measure and add the fatty deliciousness yourself, in the form of butter and milk that Kraft assumes you already have on hand. All that effort, plus the cleanup,  is hardly worth it.'b'Ramen noodles, by contrast, are a dish of effortless purity. Like the egg, or tea, they attain a state of grace through a marriage with nothing but hot water. After three minutes in a yellow bath, the noodles soften. The pebbly peas and carrot chips turn practically lifelike. A near-weightless assemblage of plastic and foam is transformed into something any college student will recognize as food, for as little as 20 cents a serving.'b'There are some imperfections. The fragile cellophane around the ramen brick tends to open in a rush, spilling broken noodle bits around. The silver seasoning packet does not always tear open evenly, and bits of sodium essence can be trapped in the foil hollows, leaving you always to wonder whether the broth, rich and salty as it is, is as rich and salty as it could have been'b'.'b' The aggressively kinked noodles form an aesthetically pleasing nest in cup or bowl, but when slurped, their sharp bends spray droplets of broth that settle uncomfortably about the lips and leave dots on your computer screen.'b'But those are minor quibbles. Ramen noodles have earned Mr. Ando an eternal place in the pantheon of human progress. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime. Give him ramen noodles, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to teach him anything.'b''b'LAWRENCE DOWNES'b''b'We\xe2\x80\x99ve been down this road before. This time, it has to be different.'b'There have been too many times that President Bush has promised a new strategy on Iraq, only to repeat the same old set of failed approaches and unachievable objectives. Americans need to hear Mr. Bush offer something truly new \xe2\x80\x94 not more glossy statements about ultimate victory, condescending platitudes about what hard work war is, or aimless vows to remain \xe2\x80\x9cuntil the job is done.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If the voters sent one clear message to Mr. Bush last November, it was that it is time to start winding down America\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in this going-nowhere war.'b'What they need is for the president to acknowledge how bad things have gotten in Iraq (not just that it is not going as well as he planned) and to be honest about how limited the remaining options truly are. The country wants to know how Mr. Bush plans to end its involvement in a way that preserves as much of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s remaining honor and influence as possible, limits the suffering of the Iraqi people and the harm to Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors, and gives Iraqi leaders a chance \xe2\x80\x94 should they finally decide to take it \xe2\x80\x94 to rescue their country from an even worse disaster once the Americans are gone.'b'The reality that Mr. Bush needs to acknowledge when he speaks to the nation tomorrow night is that the Iraqi government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki is feeding rather than restraining Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s brutal civil war. The Iraqi Army cannot be relied on to impose order even in Baghdad, while the Iraqi police forces \xe2\x80\x94 dominated by sectarian militias \xe2\x80\x94 are inciting the mayhem.'b'Mr. Bush must acknowledge that there is no military solution for Iraq. Whatever plan he offers needs to start with a tough set of political benchmarks for national reconciliation that the Iraqi government is finally expected to meet. It needs to concentrate enough forces in Baghdad to bring some security to streets and neighborhoods, giving Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s leaders one last opportunity to try to bargain their way out of civil war.'b'His plan needs to lay out tight timetables in which the Iraqis must take major steps to solve fundamental issues, including equitably dividing their oil wealth and disarming vengeful militias. There must also be a clear and rapid timetable for achieving enough stability in Baghdad to hand back significant military responsibilities to the Iraqis.'b'The last time America presented Mr. Maliki with a set of political benchmarks, he bluntly rejected them. If he does that again, there is no way America can or should try to secure Iraq on its own. Mr. Bush must make clear to both Iraqis and Americans that without significant progress, American forces will not remain.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re under no illusions. Meeting those challenges is going to be extremely tough. And Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s unraveling may already be too far gone.'b'For Mr. Bush, this means resisting any vague Nixonian formula of \xe2\x80\x9cpeace with honor\xe2\x80\x9d that translates into more years of fighting on for the same ever-receding goals. Democrats in Congress should also resist euphemistic formulas like \xe2\x80\x9cphased redeployment,\xe2\x80\x9d which really means trying to achieve with even fewer troops what Washington failed to achieve with current force levels.'b'Nor can America simply turn its back on whatever happens to Iraq after it leaves. With or without American troops, a nightmare future for Iraq is a nightmare future for the United States, too, whether it consists of an expanding civil war that turns into a regional war or millions of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s people and its oil fields falling under the tightening grip of a more powerful Iran.'b'Mr. Bush is widely expected to announce a significant increase in American troops to deploy in Baghdad\xe2\x80\x99s violent neighborhoods. He needs to explain to Congress and the American people where the dangerously tapped-out military is going to find those troops. And he needs to place a strict time limit on any increase, or it will turn into a thinly disguised escalation of the American combat role.'b'The Washington Post reported yesterday that just under 23,000 Iraqi civilians and police officers died violently in 2006, more than 17,000 of them in the last six months. That is a damning indictment of the Maliki government, and of current American military strategy.'b'That is the Iraq that Americans want Mr. Bush to deal with tomorrow night.'b'Beersheba, Israel'b'NEARLY 40 years after it was removed from official maps, atlases and school books, the Green Line has made a significant comeback. Israel\xe2\x80\x99s education minister, Yuli  Tamir, has ordered the Green Line border, which separates  Israel from the West Bank, to be reintroduced in all texts and maps used in the Israeli school system. From now on, Israeli children will know exactly where the Green Line is  and what it signifies \xe2\x80\x94 a political border that, at some point, will almost certainly become the line separating neighboring Israeli and Palestinian sovereign territories.'b'It was shortly after the Six-Day War of 1967 that the Green Line was removed from atlases produced by the Israeli government. The border, hastily drawn  at the Rhodes armistice talks after  Israel\xe2\x80\x99s war of Independence in 1948, had always been regarded as nothing more than an artificial line of separation eventually to be reworked. For most Israeli leaders in 1967, the occupation of the West Bank was a sign that the future territorial order would be vastly different from the one they had lived with for the previous 19 years.'b'According to Abba Eban \xe2\x80\x94 Israeli ambassador to the United States and the United Nations in the 1950s and foreign minister at the time of the Six-Day War \xe2\x80\x94 his attempts to negotiate with the Arab states to transform the border into a permanent recognized international boundary had been rejected in the early 1950s by Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, who had argued that the more elastic and less permanent the boundary, the easier it would be to change in the future \xe2\x80\x94 as indeed seemed to be the case in the aftermath of the 1967 war.'b'The Green Line\xe2\x80\x99s removal from maps was meant to signify that it existed no longer, but in reality it never disappeared. It remained the administrative boundary separating Israel from the occupied territories, with one law for the Jewish and Arab citizens of Israel, and quite another one for the stateless Palestinian residents of the West Bank. Even Israeli settlers who moved  to the occupied territories and continued to enjoy Israeli citizenship were ultimately subject to the military authorities \xe2\x80\x94 just to show the world that Israel had not formally annexed these territories or, as the Israeli government preferred to put it, had extended civilian law to these areas over which they did not enjoy sovereign rights.'b'But in the past decade, for most Israelis, the Green Line has once again become the line separating the relatively safe roads of Israel from the danger of the West Bank. Few Israelis, other than the settlers, venture beyond it, even when doing so would make their route shorter. It is along the Green Line that the unilateral West Bank separation barrier  has been constructed in large sections.'b'Where the barrier  has deviated from the Green Line, in practice annexing some parts of the West Bank to Israel, the International Court of Justice has ruled it illegal. Many Palestinians are caught in a state of territorial limbo: they live east of the Green Line inside the West Bank, but west of the separation barrier, in effect spatial hostages to this exercise in redrawing the border.'b'At last year\xe2\x80\x99s  Herzliya Conference, an annual gathering  arranged by the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya and attended by the prime minister and leading political figures, a group of Israeli geographers, planners and cartographers proposed that the Green Line serve as the foundation for any future territorial agreement, based on the principles of the road map and a two-state solution to this never-ending conflict. They identified certain areas along the line where, given the variations that have occurred during almost 40 years of occupation, territorial exchanges could be made between the two sides \xe2\x80\x94 as opposed to returning to a line that even 60  years ago was not ideal and that today is out of touch with the region\xe2\x80\x99s  demographic  realities.'b'The international legal status of the Green Line is not clear. On the one hand, it is no more than an armistice line \xe2\x80\x94 it is not a recognized boundary, unlike the borders separating Israel from both Egypt and Jordan, which were drawn up and ratified as part of  peace agreements. Yet the Oslo accords make mention of the West Bank as constituting the future Palestinian state. This region has a clearly defined boundary \xe2\x80\x94 the Green Line \xe2\x80\x94 and many international jurists argue that this is sufficient to recognize it as the formal line of political separation. The jurists\xe2\x80\x99 time in court is yet to come, but the groundwork has already been prepared by international boundary experts on both sides.'b'If some Israelis were unclear about the long-term significance of the Green Line, the education minister\xe2\x80\x99s decision to return the border to the geography and history textbooks will have left no one in doubt.'b'There may never be peace in this troubled region. But if there is to be a return to the negotiation table, the issue of boundary demarcation will be of paramount importance in determining the territorial configuration of the respective sovereignty to be practiced by each of the two states. On the ground, there are many reasons for drawing a completely new line, but it will always be easier for the politicians to return to what was once \xe2\x80\x94 however briefly \xe2\x80\x94 there. The Green Line is the default boundary, and it has finally been recognized anew by the Israeli government.'b'To the Editor:'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s good to know that Verlyn Klinkenborg is among those of us who stop to help tortoises on their way on a busy road (\xe2\x80\x9cEdges and Order,\xe2\x80\x9d The Rural Life, Jan. 1).'b'I have done that, and afterward felt at least virtuous if not godlike.

To my mind, Mr. Carter\xe2\x80\x99s presentation badly misrepresents the Middle East proposals advanced by President Bill Clinton in 2000, and in so doing undermines, in a small but important way, efforts to bring peace to the region.'b'In his book, Mr. Carter juxtaposes two maps labeled the \xe2\x80\x9cPalestinian Interpretation of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Proposal 2000\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cIsraeli Interpretation of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Proposal 2000.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The problem is that the \xe2\x80\x9cPalestinian interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d is actually taken from an 'b'Israeli 'b'map presented during the Camp David summit meeting in July 2000, while the \xe2\x80\x9cIsraeli interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d is an approximation of what President Clinton subsequently proposed in December of that year. Without knowing this, the reader is left to conclude that the Clinton proposals must have been so ambiguous and unfair that Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, was justified in rejecting them. But that is simply untrue.'b'In actuality, President Clinton offered two different proposals at two different times. In July, he offered a partial proposal on territory and control of Jerusalem. Five months later, at the request of Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime minister, and Mr. Arafat, Mr. Clinton presented a comprehensive proposal on borders, Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees and security. The December proposals became known as the Clinton ideas or parameters.'b'Put simply, the Clinton parameters would have produced an independent Palestinian state with 100 percent of Gaza, roughly 97 percent of the West Bank and an elevated train or highway to connect them. Jerusalem\xe2\x80\x99s status would have been guided by the principle that what is currently Jewish will be Israeli and what is currently Arab will be Palestinian, meaning that Jewish Jerusalem \xe2\x80\x94 East and West \xe2\x80\x94 would be united, while Arab East Jerusalem would become the capital of the Palestinian state.'b'The Palestinian state would have been \xe2\x80\x9cnonmilitarized,\xe2\x80\x9d with internal security forces but no army and an international military presence led by the United States to prevent terrorist infiltration and smuggling. Palestinian refugees would have had the right of return to their state, but not to Israel, and a fund of $30 billion would have been created to compensate those refugees who chose not to exercise their right of return to the Palestinian state.'b'When I decided to write the story of what had happened in the negotiations, I commissioned maps to illustrate what the proposals would have meant for a prospective Palestinian state. If the Clinton proposals in December 2000 had been Israeli or Palestinian ideas and I was interpreting them, others could certainly question my interpretation. But they were American ideas, created at the request of the Palestinians and the Israelis, and I was the principal author of them. I know what they were and so do the parties.'b'It is certainly legitimate to debate whether President Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s proposal could have settled the conflict. It is not legitimate, however, to rewrite history and misrepresent what the Clinton ideas were.'b'Indeed, since the talks fell apart, there has emerged a mythology that seeks to defend Mr. Arafat\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of the Clinton ideas by suggesting they weren\xe2\x80\x99t real or they were too vague or that Palestinians would have received far less than what had been advertised. Mr. Arafat himself tried to defend his rejection of the Clinton proposals by later saying he was not offered even 90 percent of the West Bank or any of East Jerusalem. But that was myth, not reality.'b'Why is it important to set the record straight? Nothing has done more to perpetuate the conflict between Arabs and Israelis than the mythologies on each side. The mythologies about who is responsible for the conflict (and about its core issues) have taken on a life of their own. They shape perception. They allow each side to blame the other while avoiding the need to face up to its own mistakes. So long as myths are perpetuated, no one will have to face reality.'b'And yet peace can never be built on these myths. Instead it can come only once the two sides accept and adjust to reality. Perpetuating a myth about what was offered to justify the Arafat rejection serves neither Palestinian interests nor the cause of peace.'b'I would go a step further. If, as I believe, the Clinton ideas embody the basic trade-offs that will be required in any peace deal, it is essential to understand them for what they were and not to misrepresent them. This is especially true now that the Bush administration, for the first time, seems to be contemplating a serious effort to deal with the core issues of the conflict.'b'Of course, one might ask if trying to address the core issues is appropriate at a moment when Palestinians are locked in an internal stalemate and the Israeli public lacks confidence in its government. Can politically weak leaders make compromises on the issues that go to the heart of the conflict? Can the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, compromise on the right of return and tell his public that refugees will not go back to Israel? Can Israel\xe2\x80\x99s prime minister, Ehud Olmert, tell his public that demography and practicality mean that the Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem will have Palestinian and not Israeli sovereignty?'b'The basic trade-offs require meeting Israeli needs on security and refugees on the one hand and Palestinian needs on territory and a capital in Arab East Jerusalem on the other. But producing such trade-offs won\xe2\x80\x99t simply come from calling for them. Instead, an environment must be created in which each side believes the other can act on peace and is willing to condition its public for the difficult compromises that will be necessary.'b'So long as mythologies can\xe2\x80\x99t be cast aside, and so long as the trade-offs on the core issues can\xe2\x80\x99t be embraced by Israelis or Palestinians, peace will remain forever on the horizon. If history tells us anything, it is that for peace-making to work, it must proceed on the basis of fact, not fiction.'b'WASHINGTON'b'It isn\xe2\x80\x99t really a romance turned sour, because it was never sweet.'b'The American military\xe2\x80\x99s cocky heroes were supposed to sweep in and carry off a poor, grateful Iraq to security and bliss, like Richard Gere did Debra Winger in the finale of \xe2\x80\x9cAn Officer and a Gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d The strategy was: Love lift us up where we belong/Where the eagles cry/On a mountain high.'b'Didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen.

The bill will be opposed by legislators beholden to religious conservatives. Many are likely to cite a new study suggesting that broadly useful stem cells can be derived from amniotic fluid without destroying embryos to get them.'b'The new study, while certainly intriguing, in no way lessens the need to widen the array of embryonic stem cells available for research and ultimately therapy. The Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 proposal is extremely modest \xe2\x80\x94 about the least that could be done to accelerate progress in this promising field. It deserves support from veto-proof majorities in both houses.'b'Under the policy enunciated by Mr. Bush in 2001, federal money can be used to support research on only 20 or so stem cell lines that existed before the policy was set. Many of these cell lines are deteriorating or contaminated. And their number is far too small to allow the full range of research needed to explore the value of stem cells for treating Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s, diabetes, spinal cord injuries and other serious ailments.'b'The Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 bill would expand the number of lines by directing the secretary of health and human services to finance research using human embryonic stem cells regardless of when they were derived. The source of these cells would remain highly restricted. No embryonic stem cells could be tailor-made to study specific diseases or therapies. The stem cells would have to be derived only from surplus embryos that were originally created for fertility treatments and  would otherwise be discarded.'b'An alternative approach that attracted wide attention this week was described by scientists at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine. They extracted stem cells from the amniotic fluid of pregnant women and used them to create muscle, bone, fat, blood vessel, nerve and liver cells. These stem cells, spun off by the developing fetus, seem to have some \xe2\x80\x94 though  quite probably not all \xe2\x80\x94 of the versatility that allows embryonic stem cells to grow into a wide range of body tissues. The fetal cells are easily obtainable from the amniotic fluid during amniocentesis, a diagnostic procedure often performed in the second trimester of a pregnancy.'b'Even so, it would be a mistake to use this promising research, which has yet to be replicated or fully accepted by other scientists, as another excuse for hobbling embryonic stem cell research. The days-old embryonic cells are likely more versatile than fetal cells extracted months later from amniotic fluid, and they allow a range of research on the very earliest stages of human development.'b'Stem cell research holds enormous promise, though top researchers say it could take a decade or more to develop useful therapies from it. At this point, it is important to explore all approaches: using \xe2\x80\x9cadult\xe2\x80\x9d stem cells, which can grow into a very limited range of body tissues; the cells found in amniotic fluid, which may yield a broader range of tissues; and the most versatile cells of all, those derived from early human embryos.'b'Colstrip, Montana'b'All environmentalists have  their favorite \xe2\x80\x9cgreen\xe2\x80\x9d energy source that they think will break our addiction to oil and slow down climate change. I\xe2\x80\x99ve come out to Montana to see mine. It\xe2\x80\x99s called coal.'b'Yes, yes, I know, you thought I was going to say corn ethanol or switch grass or soybean diesel. Well, one day they all might reach a scale that can get us off oil. But the cheap, available fuel that China, India and America all have in abundance today \xe2\x80\x94 and are all going to burn for the next decade \xe2\x80\x94 is coal. So unless we can burn coal in a cleaner way, you can kiss the climate goodbye \xe2\x80\x94 we\xe2\x80\x99ll all be wearing bikinis and shorts in Manhattan in January.'b'When it comes to what it will take to \xe2\x80\x9cgreen\xe2\x80\x9d coal, there\xe2\x80\x99s no more informed or intrepid tour guide than Montana\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic governor, Brian Schweitzer. The governor, a bulldozer of a man, met me in Billings in his little prop plane, we flew into a winter gale that tossed us around like salad pieces, and then we set down on a makeshift runway in Colstrip, on the edge of a coal strip mine. On the way back, after flying through another howling storm that caused me to dig my nails so deeply into the armrests I left my fingerprints in the leather, I thanked the pilots profusely. The governor simply bellowed, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad we had our best interns flying today!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When it comes to cleaning up coal, though, Governor Schweitzer is dead serious.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHere in Montana we make our living outside,\xe2\x80\x9d said the governor, an agronomist who got his start building farms in Saudi Arabia, \xe2\x80\x9cand when you do that, you know the climate is changing. We don\xe2\x80\x99t get as much snow in the high country as we used to ... and the runoff starts sooner in the spring. ... The river I\xe2\x80\x99ve been fishing over the last 50 years is now warmer in July by five degrees than 50 years ago, and it is hard on our trout population. ... So when Exxon Mobil hires someone who calls himself a \xe2\x80\x98scientist\xe2\x80\x99 to claim this is not true, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to get The New York Times to know the guy is blowing smoke.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But here\xe2\x80\x99s what the governor also knows: Montana has one-third of all the coal deposits in America \xe2\x80\x94 8  percent of all the coal in the world. Montana\xe2\x80\x99s coal is roughly equivalent to  240 billion barrels of oil. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s enough to replace all our imported oil for 60 years,\xe2\x80\x9d he noted.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s the good news. The bad news is that because of global warming \xe2\x80\x94 fueled in part by carbon dioxide emissions from coal-burning electricity plants \xe2\x80\x94 the only way we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to use all those coal reserves is if we can burn coal without emitting the CO2. Otherwise we\xe2\x80\x99re cooked, literally.'b'So Governor Schweitzer\xe2\x80\x99s crusade is to get the coal-burning industries to take the lead on this, in partnership with government. The governor recalled a recent conference of coal-dependent industries, held in Phoenix, at which he held up a lump of coal and warned: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are the people who represent the companies who will decide whether I\xe2\x80\x99m holding up the future of energy or the past. Take a look at all the other people sitting at your table. You know who you see? You see the last remaining people on the planet who don\xe2\x80\x99t believe CO2 is a problem. ... The only way you will make this the energy of the future is to recognize C02 as a problem and that you have to be part of the solution.\xe2\x80\x9d And by the way, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a lot of money in it for you guys. You can sell this technology all over the world.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Governor Schweitzer has a plan for Washington: 1) Set a floor price for crude oil in the U.S. at $40 a barrel 'b'forever'b'.  That will tell Wall Street that if it invests in new, clean coal technologies \xe2\x80\x94 which can be run profitably at the equivalent of $40 a barrel \xe2\x80\x94 OPEC will never undercut them. 2) Set up a European-style cap and trade system rewarding  companies that buy clean coal technologies and punishing those that don\xe2\x80\x99t. 3) Have Washington co-invest in a dozen pilot gasification and liquefaction technologies \xe2\x80\x94 which already exist \xe2\x80\x94 for cleaning coal and sequestering the carbon dioxide.  Then we\xe2\x80\x99ll identify the best technologies quicker and move down the innovation curve. 4) Write the regulations now for how we will manage carbon dioxide that is removed from coal and stored underground.'b'As we talked, four smokestacks from the coal-fired electricity plant in Colstrip, which helps power Portland and Seattle, were belching CO2.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor the last 100 years we built plants like this one,\xe2\x80\x9d the governor said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt takes crushed coal, ignites it to heat water that produces steam, and that turns a turbine and produces electricity. ...

In the summer of 2003, these fears were underscored when it was reported that the chief executive of Diebold, one of the biggest voting machine makers, had written a fund-raising letter for President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s campaign in which he said he was committed to delivering Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s electoral votes for the president \xe2\x80\x94 while his machines counted many of the votes in Ohio.'b'But the machines\xe2\x80\x99 manufacturers are hardly the only ones who could put malicious code on a voting machine.

Many electronic voting machines also have wireless capacity, so the results on them are vulnerable to being changed by remote technology.'b'There have been a number of alarming reports about how easy it would be to hack an electronic voting machine.'b''b'Prof. Edward Felton'b', a computer science professor at Princeton, conducted a 'b'study'b' recently that found that it would not be at all difficult to hack into a Diebold machine that is the most commonly used electronic voting machine in the country.'b'Professor Felton\xe2\x80\x99s two main findings were:'b'(1) Malicious software on a voting machine can \xe2\x80\x9csteal votes with little if any risk of detection.\xe2\x80\x9d It can also \xe2\x80\x9cmodify all of the records, audit logs and counters kept by the voting machine, so that even careful forensic examination of these records will find nothing amiss.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'(2) \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone who has physical access to a voting machine, or to a memory card that will later be inserted into a machine, can install\xe2\x80\x9d malicious software in as little as one minute.'b''b'Prof. Aviel D. Rubin'b' of Johns Hopkins University reached much the same conclusion. In a 'b'classroom exercise in 2004'b', he created a malicious code that was able to change the outcome of an election and then disappear without a trace.'b'These scenarios of intentional vote theft are the most alarming, but there is a lot that can go wrong simply by accident or with poor handling of the machines.'b'Voters using electronic machines have often reported that when they tried to cast a ballot, the machine \xe2\x80\x9cflipped\xe2\x80\x9d their votes from the candidate they selected to an opponent. In last November\xe2\x80\x99s elections, 'b'reports of \xe2\x80\x9cvote flipping\xe2\x80\x9d were widespread'b', and in some cases they were confirmed by election officials.

When voters call the glitches to poll workers\xe2\x80\x99 attention, she said, the machines can be recalibrated on the spot.'b"November's election brought reports of other problems with electronic voting, ranging from software glitches that caused votes to be counted twice to a faulty memory cartridge that caused votes to be added to races in which they were not cast. VotersUnite.org kept a "b'log of problems reported in the media'b'.'b''b'II. The Solution'b''b'There is a clear answer to the problems with electronic voting: a voter-verified paper trail. That is, every time a voter casts a ballot electronically, he or she should receive a paper record that can be reviewed for accuracy. Those records should remain with the voting machine and become the official record of the vote - so if there is a conflict between the tally on the machine and the totals obtained by adding up the paper ballots, the paper-ballot tallies are the ones that are used to decide the election.'b'The reason is clear: as Professors Felton and Rubin and many others have shown, the results produced by electronic voting machines themselves cannot be trusted.'b'The 'b'National Institute for Standards and Technology'b', a federal agency that promotes the use of appropriate technological standards, issued a 'b'draft report (PDF)'b' last month that explained in technical terms why paperless electronic voting systems cannot be trusted. To be credible, NIST found, a voting system must be \xe2\x80\x9csoftware independent\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 that is, there must be a check on the accuracy of the system that is independent of the software in the system. The most obvious way to do that, according to NIST, is with a voter-verified paper trail.'b'For touch-screen voting machines, this means having a paper printout that reflects the choices made by the voter.'b'Touch screens that produce paper trails are far better than ones that do not. But there are still problems. The biggest is that the technology for producing paper trails, and the humans who feed in the paper and keep the printers running, are prone to error. Cuyahoga County, Ohio, which includes Cleveland, recently commissioned a 'b'study of the performance of their electronic voting machines (PDF)'b'. The study, conducted by Election Science Institute, found that nearly 10 percent of the paper records reviewed were either blank or otherwise unreadable.'b'A better method uses \xe2\x80\x9coptical scan\xe2\x80\x9d technology: the voter darkens ovals on, or otherwise marks up, a sheet of paper that is then fed into an optical scan device that reads the voter\xe2\x80\x99s choices. Optical scans combine the integrity of a paper-based system \xe2\x80\x94 the sheets of paper voters fill out remain the official ballots \xe2\x80\x94 with the efficiency of vote counting by computer.'b'To ensure that the vote totals are correct, after every election there should be a mandatory audit of a fixed percentage of randomly chosen machines. The paper ballots should be tabulated and compared with the votes recorded by computer, to ensure that there is no discrepancy. In New York, 'b'the law requires a manual audit of 3 percent of the paper trails'b' from randomly chosen machines.'b''b'III. The Electronic Voting Reform Movement'b''b'The movement to reform electronic voting has been an impressive combination of leading experts and ordinary citizens.'b''b'David L. Dill'b', a professor of computer science at Stanford University, has been a pioneer. Professor Dill began publicly questioning electronic voting in January 2003, and in June of that year he launched the Web site 'b'VerifiedVoting.org'b'. VerifiedVoting.org has since become an important voice demanding that electronic voting machines produce paper trails.'b'Other computer scientists like Professor Rubin and the tireless 'b'Rebecca Mercuri'b' have, like Professor Dill, used their deep knowledge of voting technology to explain the machines\xe2\x80\x99 security vulnerabilities to the general public.'b'Major national organizations, ranging from Common Cause and the American Civil Liberties Union to MoveOn.org, have played an important role in mobilizing their members and attracting attention to the issue. The national League of Women Voters, which was regrettably slow to recognize the importance of voter-verified paper trails, has recently become a strong supporter.'b'The most remarkable part of the movement, though, has been the grass-roots organizations that have sprung up around the country to demand better voting technology. One of the most effective of these has been 'b'New Yorkers for Verified Voting'b'. The verified voting cause has also benefited from the energetic efforts of a few extremely dedicated activists who have made it a personal mission, people like Bev Harris of 'b'BlackBoxVoting.org'b', whose hard-driving style has won her both fans and critics, and Teresa Hommel of 'b'wheresthepaper.org'b'.'b'These groups organize rallies in Washington, and at the state level put pressure on elected officials. In the summer of 2004, 'b'activists held simultaneous \xe2\x80\x9cThe Computer Ate My Vote\xe2\x80\x9d rallies in 24 cities'b', and collected more than 300,000 signatures on petitions demanding paper trails.'b'They also conduct independent research and influential studies that have helped shape the debate. New Yorkers for Verified Voting recently released 'b'an important report'b' explaining how if New York chooses the wrong machines, the state may end up with such intolerably long lines at the polls that many voters will be disenfranchised.'b'For the 2004 election, VerifiedVoting.org launched TechWatch, a program that brings volunteers with technology backgrounds to the polls on Election Day to observe the functioning of voting machine technologies and investigate incidents when the machines fail to work properly.'b'There are some powerful forces lined up on the other side. The leading opponents of paper trails have been, interestingly enough, state and local election officials and voting machine manufacturers. It is no great mystery why. Paper trails are a serious form of accountability in an area where there has been little of it. If the tallies on the paper trails do not match the totals on the machines, election officials and machine companies have to answer a lot of hard questions. Both groups would prefer to be able to certify whatever numbers show up on the machines without fear of contradiction.'b'Election officials in states like Georgia and Maryland, which spent millions of dollars on electronic voting machines that do not produce paper trails, also have a vested interest in defending their own choices. If it is generally agreed that paper trails are necessary for a voting system to be acceptable, it means that election officials in those states made a multimillion-dollar mistake with the taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 money.'b'Wherever paper trails have been proposed \xe2\x80\x94 in state legislatures, in administrative bodies \xe2\x80\x94 election officials have been one of the most outspoken groups to oppose them. As long as election officials controlled the process with little input from the public, they could make decisions like these.'b'But since the meltdown in the 2000 presidential election, the American public has become much more aware of and concerned about the election system. Increasingly, the public\xe2\x80\x99s views on voting machines are prevailing, even over the opposition of election officials.'b''b'IV. Successes at the State Level'b''b'When Congress passed the Help America Vote Act in 2002, it gave the states hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade their voting systems. But it did not impose a voter-verified paper trail requirement. As a result, some states, like Maryland and Georgia, rushed out to buy electronic voting machines that do not produce a paper trail.'b'After the Help America Vote Act was passed, the Republican majority in the Senate and House blocked paper trail bills \xe2\x80\x94 including one introduced by Representative Rush Holt, Democrat of New Jersey, with roughly 200 co-sponsors.'b'This federal inaction has pushed reform efforts to the state level. The remarkable thing is just how successful those efforts have been. State after state have adopted legislation requiring electronic voting machines to produce paper trails. In July 2005 alone, a particularly successful month, the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut 'b'signed laws'b' imposing a paper trail requirement.'b'California\xe2\x80\x99s law was passed over the opposition of the secretary of state and the California Association of Clerks and Election Officials. The clerks and election officials opposed the law even thought they conceded that without a paper trail, electronic voting results could be manipulated.'b'The bill\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor, State Senator Debra Bowen, was elected California\xe2\x80\x99s secretary of state in November, putting her in charge of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest election system.'b'Today, 27 states have paper trail laws, including 6 of the 10 largest states (California, New York, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and New Jersey). Eight more states use paper trails statewide, though they are not legally required to.'b'Another sign of the success of the reform movement: jurisdictions that adopted paperless touch-screen voting are beginning to abandon it.'b'New Mexico, where some voters used to use paperless touch-screens, has adopted 'b'a statewide system in which all votes are recorded on paper'b'.'b'In last November\xe2\x80\x99s elections, voters in Sarasota County, Fla., 'b'voted for a measure'b' to require their county to have voting machines with a paper trail by January 2008.'b'The commissioners in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, have begun talking about replacing their county\xe2\x80\x99s voting machines \xe2\x80\x94 which produce paper records that have not worked very well \xe2\x80\x94 with an optical scan system, in which voters fill out their ballots by hand, and those ballots are then counted by computers.'b'Many voting experts now agree that optical scan systems are the best technology, because the voters themselves produce the paper record that can later be recounted. That is better than a system in which the voting machine produces a paper record, which the voter may or may not check for accuracy. Optical scans are also better than touch-screens because many voters can fill out their ballots at once. The ballots are then quickly run through an optical scan reader. Waiting time to vote is far shorter using optical scans than touch-screens.'b'This state action has revolutionized the voting machine industry. Not long ago, many voting machine manufacturers insisted that it was impractical to provide voters with a voter-verified paper trail. But now that it is a legal requirement in most states, the companies are of necessity making machines that comply. New York is in the process of choosing new voting machines, and Diebold, ES&amp;S, Sequoia and Avante are all competing with machines that produce voter-verifiable paper records.'b''b'V. Poised for Victory at the National Level'b''b'Having electronic voting machines that can be trusted should not be a partisan issue, but for some reason it has been.'b'Democratic members of Congress have introduced most of the bills to require paper trails for electronic voting. (One notable exception: Senator John Ensign, Republican of Nevada, has a paper trail bill. In 1998, Senator Ensign lost a Senate race to Harry Reid, now the new Senate majority leader, by fewer than 500 votes.) The Republican leadership prevented those bills from coming to the floor.'b'With the Democrats now in charge, there is an excellent chance that a federal law requiring a paper trail will pass.'b'Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, is the new chairwoman of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, which has jurisdiction over election law. Last October, Senator Feinstein 'b'announced that she intends to introduce legislation requiring paper trails and mandatory, random audits'b' early in the new session.'b'Representative Rush Holt, Democrat of New Jersey, 'b'plans to push a paper trail bill in the House'b'. Mr. Holt\xe2\x80\x99s bill, 'b'called the Voter Confidence and Increased Accessibility Act'b', has more than 220 bipartisan sponsors.'b'If paper trail legislation is passed, there is certainly a chance that President Bush will veto it. But it is unclear whether a president who was put in office by the Supreme Court after an electoral system meltdown \xe2\x80\x94 and who has vetoed so few bills \xe2\x80\x94 would want to end his presidency by vetoing a popular bill to ensure the integrity of American democracy. In any case, given the growing bipartisan support for paper trails, it is not out of the question that a veto could be overridden.'b''b'***'b''b'The last few years have been hard ones for reformers. Washington\xe2\x80\x99s lobbying industry and its pay-to-play culture have thrived, despite the best efforts of good-government groups to get rules adopted to rein it in. Well-heeled contributors and cash-hungry politicians have proved adept at finding holes in the limited campaign finance regulations that are in place.'b'Fixing voting machines is one of the very few reform efforts that have met with undeniable success.'b'There are still, unquestionably, hurdles standing in the way.'b'Federal legislation could still be blocked, by a presidential veto or a Republican filibuster, or simply by cold feet in the ranks of the Democratic Party.'b'Even when there is good paper trail legislation, there is still a lot of work to be done.'b'The Cuyahoga County study showed that paper trails on touch-screens are still a highly imperfect technology. Election jurisdictions that have touch-screen machines may have to dump them \xe2\x80\x94 as Cuyahoga County is reportedly considering doing \xe2\x80\x94 in favor of optical scans, even though the cost of switching could be considerable. Or, working with the voting machine companies, they may need to find a way to make paper trails more reliable.'b'More work also needs to be done on the auditing process, to determine the optimal percentage of ballots to audit and the best procedures for doing so.'b'There is also a lot of work to be done beyond paper trails to make voting machines acceptable.'b'Ballot design remains a major area of deficiency, six years after the \xe2\x80\x9cbutterfly ballot\xe2\x80\x9d in Florida showed how easily a bad ballot can frustrate voters\xe2\x80\x99 intent. Many people now believe that the Congressional election in Florida\xe2\x80\x99s 13th District that is now in court \xe2\x80\x94 where the Republican, Vern Buchanan, beat the Democrat, Christine Jennings, by fewer than 400 votes, and as many as 18,000 votes may not have been registered on the paperless electronic voting machines \xe2\x80\x94 may have been tainted in Ms. Jennings\xe2\x80\x99s strongest county in part by a bad ballot design that confused voters into not casting a ballot in that race.'b'The overall quality of voting machines remains poor, and the reputations of the leading voting machine manufacturers are not good. In New York, some voting rights activists \xe2\x80\x94 and this editorial writer \xe2\x80\x94 have 'b'urged the boards of elections to put off adopting new machines'b' until the machines offered by the companies get better.'b'Still, it\xe2\x80\x99s amazing how far we have come in a little more than two years. This is one reform movement that is leaving its mark.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cA Surprising Secret to a Long Life: Stay in School\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cThe New Age\xe2\x80\x9d series, front page, Jan. 3):'b'The growing evidence that more schooling leads to better health provides a compelling rationale for New York and other cities to make school dropout prevention a public health priority as well as an educational priority.'b'Since disparities in health between the better-off and the poor and among whites, blacks and Latinos closely track differences in educational achievement, improving our city\xe2\x80\x99s abysmal school completion rates can help New York reduce inequities in health. Moreover, since better health also contributes to educational achievement, New York City should expand the number of school-based health centers, strengthen its health and sexuality education curriculum, and ensure safe and healthy environments in our schools.'b'Nicholas Freudenberg'b'New York, Jan. 4, 2007'b''b'The writer is president of the Public Health Association of New York City and a professor of public health at Hunter College.'b''b'New Orleans'b'IN one 24-hour period last week in New Orleans, now a small city of  200,000, six people were murdered. Last year\xe2\x80\x99s total of 161 murders probably made New Orleans the deadliest city in the United States by a significant margin. I suppose it was only a matter of time before the violence touched my life directly.'b'Last Thursday morning I received a call from my friend Kittee. \xe2\x80\x9cI have awful news,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and then, very quickly: \xe2\x80\x9cSomeone broke into Paul and Helen\xe2\x80\x99s house. Helen was shot and killed. Paul was holding Baby Francis and was shot three times. He\xe2\x80\x99s still alive.

When I met Paul through a friend, I asked him directly, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you in favor of the death penalty?\xe2\x80\x9d He responded, with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cEh, I\xe2\x80\x99m Canadian,\xe2\x80\x9d clearly feeling that was answer enough.'b'And it was, coming from the founder of our local chapter of Food Not Bombs and the front man for the Troublemakers (a band whose songs celebrate Emma Goldman and the idea of universal health care) in such a lighthearted tone that it would scarcely have alienated the most ardent conservative.'b'Helen Hill was Paul\xe2\x80\x99s perfect match  \xe2\x80\x94 a kind and generous woman who made award-winning animated films and taught art and filmmaking to children, adults, anyone who was interested. She\xe2\x80\x99d spent much of the last year restoring reels of 16-millimeter film on which she had drawn by hand, and which had been damaged when their house took four feet of water during Hurricane Katrina.'b'She had a new film under way, inspired by discarded hand-sewn dresses, made by an elderly New Orleanian, which Helen had found in the trash after  the woman\xe2\x80\x99s death. The film interwove the story of the old woman and her dresses with Helen\xe2\x80\x99s own flood-torn life, which took her, Paul and Francis to Columbia, S.C. \xe2\x80\x94 Helen\xe2\x80\x99s hometown, where she will be buried today \xe2\x80\x94  for almost a year.'b'Helen had longed to return to New Orleans, despite Paul\xe2\x80\x99s concern that crime and potential hurricanes made it too dangerous for their family. So  Helen campaigned, sending Paul\xe2\x80\x99s friends in New Orleans blank postcards, addressed to Paul, for us to write and mail to him.  In mine, I pleaded with Paul \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cWe need you\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the way I do with anyone who is thinking about leaving, coming to, or even just visiting New Orleans. After what I am sure was a flood of similar cards, Paul relented.'b'I saw Paul and the baby a day after their return to the city, at a parade on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Francis had on a little railroad conductor\xe2\x80\x99s hat, a T-shirt depicting a cartoon love affair between red beans and rice (the New Orleans Monday lunch classic), and a little sign pinned to his back, in Helen\xe2\x80\x99s hand: \xe2\x80\x9cNew Orleans Native. I Got Back Yesterday!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The day of the anniversary was solemn but optimistic. Everyone still had a can-do attitude. Paul, for one, could help make the city\xe2\x80\x99s people well and improve health care for the poor. Helen could make art depicting the city\xe2\x80\x99s life. Others could rebuild schools, demand better levees, reconstruct their homes. It still felt as if our grassroots efforts, along with some real help from a government finally forced to make good on its obligations, could create a more just, fair and safe  city. It might have been na\xc3\xafve, but it really seemed possible.'b'After wandering this beautiful, falling-over city the afternoon after Helen\xe2\x80\x99s murder, forcing myself to remember why I love it here so much, I came back to my garden and picked flowers, those hardy few that had weathered the recent cold. I put them in a vase, wrote out the verses to Edna St. Vincent Millay\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cDirge Without Music\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cI am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground / So it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and drove to the couple\xe2\x80\x99s house, which my wife and I had recently visited for Helen\xe2\x80\x99s open studio. On the steps leading up to their old shotgun house I set down the poem and the vase, just feet from where Paul had been found by the police, shot, bleeding, holding his baby.'b'On the way home, I stopped at my neighborhood bar to try to eat something. A picture of Paul and Helen, followed by one of the baby, appeared on the television in the corner. 'b'Oh, my God.'b' The bartender was kind. She asked me whether I knew them, and talked to me about her fears living with her new baby in a city with no functional schools, no real plan for redevelopment, and spotty or nonexistent basic services. The TV news switched to a weather report: torrential downpours were expected to dump half a foot of rain overnight.'b'I drove home in the twilight and arrived uneasy and restless. Remembering the coming rain, I resolved to make myself useful to my block by digging out a sewer so backed up that the street \xe2\x80\x94 on high ground by New Orleans standards \xe2\x80\x94 floods at even the hint of rain. I had done this many times before, having realized that my innumerable calls to the city were in vain.'b'I pried up the 100-pound cast iron cover with a shovel and then shimmied it from side to side until I had the two-by-four sewer open. It was full to the top with debris. I shoveled out the leaves, dirt, Popeye\xe2\x80\x99s cups and other garbage until the small brick rectangle was as clean as it was a century ago, when New Orleans first created this drainage system.'b'Then I set to work on clearing the cylindrical drain \xe2\x80\x94 about as wide as a hubcap, at the bottom corner of the cleaned-out basin \xe2\x80\x94 so that the rain could find its way into the city\xe2\x80\x99s sewers, away from our houses, cars and belongings. I got down with a small shovel and burrowed through the muck until it seemed to open at the other side. Reaching in, though, I could feel that beyond the drain lay more dirt and leaves, packed hard.'b'Indeed, it became clear to me that the whole sewer line running beneath the street was solid with waste, impenetrable to arms and shovels \xe2\x80\x94 that my street would flood again that night. The problem, I realized, is bigger than me.'b''b'I know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned'b'.'b'President Hugo Ch\xc3\xa1vez of Venezuela \xe2\x80\x94 the very portrait of a modern Latin American strongman \xe2\x80\x94 is not content to exercise near-total political and military control of his country.

That\xe2\x80\x99s bad news for foreign investors, but even more so for the Venezuelan people who will have to pay the price for an economy plagued by increasing inefficiency and corruption.'b'Mr. Ch\xc3\xa1vez announced this week that he would nationalize electricity and telecommunications companies. Venezuela\xe2\x80\x99s biggest telecommunications company is partly owned by Verizon Communications. Its largest publicly traded electricity company is controlled by another American company, the AES Corporation. Mr. Ch\xc3\xa1vez also declared his intention to take control of four multibillion- dollar oil projects with significant investments from foreign companies.'b'State control is rarely an efficient way to run companies.

Mr. Ch\xc3\xa1vez is already using the state-controlled oil company to reward his cronies at the expense of getting the best return on Venezuela\xe2\x80\x99s most lucrative resource.'b'Exactly what form these nationalizations will take remains unclear. Whatever Mr. Ch\xc3\xa1vez is planning, he needs to fairly compensate shareholders.

Arnold Lakind'b'North Brunswick, N.J., Jan. 7, 2007'b'Gov. Eliot Spitzer of New York set an important national example this week when he announced that the state corrections department would back away from a longstanding policy of charging prison inmates and their families more than six times the going rate for collect calls made from prison.'b'Prisons all over the country began gouging inmates and their families when telephone companies started paying legalized kickbacks \xe2\x80\x94 called \xe2\x80\x9ccommissions\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 to the state prison systems in return for a monopoly on the service. These schemes place a huge financial burden on inmate families, who tend to be among the poorest in the nation, and who must often choose between paying phone bills and putting food on the table.'b'The Spitzer administration, which plans to waive its commission and renegotiate the current contract with its prison telephone carrier, estimates that the cost of a collect call from prison will drop by about half once the program goes into effect. That\xe2\x80\x99s good as far as it goes. But the better solution would be to introduce a cheaper, debit calling system like the one used in federal prisons, where inmates use computer-controlled accounts to pay for calls.'b'The governor\xe2\x80\x99s announcement didn\xe2\x80\x99t come out of nowhere. Arguments against New York\xe2\x80\x99s collect-call-only system were heard yesterday in the state\xe2\x80\x99s highest court. At the same time, laws that would make the system fairer for inmates and their families are pending in the State Legislature.'b'Whatever the source, fair pricing for prison telephone service is important. In addition to unburdening poor families, it would encourage sustained contact between inmates and their relations. And that would make it more likely that the inmates would  forge crime-free lives once they got out.'b'The Senate\xe2\x80\x99s new majority leader, Harry Reid, like most of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle,  is an admitted frequent flier on posh lobbyist-provided corporate jets. So we were very pleased yesterday when he  proposed legislation that would require senators to pay the full charter-flight fare if they wanted to ride in the style of a C.E.O.'b'Speaker Nancy Pelosi took the issue further with a full House ban on private jet perks, enacted through a rules change, not legislation. But Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s initiative could be just as effective, provided  no loopholes creep in as the Senate takes up wide-ranging proposals for ethics reform.'b'No less vital to the new Democratic majority\xe2\x80\x99s corruption-fighter claims is the need to create a public integrity office of nonpartisan professionals to help Congress police its own misbehavior. The Republican-controlled Senate rejected the idea last year, but voters soon put a new hand on the gavel. Senator Reid and Ms. Pelosi should both move quickly to create such an office.'b'Senator Reid also wants his chamber to repair its flimsy regulations by banning gifts, travel and entertainment boons \xe2\x80\x94 not just from lobbyists, but from their corporate employers. This should be enacted with bipartisan support, along with more measures to strike at the heart of the corruption issue: the mutual back-scratching of lobbyists and lawmakers who routinely barter lucrative campaign donations for lucrative legislative favors.'b'Strong proposals are to be debated in coming days,  including legislation that would require lobbyists and lawmakers to provide fuller public disclosures of who raises how much for whom. Another proposal would shine a bright light on \xe2\x80\x9cearmark\xe2\x80\x9d trafficking \xe2\x80\x94 the process by which lawmakers slip last-minute, debate-free and unsigned amendments into bills on behalf of favored pleaders. A third proposal would curb so-called \xe2\x80\x9cAstroturfing,\xe2\x80\x9d requiring the disclosure of the finances of lobbyists\xe2\x80\x99 phony grass-roots pressure groups.'b'It is far past time for Congress to end all these practices. And far past time for Congress to clean up the lobbying industry and itself.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t Play With Maps\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Jan. 9):'b'Dennis Ross rightly lambastes the mythologizing that has persistently impaired the Middle East peace process.

The moment was perfect.'b'People forget now, but much of the joy of that night revolved around not McGwire, but Maris\xe2\x80\x99s family. When Maris had broken Babe Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s record in 1961, he had been showered with scorn and derision. The fanfare McGwire received 37 years later was, indirectly, an affirmation of Maris: his children, who were in Busch Stadium that night, were able to finally receive the accolades that had been denied their father. When McGwire hugged his rival Sammy Sosa and hoisted his cherubic son to the heavens, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just a celebration; it felt as if something had been healed, a mistake corrected.'b'Now, of course, whenever the highlights of that night are shown, they\xe2\x80\x99re usually accompanied by foreboding music and interspersed with the infamous images of McGwire and Sosa testifying before Congress about steroids. In just eight years, the night has turned from symbolizing everything that was right about sports into everything that is wrong.'b'Now McGwire finds himself about 300 stubborn, scolding minds away from the Hall of Fame, and Sosa is probably even farther. If you were touched by that evening, you are now supposed to feel duped \xe2\x80\x94 that it was all a facade that has eroded away.'b'But it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t. One name that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been mentioned much in the last few years is Tim Forneris. Remember him? He was the young groundskeeper who ended up with McGwire\xe2\x80\x99s home run ball. Though collectors would have paid millions for the ball \xe2\x80\x94 McGwire\xe2\x80\x99s 70th ultimately went for more than $3 million \xe2\x80\x94 Forneris, caught up in the spirit of the moment, gave it back to McGwire, saying it belonged in the Hall of Fame.'b'Forneris\xe2\x80\x99s decision was derided by the cynics, but most fans applauded him: The moment was too inspiring and uniting to be sullied by something as ugly as rampant consumerism and greed. It was sports in its purest form, a feel-good moment that was unscripted and unrehearsed. It was perfect.'b'And now, if you believe the sports consensus, we\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be ashamed of that night, to see it as some dark blotch on the history of sport. But it was not, and trying to convince ourselves it was does us all a disservice.'b'Whatever your thoughts on steroids and McGwire\xe2\x80\x99s and Sosa\xe2\x80\x99s murky history with them, that night really did happen, and all the optimism and warmth that came out of it was real. Tim Forneris really did give back that ball. McGwire really did embrace his son and provide a real-life \xe2\x80\x9cField of Dreams\xe2\x80\x9d moment for fathers and sons everywhere. (My father called me seconds after the homer and still has the game on videotape.) The Maris children really did cry and honor their tortured, maligned father. We were all touched by these moments, and why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we be? They were real.'b'Sportswriters can cast their votes of \xe2\x80\x9cprotest\xe2\x80\x9d all they want \xe2\x80\x94 and we can reserve our right to suspect they\xe2\x80\x99re full of bunk. Mike Lupica of The Daily News has been a fierce voice against McGwire and Sosa and their \xe2\x80\x9chypocrisy,\xe2\x80\x9d but he made a tidy sum off \xe2\x80\x9cSummer of \xe2\x80\x9998,\xe2\x80\x9d his memoir about following that home run chase with his sons. That night in 1998 isn\xe2\x80\x99t going away and we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pretend it didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen. It did. And you know what? It was good. It was a great night.'b'Providence, R.I.'b'MY father once told me that he and his mother read the body count in the newspaper together. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me the exact day or time, or precisely where they were when they read it, but I like to imagine that they sat at the long, wooden table in the kitchen of the farmhouse where the Trussoni children, all 12 of them, used to eat. It was only a month or so before my father left for the war, the winter of 1967, a time of year when Wisconsin is cold and harsh and so dismal that the red barn sitting just beyond the house would have appeared as a splotch of divine color in a field of gray.'b'I imagine my grandmother pressing the sheets of crisp, ink-smeared paper against the grain of the kitchen table. The numbers were there, for both of them to see.'b'The farmhouse was a narrow stone structure, tall and close fitting, nestled between high bluffs just east of the Mississippi River. Row after row of corn and tobacco undulated from the back of the house, rising and falling with the curvature of the land. Like the rest of America, the family got its news from a black and white Zenith television set and the local paper.'b'Reading the body count in the paper was my father\xe2\x80\x99s way of preparing for the war. The American dead, the Vietnamese dead, the Communist dead, each group had its own tally. Similar body counts were broadcast on the nightly news, and he would watch the images of fighting, trying to anticipate his own fate.'b'But my grandmother, I imagine, read the numbers to steel herself against her fourth son\xe2\x80\x99s departure. She had sent three sons to Vietnam already \xe2\x80\x94 Richard, Albert and John \xe2\x80\x94 and would now send a fourth. A third of her children would be in a war zone and still I imagine she looked much as she did when I knew her: sharp, cool eyes steady, a perennial I\xe2\x80\x99ve-seen-it-all-and-then-some look about her. My grandmother was normally imperturbable, but my father\xe2\x80\x99s draft notice, this fourth boy conscripted, had shaken her.'b'The numbers signified different things to each of them. By the end of 1967, 15,000 American soldiers had died in Vietnam. For my grandmother this meant that 15,000 other people\xe2\x80\x99s children had died. To my father, the numbers seemed decent odds: Yes, the American troops were losing men, but the Communists were faring much, much worse. Of particular interest were what he called the \xe2\x80\x9ckill ratios,\xe2\x80\x9d the number of Vietnamese to every American dead. For Dad, the high ratio of Communist casualties was a sign of hope. He believed, he once told me, that the numbers proved that \xe2\x80\x9cthe good guys\xe2\x80\x9d were winning; the numbers, he said, meant that he had a \xe2\x80\x9cbetter shot\xe2\x80\x9d than the enemy; the numbers were \xe2\x80\x9con his side.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Years after his tour, when my father knew just how quickly the numbers could turn \xe2\x80\x94 he landed in Vietnam during the Tet offensive and fulfilled his tour during the bloodiest year of the war \xe2\x80\x94 he never hesitated to tell me of his swift disillusionment with the numbers. The distinct American advantage in the \xe2\x80\x9ckill ratio\xe2\x80\x9d said much about winning the battles \xe2\x80\x94 it was true, they were killing lots of Vietnamese \xe2\x80\x94 but little about winning the war: the Vietnamese were willing to give every man, woman and child for victory, a sacrifice that Americans were simply not prepared to make. In the end, for our 58,000 dead, the casualties on the Vietnamese side were in the millions.'b'There are no kill ratios in Iraq. We know very little about civilian casualties. But we do know that even as President Bush speaks about a new strategy for the war, more than 3,000 Americans have been killed in four years of fighting. And as I think of those lives cut short, I think of my father and my grandmother on that winter afternoon in 1967, a newspaper open between them, each with their own interpretation.'b'Perhaps my father is peeling an apple; perhaps he is gazing out the window at the endless frozen cornfields, the pane of glass so thin and ill fitted that a draft of freezing air slips through the kitchen, ruffling the edge of the paper whose reality will soon enough be indisputable.'b'New Yorkers have spent the last few days getting sneering phone calls and e-mail from friends in distant places. Some recommended their favorite air fresheners or asked if we washed our socks. Others worried that this week\xe2\x80\x99s big stink was a plot of some kind \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps terrorists, of course, since we always think that first now. But perhaps it was the work of somebody launching  a fancy new oxygen atomizer:  fresh air from the islands at only $5 a whiff.'b'What happened on Monday morning at 9  was that large swaths of Manhattan started to smell extremely bad. Described by most as the smell your gas stove makes when you forget to light the burner, the odor lasted about an hour. It was so bad in some areas that people decided not to go outside and smoke for fear of igniting the neighborhood.'b'As expected, New Jersey was quickly blamed for the foul smell.  But to date, there has been no public explanation for what the stink was or where it came from. Similarly, there has been no public explanation of a very sweet smell that took over most of Manhattan in late 2005 and was described as being a very good imitation of imitation maple syrup.'b'The lack of answers about these smells did nothing to deter the theories. One favorite: Are the security folks testing to see what a really dangerous gas would do if released over the big city? Did somebody then map the complaint pattern to see who would go first? Or: Was this an industrial leak that nobody is acknowledging for fear of lawsuits? Or: Has air quality improved so much in New York that we can actually notice an odd smell?'b'It is a frightening world, and New Yorkers now know to speak up if we see, hear, sense \xe2\x80\x94 or smell \xe2\x80\x94 something untoward. This time the problem blew over quickly, except on the late-night comedy circuit. It was, thankfully, just a big-city stink, not an urban disaster.'b'President Bush told Americans last night that failure in Iraq would be a disaster. The disaster is Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s war, and he has already failed. Last night was his chance to stop offering more fog and be honest with the nation, and he did not take it.'b'Americans needed to hear a clear plan to extricate United States  troops from the disaster that Mr. Bush created. What they got was more gauzy talk of victory in the war on terrorism and of creating a \xe2\x80\x9cyoung democracy\xe2\x80\x9d in Iraq. In other words, a way for this president to run out the clock and leave his mess for the next one.'b'Mr. Bush did acknowledge that some of his previous tactics had failed. But even then, the president sounded as if he were an accidental tourist in Iraq. He described the failure of last year\xe2\x80\x99s effort to pacify Baghdad as if the White House and the Pentagon bore no responsibility.'b'In any case, Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s excuses were tragically inadequate. The nation needs an eyes-wide-open recognition that the only goal left is to get the U.S. military out of this civil war in a way that could minimize the slaughter of Iraqis and reduce the chances that the chaos Mr. Bush unleashed will engulf Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors.'b'What it certainly did not need were more of Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s open-ended threats to Iran and Syria.'b'Before Mr. Bush spoke, Americans knew he planned to send more troops to pacify lawless Baghdad. Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s task was to justify that escalation by acknowledging that there was no military solution to this war and outlining the political mission that the military would be serving. We were waiting for him to detail the specific milestones that he would set for the Iraqis, set clear timelines for when they would be expected to meet them, and explain what he intended to do if they again failed.'b'Instead, he said he had warned the Iraqis that if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t come through, they would lose the faith of the American people. Has Mr. Bush really not noticed that the American people long ago lost faith in the Iraqi government \xe2\x80\x94 and in him as well? Americans know that this Iraqi government is captive to Shiite militias, with no interest in the unity, reconciliation and democracy that Mr. Bush says he wants.'b'Mr. Bush said yet again that he wanted the Iraqi government to step up to the task of providing its security, and that Iraq needed a law on the fair distribution of oil money. Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s government needs to do a lot more than that, starting with disarming the sectarian militias that are feeding the civil war and purging the police forces that too often are really death squads. It needs to offer amnesty to insurgents and militia fighters willing to put down their weapons. It needs to do those things immediately.'b'Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s Shiite-dominated government has heard this list before. But so long as Mr. Bush is willing to back that failed government indefinitely \xe2\x80\x94 enabling is the psychological term \xe2\x80\x94 Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s leaders will have no reason to move against the militias and more fairly share power with the Sunni minority.'b'Mr. Bush did announce his plan for 20,000 more troops, and the White House trumpeted a $1 billion contribution to reconstruction efforts. Congress will debate these as if they are the real issues. But they are not. Talk of a \xe2\x80\x9csurge\xe2\x80\x9d ignores the other 132,000 American troops trapped by a failed strategy.'b'We have argued that the United States has a moral obligation to stay in Iraq as long as there is a chance to mitigate the damage that a quick withdrawal might cause. We have called for an effort to secure Baghdad, but as part of the sort of comprehensive political solution utterly lacking in Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s speech. This war has reached the point that merely prolonging it could make a bad ending even worse. Without a real plan to bring it to a close, there is no point in talking about jobs programs and military offensives.

There were millions of disaffected Republicans and independents ready to coalesce around some alternative way forward, but the Democrats never came up with anything remotely serious.'b'The liberals who favor quick exit never grappled with the consequences of that policy, which the Baker-Hamilton commission terrifyingly described. The centrists who believe in gradual withdrawal never explained why that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be like pulling a tooth slowly. Joe Biden, who has the most intellectually serious framework for dealing with Iraq, was busy yesterday, at the crucial decision-making moment, conducting preliminary fact-finding hearings, complete with forays into Iraqi history.'b'The Democrats have been fecund with criticisms of the war, but when it comes to alternative proposals, a common approach is social Darwinism on stilts: We failed them, now they\xe2\x80\x99re on their own.'b'So we are stuck with the Bush proposal as the only serious plan on offer. The question is, what exactly did President Bush propose last night? The policy rollout has been befogged by so much spin and misdirection it\xe2\x80\x99s nearly impossible to figure out what the president is proposing.'b'Nonetheless, here\xe2\x80\x99s my reconstruction of how this policy evolved:'b'On Nov. 30, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki presented Bush with a new security plan for Baghdad. It called for U.S. troops to move out of Baghdad to the periphery, where they would chase down Sunni terrorists. Iraqi Shiite and Kurdish troops, meanwhile, would flood into the city to establish order, at least as they define it.'b'Maliki essentially wanted the American troops protecting his flank but out of his hair. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t want U.S. soldiers embedded with his own. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t want American generals hovering over his shoulder. His government didn\xe2\x80\x99t want any restraints on Shiite might.'b'Over the next weeks, Bush rejected the plan and opted for the opposite approach. Instead of handing counterinsurgency over to the Iraqis/Shiites, he decided to throw roughly 20,000 U.S. troops  \xe2\x80\x94 everything he had available  \xe2\x80\x94 into Baghdad. He and his advisers negotiated new rules of engagement to make it easier to go after Shiites as well as Sunnis. He selected two aggressive counterinsurgency commanders, David Petraeus and Raymond Odierno, to lead the effort. Odierno recently told John Burns of The Times that American forces would remain in cleared areas of Baghdad \xe2\x80\x9c24/7,\xe2\x80\x9d suggesting a heavy U.S. presence.'b'Then came the job of selling the plan. The administration could not go before the world and say that the president had decided to overrule the sovereign nation of Iraq. Officials could not tell wavering Republicans that the president was proposing a heavy, U.S.-led approach.'b'Thus, administration officials are saying that they have adopted the Maliki plan, just with a few minor tweaks. In briefings and in the president\xe2\x80\x99s speech, officials claimed that this was an Iraqi-designed plan, that Iraqi troops would take on all the primary roles in clearing and holding neighborhoods, that Iraqis in mixed neighborhoods would scarcely see any additional Americans.'b'All of this is designed to soothe the wounded pride of the Maliki government, and to make the U.S. offensive seem less arduous at home. It\xe2\x80\x99s the opposite of the truth.'b'Yesterday, administration officials were praising Maliki lavishly. He wants the same things we want, they claimed. He has resolved to lead a nonsectarian government. He is reworking his governing coalitions and marginalizing the extremists. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the nascent rise of a moderate political bloc,\xe2\x80\x9d one senior administration official said yesterday.'b'But the selling of the plan illustrates that this is not the whole story. The Iraqi government wants a unified non-sectarian solution in high-minded statements and in some distant, ideal world. But in the short term, and in the deepest reptilian folds of their brains, the Shiites are maneuvering amid the sectarian bloodbath all around.'b'This is not a function of the character of Maliki or this or that official. It\xe2\x80\x99s a function of the core dynamic now afflicting Iraqi society.'b'The enemy in Iraq is not some discrete group of killers. It\xe2\x80\x99s the maelstrom of violence and hatred that infects every institution, including the government and the military. Instead of facing up to this core reality, the Bush administration has papered it over with salesmanship and spin.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cDemocrats Plan Symbolic Votes Against Bush\xe2\x80\x99s Iraq Troop Plan\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 10):'b'So the Democrats are planning symbolic votes against more troops for Iraq.'b'Actually, when I and many other Americans cast our votes against this war, even before the prospect of escalation, they were for real.'b'Daniel England'b'Fairfield, Conn., Jan. 10, 2007'b'New Orleans'b'As its problems mount, the Big Easy is becoming increasingly unnerved.'b'Local officials, who will never be mistaken for the brightest lights in the firmament, have been unable to stem a hideous wave of murders.

Most people call him Gabe, and so will I for the rest of this column. Gabe is a middle-aged bundle of energy who heads the NHP Foundation, a national nonprofit organization that has taken on the difficult mission of providing quality housing at rents that poor and middle-class families can afford. There is no more imperative need in New Orleans than affordable housing.'b'On Garden Oaks Drive in the Algiers neighborhood Gabe showed me a remarkable sight  \xe2\x80\x94 a sparkling two-story apartment complex, neatly landscaped, that was owned by NHPF, was badly damaged by the hurricane, and is now being completely renovated at a cost of $20 million.'b'Nearby are buildings that look like the hurricane hit them yesterday. The NHPF complex, known as Forest Park, will have 284 solid, attractive, energy-efficient units completed this year, with tenants beginning to move in as early as May. The rents will range from $194 to $673 a month.'b'In New Orleans East, which had been completely submerged in the flood, I stood with Gabe and an architect at what was once the site of a housing complex known as Walnut Square. \xe2\x80\x9cNew Orleans East was under water for eight days,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabe. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had to raze it. It\xe2\x80\x99s demolished.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A quiet wind was blowing across the vast empty space where 18 residential buildings used to be.'b'The effort to rebuild Walnut Square, at a cost of $37 million, is already under way. There will be 209 apartments, with rents ranging from $130 to $820 a month. There will also be a commercial strip, a community center and day care facilities. (The apartments will be built on raised foundations to guard against future catastrophic floods.)'b'Eventually Gabe hopes to build 3,000 affordable rental apartments in and around New Orleans at a total cost of $300 million.'b'How does he do it, when others find the task so daunting?'b'The key, he said, is to combine the expertise of a successful real estate operation with the talent and vision of an experienced foundation committed to what is essentially a charitable mission. NHPF, which has its Louisiana office in Baton Rouge, gets the funds to build from government grants, tax credits and low-interest loans, as well as conventional financing.'b'As Gabe dryly noted, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is not much profit in developing low- income housing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'No successful rebirth of New Orleans is possible without substantial amounts of new and rebuilt housing  \xe2\x80\x94 housing that the city\xe2\x80\x99s very large percentage of low-income residents can afford. Most of the people homing in on development opportunities here have either no interest or no expertise in building such housing.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere are essentially two kinds of organizations here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabe. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have out-of-town real estate developers who look at this as a tremendous opportunity and their main concern, quite naturally, has been how much money they can make. On the other hand, you have well-meaning nonprofit entities that unfortunately, in most cases, do not have the capacity to develop on a significant scale.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Compounding the problem has been the lack of housing expertise in New Orleans. Much of the city\xe2\x80\x99s housing stock pre-Katrina was so poor as to be illegal in most major American cities. The Housing Authority of New Orleans, which administered public housing, was in such bad shape its operations had to be taken over by the federal government.'b'Half the population of New Orleans has been dispersed across the United States. Many of those still in the city are living in trailers or are doubled up with relatives and friends. There is no way to overstate the desperate need for housing.'b'Gabe and the NHP Foundation have provided at least one model that works.'b'The tax system in the United States is supposed to mitigate inequality. But a recent report by Congress\xe2\x80\x99s budget agency provides fresh evidence that Bush-era tax cuts have done more to reinforce inequality than to redress it.'b'The agency found that in 2004, the latest year for which comprehensive data were available, the top 1 percent of households pocketed 14 percent of total after-tax income in the United States, up from 12.2 percent in 2003. That increase, the third largest in one year since the agency started keeping track in 1979, works out to an extra $128 billion.  And yet despite that hefty gain, the effective federal tax rate of the top 1 percent decreased slightly.'b'In contrast, the share of after-tax income going to households in the middle of the income distribution fell to 15 percent in 2004, down from 15.4 percent in 2003 \xe2\x80\x94 the equivalent of a $29 billion loss. In that time, the share of their income going to federal taxes stayed about the same.'b'One of the reasons the rich are getting so much richer than everyone else is that investment income is highly concentrated among the richest Americans and has grown robustly through much of the Bush years \xe2\x80\x94 unlike wages and salaries. But the rise in investment income hasn\xe2\x80\x99t caused rich Americans\xe2\x80\x99 income taxes to rise substantially because \xe2\x80\x94 thanks to the tax cuts of 2003 \xe2\x80\x94 investments are now taxed at about the lowest rates in the code.'b'Another reason for the after-tax advance of upper-income Americans is that an ever larger share of their salaries escapes the payroll tax that pays for Social Security benefits. The annual amount of income subject to the tax \xe2\x80\x94 now  $97,500 \xe2\x80\x94 has been adjusted upward each year since 1982, in line with the increase in average wages. But as pay raises at the top of the income scale have increasingly  exceeded the average wage gain, incremental adjustments in the wage cap have been inadequate. In 1982, only about 10 percent of all wages escaped the tax. Today, that figure is estimated at 15 percent. The administration has yet to call for raising the cap, though doing so is a matter of simple fairness.'b'Unfortunately, with the administration having abandoned fiscal prudence for the past six years, it\xe2\x80\x99s practically inevitable that inequality will worsen. The bill for the deficit-financed tax cuts of the Bush era will arrive in the years to come. It\xe2\x80\x99s likely that the costs will be borne by all, even though most of the benefits have accrued to the few.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cEthics Overhaul Tops the Agenda as the Democrats Take Over\xe2\x80\x9d (news article, Jan. 4):'b'You report that \xe2\x80\x9cthe scene vividly illustrated the pressure that Democrats will face from the left wing of their party to challenge President Bush more aggressively on Iraq,\xe2\x80\x9d referring to antiwar demonstrators who interrupted the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 news conference introducing ethics legislation.'b'I feel compelled, as the director of Grandmothers Against the War, to say that very few of us grannies would characterize ourselves as leftists.'b'We consider ourselves patriots as we desperately seek to end the catastrophic and immoral occupation of Iraq.

I\xe2\x80\x99ll surge. I\xe2\x80\x99ll surge on the condition that you once and for all enlist the entire American people in this war effort, and stop putting it all on the shoulders of 130,000 military families, and now 20,000 more. I\xe2\x80\x99ll surge on the condition that you make them 'b'fight all of us'b' \xe2\x80\x94  and that means a real energy policy, with a real gasoline tax, that ends our addiction to oil, shrinks the flow of petro-dollars to bad actors and makes America the world\xe2\x80\x99s leader in conservation.'b'But please, Mr. President, stop insulting our intelligence by telling us that this is the \xe2\x80\x9cdecisive ideological struggle of our time,\xe2\x80\x9d but we\xe2\x80\x99re going to put the whole burden of victory on 150,000 U.S. soldiers. Yes, you\xe2\x80\x99re right, confronting  violent Islamic radicalism by trying to tilt Iraq and the Arab-Muslim world onto a more progressive track is indeed hugely important. But the way you have fought this war  \xe2\x80\x94 with our pinky  \xe2\x80\x94 is contemptible. For three years you would not summon the military means to back your lofty ends.'b'That led to a vacuum. The Sunnis, who refused to accept majority rule by Shiites, went on a murderous rampage, and that rampage has now metastasized into five different wars in Iraq: Sunnis against Shiites; Sunnis and Shiites against the U.S. \xe2\x80\x9coccupiers\xe2\x80\x9d; Al Qaeda against the U.S.; Shiite theocratic thugs against ordinary Shiites; and Iran, Syria and all the Arab autocrats against any kind of democratic, Shiite-led Iraq that could be a model for their own people.'b'Hence my observation: The notion that the only war in Iraq now is good guys versus terrorists is ludicrous. There is no center in Iraq. And when there is no center and you put in more troops, you end up supporting a side. (See Lebanon: 1982)'b'And now for the advice. At this 11th hour, with Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s sectarian fires raging, the only way more U.S. troops might bring stability is if you add two missing elements: a deadline and a floor.'b'You need to tell Iraqis that by calling for a surge in troops you\xe2\x80\x99re giving them one last chance to reconcile, otherwise we\xe2\x80\x99re gone by Dec. 1. And you need to tell Americans that you\xe2\x80\x99re creating a $45-a-barrel floor price for imported oil, so investors can safely finance alternatives without worrying that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be undercut by OPEC.'b'By not setting a hard date to leave Iraq, we are only putting a floor under bad behavior and allowing Iraqi leaders to pay wholesale, not retail, for their tribal politics. If Sunnis or Shiites want it \xe2\x80\x9call\xe2\x80\x9d in Iraq, they have to pay for it all.'b'Of course, just leaving would be bad for us and terrible for those Iraqis who have worked with us. We need to give them all U.S. passports. We have a moral responsibility to them. But it would also be bad for a lot of bad people. They would be left to fight it out with each other. And yes, Syria and Iran would \xe2\x80\x9cwin\xe2\x80\x9d Iraq  \xe2\x80\x94 meaning they\xe2\x80\x99d win the responsibility of managing the mess there or have it spill over on them. Have a nice day.'b'And by not setting a hard floor price for oil to promote alternative energy, we are only helping to subsidize bad governance by Arab leaders toward their people and bad behavior by Americans toward the climate.'b'Make them fight all of us, Mr. President, or don\xe2\x80\x99t do it at all! If we made ourselves energy independent, we would bring down global oil prices, which would not only shrink  the resources for mischief by our enemies and limit Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s ability to transform Islam all over the world into its most intolerant Wahhabi form, but also, more important, would force the Arab world to reform. It would force Arab leaders,  including Iraqis, to organize their societies in ways that would  tap their people, not just their oil wells  \xe2\x80\x94 'b'whether our troops were there or not'b'.  Also, if the rest of the world saw all of us sacrificing to win this war, we might actually be able to enlist them to help a little.'b'More troops alone will not suffice. The only tiny hope left of transforming Iraq is if its leaders have to pay the full retail price of their passions and we have to pay the full retail price of our oil. And if even that won\xe2\x80\x99t work, then setting a date and setting an oil price will extract us from this disaster and make us less vulnerable to the madness we leave behind.'b'If we fail in Iraq, at least let America be stronger  \xe2\x80\x94  by being energy independent  \xe2\x80\x94  the morning after.'b'From all the ruckus raised by the administration and its patrons in the pharmaceutical industry, you would think that Congressional Democrats were out to destroy the free market system when they call for the government to negotiate the prices of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Yet a bill scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives today is sufficiently flexible to allow older Americans to benefit from the best efforts of both the government and the private drug plans.'b'The secretary of health and human services should be able to exert his bargaining power with drug companies in those cases in which the private plans have failed to rein in unduly high prices \xe2\x80\x94 leaving the rest to the drug plans. The result could be lower costs for consumers and savings for the taxpayers who support Medicare.'b'Under current law, written to appease the pharmaceutical industry, the government is explicitly forbidden from using its huge purchasing power to negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. That job is left to the private health plans that provide drug coverage under Medicare and compete for customers in part on the basis of cost.'b'The Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 bill would end the prohibition and require \xe2\x80\x94 not just authorize \xe2\x80\x94 the secretary of health and human services to negotiate prices with the manufacturers. That language is important since the current secretary, Michael Leavitt, has said he does not want the power to negotiate.'b'No data is publicly available to indicate what prices the private health plans actually pay the manufacturers. But judging from what they charge their beneficiaries, it looks like they pay significantly more for many drugs than do the Department of Veterans Affairs \xe2\x80\x94 which by law gets big discounts \xe2\x80\x94 the Medicaid programs for the poor, or foreign countries.'b'The administration argues, correctly, that the private plans have held costs down and that there is no guarantee the government will do any better. The bill, for example, prohibits the secretary from limiting which drugs are covered by Medicare, thus depriving him of a tool used by private plans and the V.A. to win big discounts from companies eager to get their drugs on the list. The secretary does have the bully pulpit, which he can use to try to bring down the cost of overpriced drugs.'b'The bill also does not require the secretary to negotiate prices for all 4,400 drugs used by beneficiaries. A smart secretary could simply determine which prices paid by the plans seemed most out of line with the prices paid by other purchasers and then negotiate only on those drugs. The private plans are explicitly allowed to negotiate even lower prices if they can. This sort of flexibility should pose no threat to the free market. It is time for the Medicare drug program to work harder for its beneficiaries without worrying so much about the pharmaceutical companies.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cBush Adding 20,000 U.S. Troops; Sets Goal of Securing Baghdad\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 11):'b'The president, in his speech to the nation on Wednesday, said, \xe2\x80\x9cFor the safety of our people, America must succeed in Iraq.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If the safety of the American people had been considered in advance by a competent president, we would have never mounted the unnecessary invasion of Iraq.'b'This president has thrust this nation into a predictably disastrous entanglement from which there is no satisfactory escape, never mind the unattainable \xe2\x80\x9cvictory\xe2\x80\x9d to which Mr. Bush repeatedly refers.'b'Placing 20,000 more American troops into the caldron that Iraq has become will serve only to increase the number of dead and maimed Americans and Iraqis, leaving the sectarian civil war to rage on with little or no restraint.'b'The best of the wretched alternatives this president has left us is that of immediate withdrawal of the troops he has placed in grave danger with his failed war of choice.

Peter Hayden'b'Manchester, Mo., Jan. 11, 2007'b'The north of Mexico is under siege. Gang wars for control of the drug market and cocaine routes to the United States took at least 2,000 lives in Mexico last year, most of them in border states. Serious journalism is also a victim.'b'Working as a reporter has become a very dangerous job in Mexico. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, seven Mexican reporters were killed last year, their work the confirmed or suspected reason. This count moves Mexico past Colombia \xe2\x80\x94 a country where journalists vanish with terrifying regularity.'b'Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s count is still much lower than Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s record of 39 murders in 2006. But it is high enough to accomplish what the traffickers want. Widespread intimidation has brought coverage of drug trafficking virtually to a halt.'b'Among the most prominent dead are Roberto Javier Mora Garc\xc3\xada, the highly respected editor of El Ma\xc3\xb1ana in the border town of Nuevo Laredo, who was stabbed to death in March 2004. Alfredo Jim\xc3\xa9nez Mota, the trafficking expert at El Imparci\xc3\xa1l in Hermosillo, Sonora, has been missing since April 2005. Last year, Enrique Perea Quintanilla, editor of the Chihuahua magazine Dos Caras, Una Verdad, which reported on unsolved crimes, was killed.'b'At respected newspapers across the north, even innocuous decisions \xe2\x80\x94 publishing photos of traffickers at a wedding, for example \xe2\x80\x94 can bring death threats. Reporters have been kidnapped briefly by drug gangs as a warning. The drug cartels pay off other reporters, who warn colleagues not to touch certain subjects or print certain names or pictures.'b'Newspapers, many of which depend heavily on government advertising, also face financial pressure from local officials and business leaders to tamp down the reporting. Some officials are on the take; others simply do not want bad news to scare away business and tourism.  Northern Mexico is rife with violence, fear and corruption \xe2\x80\x94 except in its newspapers. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore, we focused on writing good stories that went beyond official statements on organized crime and drug trafficking,\xe2\x80\x9d said the editor of one northern paper. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we are worried about taking care of ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Shortly after Mr. Jim\xc3\xa9nez Mota disappeared, El Imparci\xc3\xa1l announced that conditions did not permit investigations into drug trafficking, and it would no longer do them. Nor would papers owned by the same family in Tijuana and Mexicali. El Ma\xc3\xb1ana stopped investigating organized crime after Mr. Mora Garci\xc3\xa1\xe2\x80\x99s death. Then last February,   gunmen broke into the newspaper, firing shots and throwing a grenade, seriously wounding one reporter. The shooting followed a high-profile international conference on journalism in Nuevo Laredo. After the attack, the paper announced that it was no longer going to publish anything about drug trafficking.'b'At most papers today, coverage of organized crime is limited to printing unsigned stories quoting official police information after a killing, and each killing is treated as an isolated event. Some will not even do this, preferring complete silence.'b'Last February, Vicente Fox, the president then, appointed a special federal prosecutor to investigate crimes against journalists. This was a needed statement of support, and a way to take such cases out of the hands of state courts, where traffickers enjoy impunity. But the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s resources and mandate are limited. He has not yet brought an indictment.'b'Given the dangers, the media silence is understandable, especially when corruption is so rampant that there is no reason to expect change. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to ask yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said the editor, \xe2\x80\x9cis it worth it?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In Colombia, where for decades journalists have faced threats from cocaine gangs and armed groups on the left and right, reporters sometimes are able to do real journalism by banding together. Mexico tried that \xe2\x80\x94 for a while.'b'In August 2005, the Inter-American Press Association \xe2\x80\x94 a nonprofit group that encourages good journalism in Latin America \xe2\x80\x94 convened a meeting of about 30 border editors and publishers in Hermosillo.'b'They organized a group of journalists from different papers to work together on investigations. Their first story \xe2\x80\x94 on the disappearance of Mr. Jim\xc3\xa9nez Mota \xe2\x80\x94 was published and broadcast on the same day by 70 different outlets across Mexico \xe2\x80\x94 with no reporters\xe2\x80\x99 names attached.'b'But the effort has since foundered without sufficient money and leadership from the large papers in Mexico City and from international groups. Collaboration would also require a level of trust and a culture of investigative reporting very scarce in Mexico. In the north, it grows more rare by the day.'b'A few days ago. Gov.  Arnold Schwarzenegger unveiled an ambitious plan to bring universal health insurance to California. And I\xe2\x80\x99m of two minds about it.'b'On one side, it\xe2\x80\x99s very encouraging to see another Republican governor endorse the principle that all Americans are entitled to essential health care. Not long ago we were wondering whether the Bush administration would succeed in dismantling Social Security. Now we\xe2\x80\x99re discussing proposals for universal health care. What a difference two years makes!'b'And if California  \xe2\x80\x94 America\xe2\x80\x99s biggest state, with a higher-than-average percentage of uninsured residents  \xe2\x80\x94 can achieve universal coverage, so can the nation as a whole.'b'On the other side, Mr. Schwarzenegger\xe2\x80\x99s plan has serious flaws. Maybe those flaws could be fixed once the principle of universal coverage was established  \xe2\x80\x94 but there\xe2\x80\x99s also the chance that we would end up stuck with those flaws, the way we ended up stuck with a dysfunctional system of insurance tied to employment.'b'Furthermore, in the end health care should be a federal responsibility. State-level plans should be seen as pilot projects, not substitutes for a national system. Otherwise, some states just won\xe2\x80\x99t do the right thing. Remember, almost 25 percent of Texans are uninsured.'b'To understand both what\xe2\x80\x99s right and what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with Mr. Schwarzenegger\xe2\x80\x99s plan, let\xe2\x80\x99s compare what he\xe2\x80\x99s proposing with the plan he rejected. Last summer, the California Legislature passed a bill that would have created a single-payer health insurance system for the state  \xe2\x80\x94 that is, a system similar to Medicare, under which residents would have paid fees into a state fund, which would then have provided insurance to everyone.'b'But the governor vetoed that bill, which would have bypassed private insurance companies. He appears to sincerely want universal coverage, but he also wants to keep insurance companies in the loop. As a result, he came up with a plan that, like the failed Clinton health care plan of the early 1990s, is best described as a Rube Goldberg device  \xe2\x80\x94 a complicated, indirect way of achieving what a single-payer system would accomplish simply and directly.'b'There are three main reasons why many Americans lack health insurance. Some healthy people decide to save money and take their chances (and end up being treated in emergency rooms, at the public\xe2\x80\x99s expense, if their luck runs out); some people are too poor to afford coverage; some people can\xe2\x80\x99t get coverage, at least without paying exorbitant rates, because of pre-existing conditions.'b'Single-payer insurance solves all three problems at a stroke. The Schwarzenegger plan, by contrast, is a series of patches. It forces everyone to buy health insurance, whether they think they need it or not; it provides financial aid to low-income families, to help them bear the cost; and it imposes \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity rating\xe2\x80\x9d on insurance companies, basically requiring them to sell insurance to everyone at the same price.'b'As a result, the plan requires a much more intrusive government role than a single-payer system. Instead of reducing paperwork, the plan adds three new bureaucracies: one to police individuals to make sure they buy insurance, one to determine if they\xe2\x80\x99re poor enough to receive aid, and one to police insurers to make sure they don\xe2\x80\x99t discriminate against the unwell.'b'The plan\xe2\x80\x99s supporters say that it would save money all the same. Those who are currently uninsured would receive preventive care, which is often cheaper than waiting until they show up in emergency rooms. Insurers would spend less money trying to weed out high-risk clients and more money actually paying for health care: the plan would require that insurers spend at least 85 percent of premiums on health care, considerably more than most of them do now.'b'Still, why all the complexity? The smart, well-intentioned economists who devised the plan think they\xe2\x80\x99re being more politically realistic than single-payer advocates  \xe2\x80\x94 that it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to placate the insurers. But that\xe2\x80\x99s what Bill and Hillary Clinton thought, too  \xe2\x80\x94 only to find that their plan\xe2\x80\x99s complexity confused the public, while the insurance industry went all-out to defeat it anyway.'b'So am I for or against the Schwarzenegger plan? That\xe2\x80\x99s a tough question. As a practical matter, however, I suspect that the real question is what to do after the plan founders from  its own complexity. And the answer is, damn the insurers  \xe2\x80\x94 full speed ahead.'b'Making his umpteenth pitch to Congress to provide more security money for New York City, Mayor Michael Bloomberg stated the obvious when he said that money to defend against terrorism should be divvied up based on an assessment of risks, not \xe2\x80\x9cspread across the country like peanut butter.\xe2\x80\x9d After all, his testimony to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee echoed one of the key recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. The mayor estimated that more than $3 billion had been distributed in this lunatic way to date.'b'Unfortunately, the committee\xe2\x80\x99s incoming chairman, Senator Joseph Lieberman, is partial to peanut butter. Mr. Lieberman, who won re-election last November as an independent with help from Mr. Bloomberg, continues to believe that every state, regardless of the risks or threats it faces, should be getting antiterrorism money. In negotiations with the House, Mr. Lieberman is seeking a \xe2\x80\x9ccompromise\xe2\x80\x9d formula that preserves guaranteed minimums for relatively low-risk places like his home state of Connecticut. The minimums he wants well exceed the financing favored  by the House, and cannot be justified on the basis of national security.'b'Mr. Lieberman also wants to increase the overall amount of money budgeted for state and local antiterrorism efforts. He is right about that. High-risk jurisdictions like New York have been unfairly burdened by the steep decrease in spending recently. But without a formula adjustment that minimizes the pork barreling that now sends antiterrorism money needed in New York City to places like Nebraska, it would also increase the waste.'b'Mr. Lieberman fought the odds, held his seat and got this chairmanship. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s up to him to use the power responsibly.'b'With great computing power comes great responsibility. Unsecured computers hurt their owners by exposing them to identity theft and stolen passwords. But they can also be conscripted as foot soldiers in a destructive online army: At best, it inconveniences all users by spewing noisome spam. At worst, it generates large-scale attacks on the Web sites of companies and even governments that can shut down networks at enormous cost.'b'These botnet programs represent a growing scourge, especially since so many Internet users won\xe2\x80\x99t take the fairly simple steps needed to combat them. Users need to update their computers regularly, bite the bullet and upgrade when out-of-date software is no longer supported by its maker, use the firewalls that come with their computers, and install antivirus programs. Most states require car owners to buy liability insurance. Asking users to make a minimal effort to keep their computers from damaging others is not beyond the pale.'b'Affected computers are commonly referred to as zombies because they go through active motions unaware that they are even doing anything. First a virus or worm program compromises the computer. Then the criminal behind the attack can control it remotely. As John Markoff reported recently in The Times, a consensus estimate among experts is that 11 percent of the more than 650 million computers connected to the Internet are infected.'b'In the early days of the Internet, there was an optimistic vision of a virtual global village through which everyone around the world would be connected, leading to greater understanding and even peace. In this day of jihadi Web sites, that sounds about as realistic as the world adopting Esperanto as its official language.'b'There was a crucial difference between early adopters and the bulk of the Internet users of today. At the dawn of networked computing, the hobbyists and professionals online expected to have to learn and do a little work. As the Internet became the mainstream, the dedication of technology companies to creating easy plug-and-play products has made the Internet seem as though it requires less understanding and care among users than it does. Every user has a personal responsibility for our collective security, no matter how much of a hassle updates, firewalls and security patches may be.'b'PRESIDENT BUSH has presented a new strategy for the war in Iraq that he feels can reverse the country\xe2\x80\x99s drift toward large-scale civil war. The new plan focuses on stabilizing Baghdad by adding thousands of American troops with newly expanded powers to take on Shiite as well as Sunni rebels. It also includes a limited increase in United States forces in Anbar Province, and calls for Iraqi forces to take formal control of the security mission in November. The president was refreshingly candid, saying that \xe2\x80\x9cwhere mistakes have been made, the responsibility rests with me.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But taken as a whole, the speech raised more questions than it answered. I\xe2\x80\x99ve selected a number of important phrases from the address that beg for more detailed discussion, and included my own analysis of the validity and practicality of what the president seems to have in mind.'b''b''b'Go to Analysis \xc2\xbb'b''b''b'Below, I\xe2\x80\x99ve selected a number of important phrases from the address that beg for more detailed discussion, and included my own analysis of the validity and practicality of what the president seems to have in mind.'b''b'***'b''b''b'Tonight in Iraq, the armed forces of the United States are engaged in a struggle that will determine the direction of the global war on terror and our safety here at home. 'b''b''b'Analysis:'b' Iraq is only one element in the war on terrorism. The resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan and the failure to suppress Al Qaeda globally are probably of equal importance, and the Bush administration seems to have no overall strategy for America\'s "other war" in Afghanistan or the broader war on terrorism.'b''b'***'b''b''b'When I addressed you just over a year ago, nearly 12 million Iraqis had cast their ballots for a unified and democratic nation. The elections of 2005 were a stunning achievement. 'b''b''b'Analysis:'b' The elections were anything but a "stunning achievement." The system used virtually ensured that Iraqis would vote by sect and ethnicity and that the outcome would further divide Sunni Arabs and Shiites, compounding the tensions created by American efforts to make Iraqis draft a new constitution.'b''b'***'b''b''b'Analysis:'b" This statement reinvents history. The level of sectarian violence had built up steadily during 2005. The rise of sectarian and ethnic conflict was a major factor long before President Bush announced his previous strategy at the end of 2005, before the attack on one of the Shiites' holiest sites, the Golden Mosque in Samarra - an event whose importance the administration sharply played down at the time."b''b'***'b''b''b'Analysis:'b' This statement again tries to link Iraq to the broader war on terrorism. In reality, the risks are far greater that Iraqi Shiites and Kurds would end up fighting Sunnis, if not each other. Iranian influence would grow. Sunni nations would intervene on the Sunni side. The primary risk is civil war with broad regional implications, not a Sunni extremist victory.'b''b'***'b''b''b'Analysis:'b' In reality, Iraq has about a dozen major cities, and there are severe problems in many, including Basra, Mosul and Kirkuk. It is far easier to measure the violence in Baghdad because there has been more killing there. But the kind of intimidation and softer forms of ethnic cleansing that are occurring across the country are equally important.'b''b'***'b''b''b'Analysis:'b" This is simply untrue. Other factors - which could also destroy the president's new plan - have been more important. The real reason previous operations did not succeed was that the Baghdad government would not confront the Shiite militias and Iraqi forces were largely ineffective when they did fight. This forced American troops to act alone, and the result was often a substantial local backlash."b''b'***'b''b''b'Analysis:'b' This ignores the fact that reports have repeatedly shown that a significant number of commanders fear the United States will still not get effective support from the Iraqis, and will be perceived as the enemy by one or more sides.'b''b'***'b''b''b'Analysis:'b' While admirably specific for a political speech, this plan seems far too optimistic. Iraqi Army units still have major effectiveness problems. The police still have ties to Shiite militias and death squads, and often are corrupt and poorly trained and equipped.'b''b'***'b''b''b'Analysis:'b" This raises serious political issues since Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki's advisers and the leaders of the powerful Supreme Council of Islamic Revolution in Iraq have gone on record as opposing an increase in American troops. The initiative will almost certainly mean a major confrontation with the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, who can now draw on as many as 60,000 fighters nationwide."b'In reality, the United States forces will not support or "help" Iraqi forces because the latter are too weak and lack motivation. The Bush plan will add up to 17,500 troops to the 15,000 now in the greater Baghdad area, and calls for three Iraqi brigades. But it seems unlikely those Iraqi troops will do much - the Iraqi Army deployed only two of the six battalions it promised for last summer\'s Baghdad offensive. Embedding an American battalion of 400 to 600 men in each of the nine military districts in Baghdad may help, but it is still United States forces that will do almost all of the hard fighting and dying.'b''b'***'b''b''b'In earlier operations, Iraqi and American forces cleared many neighborhoods of terrorists and insurgents, but when our forces moved on to other targets, the killers returned. This time, we will have the force levels we need to hold the areas that have been cleared. . . . Prime Minister Maliki has pledged that political or sectarian interference will not be tolerated. 'b''b''b'Analysis:'b' Mr. Maliki has been quietly put under intense pressure, but may or may not continue to comply. More important, he simply does not have the political power to give a green light to the cleaning of Baghdad. This has to come from the Iraqi people in the neighborhoods involved.'b''b'***'b''b''b"I have made it clear to the prime minister and Iraq's other leaders that America's commitment is not open-ended. If the Iraqi government does not follow through on its promises, it will lose the support of the American people - and it will lose the support of the Iraqi people. "b''b''b'Analysis:'b' The plan creates a strong incentive for the elements hostile to the United States to keep up military pressure, and for sectarian Shiites to push the Maliki government to not cooperate.'b''b'***'b''b''b'Analysis:'b' The very real risks in the president\'s new strategy do not mean it cannot succeed. They simply mean the odds of success are probably somewhat short of even. The president clearly expects much more intense urban fighting, and understands that a more powerful American military effort to "win, hold, build" in Baghdad could significantly increase our casualties. What is not clear is what happens if the Iraqi people turn against American forces or the insurgents simply lie low and outwait the United States in what is fundamentally a long war of attrition.'b''b'***'b''b''b'Analysis:'b' Benchmarks are important, but there is no real schedule here and no clear picture of what the United States will do if the Iraqi government proves unwilling and untrustworthy.'b''b'***'b''b''b'Analysis:'b" These are laudable and ambitious goals, but the practical question is whether the Iraqi government can and will meet them. Assigning Iraqis responsibility for security in Iraq's provinces has so far proved to be a cosmetic gesture. Past pledges on oil revenues, local elections and de-Baathification have not been met. The fact is that Iraqis already planned to spend this much money on reconstruction, and the United States will actually have to finance most new job creation efforts."b''b'***'b''b''b'Analysis:'b' These are potentially positive measures, but the statement disguises the reality that a coalition brigade has far more real combat power than an Iraqi division and would do most of the fighting. It also does not address the fact that at the end of December, the Iraqi Army had trained and equipped 132,000 men, but many had deserted (as have at least a quarter of new police officers), many of the remainder were ineffective, and even effective units were often largely Shiite or Kurdish and had mixed loyalties.'b''b'***'b''b''b'Analysis:'b' The administration has had huge problems recruiting qualified civilians even for the present number of reconstruction teams and in effectively administering every aspect of its aid programs.'b''b'***'b''b''b'Analysis:'b' Washington has been saying for two years that local leaders in Anbar were turning against the Islamist extremists, but there have been little more than token results. It is far from clear that 4,000 more American troops in the province will be enough to make a decisive difference.'b''b'***'b''b''b'Analysis:'b" This seems to reject the option of regional diplomacy and to tie Syria and Iran into a common threat. It's a hard-line position that may be justified, but it will certainly drive the two countries closer to each other."b''b'***'b''b''b'Analysis:'b' Again, good goals. The question is whether major additional aid and support will be forthcoming. And there is no specific mention of any new Arab-Israeli peace initiatives.'b''b'***'b''b''b''b''b'Analysis:'b''b''b' This promises more than history is likely to deliver in Iraq in the near future, and far more than victory in Iraq can deliver to our children and grandchildren.'b''b'***'b''b''b'Analysis:'b' This overstates the risks of withdrawal or "defeat," just as those calling for force cuts and withdrawal understate them.'b''b'To the Editor:'b'The United States and Iran must talk. Not with the mutually negative public rhetoric that for the 27 years since the 1979 hostage crisis has eroded the trust needed for any diplomatic exchange; not indirectly, as we do now on the nuclear issue through our Security Council and European Union colleagues; but frontally and frankly as responsible powers with shared interests in a critically important part of the world.'b'The absence of dialogue has made no sense on any count \xe2\x80\x94 strategic, human, historic, political, cultural.

P. recently informed a personal-finance columnist. He always paid more than the minimum amount due on his credit card bill, but \xe2\x80\x9cstill the balance never goes down,\xe2\x80\x9d T .P. wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there any way to get the interest rate down?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The interest rate that so oppressed T. P.? A towering 29.99 percent. At this rate, the columnist said, if T. P. continued to pay little more than the monthly minimum, it could take him more than 30 years to pay off his balance \xe2\x80\x94 even if he never went shopping again.'b'Trying to fight off a collection agency while paying little or nothing on his credit card debt, another desperate borrower, R. Z., appealed to this same columnist. How could he prevent interest charges and late fees from mounting? He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, replied the columnist, as long as he legally owed the money.'b'Consumers like T. P. and R. Z. find themselves caught in the complexities of today\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy laws. And their predicament is increasingly common.'b'Thirty years ago, the unlucky R. Z. would probably have struck many of his acquaintances as something of a deadbeat: Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t he voluntarily run up a debt and then tried to slip out of the deal? T. P., on the other hand, would have received sympathy as the victim of a heartless usurer (if interest rates equal to one-third of the principal had been legal in those days).'b'But in today\xe2\x80\x99s strange alternative universe of credit card banks, the term \xe2\x80\x9cdeadbeat\xe2\x80\x9d refers not to the improvident borrower but to the solid citizen who prides himself on paying off his balance every month. As anybody with a mailbox knows, credit card issuers make unrelenting efforts to lure accounts from one another as well as to establish new accounts. And what these lenders seek are \xe2\x80\x9crevolvers,\xe2\x80\x9d people like R. Z. and T. P., who are likely to pay little more than the monthly minimum \xe2\x80\x94 and who eventually find themselves in thrall to mushrooming interest payments, abundantly garnished with late fees.'b'As for the morality involved in lending money at exorbitant rates, the word \xe2\x80\x9cusury\xe2\x80\x9d itself has taken on a quaint, archaic sound, like \xe2\x80\x9cjousting\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cnecromancy.\xe2\x80\x9d What happened?'b'In 1978, the United States Supreme Court delivered a landmark decision that freed banks to charge the interest rates allowed in their home states to customers across the country. This decision, at a time of high inflation, unleashed a national credit storm: states scrambled to relax usury laws in order to attract banks, while banks rushed to establish affiliates in states that weakened or abolished such laws. R. Z. and T. P. are the natural products of this unhappy change. One obvious recourse for people like them is to file for bankruptcy. There\xe2\x80\x99s the stigma to consider, of course. But making such a move would allow R. Z. to end the harassment by the collection agency and both men to make fresh starts free of unsecured debts.'b'Unsurprisingly, in the 25 years since the credit explosion began, personal bankruptcy filings have risen sharply. Bank advocates have argued that this reflected debtors\xe2\x80\x99 increasing abuse of the protections granted by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. Personal bankruptcies, said the industry, were costing every household a hidden tax of $400 a year, in the form of rising prices and higher interest rates. It mounted a campaign against what banks called an \xe2\x80\x9cepidemic\xe2\x80\x9d of defaults by debtors.'b'In 2005, these suffering financial institutions succeeded in securing the adoption of new federal legislation, the marvelously named Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act. Nobody who favored this bill chose to see that the bankruptcy epidemic had been produced in large measure by the banks, or that the real hidden costs were the usurious interest rates these banks charged borrowers.'b'Two simple comparisons demonstrate the point: From 1980 to 2004, personal bankruptcy filings increased 443.45 percent, which is certainly impressive. But over the same time, consumer credit debt rose a bit more, by 501.29 percent. In 1980, less than one personal bankruptcy case was filed for each $1 million in consumer credit outstanding; the figure was slightly smaller in 2004.'b'Bankruptcies tend to rise as amounts of credit rise. No mystery there, and certainly no epidemic. It all suggests that the bankruptcy code was performing remarkably well.'b'But the banks got what they wanted from Washington. Since the law has been on the books, people like R. Z. and T. P. have continued to receive all kinds of credit offers (no limits there), but they may have a much harder time now fending off disaster through bankruptcy protection.'b'A group of credit-counseling firms that provide bankruptcy screening \xe2\x80\x94 a step the new law requires \xe2\x80\x94 report that 97 percent of the clients could not repay any debts at all, and 79 percent sought relief for reasons beyond their control, like job loss and large medical expenses and, notably, rising credit card fees and predatory lending practices.'b'A boomerang effect has appeared, too. The new law contains a provision forcing many debtors into Chapter 13 compulsory repayment plans. The bill\xe2\x80\x99s backers expected this fresh squeeze on debtors to produce more cash for the banks, but the trend appears to be downward.'b'In adopting the provision, Congress disregarded the advice of every disinterested group that has looked at the question, including three presidential commissions, the Congressional Budget Office and the Government Accountability Office. It also ignored a past House Judiciary Committee report, which declared that such compulsion might well amount to the imposition of involuntary servitude.'b'So the lending goes on. People classed as the \xe2\x80\x9cworking poor,\xe2\x80\x9d now beginning to be tapped by the credit card vendors, no doubt constitute a rich supply of coveted potential revolvers \xe2\x80\x94 fresh customers for the banks to draw into the credit maze, with its minimums and its unending late fees. In signing the 2005 act, President Bush declared that it would make more credit available to poor people. Unquestionably so. And 30 percent interest was just what they needed, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?'b'LeIpzig, Germany'b'COL. WILLIAM PRESCOTT is said to have prepared his troops for a charge from the British Army at the Battle of Bunker Hill by telling his men, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t one of you fire until you see the whites of their eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If the opposing army had not been British men but rather a horde of charging chimpanzees, the American troops would have been summarily overrun. Why? Because neither chimpanzees nor any of the other 220 species of nonhuman primates have whites of the eyes, at least not that can be easily seen. This means that if their eyes are looking in a direction other than the one in which their heads are pointing, we can easily be fooled about what they are looking at.'b'Why should humans be so different? And yet we are. We can\xe2\x80\x99t fool anyone. The whites of our eyes are several times larger than those of other primates, which makes it much easier to see where the eyes, as opposed to the head, are pointed. Trying to explain this trait leads us into one of the deepest and most controversial topics in the modern study of human evolution: the evolution of cooperation.'b'The idea is simple. Knowing what another person is looking at provides valuable information about what she is thinking and feeling, and what she might do next. Even young children know that when a person is looking at one toy and not another, she most likely prefers that toy and may reach for it. Professional poker players are often so worried about others reading their minds by reading their eyes that they wear sunglasses.'b'Evolutionarily, it is easy to see why it is to your advantage to be able to tell with maximum certainty where I am looking. You may use this information to detect food you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t otherwise have seen, or to detect the dominant male approaching in a fighting mood.'b'But evolution cannot select the color of my eyes based on advantages to you. Evolutionary theory tells us that, in general, the only individuals who are around today are those whose ancestors did things that were beneficial to their own survival and reproduction. If I have eyes whose direction is especially easy to follow, it must be of some advantage to me.'b'If I am, in effect, advertising the direction of my eyes, I must be in a social environment full of others who are not often inclined to take advantage of this to my detriment \xe2\x80\x94 by, say, beating me to the food or escaping aggression before me. Indeed, I must be in a cooperative social environment in which others following the direction of my eyes somehow benefits me.'b'Of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that having large whites of the eyes serves some other purpose, like enabling me to advertise my good health to potential mates. But such an advantage would apply to other primates as well. Cooperation, on the other hand, singles out humans, as humans coordinate activities to do such things as construct buildings, create social institutions and even, paradoxically, organize armies for war.'b'In a recent experiment, our research team has shown that even infants \xe2\x80\x94 at around their first birthdays, before language acquisition has begun \xe2\x80\x94 tend to follow the direction of another person\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, not their heads. Thus, when an adult looked to the ceiling with her eyes only, head remaining straight ahead, infants looked to the ceiling in turn. However, when the adult closed her eyes and pointed her head to the ceiling, infants did not very often follow.'b'Our nearest primate relatives, the African great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos and gorillas) showed precisely the opposite pattern of gaze following. When the human pointed her eyes only to the ceiling (head remaining straight ahead), they followed only rarely. But when she pointed her head only (eyes closed) to the ceiling, they followed much more often.'b'It has been repeatedly demonstrated that all great apes, including humans, follow the gaze direction of others. But in previous studies the head and eyes were always pointed in the same direction. Only when we made the head and eyes point in different directions did we find a species difference: humans are sensitive to the direction of the eyes specifically in a way that our nearest primate relatives are not. This is the first demonstration of an actual behavioral function for humans\xe2\x80\x99 uniquely visible eyes.'b'Why might it have been advantageous for some early humans to advertise their eye direction in a way that enabled others to determine what they were looking at more easily? One possible answer, what we have called the cooperative eye hypothesis, is that especially visible eyes made it easier to coordinate close-range collaborative activities in which discerning where the other was looking and perhaps what she was planning, benefited both participants.'b'If we are gathering berries to share, with one of us pulling down a branch and the other harvesting the fruit, it would be useful \xe2\x80\x94 especially before language evolved \xe2\x80\x94 for us to coordinate our activities and communicate our plans, using our eyes and perhaps other visually based gestures.'b'Infant research, too, suggests that coordinating visual attention may have provided the foundation for the evolution of human language. Babies begin to acquire language through joint activities with others, in which both parties are focused on the same object or task. That\xe2\x80\x99s the best time for an infant to learn the word for the object or activity in question.'b'We are still a long way from figuring out why humans evolved to do so many complicated things together \xe2\x80\x94 from building houses to creating universities to fighting wars. But the simple fact that we have evolved highly visible eyes, to which infants attune even before language, supplies at least one small piece of the puzzle of how.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cThe Incredibles\xe2\x80\x9d (Education Life, Jan. 7):'b'All of the 13 Advanced Placement courses I took at my comprehensive public high school required more work than most of the classes I have experienced in four years at Yale, and there were plenty of primary documents to go around.'b'The difference between high-powered high schools like those mentioned in the article (merely 68 schools supplied over 20 percent of Yale\xe2\x80\x99s 2006 freshman class) and mine, where the college counselor had not heard of the top-ranked liberal arts colleges where I applied, is not academic; it\xe2\x80\x99s social.'b'Many classmates from schools like Andover and Dalton arrive at college fighting to get into the most selective major and singing group and, later, the best law school and investment bank \xe2\x80\x94 realms that preserve the \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take you down\xe2\x80\x9d moral certitude they learned in high school.

This is the failed war on drugs.'b'It was Nixon who, in 1971, first declared war on drugs. As with Iraq, the strategy is flawed in its conception and execution, made worse by a refusal to change course in the face of failure. It strongly emphasizes eradicating the source of drugs, interdiction of traffic and draconian punishment for offenders. It neglects what nearly every expert believes \xe2\x80\x94 and European experience has shown \xe2\x80\x94 to be the only successful strategy: a demand-side emphasis on preventive programs and rehabilitation of addicts. The present administration\xe2\x80\x99s claims of a shift to preventive measures is belied by the budget of its drug control office, which allocates a 94 percent share to disrupting the supply, mainly through environmentally hazardous spraying in Latin America and the Caribbean that alienates local farmers.'b'The domestic results are tragic: an enormous increase in the incarceration of young, disproportionately minority Americans, resulting in the waste of human resources and the creation of a prison culture that converts nonviolent addicts into hardened criminals, without any impact on drug use. Within a year of release, 43.5 percent of drug offenders are rearrested. Recent surveys indicate a steady increase in the use of illicit drugs: more than 40 percent of Americans over 12 have used them at some point. Nearly all Caribbean societies are involved with narcotrafficking and, in the case of Jamaica, large-scale production and export of marijuana. In 2001, illicit drug shipments in the region were worth more money than the top five legitimate exports combined. The results have been devastating. Political corruption and payment in arms threatens the sovereignty and stability of many states. In 1985, the chief minister and minister of commerce of the Turks and Caicos Islands were arrested in Miami and imprisoned in America for drug offenses.'b'Drug addiction and violent crime are now endemic in Jamaica, Puerto Rico and even small islands like St. Kitts. The corruption of the police and other security forces has reached a crisis point in Jamaica, where an officer can earn the equivalent of half a year\xe2\x80\x99s salary by simply looking the other way. Last year, 1,300 people were murdered here, in a population of only three million \xe2\x80\x94 and that was an improvement on the previous year.'b'Dr. Peter Phillips, Jamaica\xe2\x80\x99s very competent minister of national security, estimates that 60 percent of the murders are drug related. Calling cocaine trafficking and use the \xe2\x80\x9ctaproot\xe2\x80\x9d of a \xe2\x80\x9cweb of criminality,\xe2\x80\x9d he said drugs sustain a \xe2\x80\x9cself-perpetuating culture of extreme violence\xe2\x80\x9d extending to many areas of the society.'b'The drug culture is highly transnational and organized, exemplified by the Jamaican \xe2\x80\x9cposses\xe2\x80\x9d that terrorized America in the 1980s with some 4,900 murders. Traffickers increasingly operate offshore, taking advantage of better arms, faster boats and more efficient tracking equipment than those available to local security forces.'b'Phillips is puzzled by America\xe2\x80\x99s inflexible emphasis on eradication and interdiction and its refusal to provide help where it is most needed, like the rebuilding of corrupted police forces. He provided a telling example of the futility of current approaches. With Americans and Jamaicans working closely together recently, the percentage of transshipments of Colombian cocaine to the U.S. that went through Jamaica was reduced from 20 to 2. But this had no effect on the amount of cocaine entering America \xe2\x80\x94 the traffickers simply changed routes \xe2\x80\x94 and it increased violent crime in Jamaica. Drug dons became more murderous in turf wars, as there was less cocaine and money to go around.'b'America\xe2\x80\x99s unwillingness to recognize the socioeconomic context of the drug crisis at home and abroad, to see that being surrounded by failing states threatens its security, to provide aid where it is most effective, and to acknowledge that the root cause of this hemispheric disaster is not supply but its own citizens\xe2\x80\x99 insatiable demand for illicit drugs, is as incomprehensible as the quagmire in Iraq.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2'b'A Ford White House aide mentioned in last Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s column should have been Robert Goldwin, not Goldman.'b'To the Editor:'b'Robert Hicks made some excellent points in \xe2\x80\x9cAn Election With No Losers\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Jan. 7).

That gave the sport a brief jolt in this country but one that quickly faded, followed by the failure of that era\xe2\x80\x99s professional league.'b'The news of Mr. Beckham\xe2\x80\x99s move \xe2\x80\x94 and that of his paparazzi-magnet wife, the former Posh Spice \xe2\x80\x94 overshadowed this week\xe2\x80\x99s announcement that Clint Dempsey would be leaving.'b'Who is Clint Dempsey?'b'He is a 23-year-old firebrand midfielder who scored the only goal by an American in last year\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup (the Italians scored one on themselves for us) and briefly raised hopes that the United States could advance to the second round. He was the 2006 player of the year for the United States national team, but that hardly makes him a household name.'b'Naturally, Mr. Dempsey is on his way to Europe \xe2\x80\x94 the English Premier League team Fulham \xe2\x80\x94 where arguably the best professional soccer is played. While Mr. Dempsey has a bright future, Mr. Beckham, at 31, may have his best days behind him. Don\xe2\x80\x99t get us wrong, he is still good. But he decided to cross the Atlantic only after losing a step, and his position as captain of the English national team.'b'Beyond the money and the glamour, Mr. Beckham\xe2\x80\x99s story appeals to us because it matches a notion we Americans cherish about ourselves: We are a destination. The best want to come here, play here  and live here. We aren\xe2\x80\x99t accustomed to sending our children abroad to seek their fortunes the way other countries have, be they Ireland or Mexico.'b'Mr. Beckham has made a sizable splash, but the future of the sport in America probably rests on the Latino immigrants who arrive with a love of the game and pass it on to their children. Until then our homegrown talents will blossom abroad. We are still the most powerful nation in the world and the largest economy, but we aren\xe2\x80\x99t the only game in town.'b'Bangladesh is lurching in a dangerous direction. After weeks of violent protests that left at least 40 people dead, the government has declared martial law. Only strong pressure from the United States and international help will keep this huge country from slipping further off a democratic path.'b'For weeks, a broad coalition of parties has protested what it charges is a clear attempt by the government to rig parliamentary elections, originally scheduled for later this month. It  claimed that the voter rolls were padded; the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, an American monitoring group working in Bangladesh, surveyed the voter lists and found 13 million fake names. The coalition also charged that President Iajuddin Ahmed, who had the job of overseeing the elections,  was  biased in favor of a rival party.'b'The United Nations agreed that the run-up to the elections had been so flawed that the results could not be \xe2\x80\x9cconsidered credible or legitimate.\xe2\x80\x9d International election monitors pulled out of Bangladesh, saying the existing conditions did not allow for a meaningful vote.'b'On Thursday, Mr. Ahmed yielded to international pressure, resigning as the election caretaker  and postponing the vote. Mr. Ahmed, who will stay on as president, a largely ceremonial position, said a clean voter roll was needed for \xe2\x80\x9cfree, fair and credible\xe2\x80\x9d elections.'b'Unfortunately, at the same time he declared a state of emergency, which revokes many basic rights and allows the army to enforce order. This is a particularly disturbing development in a country that has been subjected to long periods of military rule since gaining its independence in 1971.'b'The United States should use its substantial political influence to urge the government to restore suspended rights immediately. The United Nations should quickly send an envoy to mediate among Bangladesh\xe2\x80\x99s parties to ensure that this time the elections move forward in a clean and transparent manner. Both the U.N. and the Bush administration should encourage the protest\xe2\x80\x99s leaders to avoid further violence, assuring them that their demands are being heard. And they should redeploy their monitors once a new election date is set.'b'Bangladesh is one of the poorest and most politically polarized countries in the world.

But the executive branch has refused to enforce it, illegitimately depriving retailers and taxpayers of revenues as high as $576 million a year.'b'That is why I filed a lawsuit last spring against these Indian retailers, including those from the Unkechaug Poospatuck Tribe and the Shinnecock Indian Nation, both in Suffolk County. Cigarette taxes help state and local governments meet their obligations to their citizens. Every non-taxed sale of a carton of cigarettes means that there is less money for new schools, hospitals and roads. As a result, our overall tax burden is increased.'b'These levies were imposed for another important public purpose. Anti-tobacco groups have long argued that a higher cigarette tax helps discourage smoking by teenagers. The city\xe2\x80\x99s health commissioner puts it this way: \xe2\x80\x9cIncreasing tobacco taxes is the single most effective way to reduce tobacco consumption, particularly for kids.\xe2\x80\x9d That disincentive disappears when tax-free cigarettes are readily available at Indian smoke shops or on the Internet.'b'Finally, the government\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement failure erodes public respect for the rule of law itself. The concept of equal protection, which obliges everyone to obey the law, is a great feature of American democracy. When the New York tax commissioner named the fear of Indian violence as reason to hesitate to enforce the cigarette tax equally, he set a deplorable precedent. There should be no \xe2\x80\x9crioter\xe2\x80\x99s veto\xe2\x80\x9d that stops law enforcement.'b'Indian retailers claim that the state\xe2\x80\x99s effort to tax their cigarette sales is \xe2\x80\x9clike New York taxing New Jersey.\xe2\x80\x9d Nothing could be further from the truth. The Supreme Court put such arguments to rest in 1994 when it ruled that Indian sovereignty did not govern sales of any product to non-Indians.'b'Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t everyone who benefits from doing business with New Yorkers share, on equal footing, the responsibility of keeping our communities strong and our children healthy?'b'Gov. Eliot Spitzer has made it clear in his public statements that he believes it is right and necessary for New York to collect these taxes. New Yorkers should support him in that endeavor.

You also claim that \xe2\x80\x9cmany charter schools do a superb job.\xe2\x80\x9d Where is the evidence?'b'In most of Connecticut\xe2\x80\x99s charter schools, the percentage of students meeting targets on the Connecticut Mastery Test and Connecticut Academic Performance Test is below the state average \xe2\x80\x94 sometimes well below. This evidence is consistent with the conclusions of studies conducted across this country \xe2\x80\x94 that students in charter schools do no better than those in traditional public schools, on state tests and on the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The one, admittedly limited, study finding promise in Connecticut\xe2\x80\x99s charter schools attributes a large part of this success precisely to the state\xe2\x80\x99s strict limits on expansion that you decry.'b'Where charter schools succeed in Connecticut, there is no evidence that \xe2\x80\x9ceducational innovation\xe2\x80\x9d is at play, as you claim, rather than longer school hours, smaller schools and smaller class sizes than those in traditional public schools. These conditions have been long known to educators and parents to raise student achievement. They should be made available to all of our public school children, not just the select few who attend charter schools.'b'Wendy Lecker 'b'Stamford'b''b'The writer is a consultant on public education finance.'b''b''b''b'Revamping a sprawling state court system beset by chronic organizational and patronage problems, and badly in need of structural reform, is one of the most urgent tasks facing New York\xe2\x80\x99s new governor, Eliot Spitzer.'b'The urgency of this task is attributable in no small measure to indifference by Mr. Spitzer\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor, George Pataki. Although he periodically gave lip service to making improvements in the courts, occasionally following through, Mr. Pataki generally shied from expending the necessary energy or political capital to persuade the State Legislature to go along. To the extent Mr. Pataki led in this sphere, it was mostly by bad example. His misuse of the governor\xe2\x80\x99s judicial appointment power to play politics \xe2\x80\x94 even to the extent of packing Manhattan\xe2\x80\x99s appellate court with upstate Republicans \xe2\x80\x94 has left a legacy of mediocrity and cronyism.'b'Mr. Spitzer has already announced his support for two fundamental reforms: a major court restructuring to simplify the state\xe2\x80\x99s wacky organizational chart of nine separate trial courts, and a switch from clubhouse-dominated elections for the State Supreme Court, the state\xe2\x80\x99s highest trial court, to a new system of merit appointments. Here is a brief look at these and two other court reform matters needing priority attention:'b''b''b'Court Restructuring.'b''b' Mr. Spitzer has embraced Chief Judge Judith Kaye\xe2\x80\x99s sensible proposal to merge the court system\xe2\x80\x99s archaic maze of trial courts into a modern, two-tiered system that permits efficient deployment of resources and personnel. Its enactment will require a sustained effort. As in the past, attempts may be made to preserve patronage by exempting Surrogate\xe2\x80\x99s Court from the reorganization. Moreover, the overhaul will require amending the state Constitution, meaning approval must be given by two separate Legislatures \xe2\x80\x94 the present one and the one to be chosen in November 2008 \xe2\x80\x94 before the measure goes to voters.'b''b''b'Merit Selection. 'b''b'The system of sham elections that allowed party leaders to award State Supreme Court seats to their handpicked favorites at tightly controlled nominating conventions was declared unconstitutional last year. Unless the Legislature devises a new system, the discredited conventions will be replaced by primaries that could open judicial campaigns and decision-making to special interest contributions without breaking the courthouse-clubhouse link at the heart of recent judicial scandals.'b'A special commission appointed by Judge Kaye suggested tweaking the convention system in ways that would make it feasible for political outsiders to compete at the conventions and gain a berth on the ballot, mandate review of candidates\xe2\x80\x99 credentials by independent screening panels, and forbid sitting judges from hearing cases involving people who donated above a certain amount to their campaigns. But the wise, permanent fix is the one Mr. Spitzer advocates: Amending the state Constitution to provide a new merit selection system.'b''b''b'Judicial Pay.'b''b' The last time New York\xe2\x80\x99s judges got a salary increase was eight years ago. As a matter of fairness, and to avoid harming the recruitment and retention of quality judges, Mr. Spitzer needs to press the Legislature to approve catch-up raises. He should also get behind Judge Kaye\xe2\x80\x99s proposal for changing the manner of setting judicial compensation. The present system holds judicial salaries hostage to the legislators\xe2\x80\x99 own pay raises.'b''b''b'Town and Village Courts.'b''b' Responding to press accounts of abusive practices by \xe2\x80\x9cjustice courts\xe2\x80\x9d doing business in rural areas around the state, Albany and Judge Kaye have been exploring remedies. Any new package should mandate more training for these justices, require that all be lawyers, and enhance indigent defense services. Mr. Spitzer\xe2\x80\x99s persuasive powers will be greatly needed here, since these changes will affect upstate communities represented by Republican members of the Senate.'b'PRESIDENT BUSH always had one asset he could fall back on: the self-confidence of a born salesman. Like Harold Hill in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Music Man,\xe2\x80\x9d he knew how to roll out a new product, however deceptive or useless, with conviction and stagecraft. What the world saw on 'b'Wednesday night'b'  was a defeated Willy Loman who looked as broken as his war. His flop sweat was palpable even if you turned down the sound to deflect despair-inducing phrases like \xe2\x80\x9cPrime Minister Maliki has pledged ...\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSecretary Rice will leave for the region. ...\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Bush seemed to know his product was snake oil, and his White House handlers did too. In the past, they made a fetish of situating their star in telegenic settings, from 'b'aircraft carriers'b' to 'b'Ellis Island'b'. Or they placed him against 'b'Orwellian backdrops shrieking \xe2\x80\x9cPlan for Victory."'b' But this time even the audio stuttered, as if in solidarity with Baghdad\xe2\x80\x99s continuing 'b'electricity blackout'b', and the Oval Office was ditched, lest it summon up memories of all those past presidential sightings of light at the end of the Iraqi tunnel. Mr. Bush was banished to the White House library, where the backdrop was acres of books, to signify the studiousness of his rethinking of the \xe2\x80\x9cway forward.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'"I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be rushed,"'b' the president said a month ago when talking about his many policy consultations. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t kidding. His ostentatious deep thinking started after Election Day, once he realized that firing Donald Rumsfeld wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be enough to co-opt the Iraq Study Group. He was thinking so hard that he abandoned his initial plan  'b'to announce a strategy before Christmas'b' .'b'The war, however, refused to take a timeout for the holiday festivities in Crawford. The 'b'American death toll in Iraq'b', which hovered around 2,840 on Election Day, was nearing 3,020 by Wednesday night.'b'And these additional lives were sacrificed to what end? All the reviews and thinking and postponing produced a policy that, as a former top Bush aide summed it up for The Daily News, is nothing more than "'b'repackaged stay-the-course dressed up to make it look more palatable'b'." The repackaging was half-hearted as well. Not for nothing did the  \xe2\x80\x9cway forward,\xe2\x80\x9d a rubric the president used at least 27 times in December, end up on the cutting-room floor. The tossing of new American troops into Baghdad, a ploy that backfired in Operation Together Forward last year, is too transparently the way backward.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cVictory\xe2\x80\x9d also received short shrift, downsized by the president to the paltry goal of getting \xe2\x80\x9ccloser to success.\xe2\x80\x9d The \xe2\x80\x9cbenchmarks\xe2\x80\x9d he cited were so vague that they\xe2\x80\x99d be a disgrace to No Child Left Behind.  And no wonder: in November, Mr. Bush couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even get our devoted ally, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, 'b'to show up for dinner at their summit'b'  in Amman, let alone induce him to root out Shiite militias. The most muscle the former Mr. Bring-\xe2\x80\x99Em-On could muster in Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s speech was this: \xe2\x80\x9cIf the Iraqi government does not follow through on its promises, it will lose the support of the American people.\xe2\x80\x9d Since that support vanished long ago, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine an emptier threat or a more naked confession of American impotence, all the more pathetic in a speech rattling sabers against Syria and Iran.'b'Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s own support from the American people is not coming back. His \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d Iraq policy is also in defiance of 'b'Iraqi public opinion'b' , the 'b'Joint Chiefs'b', the Baker-Hamilton grandees, and Mr. Maliki, who six weeks ago asked for a 'b'lower American profile in Iraq'b'. Which leaves you wondering exactly who is still in the bunker with the president besides the first lady and Barney.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a very short list led by John McCain, Joe Lieberman, and neo-conservative dead-enders like William Kristol and Frederick Kagan, who congregate at The Weekly Standard and the American Enterprise Institute, the Washington think tank. The one notable new recruit is Rudy Giuliani, who likened taming Baghdad to 'b'\xe2\x80\x9creducing crime in New York\xe2\x80\x9d'b'  without noticing that even after the escalation there will be fewer American troops patrolling Baghdad than 'b'uniformed police officers'b' in insurgency-free New York City.'b'Mr. Kagan, a military historian, was sent by the White House to 'b'sell its policy'b'  to Senate Republicans. It was he, Mr. Kristol and the retired Gen. Jack Keane who have most prominently pushed for this escalation and who published studies and editorials credited with defining it. Given that these unelected hawks are some of the same great thinkers who promoted the Iraq fiasco in the first place, it is hard to imagine why this White House continues to listen to them. Or maybe not that hard. In a typical op-ed article,  headlined \xe2\x80\x9cStay the Course, Mr. President!,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kagan wrote in The Los Angeles Times in 2005: "'b'Despite what you may have read, the military situation in Iraq today is positive'b'."'b'Yet Mr. Bush doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even have the courage of his own disastrous convictions: he\xe2\x80\x99s not properly executing the policy these guys sold him. In The Washington Post on Dec. 27, Mr. Kagan and General Keane wrote that escalation could only succeed 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cwith a surge of at least 30,000 combat troops\xe2\x80\x9d'b' \xe2\x80\x94 a figure that has also been cited by Mr. McCain. (Mr. Kagan put the figure at 'b'50,000 to 80,000'b' in a Weekly Standard article three weeks earlier. Whatever.) By any of these neocons\xe2\x80\x99 standards, the Bush escalation of some 20,000  is too little, not to mention way too late.'b'The discrepancy between the policy that Mr. Bush nominally endorses and the one he actually ordered up crystallizes the cynicism of this entire war. If you really believe, as the president continues to put it, that Iraq is the central front in \xe2\x80\x9cthe decisive ideological struggle of our time,\xe2\x80\x9d then you should be in favor of having many more troops than we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had in Iraq. As T. X. Hammes, an insurgency expert and a former marine, 'b'told USA Today'b', that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t now mean a \xe2\x80\x9cdribble\xe2\x80\x9d (as he ridicules the \xe2\x80\x9csurge\xe2\x80\x9d) but a total of 300,000 armed coalition forces over a minimum of four years.'b'But that would mean asking Americans for sacrifice, not giving us tax cuts. Mr. Bush has never asked for sacrifice and still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. If his words sound like bargain-basement Churchill, his actions have been cheaper still. The president\xe2\x80\x99s resolutely undermanned war plan indicated from Day 1  that he knew in his heart of hearts that Iraq was not the central front in the war against 9/11 jihadism he had claimed it to be, only the reckless detour that it actually was. Yet the war\xe2\x80\x99s cheerleaders, neocon and otherwise, disingenuously blamed our low troop strength almost exclusively on Mr. Rumsfeld.'b'Now that the defense secretary is gone, what are they to do? For whatever reason, you did not hear Mr. Kagan, General Keane or Mr. McCain speak out against Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s plan even though it\xe2\x80\x99s insufficient by their own reckoning \xe2\x80\x94 just a repackaged continuance of the same \xe2\x80\x9cWhac-A-Mole\xe2\x80\x9d half-measures that Mr. McCain has long deplored. Surely the senator knows that, as his loosey-goosey endorsement attests. (On Friday, he called the Bush plan \xe2\x80\x9cthe best chance of success\xe2\x80\x9d while simultaneously going on record that 'b'\xe2\x80\x9ca small, short surge would be the worst of all worlds.\xe2\x80\x9d'b')'b'The question now is how to minimize the damage before countless more Americans and Iraqis are slaughtered to serve the president\xe2\x80\x99s endgame of passing his defeat on to the next president. The Democrats can have all the hearings they want, but they are unlikely to take draconian action (cutting off funding) that would make them, rather than Mr. Bush, politically vulnerable to blame for losing Iraq.'b'I have long felt that it will be up to Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s own party to ring down the curtain on his failed policy, and after the 2006 midterms, that is more true than ever. The lame-duck president, having lost both houses of Congress and at least one war (Afghanistan awaits), has nothing left to lose. That is far from true of his party.'b'Even conservatives like 'b'Sam Brownback'b' of Kansas  and 'b'Norm Coleman'b'  of Minnesota started backing away from Iraq last week. Mr. Brownback is running for president in 2008, and Mr. Coleman faces a tough re-election fight. But Republicans not in direct electoral jeopardy ('b'George Voinovich'b'  of Ohio, 'b'Lisa Murkowski'b'  of Alaska) are also starting to waver. It\xe2\x80\x99s another Vietnam-Watergate era flashback. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Democrats or the press that forced Richard Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s abdication in 1974; it was dwindling Republican support. Though he had vowed to fight his way through a Senate trial, Nixon folded once he lost the patriarchal leader of his party\xe2\x80\x99s right wing.'b'That leader was 'b'Barry Goldwater'b' , who had been one of Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s most loyal and aggressive defenders until he finally realized he\xe2\x80\x99d been lied to once too often. If John McCain won\xe2\x80\x99t play the role his Arizona predecessor once did, we must hope that John Warner or some patriot like him will, for the good of the country, answer the call of conscience. A dangerous president must be saved from himself, so that the American kids he\xe2\x80\x99s about to hurl into the hell of Baghdad can be saved along with him.'b'A battle between Yonkers and its neighbors over Ridge Hill Village, the $600 million residential, retail and commercial project the city wants to build near its border with the Town of Greenburgh, has gone quiet.'b'All sides have now settled a lawsuit that accused Yonkers of conducting an inadequate environmental review in its rush to greenlight the project, which will include 1,000 homes, 1.3 million square feet of retail space and who knows how many cars barrelling \xe2\x80\x94 or crawling, as the case may be \xe2\x80\x94 along the roads in and around it, including the Sprain Brook Parkway, the New York State Thruway and Tuckahoe Road.'b'As settlements go, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t offer much for Yonkers\xe2\x80\x99s adversaries. Greenburgh, Hastings-on-Hudson, Ardsley and some residents of Yonkers itself had complained that traffic from Ridge Hill would engulf their streets. They wanted the city and the developer, Forest City Ratner (which is also building The Times\xe2\x80\x99s new headquarters in Manhattan), to scale back.'b'But that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen. About all the settlement calls for is $5 million to mitigate traffic at certain intersections, and the creation of a task force to jointly lobby Westchester County and New York State to ease the traffic problem once and for all by creating a direct link to Ridge Hill from the Sprain Parkway.'b'Many people can support this solution   in theory, but the obstacles to building it are significant. This is partly because the multimillion-dollar system of ramps and exits envisioned by the Yonkers City Council President, Chuck Lesnick, would have to cross a Westchester County park, and the county says it will sacrifice precious parkland to Ridge Hill at about the time hell freezes over.'b'In addition, the county    has already raised serious questions about the scale and design of the so-called village, which it considers a closer cousin of a megamall. It insists further that offering a parkland boon to a private developer would set a catastrophic precedent with other builders and at other parks. The task force can lobby all it wants, the county says, but the Sprain Parkway ramps are roads to nowhere.'b'We love the idea of a regional task force \xe2\x80\x94 of neighbors joining neighbors, crossing borders and putting heads together to solve development challenges that would otherwise lead to the usual endless and tiresome Westchester border wars.'b'But in the case of Ridge Hill, where so many problems could have been solved early on, with the City of Yonkers simply listening to its neighbors and working with Forest City Ratner to create a project on a more manageable scale, the great d\xc3\xa9tente appears to have come too late.'b'Newark'b'A RECENT report by the New Jersey Death Penalty Study Commission has recommended that the state abolish the death penalty and replace it with a life sentence in a maximum security prison, with no possibility of parole. Although I might not agree with all of the commission\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning \xe2\x80\x94 I don\xe2\x80\x99t, for example, interpret public sentiments as leaning against capital punishment to the extent that the commission does \xe2\x80\x94 I concur in its recommendation.'b'That was not always my view. As state attorney general, I supported the death penalty and worked to enforce it. Later, as a member of the New Jersey Supreme Court, I voted to affirm and overturn death sentences when legal standards required either result.'b'But from a policy perspective, I now believe that the current capital punishment system, which has spawned elaborate litigation that includes several layers of appeal, is ineffective.'b'Because death is an irreversible penalty, the state Supreme Court has construed the judicial role in capital cases as requiring heightened and exact scrutiny. The legal process has grown into a complex, lengthy undertaking that consumes enormous energy and resources.'b'For instance, each death penalty case typically entails not one but several hearings before lower and appellate courts. And it\xe2\x80\x99s not only state courts; federal courts also evaluate the cases. Given that trial judges, jurors, prosecutors and defense lawyers are, like everyone else, prone to error, some have wondered whether any capital case ultimately can survive such unstinting review.'b'But the judiciary has not been alone in its caution. Two of the last six elected governors \xe2\x80\x94 Brendan Byrne, who is also a former prosecutor and judge, and Jon Corzine, the current governor \xe2\x80\x94 have opposed the death penalty. Moreover, while the death penalty study commission was conducting its review, the Legislature imposed a moratorium on capital punishment apparently because of policy concerns, including the possibility of mistakes. Although the chance of executing an innocent person under our judicial process is minuscule, the role of DNA in overturning convictions has increased doubts.'b'The result is that New Jersey has not carried out any executions since it reinstated capital punishment in 1982. The last execution here was in 1963. And no death sentence is likely to be carried out in the near future.'b'Other states, like New York, are in a similar position. New York\xe2\x80\x99s highest court found a constitutional defect in the state\xe2\x80\x99s death penalty system in 2004, and legislators in Albany have so far not corrected it.'b'Why not fix the flaws that have prevented the use of capital punishment rather than eliminate it altogether? Here\xe2\x80\x99s the problem. Narrowing the scope of the death penalty statute or tightening its provisions, as some have proposed, would invite a fresh wave of litigation and open new avenues for legal challenge. In a decent society where death should be imposed only after careful judicial examination, those appeals would continue for years. Even renewed attempts at limiting the review process itself would spur additional lawsuits.'b'For instance, when New Jersey lawmakers sought in 1992 to curb the manner in which the judiciary conducts reviews to ensure that juries do not apply death sentences arbitrarily, the state Supreme Court eventually decided that it should not be so restricted.'b'If similar reforms were tried once more, it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that another two decades would pass with no executions, and we would be having the same debate as we are today. Indeed, since 1985, the Legislature has amended the death penalty statute 15 times. Tellingly, rather than expedite the process, some of those amendments have echoed judicial or constitutional concerns by strengthening legal safeguards, underscoring how all three branches have proceeded carefully in this field.'b'Instead of revising the system yet again, we should accept the conclusion that New Jersey simply lacks the collective will to carry out capital punishment. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s fear of an erroneous execution, as DNA evidence has shown is possible in other states, or a combination of other factors, the elected branches appear ready to alter course. In that context, substituting a sentence of life without parole for the death penalty makes sense. In the absence of executions, such sentences essentially already exist.'b'I cannot fathom the pain felt by the families of murder victims. I can only assume that their grief and sense of loss are perpetual. Understandably for some, a feeling of justice will result only from the execution of the persons responsible for such unspeakable crimes.'b'Still, as a practical matter, New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s death penalty exists merely on paper. Despite the law on the books, this state has never really embraced capital punishment. We should acknowledge that reality and replace the death penalty with a punishment that is real.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s any librarian\xe2\x80\x99s nightmare. Boisterous middle school youngsters just out of school barge through the library door and do what some kids have been doing since time immemorial: talk loudly, push each other back and forth and make a general nuisance of themselves for many of the other patrons trying to read, study or use the computers.'b'In Maplewood, a middle class suburb just 10 miles west of Newark, library officials said \xe2\x80\x9cenough\xe2\x80\x9d a few weeks ago and announced they would close both of the town\xe2\x80\x99s libraries each weekday starting Tuesday from 2:45 until 5 p.m. By that time, they hoped, the obstreperous kids would be home or at least somewhere far from the libraries.'b'One can certainly understand the librarians\xe2\x80\x99 frustrations; after all, they are trained to assist patrons in locating library material and doing research, not to be disciplinarians. But the idea of closing a library during prime hours was an inappropriately heavy-handed way to react to a problem that many libraries across the country have been dealing with for generations.'b'Not surprisingly, the announcement dismayed a great many people, and the township\xe2\x80\x99s governing committee asked the library board to reconsider its decision. Both library and township officials met last week in an effort to avoid the closing, and the library board is scheduled to meet today to rethink the closings.'b'That would be a positive first step, and would give the township committee time to explore suggestions that the town create a permanent facility where youngsters could go after school lets out. Many activists in town say teenagers with working parents simply have no suitable place to congregate during the late afternoon.'b'In the meantime, there are things the library can do on its own to accommodate the students. Leslie Burger, the director of the Princeton, N.J. library and the president of the American Library Association, points out that youngsters started frequenting her library\xe2\x80\x99s new facility shortly after it opened a couple of years ago. She then hired three retired persons with skills in handling young people to work part-time with the youngsters in a positive rather than just a disciplinary way.'b'Obviously, such a program would require modest funding, and that\xe2\x80\x99s where Maplewood\xe2\x80\x99s township committee should provide some help.'b'At a time when student reading scores are declining and young people are spending more and more time tethered to all manner of electronic screens \xe2\x80\x94 everything from text-messaging cell phones to video iPods to computers and, yes, TV\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 librarians have a responsibility to do almost anything to welcome students to their facilities. By resolving their current difficulties and keeping their libraries open during weekday afternoons, Maplewood officials have an opportunity to set an example for public libraries across the country.'b'The only way New Jersey can stabilize its highest-in-the-nation property taxes over the long run is for the Democratic-controlled Legislature to approve major spending cuts that many of the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 political allies do not like. That was the unstated premise of Gov. Jon Corzine\xe2\x80\x99s State of the State Message last week in which he made it clear said that he saw no alternative to making cuts that would inevitably outrage powerful groups.'b'For instance, Mr. Corzine said he would not approve a property tax credit \xe2\x80\x94 something the Democratic\xe2\x80\x93controlled Legislature wants \xe2\x80\x94 unless the Legislature also imposed a cap of about 4 percent on future property tax increases. Teachers and public employees, who generally support Democrats, oppose such an ironclad ceiling and so do many local officials and school administrators.'b'Mr. Corzine also said his administration would have to cut pension and health benefits for all public employees, including teachers. The powerful public employee and teacher unions can be expected to oppose such cuts. He raised the possibility of selling off major state assets, including the New Jersey Turnpike, in an effort to pay down the state\xe2\x80\x99s huge debt, even though many good government forces take a dim view of such a sale.'b'And he called for creation of a state comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s office to audit state spending, for a new formula for apportioning school aid, and for voluntary consolidation of school districts and municipalities. These proposals, too, will face formidable opposition from groups that normally back Democrats.'b'Because of high public expectations, most Democratic legislators believe they have no alternative but to pass property tax reform. But that will also mean standing up to their own supporters.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s Millstone'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 7):'b'You are correct in suggesting that middle-income New Jersey homeowners use an inordinate amount of their income to pay their property taxes.'b'This is particularly onerous for many retirees who frequently pay some 20 percent of their pension and Social Security income for property taxes, yet on the block where they live, a wealthier person with the same property assessment may pay only 5 percent of his income for property taxes.'b'Property taxes are regressive in that payments reflect property values rather than income, thus favoring the wealthy over the middle class and poor.'b'Reform will not occur through plans to reduce benefits for state employees because the prospect of labor unrest and political retribution in an election year will surely deter legislators from provoking a significant part of the electorate.'b'The fair and appropriate way to achieve property tax reform is to require those with the highest incomes to pay a higher state income tax and use that money to substantially finance education while reducing property taxes.'b'Jack Isaacs'b'Hackensack'b''b''b'Historic Events in Jewstown'b''b'To the Editor:'b'An interesting footnote to the racial and religious diversity described in \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Reclaiming the Revolution'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Dec. 24) concerns the Colonel Tye mentioned in the article and the tiny community of Jewstown (the site of present-day Colts Neck).'b'Jewstown enjoyed a brief notoriety around the time of the Battle of Monmouth (1778), appearing on several Revolutionary War maps and referred to in Gen. Henry Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s memoir of the Monmouth campaign.'b'Hart\xe2\x80\x99s Tavern, located in the center of Jewstown, was established by Levy Hart, a naturalized Jewish merchant who married Catherine Applegate, a local Protestant. Three years after Hart\xe2\x80\x99s death in 1775, Catherine married Joshua Huddy, who subsequently moved into the Hart home. Captain Huddy of the New Jersey Militia was Monmouth County\xe2\x80\x99s most famous patriot, and it was while leading an attack in 1780 upon the Hart-Huddy house (hoping to kill or capture Huddy) that Tye sustained the wound that led to his death.'b'Jean Klerman 'b'Fair Haven 'b''b'The writer is co-president, Jewish Heritage Museum of Monmouth County.'b''b''b''b'MY mother never explained to me how she met that short, thin man with the pockmarked neck, why she decided to let him move in with us or what made her leave me with him that day when she went to work. I guess she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any other choice. But when she got home and found that her 6-year-old son had been beaten, thrown against the wall, slashed on his back repeatedly with an electrical cord \xe2\x80\x94 all because I had changed the television channel \xe2\x80\x94 she knew enough to throw that man out.'b'Sadly, Quachaun Browne wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as lucky. One year ago this month, prosecutors say, 4-year-old Quachaun  was beaten to death by his mother\xe2\x80\x99s companion. As in the case of 7-year-old Nixzmary Brown, whose mother and stepfather are about to go on trial in her death, workers at the city\xe2\x80\x99s Administration for Children\xe2\x80\x99s Services were investigating the family but they were unable to save the child. This failure has resulted in some positive changes at the agency. The number of children removed from their homes and placed in foster care is the fewest in decades. But unfortunately, this number is now rising at a significantly faster pace since Nixzmary\xe2\x80\x99s death, up by about 55 percent in 2006 over the first 10 months of 2005.'b'In 1995, Los Angeles County\xe2\x80\x99s foster care system underwent a similar upheaval after a 2-year-old boy was returned to his family only to be beaten to death months later. Just as New York has done, officials in Los Angeles redoubled training, took over individual cases and hired frontline workers, then descended on communities to root out failing families. The system bloated to 70,000 children under the county\xe2\x80\x99s supervision.  Officials soon discovered that taking children was easier than returning them. As a result, thousands of children languished in foster care for years.'b'New York City\xe2\x80\x99s system has some critical differences, but the rising number of children taken into foster care this year suggests that we\xe2\x80\x99re still focusing more on removing children than on helping families stay together. No wonder social workers find mothers reluctant to ask for help. They\xe2\x80\x99re afraid their children will be taken from them.'b'Friends, family and neighbors share these fears and often resist calling child welfare until it\xe2\x80\x99s too late. Social workers would be more effective if the bureaucracy that employed them understood that even failing families may have something valuable to offer their children.'b'That afternoon with the man with the scarred neck was a long time ago; I am now a lawyer and I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent my career working on behalf of the frightened children who fill our nation\xe2\x80\x99s foster care systems. When I ask them about their lives they almost always answer that they want nothing more than to be returned to their mothers, who want nothing more than to be given back their children. As long as a mother is not abusive,  child welfare succeeds most when it finds the means to help mothers.'b'Like so many mothers I have worked with, my mom was poor and never graduated from high school. Fortunately for me she got rid of that man before he had the chance to kill me \xe2\x80\x94 though for her bravery he returned and raped her. Within a year, she and I were living in a motel, foraging for food from trash bins.'b'As we slid deeper into poverty, child welfare officials offered little more than threats that I would be taken from her. A social worker eventually arrived with a police escort. While my mother screamed on the sidewalk, I was hustled into a waiting car. She loved me but she lacked the resources to care for me. I remained in foster care until I was 18.'b'That was decades ago, yet child welfare has changed little. In the glare of public scrutiny, officials too often respond with reforms that drive up the number of children taken from their families. One can barely comprehend the evil of an adult who murders a child, but few parents, even those tangled in child welfare systems, are monsters. If greater trust existed between impoverished communities and child welfare systems, if mothers felt that calling child welfare meant more than losing their children, if their neighbors felt the same, help might arrive more often in time to prevent a tragedy.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cTesting the Testers\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 8):'b'Only in the United States could we decide to entrust to private enterprise something as fundamental to the Republic as the vote.

But for some, gambling leads to debilitating problems.'b'At its most serious, problem gambling has been recognized as a psychiatric disorder. Yet very few comprehensive studies of the impacts of gambling (both positive and negative) have been carried out, probably because \xe2\x80\x94 as the National Gambling Impact Study Commission pointed out in 1999  \xe2\x80\x94 regulating gambling is viewed as a state issue and few states have the resources or political will to finance such studies.'b'I have spent more than 20 years studying gambling and, to my knowledge, Connecticut is the only jurisdiction ever to mandate that impact studies of legal gambling be conducted every five years. Starting in 1981, four impact studies \xe2\x80\x94 including one in 1991 in which I was involved \xe2\x80\x94 have been carried out in Connecticut. However, each one was done so differently that it was impossible to draw any hard and fast conclusions about changes in the impact of legal gambling over time.'b'In 2001, in the face of budget constraints, the state reneged on its pledge to conduct these periodic surveys; no gambling impact study has been carried out in Connecticut since 1996. This was a mistake, especially when the state\xe2\x80\x99s gambling industry has brought in more than $600 million annually to Connecticut\xe2\x80\x99s general fund since 2002.'b'There is some good news. The State Senate has recently set aside money  to study the impact of gambling in Connecticut. As officials prepare to carry out the study, here are some things they should keep in mind.'b'Quantifying the effects of legal gambling is a complex task. An international review of gambling impact studies that my colleagues and I are doing for the British government has highlighted several important issues.'b'First, every jurisdiction is unique and any impact study must be designed to answer, as comprehensively as possible, the questions deemed most important by its policymakers and citizens. Second, account must be taken of the socio-economic impacts of all of the different types of gambling available, rather than focusing narrowly on one or another form of gambling.'b'Third, it is impossible to account fully for all of the social benefits or costs associated with gambling since some of the effects defy quantification and the negative impacts often take much longer to emerge than positive ones like revenue flowing into state coffers. Fourth, while the relationship between gambling availability and the prevalence of problem gambling is poorly understood, research suggests that there is a substantial lag between the introduction of a new form of gambling and the emergence of new problem gamblers. This underscores the importance of conducting uniform studies on a regular basis.'b'What we have learned by looking at the few exemplary gambling impact studies conducted internationally is that the cost of a high-quality study far surpasses the $350,000 that Connecticut is pledging to spend; that the best studies are awarded competitively and carried out by large, multidisciplinary teams from independent research organizations with close involvement of gambling researchers; and that consideration of a range of issues, including economics, crime, public health and culture and community impacts is necessary.'b'It is also important to pay particular attention to vulnerable groups. For instance, people who are socially and economically disadvantaged are often hurt the most by legal gambling. And most significant, any gambling impact study must be accompanied by recommendations for change that are put into action and assessed for their effectiveness in reducing the harm caused by gambling.'b'Those of us concerned about the effects of gambling applaud the effort in Connecticut to reclaim its early leadership role in studying the impacts of legal gambling. But to avoid repeating mistakes, Senate leaders must ensure that sufficient resources are made available in Connecticut and that the study is done to the highest standards, maintaining comparability with what was done previously in the state as well as with studies across the nation and around the world.'b'Hide your children, and pass out the measuring tapes. Lawmakers on Long Island, doing their part to prevent sexual abuse, are busily weaving a tight web of laws restricting where convicted sex offenders can live and lurk. The laws, like  others  around the country, are a sort of geography-based epidemiology, treating each sex offender as a one-man roaming toxic zone that must be kept at a rigorous distance from places where children gather.'b'The distances vary, with Suffolk County (a quarter-mile from schools, day-care centers and playgrounds) and Nassau (1,000 feet from schools, 500 feet from public parks) setting benchmarks that some communities are emulating. East Rockaway includes \xe2\x80\x9cany school, place of worship, child day-care center, community center, public library, public park, playground and other recreational facility\xe2\x80\x9d in its 1,000-foot no-go zones. The City of Long Beach is considering similar legislation, and since restricted areas would include its long, long beach, sex offenders could effectively be driven entirely out of that skinny city. Huntington Town is jumping on the bandwagon, with a bill expanding on Suffolk\xe2\x80\x99s list of restricted places and forbidding offenders to own or live in  houses used as apartments.'b'The first thing that needs to be said about laws like this is that they are a sham. There is no evidence linking buffer zones to a reduction in sex crimes, and no way that buffer zones will do anything about the bulk of the sex-offender problem, which is the abuse of children by relatives and other people they know. The laws are simplistic, emotion-based formulas that cloak politicians in an aura of decisiveness while doing nothing to tackle a ferociously difficult problem.'b'The second thing is that they are a dangerous waste of law-enforcement time and resources. Police departments are already obliged under a welter of federal and state laws to register and monitor sex offenders. Prosecutors and sheriffs around the country have complained that adding map-reading and buffer-zone enforcement to their large and growing offender-management portfolios only hampers their ability to fight crime.'b'The final and most important point is that buffer zones and housing restrictions send offenders underground. We may all find these men fearsome and creepy, but if communities systematically banish them, denying them the chance to find housing and to lead stable lives under close supervision, they end up doing the logical thing. They congregate in unincorporated poor areas. Or they disappear.'b'Lawmakers stress how important it is to keep children safe.

Landmarking does not cause population exclusion or displacement, and to place it along with redlining, urban renewal and other racially charged planning practices is both incorrect and inappropriate.'b'Simeon Bankoff'b'Executive Director'b'Historic Districts Council'b'East Village'b''b''b''b'Fort Benning, Ga.'b'IN 1901, Gen. Leonard Wood, the American governor of occupied Cuba, wrote an incensed letter to President William McKinley after discovering deep corruption in the island\xe2\x80\x99s postal service. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have gone into Cuba to give these people an example of good government,\xe2\x80\x9d Wood insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cThese thefts in the post office are so far the only blot on our record. Our honor as a nation demands that we bring the thieves to trial.\xe2\x80\x9d He gave his commander in chief an ultimatum: \xe2\x80\x9cIf it is embarrassing to you to have me persist in this matter, I will resign.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'About the only difference between Cuba then and Iraq today is that Wood\xe2\x80\x99s intervention resulted in the jailing of the culprits. The level of corruption in the Iraq Security Forces is staggering. The Iraq Study Group found that $5 billion to $7 billion is lost annually to different types of corruption, and yet \xe2\x80\x9cthere are still no examples of senior officials who have been brought before a court and convicted of corruption charges.\xe2\x80\x9d The result: \xe2\x80\x9cEconomic development is hobbled by insecurity, corruption, lack of investment, dilapidated infrastructure and uncertainty.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yet of the study group\xe2\x80\x99s 79 recommendations, only two are much relevant to this problem, and no anticorruption milestones to be achieved were set forth. Having served in Iraq, I find this very disappointing. While I can\xe2\x80\x99t of course speak officially for the Pentagon, I can describe what I saw and give my own thoughts on how to improve things.'b'The most prominent forms of corruption I saw were Iraqi commanders pocketing the paychecks of nonexistent troops in the Iraqi Army and officers in the police forces, and customs officials abetting the smuggling of oil and precious rebuilding supplies across Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s porous borders.'b'These are vast problems, but some relatively simple solutions could tamp them down considerably.'b'The greatest amount of corruption in the Iraq military and police forces occurs when payrolls are handed out at the unit level. Because the country doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a functioning banking system that would allow easy money transfers to private accounts, military and security commanders receive large sums of cash every payroll period  based on the number and rank of soldiers on their personnel rosters. The endemic problem is that commanders frequently put nonexistent soldiers and security personnel \xe2\x80\x94 dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cghosts\xe2\x80\x9d by American overseers \xe2\x80\x94 on their rosters and pocket their salaries.'b'It is difficult to overstate how deeply these ghosts hurt the war effort. Most obviously, we have no idea how much of this money is being siphoned off to support tribal and ethnic fighting, and even the insurgency itself.'b'Also, because hundreds and thousands of ghosts exist at all echelons, many military and police units in the field do not have nearly as many men at arms as they seem to have on paper. Thus the units are often assigned tasks for which they do not have necessary manpower. And when American or other coalition forces are asked to \xe2\x80\x9cpartner\xe2\x80\x9d with Iraqi troops, we have often found that there simply aren\xe2\x80\x99t enough bodies to conduct training and missions.'b'American officials have long been aware of this problem. \xe2\x80\x9cThe number of trained and equipped security forces does not provide a complete picture of their capabilities and may overstate the number of forces on duty,\xe2\x80\x9d was the finding of the Government Accountability Office\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cStabilizing Iraq\xe2\x80\x9d report last fall. \xe2\x80\x9cFor example, Ministry of Interior data include police who are absent without leave.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Those of us on the ground discovered this the hard way. When I was with the Third Armored Cavalry Regiment in Nineveh Province in 2005, we tried for months to get the names of all Iraqi security personnel in our sector on the payrolls of the Ministries of Interior and Defense. We were curious because when we tried to assess the effectiveness of the Iraqi Border Police brigade in Sinjar, on the Syrian border, we were told by Iraqi commanders that at least 300 officers were \xe2\x80\x9cperforming guard duties in Mosul.\xe2\x80\x9d Mosul is more than 100 miles inside Iraq, so border troops had no business there, if indeed they existed at all.'b'Similarly, in South Baghdad, we American advisers assigned to the Fourth Brigade of the Sixth Iraqi Army Division had little luck getting a clear read of the brigade\xe2\x80\x99s strength. Iraqi commanders repeatedly told us that many of their men were \xe2\x80\x9celsewhere, performing security duties for the Ministry of Defense.\xe2\x80\x9d The advisers found personnel discrepancies as high as 30 percent in any given unit.'b'How can we bust the ghosts? Every soldier, police officer and government official is assigned a national identification number for bookkeeping, but so far it has been far too easy for corrupt officials to get numbers for nonexistent people. A better idea would be a universal national identification card for all government and military employees that includes the holder\xe2\x80\x99s photograph and fingerprints.'b'Such cards should be required for any Iraqi to receive his paycheck. Both the distribution of the cards and the payroll-distribution sites should be jointly overseen by coalition and Iraqi officials. There is no reason such a system could not be in place by the end of the year.'b'It would also help if American advisers embedded with security forces were charged with ensuring that all Iraqis are actually on duty with their assigned units. Should Iraqi commanders refuse to cooperate with their audits, we must insist that the Iraqi government fire them.'b'The second major source of corruption I witnessed is what I call the \xe2\x80\x9creverse Ho Chi Minh Trails\xe2\x80\x9d that facilitate smuggling of Iraqi oil and other resources out of the country. A United States interagency panel reported in November that oil smuggling abetted by corrupt Iraqi customs officials is netting the insurgents $100 million a year, helping to make them financially self-sustaining.'b'Because most of Iraq is landlocked, almost all goods going in and out pass through 14 land \xe2\x80\x9cports of entry.\xe2\x80\x9d Smuggling has always been a part of Iraqi life, and was even more so during the last years of Saddam Hussein\xe2\x80\x99s rule, because he encouraged it to counteract the embargo on Iraqi oil. Yet, almost immediately after the 2003 invasion, former customs officials from the regime resumed their duties at the ports of entry.'b'Later that year, we in the Third Armored Cavalry were given responsibility for the Syrian, Jordanian and Saudi Arabian borders along Anbar Province. In addition to helping create the new Iraqi Border Police force, we set about reforming the customs checkpoints.'b'At first, this was successful: for example, the border police battalion we trained at Walid, near the conjunction of the Syrian and Jordanian borders, uncovered many attempts to smuggle out large quantities of food, fuel, industrial parts and other goods. Hundreds of smugglers were arrested.'b'Unfortunately, we left Anbar in early 2004 and corrupt officials in Baghdad soon took away the border police\xe2\x80\x99s oversight authority on the grounds that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t their \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional role to conduct operations that were assigned exclusively to customs officials.\xe2\x80\x9d American advisers at the national level failed to do anything about this, and things quickly reverted to the corrupt status quo.'b'The situation at Walid was hardly unique. In 2005 I returned to Iraq with the Third Armored Cavalry, this time to Nineveh Province, to cover the northern section of the border between Iraq and Syria. It soon became clear that the region\xe2\x80\x99s port of entry, at Rabiya, was a hotbed of corruption. Not only were customs officials apparently turning a blind eye to smuggling, but they seemed to be directly engaged in it.'b'And little has changed: last month the American special inspector general for Iraq, Stuart Bowen, reported that the pipelines in the area have been blown up, so the only way to export oil is by road. He noted, \xe2\x80\x9cThat leaves it vulnerable to smuggling as truckers sell their cargoes on the black market.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'How can we shut down this black market? First, we must insist that the Iraqi government replace the customs workers at the 14 land border crossings with a new set of at least 1,400 elite officials jointly selected and vetted by the Iraqi ministries and the coalition forces.'b'We should supplement this new force with teams of American advisers \xe2\x80\x94 soldiers, police officers, customs officials and the like \xe2\x80\x94 to ensure that the Iraqis are prepared to do their jobs. And we should create an anticorruption task force of coalition officers with the power to periodically review systemic issues like the Iraqis\xe2\x80\x99 recruitment methods, policies governing potential ethical problems and records of internal discipline.'b'The Iraq Study Group concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe ability of the United States to shape the outcomes is diminishing\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9ctime is running out.\xe2\x80\x9d Those of us who have been on the ground know how true this is. Irrespective of the number and mission of United States forces sent to Iraq, winning or losing will depend in large part on our ability to, in General Wood\xe2\x80\x99s phrasing, \xe2\x80\x9cgive these people an example of good government.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Tarrytown, N.Y.'b'THERE\xe2\x80\x99S invariably something risky, if not risible, about allowing Congress to decide what\xe2\x80\x99s for dinner. Bad decisions about agriculture have defined government policy for the last century; 70 percent of our nation\xe2\x80\x99s farms have been lost to bankruptcy or consolidation, creating an agricultural economy that looks more Wall Street than Main Street.'b'Now, after the uprooting of a thousand years of agrarian wisdom, we chefs have discovered something really terrible  \xe2\x80\x94 no, not that the agricultural system we help support hurts farmers and devastates farming communities, or that it harms the environment and  our health. What we\xe2\x80\x99ve discovered is that the food it produces just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t taste very good.'b'Who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for the blandness? Look no further than Washington: There you will meet not farmers, but the people determining how our farmers farm. They do it through the farm bill, a mammoth piece of legislation that designates American agricultural policy every five years and that Congress is preparing to take up in its new session.'b'This is a  sweeping bill, omnibus in every sense \xe2\x80\x94 nutrition, conservation, genetic engineering, food safety, school lunch programs, water quality, organic farming and much more. It\xe2\x80\x99s really a food and farm bill. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a chef or a home cook or someone who just likes to eat, it affects you, because it determines what you eat and how what you eat is grown.'b'And the food that we grow on 200 million acres of harvested cropland is inedible. Stand in the middle of our farm belt and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see cornfields extending to the horizon, but the harvest won\xe2\x80\x99t be dinner, not until it\xe2\x80\x99s milled and processed into flours or starches, or used to fatten our animals on feedlots. Just four crops \xe2\x80\x94 corn, rice, soybeans and wheat \xe2\x80\x94 account for the vast majority  of our harvested acreage. Not surprising, given that these same crops account for 70 percent  of the total subsidies allotted to farmers.'b'No one wants farmers to suffer, especially chefs. But if we\xe2\x80\x99re spending $20 billion or so  a year on farm subsidies, we ought to invest in the foods we eat. And I mean'b' eat,'b' not process into something that resembles food. That means fewer subsidies for grains like corn and soy, and more help for growers of broccoli and tomatoes.'b'How do we do this? We could start by rewarding diversity over yield, basing subsidy payments not on how many acres of corn a farmer grows but on the number of varieties of crops he plants. We could also link payments to, say, the efficiency of nitrogen fixation (crop rotation helps the soil retain nitrogen, so farmers don\xe2\x80\x99t need to add it with chemicals) or equate them with how much a farm helps soil and water conservation. In effect, tie payments to plant health.'b'This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean the government needs to tell the farmer what to grow. Instead, show the farmer that there\xe2\x80\x99s more money to be made in a rich, diverse ecology and the planting strategy will change. Change the planting strategy, and whether it\xe2\x80\x99s grains or greens, the quality of what\xe2\x80\x99s harvested vastly improves.'b'Yes, the naughty thumb of science may have prodded the earth, as E. E. Cummings said, but there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong with thumbing dollar bills in the direction of promoting a tastier food supply. That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of green revolution that a chef can support.'b'But such thoughts are rarely on the minds of our legislators, or, so it seems, anyone else. Take as an example the insurance industry. Its policies favor big farms that grow a single commodity crop. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a farmer who wants to grow lots of different crops, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost impossible to get affordable coverage; to  insurers, you\xe2\x80\x99re pretty much the equivalent of a skydiving cigarette smoker.'b'The insurance regulations that are part of the farm bill need to address this disparity, because crop diversification should be exactly what insurers want: it helps to prevent the kind of natural disasters that insurance policies protect against, say, a devastating insect infestation. (Of course, it gives food lovers precisely what they want: more diversity, more variety, more flavor.) To this end, our agricultural policy should acknowledge the role of biodiverse farms in risk management by establishing discounts for farmers who practice this form of environmental stewardship and removing the discriminatory 5 percent premium surcharge on policies that encumbers organic producers under the current system.'b'While our legislators are at it, they might also look at another powerful paradox that chefs confront every day. If I want to purchase a case of carrots, it\xe2\x80\x99s much easier (and cheaper) to get them from the Salinas Valley, in California, than from the Hudson Valley that surrounds my restaurants. The food distribution system favors size. A distributor in California can send one truck to pick up 50 cases of carrots; a distributor procuring exclusively from  the Northeast will need to send 50 trucks to 50 different farms.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s a shame, not just because a carrot that comes to New York from California gets singed with petroleum as it travels cross-country, but because at this time of year carrots pulled from the rich muck dirt of Western New York have 50 times more flavor than their West Coast counterparts.'b'Same with milk, which large industrial dairy farms sell with the iconic label of a smiling, muscle-flexed cow in front of open pasture and next to an old red barn. That\xe2\x80\x99s tantamount to false advertising, since the industrial dairy cow never sees a blade of fresh grass and has very few muscles to flex after receiving hormones to increase productivity. With 20,000 cows per farm, the animals spend a lot of time waiting in line for the next milking, so it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine that there is a lot of smiling going on.'b'False representation aside, there\xe2\x80\x99s one point the powerful dairy industry won\xe2\x80\x99t let us forget: milk is pretty cheap. But  the real cost of milk is hidden in places like California, with its heavily subsidized irrigation system; if Western dairy farmers  had to pay the real cost of the irrigation-dependent alfalfa fed to cows, New England\xe2\x80\x99s milk prices would be more competitive. And if those cows ate a variety of grasses as they were meant to, instead of just alfalfa, \xe2\x80\x9cGot Milk?\xe2\x80\x9d would be more \xe2\x80\x9cGot Rich, Delicious and Affordable Milk?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Though food transportation and irrigation subsidies exist outside the domain of the current farm bill, their implications cannot be overlooked as we review (and revise) our system of agriculture. The new bill needs to level the playing field by recognizing a region\xe2\x80\x99s agricultural strength \xe2\x80\x94 like New England\xe2\x80\x99s abundant supply of great grassland \xe2\x80\x94 and encouraging farmers through subsidies and other inducements to use it accordingly.'b'Then there\xe2\x80\x99s the question of meat and poultry. A breed of pig that tasted like pork (something other than the other white meat)? A chicken that actually saw pasture (and tasted  like ... chicken)? A steer with fat marbled on a grass diet, or a lamb that\xe2\x80\x99s been rotationally grazed? We\xe2\x80\x99re not asking for a lot, but no matter, it\xe2\x80\x99s not for sale, at least not by the big-food chain.'b'Unless you\xe2\x80\x99re a farmers\xe2\x80\x99 market devotee or savvy Internet user, or happen to live near a market that supports good animal husbandry, you depend on a system that raises animals in confinement. That\xe2\x80\x99s very large confinement \xe2\x80\x94 several thousand pigs to a barn, tens of thousands of chickens. The industrial model is efficiency through uniformity. A tastier model would be flavor through diversity \xe2\x80\x94 but the current farm bill won\xe2\x80\x99t allow it.'b'For one thing, federal rules prohibit the out-of-state sale of livestock and poultry products inspected by a state agency, which means if you want to raise more meat and expand  your farm by offering a niche product, you\xe2\x80\x99re stuck doing it only in your state  \xe2\x80\x94  if you can find a slaughterhouse. (Oh, federally inspected slaughterhouses are few and far between, and unless you\xe2\x80\x99re an agribusiness giant, nearly impossible get into.)'b'Local abbatoirs, besides feeling the pressure of land prices and unwelcoming neighbors, have to contend with unwieldy rules. A one-size-fits-all mentality dictates that mom-and-pop slaughterhouses must follow the same rules of inspection as industrial plants, even though these huge meat processors typically slaughter more cattle in a single hour (390 by Agriculture Department estimates) than their counterparts might see in a whole year.'b'Legislation to approve state-inspected meats was introduced in the last session by Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri. His bill calls for the Agriculture Department to certify all satisfactory state-inspection programs, thus enabling the 2,000 existing state-inspected meat processors to enter the national market, and paving the way for many more.'b'His bill would help, but so would a farm bill that put up fewer roadblocks to smaller-scale livestock farms and pulled the veil back on where our food comes from. We stamp \xe2\x80\x9cMade in the U.S.A.\xe2\x80\x9d on blue jeans and cars \xe2\x80\x94 but Americans can\xe2\x80\x99t find out where their food was grown. If Congress passes \xe2\x80\x94 and enforces \xe2\x80\x94 a rule in the 2007 bill requiring country of origin labeling, we\xe2\x80\x99d be more informed about the origins of our food supply and, to the great fear of our corporate brethren, we might ask a lot more questions. Questions like \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s growing our food?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s it being grown?\xe2\x80\x9d are not easily answered anymore, especially when a package of frozen ground meat can  have  animal parts from as many as 20 countries.'b'Suggest to agribusiness interests that they think about flavor, though, and you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to be called an indulgent elitist who wants to force Americans to pay more for their food and an anti-progressive nostalgic for a bygone era of family farms.'b'I  SUPPOSE, as a chef, I\xe2\x80\x99m guilty of being indulgent, but nothing like the over-indulgence of the farm bill. The meat we end up buying at the local farmers\xe2\x80\x99 market is relatively expensive because, through the workings of agricultural legislation, conventional meat prices are unnaturally low. I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the big boys \xe2\x80\x94 the Smithfields, the Tysons and the Archer Daniels Midlands of the world \xe2\x80\x94 which the farm bill subsidizes in the form of direct payments for grain (their feed is then artificially cheap). In doing that, we indirectly subsidize industrial farms\xe2\x80\x99 pollution; the health care costs (associated with animals bursting with corn fat, or animals reared on a constant cocktail of antibiotics); and the costs of insuring these companies against food-borne illness (brought on by a system that\xe2\x80\x99s run amok \xe2\x80\x94 or should I say that runs in muck, with animals living in their own waste).'b'We need a farm bill that makes corporations internalize the costs they impose on society in the same way that they internalize their profits.'b'Some people argue that the desire to promote smaller, family-run local farms is gratuitously effete and nostalgic. That\xe2\x80\x99s just nonsense. It\xe2\x80\x99s the agriculture industry\xe2\x80\x99s mind-set \xe2\x80\x94 high on capital, chemistry and machines \xe2\x80\x94 that is actually old-fashioned. Just as the Industrial Revolution of factories with heavy machinery and billowing black smoke is yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s news, so too are our unsustainable farming operations. Nonetheless our legislators continue to marvel at how modern industrial farms have become, and to invest ever more of our tax dollars into them.'b'In place of these outmoded and untenable practices, we need a farm bill that promotes sustainable farming research. We need increased money for the existing Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program, as well as an overhauled version of the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems,  a competitive grants program introduced in 1998 whose financing has since disappeared. These organizations encourage and finance innovative technologies to profit, and empower, the independent farmer.'b'We also need to ensure more money for things like the Conservation Security Program. Unlike most conservation programs that take land out of production, this one offers financial support to farmers who cultivate their fields in an environmentally sustainable manner. But enrollment in this program has been severely restricted since its 2002 inception, in large part because of $4 billion in budget cuts. That\xe2\x80\x99s a 50 percent cut  in a program that supports the basic tenets of land, water and wildlife conservation \xe2\x80\x94 tenets that go hand in hand with small-scale, chemical-free and crop-diverse agriculture.'b'These are also the tenets that built the world\xe2\x80\x99s great cuisines \xe2\x80\x94 Chinese, Italian, peasant French, Indian. Good gastronomy evolved out of good farming \xe2\x80\x94 the best chefs have merely delivered on what farmers have worked out over several centuries. A tomato bursting with flavor, or an impossibly juicy leg of lamb, is no accident. If we\xe2\x80\x99re able to eventually clone that, great, but let\xe2\x80\x99s do it in the name of flavor, not corporate greed.'b'Right now, as members of Congress prepare to debate the details of the new farm bill, let\xe2\x80\x99s hope they allow the best examples of gastronomy to be their guide. Great farming, environmental stewardship and nutritious food will not be far behind.'b'An Op-Ed article on Dec. 28, about Gerald Ford during World War II, incorrectly described a ship he saw hit by a Japanese torpedo during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. The ship, the cruiser Canberra, was American, not Australian.'b'WHEN Cesar Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s stepdaughter missed several weeks of first grade in the spring of 2005, he convinced an investigator from the city Administration for Children\xe2\x80\x99s Services that his wife, pregnant with her sixth child, was simply overwhelmed. After he agreed to get the older children to school on time, the investigator arranged to buy the family a crib, a stroller and a high chair. And then she closed the case.'b'Months later, when the girl came to school with stitches and a black eye, Mr. Rodriguez told a doctor and children\xe2\x80\x99s services investigators that the injury was the result of an accident. Then he kept his family out of sight for a month. No one unlocked the door to his Brooklyn apartment when Children\xe2\x80\x99s Services came to call.'b'On the morning of Jan. 11, 2006, an investigator visited Mr. Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s building once again, and this time she had no trouble getting inside. An ambulance crew was there with the badly damaged body of 7-year-old Nixzmary Brown. And now Mr. Rodriguez and the girl\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Nixzaliz Santiago, are nearing  trials on  murder charges.'b'There had been reasons to suspect violence and deception in the Nixzmary Brown case, but investigators had not followed up on them. City officials have acknowledged breaches of protocol on the part of child protection workers and others who had seen evidence of the child\xe2\x80\x99s abuse, and they have since made valuable reforms in caseworker oversight.'b'Nonetheless, in trying to prevent the same kind of failures from happening again, it is important to look beyond this case to a larger problem with the laws that guide child protection. Some of the rules that caseworkers must follow do not accurately reflect the day-to-day reality of their work, and may even divert their attention from serious trouble.'b'Last year I spent several weeks with skilled child-protection workers looking into reports of abuse and neglect in East Harlem. The best of these professionals are trained skeptics with instinctive compassion. They spend their days and evenings in the toughest neighborhoods, in the homes of the poorest New Yorkers,  trying  to make sure children are safe. Most are women in their 20s who have bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degrees and earn modest salaries. (Starting pay is $38,000.)'b'Situations involving brutal assaults are very rare. Most cases stem from pressures linked to poverty \xe2\x80\x94 including overcrowded housing, domestic violence, mental health problems and substance abuse.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve watched investigators help single mothers organize child care, buy furniture or seek orders of protection against abusive men. I saw one worker in East Harlem embrace a sobbing mother of two, as the woman contemplated the near impossibility of coming up with the rent after her violent lover moved out. Later that evening, the worker cajoled a 16-year-old to obey her probation rules, stay out of detention and help her grandmother keep her family together.'b'From January through May of last year, after Nixzmary Brown\xe2\x80\x99s death, a torrent of nearly 1,600 new cases of suspected abuse and neglect were reported each week to the Administration for Children\xe2\x80\x99s Services \xe2\x80\x94 48 percent more than usual. To this day, new names are added to case lists faster than old cases can be resolved.'b'About one-third of such reports turn out to raise valid concerns. Many turn out to be frivolous complaints made by former lovers, unhappy neighbors or meddlesome in-laws. Other reports \xe2\x80\x94 far too many, city officials say privately \xe2\x80\x94 come from school officials  who don\xe2\x80\x99t first reach out to families to find out why a child is missing school, hungry or poorly clothed.'b'A central purpose of child protection services is to ensure that no child is killed or endangered by vicious, soulless or oblivious adults. State laws aim to accomplish this by requiring caseworkers to meet strict investigative protocols. These include interviews with everyone in the household within 48 hours, as well as others involved with the family \xe2\x80\x94 but also stiff deadlines and multiple record checks with clinics and schools, and paperwork that includes dozens of pages of notes that must be filed in two separate data systems.'b'These rules make sense in cases like Nixzmary Brown\xe2\x80\x99s, in which there is reason to suspect harsh abuse. But in the great majority of cases, violence or extreme neglect is not the issue. And the rules impose a staggering burden of work that can distract investigators from more important tasks.'b'New York City needs to consider a two-tiered approach to child-protection services, similar to the ones that have  been tried with some success in states like Minnesota. In all cases, investigators should be required to follow the most basic procedures. They should see all the children in the household, and interview the adults. In instances where there is reason to suspect serious problems, teams of skillful, highly experienced investigators should dig deeper.'b'But most cases should be quickly passed on to workers who have the time to give families the support, resources and counseling they need.'b'With Iraq sliding off a cliff, and now tugging another 20,000 young Americans along as well, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth wrestling with a larger question: Why are we so awful at foreign policy?'b'Shirin Ebadi, the Iranian lawyer who won the Nobel Peace Prize, dropped by the other day, and she made the same point with characteristic bluntness. \xe2\x80\x9cIt amazes me that the U.S., with all its scientific accomplishments, is so shortsighted in its foreign policy,\xe2\x80\x9d she noted.'b'It is pathetic. We can go safely to the moon but not to Anbar Province. We can peer into the farthest reaches of the universe, but we fail to notice (until it\xe2\x80\x99s too late) that many Iraqis loathe us. We produce movies that delight audiences all over the world, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t devise a foreign policy that anybody likes.'b'And it\xe2\x80\x99s not just right-wing Republicans who are the problem. President Bush has been particularly myopic, but Democrats mired us in Vietnam: shortsightedness is a bipartisan tradition in foreign policy. Historically, we are often our own worst enemy.'b'Iraq is the example of the moment. We invaded, thinking that we would get a pro-American bulwark, cheap oil, long-term military bases and the gratitude of liberated Iraqis. Instead, we fought Iraq, and Iran won.'b'Speaking of which, look at Iran. In 1953, we helped overthrow the democratically elected prime minister, Mohammed Mossadegh, to achieve a more pro-Western government. That created tensions that led to the Iranian revolution of 1979 and the rise of mullahs with nuclear dreams. If it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for our own policies, Iran might well now have a pro-American government.'b'So why do we act so often against our own long-term interests? There are at least two reasons.'b'The first is that great powers always lumber about, stepping on toes, provoking resentments, and solving problems militarily simply because they have that capability. One of the great passages of Thucydides records how some 2,400 years ago Athens decided to wipe out the city of Melos because it could.'b'Likewise, in 1955, when Britain was the dominant player in the Middle East, it formed the Baghdad Pact, a military arrangement intended to protect British interests in the Middle East. Instead, the arrangement inflamed Arab nationalists, strengthened anti-British feeling and contributed to the fall of the Iraqi monarchy in 1958 \xe2\x80\x94 and, eventually, to the rise of Saddam.'b'The second reason is particular to the U.S.: We don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the world. The U.S. may owe its existence to prickly nationalist troublemakers like Sam Adams, but (partly because relatively few Americans have lived abroad) we are obtuse about the appeal of prickly nationalist troublemakers elsewhere. Like George III, we empower our enemies.'b'So what does all this have to do with the price of tea in Baghdad?'b'Once again the White House is seeking military solutions that are likely to rebound and hurt us. Sending more young Americans into that maelstrom may well have three consequences: inflaming Iraqi nationalism, bolstering Shiite and Sunni extremists alike, and killing more young Americans.'b'A U.S. military study in 1999, recently declassified and in the National Security Archive, concluded that even 400,000 American troops might not be able to stabilize a post-Saddam Iraq. The study emphasized the importance of diplomacy to engage Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors.'b'But President Bush is moving in the opposite direction. Most worrying, he is hinting at  engaging Syria and Iran not diplomatically but militarily. We are careering down a road that may ultimately lead to military strikes on Iran \xe2\x80\x94 a disaster.'b'What would a better strategy look like? A good bit like the one advocated by the Iraq Study Group. It would emphasize engaging neighbors, a big push for political compromises within Iraq, steps toward troop withdrawals and an intensive effort to achieve an Israeli-Palestinian peace. (Condi Rice is planning this last effort.)'b'Would this strategy work in Iraq? No one knows. But such a bipartisan plan might at least bring a bit of healing to the U.S.'b'Meanwhile, history comes around in other ways. The Rev. Bob Edgar, the general secretary of the National Council of Churches, recalls that as a young congressman in April 1975, he encountered a similar presidential request for a surge of troops. It was a demand by President Gerald Ford for more U.S. forces to stabilize Saigon.'b'A White House photo captures Ford conferring with two of the architects of that request: senior administration officials named Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld.'b'Income inequality is on the rise. The rich are getting better at passing their advantages on to their kids. Lifestyle and values gaps are widening between the educated and uneducated. So the big issue is: Will Americans demand new policies to reverse these trends \xe2\x80\x94 to redistribute wealth, to provide greater economic security? Are we about to see a mass populist movement in this country?'b'Nobody was smarter on this subject than Seymour Martin Lipset, the eminent sociologist who died at 84 on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve. Lipset had been a socialist in the hothouse atmosphere of City College during the 1940s, and though he later became a moderate Democrat, he continued to wonder, with some regret, why America never had a serious socialist movement, why America never adopted a European-style welfare state.'b'Lipset was aware of the structural and demographic answers to such questions. For example, racially diverse nations tend to have lower levels of social support than homogeneous ones. People don\xe2\x80\x99t feel as bound together when they are divided  on ethnic lines and are less likely to embrace mutual support programs. You can have diversity or a big welfare state. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to have both.'b'But as he studied these matters, Lipset moved away from structural or demographic explanations (too many counterexamples). He drifted, as Tocqueville and Werner Sombart had before him, to values.'b'America never had a feudal past, so nobody has a sense of social place or class-consciousness, Lipset observed. Meanwhile, Americans have inherited from their Puritan forebears a sense that they have a spiritual obligation to rise and succeed.'b'Two great themes run through American history, Lipset wrote in his 1963 book \xe2\x80\x9cThe First New Nation\xe2\x80\x9d: achievement and equality. These are often in tension because when you leave unequally endowed people free to achieve, you get unequal results.'b'Though Lipset never quite put it this way, the clear message from his writings is that when achievement and equality clash in America, achievement wins. Or to be more precise, the achievement ethos reshapes the definition of equality. When Americans use the word \xe2\x80\x9cequality,\xe2\x80\x9d they really mean \xe2\x80\x9cfair opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d When Americans use the word \xe2\x80\x9cfreedom,\xe2\x80\x9d they really mean \xe2\x80\x9copportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Lipset was relentlessly empirical, and rested his conclusions on data as well as history and philosophy. He found that Americans have for centuries embraced individualistic, meritocratic, antistatist values, even at times when income inequality was greater than it is today.'b'Large majorities of Americans have always believed that individuals are responsible for their own success, Lipset reported, while people in other countries are much more likely to point to forces beyond individual control. Sixty-five percent of Americans believe hard work is the key to success; only 12 percent think luck plays a major role.'b'In his \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Exceptionalism\xe2\x80\x9d (1996), Lipset pointed out that 78 percent of Americans endorse the view that \xe2\x80\x9cthe strength of this country today is mostly based on the success of American business.\xe2\x80\x9d Fewer than a third of all Americans believe the state has a responsibility to reduce income disparities, compared with 82 percent of Italians. Over 70 percent of Americans believe \xe2\x80\x9cindividuals should take more responsibility for providing for themselves\xe2\x80\x9d whereas most Japanese believe \xe2\x80\x9cthe state should take more responsibility to ensure everyone is provided for.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'America, he concluded, is an outlier, an exceptional nation. And though his patriotism pervaded his writing, he emphasized that American exceptionalism is \xe2\x80\x9ca double-edged sword.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Political movements that run afoul of these individualistic, achievement-oriented values rarely prosper. The Democratic Party is now divided between moderates \xe2\x80\x94 who emphasize individual responsibility and education to ameliorate inequality \xe2\x80\x94 and progressive populists, who advocate an activist state that will protect people from forces beyond their control. Given the deep forces in American history, the centrists will almost certainly win out.'b'Indeed, the most amazing thing about the past week is how modest the Democratic agenda has been. Democrats have been out of power in Congress for 12 years. They finally get a chance to legislate and they push through a series of small proposals that are little pebbles compared to the vast economic problems they described during the campaign.'b'They grasp the realities Marty Lipset described. They understand that in the face of inequality, Americans have usually opted for policies that offer more opportunity, not those emphasizing security or redistribution. American domestic policy is drifting leftward, but there are sharp limits on how far it will go.'b'To the Editor:'b'I\xe2\x80\x99d like to note my objections to both the premise and substance of \xe2\x80\x9c'b'How to End Long Island\xe2\x80\x99s Sour Vintages'b',\xe2\x80\x9d by Lisa Granik (Op-Ed, Jan. 7).'b'There may be other factors such as illness and old age that weigh into an owner\xe2\x80\x99s decision to sell a vineyard property. Ms. Granik jumped to the conclusion that because there are a number of properties for sale, then something is rotten with the industry and by extension its winemakers. I strongly disagree.'b'As I start my 10th vintage as a Long Island winemaker, I feel more strongly than ever that our focus should remain on producing high-quality merlot, cabernet franc and Meritage blends with a Long Island identity. Ms. Granik, in fact, was part of a distinguished tasting panel that rated a Long Island producer of merlot nearly equal to that of Ch\xc3\xa2teau P\xc3\xa9trus, yet she dismisses the region as a great producer of merlot, and ignores Long Island\xe2\x80\x99s unique ability to become a world-class producer of cabernet franc.'b'Adam Suprenant 'b'Peconic'b''b'\xe2\x80\xa2'b'To the Editor:'b'The Long Island wine industry is certainly not in decline because a few of our wineries are on the market. There are various factors cited by owners of those particular properties \xe2\x80\x94 personal reasons being the most prevalent \xe2\x80\x94 but there is definitely no overall trend to abandon a region so painstakingly developed.'b'Lisa Granik also suggests that Long Island is not producing the styles of wine that are receiving critical and consumer acclaim. In fact, beyond the many accolades received by individual wineries every year, our region is generating significant positive media coverage across the country.'b'Regarding pricing, many of our wines sell for less than $20, and those that are priced higher to reflect more limited production have been found by critics to be of excellent value compared to the competition. Consumers seem to agree as many wineries recorded their highest sales ever in 2006.'b'Finally, the idea that our region should seek a foothold in Manhattan has been an objective from the beginning, resulting in many of our wines being offered in prominent restaurants and wine stores throughout the city.'b'Robert Palmer'b'President'b'Long Island Wine Council'b'Riverhead'b''b''b''b'\xe2\x80\xa2'b'To the Editor:'b'I am a resident of the North Fork of Long Island, an amateur oenophile and a consumer of our local wines who appreciates the uniqueness of the vintages that many of our local wineries produce.

Our vineyards are the agricultural jewels of the North Fork that not only provide a significant economic impact on the region, but also help to preserve its natural beauty and prevent the development that might otherwise occur. I sincerely hope that they will continue to thrive for generations to come.'b'Jerry Bilinski'b'Wading River'b''b''b'Having a Drink on the Way Home'b''b'To the Editor:'b'The concerns expressed by \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Running Dry on the M.T.A.'b',\xe2\x80\x9d a Jan. 7 editorial arguing that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority should not be selling alcoholic beverages, add up to unbridled moralism.'b'As a Long Island Rail Road passenger, I can verify that rush-hour (by and large \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional\xe2\x80\x9d) travelers who purchase a drink for their home commute are unlikely to disrupt fellow passengers. A far greater threat of disruption exists after Friday and Saturday night binges, when most of the alcohol is consumed far from M.T.A. premises and all platform vendors are shut down.'b'I would wager my innocent $2 Budweiser that the push for transit prohibition by the M.T.A. board member Mitch Pally will soon become a reality, in keeping with the maternalistic no-smoking, no-fatty-foods wave that has swept the city. But such a move would unwittingly target moderation while failing to address the truly raucous children of the night, whose decadence falls outside of the M.T.A.\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction anyway.'b'Chris Wood'b'Williston Park'b''b'\xe2\x80\xa2'b'To the Editor:'b'I am 10th-grade student. After reading your editorial about how the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North are selling alcohol to their passengers, I was completely shocked because I was not aware of this kind of event that has been taking place for many years now.'b'I think it is completely unnecessary to sell beer and other alcoholic drinks to passengers whether they are boarding the next train or just getting off the train. The train stations could sell something else rather then supplying people with beer for their ride home. As a rider of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, I would not appreciate having drunken people sitting next to me or in fact in the same car as me because it is sure to cause a commotion in some form or another.'b'Deborah Mui'b'The Bronx'b''b'ALBANY is infamous for its disdain for democracy. In fact, what\xe2\x80\x99s been going on for years in the  capital would be better called a triocracy because all important decisions that affect the third-largest state  in the country are made by three people: the governor, the Senate majority leader and the Assembly speaker.'b'To those of us who believe in democracy, this situation should be embarrassing and unacceptable. For example,  there are virtually no hearings in Albany on bills headed for passage, and  the public, like 210 of their 212 elected representatives, has little access to information about legislative decision-making and even less chance for meaningful input.'b'Formal dissent, too, is rare, as voting within each party in Albany is almost always unanimous. Practically no bill becomes law without the approval of both Sheldon Silver, speaker of the Assembly, and Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader, reflecting a subservience by lawmakers that has no peer in the United States Congress nor in many American statehouses.'b'New York\xe2\x80\x99s legislative committees are just as lifeless. Only bills blessed by the leaders are released to the floor for a vote \xe2\x80\x94 a vote whose outcome is almost always a foregone conclusion.'b'The reward for lawmakers\xe2\x80\x99 compliance includes party assistance and taxpayer-financed  pork barrel morsels for community organizations in election years. Those who play by the rules of the leadership also benefit by having their names appended from time to time to bills of importance. They receive committee assignments that can earn them as much as $40,000 on top of their $79,000 yearly salary, and their district lines are rigged in their favor for lifetime job security. Is it any wonder that while Democrats won big across the country this November, in Albany just one Republican seat in the state Senate went Democratic?'b'If little about the top-down decision-making structure in Albany has changed in recent decades, Gov. Eliot Spitzer, with a nearly 70 percent mandate from voters, has promised to create a more open executive and Legislature. We believe he means what he has proposed so far and wants to fashion a democratic arena where policies and budgets are debated in an atmosphere of transparency, and fingerprints of accountability are left behind when decisions are made.'b'The new governor should indeed start with an overhauled budget process that for the first time in years reveals the details of how public money is to be raised and spent, along with the creation of a general accounting office to provide oversight that is independent of the executive and legislative branches. He should demand a revitalized legislative committee system whose chairmen  and staffs will be chosen by their members, not by the house leaders, and who will be free to mark up bills and send them out to the floor for debate and amendment.'b'Mr. Spitzer also must make good on his avowal that he will end gerrymandering, which protects the party majorities and their entrenched leaders, and hand the task of redrawing district lines every decade to an impartial, nonpartisan, census-driven redistricting commission, as exists most prominently in Iowa.'b'Just as important, he should appoint a panel of distinguished New Yorkers to scrutinize and slash a symbol of unanswerable state government: the hundreds of public authorities, of which no one, including the state comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s office, seems to know exactly how many exist. The authorities have amassed a huge amount of debt they will not be able to repay without one day turning to a new generation of taxpayers for a bailout.'b'Forcing  change on Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno will be tough, even in a moment that seems unusually conducive to change. The top legislative leaders, who prefer to operate secretively and are unwilling to cede meaningful power to the other 210 legislators, are deeply invested in the tactics of defense and delay. Mr. Spitzer will require strong public backing and relentless persistence to hammer out at least the semblance of democratic rule in Albany. It won\xe2\x80\x99t be easy, but for the sake of democracy, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth a try.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cCalifornia Plan for Health Care Would Cover All\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 9):'b'Gov.

Alabama law requires people exposed to dangerous chemicals to wait until a \xe2\x80\x9cmanifest\xe2\x80\x9d injury develops. But when his leukemia developed years later, it was too late.

Gun makers and dealers, notoriously, persuaded Congress in 2005 to give them immunity when their guns are used to maim and kill.'b'Industries are also winning immunity at the state level, and attracting far less attention. Pharmaceutical companies pushed through a law in Michigan protecting them when their drugs injure or kill people, as long as the drugs were approved by the Food and Drug Administration. There is no reason F.D.A. approval, a deeply flawed process, should be a shield.'b'When corporations do end up in court, they have lowered the stakes substantially by undermining punitive damages, which have long been one of the main ways that society deters people from unreasonably putting others at risk. The United States Supreme Court struck a major blow against punitive damages a decade ago, ruling that it was unconstitutional for a jury to award $2 million in punitive damages against an auto dealer that knowingly sold a damaged, repainted BMW as new.'b'Lower federal court judges, many of whom have been screened by the Bush administration for pro-business sympathies, and state court judges, many of whose campaigns were bankrolled by big business, are eagerly joining in. So are state legislatures. Last month Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s legislature voted to cap punitive damages in many cases against paint companies \xe2\x80\x94 which have been accused of selling lead-based paint that causes retardation in children \xe2\x80\x94 at a paltry $5,000.'b'Perhaps the most insidious tactic for slamming the courthouse door on injured people is the stealth use of \xe2\x80\x9cpre-emption.\xe2\x80\x9d When federal and state laws conflict, the federal law pre-empts, or invalidates, the state law. The Bush administration is taking advantage of this principle by issuing weak regulations in a wide range of areas to wipe out stronger state-law protections. When people try to sue, they may find that their legal rights have been swept away. Among the areas the administration has focused on are automobile roof crushes and mattress flammability.'b'These incursions on the right to sue, taken together, are a serious assault on justice. In the most extreme cases, they may also be unconstitutional. Mr. Cline\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, Mr. Palmer, argued that preventing him from ever suing denied him his rights under the Alabama Constitution to seek a legal remedy for his injuries.'b'Mr. Palmer was encouraged when the Alabama Supreme Court reopened the case. He also saw it as a good sign when it scheduled oral arguments for a special public session on a law school campus, an indication it considered the case particularly significant. The arguments went well. \xe2\x80\x9cQuestions asked by several justices indicated they were troubled by the legal Catch-22,\xe2\x80\x9d The Birmingham News reported.'b'The court ruled this month. It affirmed the dismissal of Mr. Cline\xe2\x80\x99s case by a 5-to-4 vote. If Mr. Cline wanted to challenge the unfairness of the rules, it said, he would have to take it up with the State Legislature \xe2\x80\x94 a body every bit as pro-business as the Alabama Supreme Court.'b'Mr. Palmer intends to take the case to the United States Supreme Court. In the meantime, Mr. Cline can take some small comfort in the close vote. Four Alabama justices, at least, would not accept a legal system that told people like him that \xe2\x80\x9cno matter when\xe2\x80\x9d they \xe2\x80\x9cfile the action, it is either too soon or too late.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Many Connecticut residents experienced the annoying necessity this past Christmas Eve and New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve of having to act like bootleggers in order to serve alcohol at parties. Those who had not planned ahead were forced to drive to border states to purchase wine, beer and other spirits. The reason? This year, both days, normally among the strongest for liquor sales, fell on Sundays, when it is illegal to sell alcohol in Connecticut.'b'There are many worse fates, of course, but the tyranny of the calendar combined with the state\xe2\x80\x99s enduring Sunday closing law forced people to scramble to out-of-state stores. Connecticut clings to the Puritan tradition of a Sunday ban, in part because many mom-and-pop establishments, which like to stay closed on Sunday, have fought to keep it.'b'But in the past few years alone a dozen states have done away with the Sunday booze ban. Even Massachusetts, which started the practice nearly 400 years ago, has ditched the tradition. States like Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New York, which border Connecticut, are now cashing in on the Nutmeg State\xe2\x80\x99s stubborn attachment to an inconvenient and inessential law.'b'One consolation is that this year, Christmas Eve and New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve are on Mondays, and they will not fall again on Sundays until 2017, by which time the legislature may have come to its senses.'b'It was surreal how disconnected President Bush was the other night, both from Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s horrifying reality and America\xe2\x80\x99s anguish over this unnecessary, mismanaged and now unwinnable war. Indeed, most Americans seem far ahead of the president. They understand that what the country urgently needs is for Mr. Bush to chart a way out of Iraq that also limits the chaos that will be left behind.'b'The president\xe2\x80\x99s disconnect goes far to explain the harshly critical reaction of Congress and the public to his plan to further bleed America\xe2\x80\x99s overstretched forces by sending some 20,000 additional troops in an attempt to impose peace on Baghdad\xe2\x80\x99s vengeful streets. He proposes to do that without any enforceable commitments from the Iraqi government that it will take the necessary political steps that are the only hope for tamping down a spiraling civil war.'b'There are no really satisfying answers in Iraq, since all of the remaining options are bad. Still, some are notably worse than others, and Mr. Bush has come up with possibly the worst. He would mortgage thousands more American lives and what remains of Washington\xe2\x80\x99s credibility in the region to a destructively sectarian Shiite government that he seems unwilling or unable to influence or restrain.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2'b'Unlike Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s views on the American military presence in Iraq, our views have evolved as the evident realities on the ground have changed. At the outset, although we opposed Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s invasion, we hoped the United States military could provide enough security to allow an elected government to build the foundations of national unity and eventual democracy.'b'As it became increasingly clear that Iraqi political leaders had other, less noble intentions, we still hoped that a substantial American military presence could be used to shield innocent civilians from the growing violence, train reliable and professional Iraqi security forces to take over that task, and exert leverage on Iraqi leaders to follow a less divisive and destructive course.'b'Now, with Mr. Bush unwilling or unable to persuade Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki to take the minimum steps necessary to justify any deeper American commitment, we recognize that even that has become unrealistic. Mr. Maliki gave the latest White House plan an even chillier reception than it received in the United States Congress, boycotting a Thursday news conference in Baghdad announcing it. He apparently would have preferred to see American forces sent to fight Sunni insurgents in western Anbar Province, leaving Baghdad as a free-fire zone for his Shiite militia partners.'b'But even knowing all that, America cannot simply wash its hands of Iraq and go home. The region\xe2\x80\x99s problems, many of them made worse by this war, are unavoidably America\xe2\x80\x99s problems as well. For starters, Iraq is in imminent danger of violently breaking apart, driving millions of refugees across its borders \xe2\x80\x94 who will bring with them their ethnic grievances, and in some cases their weapons \xe2\x80\x94 and potentially unleashing a chain reaction of regional conflicts that could draw in Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran and perhaps others as well.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2'b'Whatever else happens, Iran has already become more formidable and dangerous. Where it once had a hostile Saddam Hussein on its western border, it now has a friendly Shiite fundamentalist government. Its other longtime enemy, the United States, has had its diplomatic and military clout  severely diminished by this war.'b'The expanding power of a revolutionary, Shiite Iran is profoundly unsettling to the conservative Sunni-led governments in most of the Arab Middle East, which have been America\xe2\x80\x99s traditional allies in the region. If the United States is to recoup any of its standing and influence there, it will have to find a way to contain the chaos in Iraq. And it will have to do a lot more to address other concerns of these governments and their people, starting with a genuine and sustained effort to mediate a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.'b'If Mr. Bush does persist in sending more American troops to Baghdad, despite Congress\xe2\x80\x99s amply justified opposition, he will have to establish clear lines of command that assure that those troops can enter the strongholds of the Shiite militias responsible for much of the violence without militia leaders\xe2\x80\x99 being tipped off by allies in the Iraqi government.'b'And so long as any American troops remain in Iraq, Mr. Bush must put serious pressure on Mr. Maliki to support the troops\xe2\x80\x99 efforts with a genuine program of national reconciliation. That must include, at a minimum, ridding the police and other security services of killers, torturers and criminals and disarming all sectarian militias.'b'The government must also assure that Iraqi oil revenues are fairly shared out among the entire Iraqi population. And it must move quickly to offer an amnesty to Sunni insurgents willing to put down their weapons, and narrow the legal restrictions on former Baath Party members so that Sunni professionals can once again fully participate in Iraqi national life.'b'These benchmarks should be accompanied by fixed timelines. And they must be accompanied with a clear message that the United States is prepared to withdraw its troops if the Iraqis continue to refuse to take responsibility for their own future. Mr. Bush and other American officials need to make clear that as much as the United States will suffer from a complete collapse in Iraq, Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s leaders will suffer far worse from the loss of their American protectors.'b'Mr. Bush should reinforce that message by convening a conference of all of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors to discuss how they can help stabilize Iraq \xe2\x80\x94 and what they can do to contain the wider chaos should it come. With nearly two million Iraqis already seeking refuge, mainly in Syria and Jordan, it is far past time for American officials to begin their own planning and relief efforts.'b'If Mr. Bush refuses to deliver this ultimatum to Mr. Maliki, Congress will have to do so in his stead. That\xe2\x80\x99s not the usual division of labor between the executive and legislative branches, but it is one that Mr. Bush has made necessary by his refusal to face realities. The potential consequences of his failed leadership are so serious that neither the new Democratic majorities in Congress, nor the public at large, can afford the luxury of merely criticizing from the sidelines.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2'b'So far, Congress is off to an encouraging start, holding substantive oversight hearings and asking probing questions of administration officials for the first time in too many years. Similarly encouraging has been the bipartisan character of this reinvigorated oversight. The Congress should continue asking hard questions. And it must insist on real answers before acting on any new requests for money to support Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s plans to send more troops to Baghdad. Congress has the authority to attach conditions to that money, imposing benchmarks and timetables on Mr. Bush, who then would be forced to impose them on the Iraqi government.'b'One immediate step could be a set of bipartisan resolutions spelling out the broad policy directions Congress expects the president to pursue on Iraq. That would send a useful message to the American people that lawmakers are listening to their concerns, if Mr. Bush is not, and also to Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s leaders.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s now up to Congress to force the president to live up to his constitutional responsibilities and rescue this country from the consequences of one of its worst strategic blunders in modern times.'b'History will surely blame Mr. Bush for leading America into Iraq, but it will blame Congress if it does not act to push him onto a more realistic path.'b'Connecticut\xe2\x80\x99s prison population, at 19,000, is inching up toward record levels, reversing a trend of slight reductions over the last two years. Incarcerating people in overcrowded facilities is inhumane and always expensive: it costs $29,500 a year to imprison each person. This problem did not develop overnight. The prison population rose steadily from the late 1980s until 2003. And the recent increase is not surprising, especially in light of last year\xe2\x80\x99s rising crime rate. But the important thing to remember is that prison is not an answer to crime; bigger prison populations reflect society\xe2\x80\x99s failure to find answers.'b'The state needs to walk a difficult tightrope: reducing the number of inmates in prison while keeping dangerous offenders off the streets. The Department of Correction is trying to make things better, and in time its actions will bear fruit. But ultimately the problem is bigger than any one agency can cope with.'b'The most effective intervention takes place years before a person enters the legal system. That is clear from two statistics: Eighty five percent of those Connecticut inmates have substance abuse problems at the time of arrest; a staggering three-quarters are high school dropouts. In response, the Department of Correction gives addiction treatment to the vast majority of inmates and gives out more high school equivalency diplomas than any other institution in Connecticut.'b'But more should be done before a person enters prison. Making preschool programs widely available for the poor, as Gov. M. Jodi Rell has proposed, would have the long-term effect of increasing employment and reducing the incidence of incarceration years later. Improving schools in Connecticut\xe2\x80\x99s cities would have much the same salubrious effect.'b'There are also a range of shorter-term measures that could relieve prison overcrowding. Of the more than 19,000 people behind bars, about one-quarter \xe2\x80\x94 or nearly 5,000 inmates \xe2\x80\x94 are awaiting trial, a larger proportion than usual. Of these, according to Representative Michael Lawlor, the Democratic co-chairman of the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s Judiciary Committee, about 1,000 are indigent and pose little threat to the public, yet they are being held because they cannot post bond for amounts as low as $500 or $1,000. It makes no sense to keep them incarcerated; the taxpayers spend more money in less than two weeks to feed and house them than the bail necessary to obtain their release.'b'Then there are the more than 400 inmates who are teenagers \xe2\x80\x94 14- to 17-year-olds who, because of their crimes and Connecticut\xe2\x80\x99s misguided \xe2\x80\x9cget tough\xe2\x80\x9d philosophy for youngsters, are serving time in prison along with adults. Connecticut is one of the few states to mix the two age groups for serious crimes. Housing young people with career criminals is bad public policy. Continuing the status quo when prisons are overcrowded makes even less sense. The current conditions add urgency to the need to house young offenders in separate facilities, and not treat them as adults.'b'Connecticut prisons may be overcrowded, but building more of them is the last thing we need. Thoughtful solutions exist for overcrowding. But the best solutions keep people from being sent to prison in the first place.'b'Fiscal discipline seems a quaint idea when money is pouring into the city treasury like beer at a Super Bowl party. But the Independent Budget Office knew what it was doing when it warned that lawmakers eager to spend the city\xe2\x80\x99s budget surplus could be looking at tax increases and spending cuts down the road unless they show restraint.'b'Fighting the urge to spend will be a real and pivotal test for the city\xe2\x80\x99s elected officials. This is a moment when New York needs to hold itself up as a model of fiscal prudence. And if it does,  it can argue that it  is worthy of being given more responsibility over its own financial house, something that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.'b'The extra $700 million this year, on top of a $3.5 billion surplus last year, should put the city on good financial footing until 2009. After that, though, no one should assume that the real-estate boom and the Wall Street bulls will continue to buoy the economy. Mr. Bloomberg has rightly ended the myopia of budgets past, extending forward planning to four years, controlling spending where he could and lobbying the state where he could not.'b'Even so, there could still be red ink ahead. And should any city lawmaker be so dazzled by present-day surpluses as to overlook that danger, there are plenty of independent analysts with long memories ready to sound the alarm. The budget office has served this function for 10 years, analyzing budgets and spending on everything from housing to sports stadiums, and raising questions that officials would rather duck. And then there is the Financial Control Board, which came into being three decades ago, when the city verged on bankruptcy.'b'The board mostly serves as a monitor now, no longer an overlord, and the word \xe2\x80\x9cEmergency\xe2\x80\x9d was removed from its title, but it continues to do good work. Because of inept tinkering in Albany with the board\xe2\x80\x99s mandate, it could go out of business. But the mayor supports it and it deserves to survive.'b'Mr. Bloomberg and Christine Quinn, the Speaker of the City Council, should seize the opportunity to trumpet the city\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal soundness and use it to win more freedom from Albany. It\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous that City Hall should have to ask state legislators\xe2\x80\x99 permission on almost anything of consequence \xe2\x80\x94 on most matters involving taxation, for instance, and even for the right to investigate Medicaid fraud.'b'If the city shows self control, it should be rewarded with more control.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cSan Franciscans Hurl Their Rage at Parking Patrol\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 6):'b'I take issue with the notion that San Francisco isn\xe2\x80\x99t dense enough to support an effective public transportation system.'b'The success of such a system depends somewhat on ridership: the more people use public transportation, the more money, routes and runs there are for buses and trains.'b'Higher prices at meters would deter those looking for parking downtown and encourage them to take public transit.

Last month in Florida, the head of the state\xe2\x80\x99s social services department  resigned abruptly after having been fined $80,000 and is facing criminal contempt charges for failing to transfer severely mentally ill jail inmates to state hospitals.'b'Ten days ago, the Supreme Court agreed to determine when mentally ill death row inmates should be considered so  deranged that their execution would be constitutionally impermissible. The case involves a 48-year-old Navy veteran who is a diagnosed schizophrenic. In the decade leading up to the crime he was hospitalized 14 times for severe mental illness.'b'According to a study released by the Justice Department in September, 56 percent of jail inmates in state prisons and 64 percent of inmates across the country reported mental health problems within the past year.'b'Though troubling, none of this should come as a surprise. Over the past 40 years, the United States dismantled a colossal mental health complex and rebuilt \xe2\x80\x94 bed by bed \xe2\x80\x94 an enormous prison. During the 20th century we exhibited a schizophrenic relationship to deviance.'b'After more than 50 years of stability, federal and state prison populations skyrocketed  from under 200,000 persons in 1970 to more than 1.3 million in 2002. That year, our imprisonment rate rose above 600 inmates per 100,000 adults. With the inclusion of an additional 700,000  inmates in jail, we now incarcerate more than two  million people \xe2\x80\x94 resulting in the highest incarceration number and rate in the world, five times that of Britain and 12 times that of Japan.'b'What few people realize, though, is that in the 1940s and \xe2\x80\x9950s we institutionalized people at even higher rates \xe2\x80\x94 only it was in mental hospitals and asylums. Simply put, when the data on state and county mental hospitalization rates are combined with the data on prison rates for 1928 through 2000, the imprisonment revolution of the late 20th century barely reaches the level we experienced at mid-century. Our current culture of control is by no means new.'b'The graph on the left \xe2\x80\x94 based on statistics from the federal Census Bureau, Department of Health and Human Services and Bureau of Justice Statistics \xe2\x80\x94 shows the aggregate rate of institutionalization per 100,000 adults in the United States from 1928 to 2000, as well as the disaggregated trend lines for mental hospitalization on the one hand and state and federal prisons on the other.'b'The numbers include only state and county mental hospitals. There were many more kinds of mental institutions at mid-century, ones for \xe2\x80\x9cmental defectives and epileptics\xe2\x80\x9d and the mentally retarded, psychiatric wards in veterans  hospitals, as well as \xe2\x80\x9cpsychopathic\xe2\x80\x9d and private mental hospitals. If we include residents of those facilities, from  1935 to  1963 the United States consistently institutionalized at rates well above 700 per 100,000 adults \xe2\x80\x94 with highs of 778 in 1939 and 786 in 1955. It should be clear why there is such a large proportion of mentally ill persons in our prisons: individuals who used to be tracked for mental health treatment are now getting a one-way ticket to jail.'b'Of course, there are important demographic differences between the two populations. In 1937, women represented 48 percent of residents in state mental hospitals. In contrast, new prison admissions have consistently been 95 percent male. Also, the mental health patients from the 1930s to the 1960s were older and whiter than  prison inmates of the 1990s.'b'But the graph poses a number of troubling questions: Why did we diagnose deviance in such radically different ways over the course of the 20th century? Do we need to be imprisoning at such high rates, or were we right, 50 years ago, to hospitalize instead? Why were so many women hospitalized? Why have they been replaced by young black men? Have both prisons and mental hospitals included large numbers of unnecessarily incarcerated individuals?'b'Whatever the answers, the pendulum has swung too far \xe2\x80\x94 possibly off its hinges.'b'It would be na\xc3\xafve, today, to address any of these questions without also considering the impact of imprisonment on crime. One of the most reliable studies estimates that the increased prison population over the 1990s accounted for about a third of the overall drop in crime that decade.'b'However, prisons are not the only institutions that seem to have this effect. In a recent study, I demonstrated that the rate of institutionalization \xe2\x80\x94 including mental hospitals \xe2\x80\x94 was a far better predictor of serious violent crime from 1926 to 2000 than just prison populations. The data reveal a robust negative relationship between overall institutionalization (prisons and asylums) and homicide. Preliminary findings based on state-level panel data confirm these results.'b'The effect on crime may not depend on whether the institution is a mental hospital or a prison. Even from a crime-fighting perspective, then, it is time to rethink our prison and mental health policies. A lot more work must be done before proposing answers to those troubling questions. But the first step is to realize that we have been wildly erratic in our approach to deviance, mental health and the prison.'b'With corporations posting record profits amid nonstop accounting scandals, one would assume that the Internal Revenue Service is looking long and hard at big companies\xe2\x80\x99  tax returns. Unfortunately, the opposite is true.'b'Since 2003, I.R.S policy has called for spending less time on any one large corporate audit, with the purported aim of auditing more big businesses. But as The Times\xe2\x80\x99s David Cay Johnston reported last week, I.R.S. auditors are being pushed by the agency\xe2\x80\x99s top officials to prematurely close audits of large corporations with agreements that they  pay only  a fraction of the additional taxes that could be collected. Dozens of auditors said they were instructed to limit their examinations to issues that the I.R.S. and the  companies agreed to in advance, even if suspicious deductions or other questionable tax tactics emerged during the audit.'b'Recently released I.R.S statistics \xe2\x80\x94 which the agency is required to disclose, but which it had long withheld \xe2\x80\x94 underscore Mr. Johnston\xe2\x80\x99s report. In 2006, the time devoted to each large-company audit was nearly 21 percent below what it was in 2002. From 2003 through 2005, an ever larger share of companies was audited; but in 2006, the share declined from a high of 44 percent in 2005, to 34 percent, about where it was in 2002.'b'The I.R.S. says its light-touch approach is  successful because auditors are finding much more tax owed for each hour they work than they did in 2002. But auditors interviewed by Mr. Johnston dispute that claim. They say that abusive and illegal tax shelters have become so pervasive that it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to find additional taxes due. So the overall figure rises, even though companies are being allowed to pay far less than they owe. Economists and tax experts who have looked at the I.R.S. statistics have also raised the possibility that an increase in corporate noncompliance is behind the increased tax-due amounts, not more effective auditing.'b'Congress must ensure that the agency  justifies its policy or changes it.'b'The Bush administration has appointed an extreme political partisan as the new United States  attorney for Arkansas. Normally, the Senate would have vetted him, and quite possibly blocked his appointment.

One way to ensure that is to require them to submit to questions from the Senate, and face a confirmation vote.'b'Senators Feinstein, Leahy and Pryor have a bill to change the method for selecting interim United States  attorneys back to what it once was: the federal district court in the jurisdiction would make the appointment. Congress should pass that bill, and take a hard look at how vacancies are being filled. There might not be fire where the senators see  smoke.

There have been the bromides (we\xe2\x80\x99re making \xe2\x80\x9cgood progress\xe2\x80\x9d); the promises (we have a \xe2\x80\x9cstrategy for victory\xe2\x80\x9d); and, as always, attacks on the media for not reporting the good news from Iraq.'b'Who you gonna believe, the president or your lying eyes?'b'Now Mr. Bush has grudgingly sort- of admitted that things aren\xe2\x80\x99t going well \xe2\x80\x94 but he says his \xe2\x80\x9cnew way forward\xe2\x80\x9d will fix everything.'b'So it\xe2\x80\x99s still the Texas strategy: the war\xe2\x80\x99s architects are trying to keep their failed venture going as long as possible.'b'The Hail Mary aspect \xe2\x80\x94 the off chance that somehow, things really will turn out all right \xe2\x80\x94 is the least of their motivations. The real intent is a form of looting. I\xe2\x80\x99m not  talking mainly about old-fashioned war profiteering, although there is no question that profiteering is taking place on an epic scale. No, I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that the hawks want to keep this war going because it\xe2\x80\x99s to their personal and political benefit.'b'True, Mr. Bush can\xe2\x80\x99t win another election with phony claims of success in Iraq, the way he did in 2004. But escalation buys him another year or two to claim that we\xe2\x80\x99re making progress \xe2\x80\x94 and it gives him another chance to prove that he\xe2\x80\x99s the Decider, beyond accountability.'b'And as for pundits who promoted the war and are now trying to sell the surge: for a little while longer they can be Very Important People who have the president\xe2\x80\x99s ear.'b'Meanwhile, the nation pays the price. The heaviest burden \xe2\x80\x94 in death, shattered bodies, broken families and ruined careers \xe2\x80\x94 falls on those who serve. To find the personnel for the Bush escalation, the Pentagon must lengthen deployments in Iraq and shorten training time at home.'b'And the back-door draft has become a life sentence: there is no limit on the cumulative amount of time citizen-soldiers can be required to serve on active duty. Mama, don\xe2\x80\x99t let your children grow up to be reservists.'b'The rest of us will pay a financial price for the hundreds of billions squandered in Iraq and, more important, a price in reduced security.'b'Escalation won\xe2\x80\x99t bring victory in Iraq, but it might bring defeat in Afghanistan, which the administration will continue to neglect. And it has pushed the military to the breaking point.'b'Mr. Bush calls his critics \xe2\x80\x9cirresponsible,\xe2\x80\x9d saying that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have an alternative to his strategy. But they do: setting a timetable for withdrawal, so that we can cut our losses, and trying to save what can be saved. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t a strategy for victory because that\xe2\x80\x99s no longer an option. It\xe2\x80\x99s a strategy for acknowledging reality.'b'The lesson of the savings and loan scandal was that when a bank has failed, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let the owner string you along with promises \xe2\x80\x94 you should shut the thing down. We should do the same with Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s failed war.'b'The Bush administration is eager to start work on a new nuclear warhead with all sorts of admirable qualities: sturdy, reliable and secure from terrorists. To sweeten the deal,  officials say that if they can replace the current arsenal with Reliable Replacement Warheads (what could sound more comforting?), they probably won\xe2\x80\x99t have to keep so many extra warheads to hedge against technical failure. If you\xe2\x80\x99re still not sold, the warhead comes with something of a guarantee  \xe2\x80\x94 that scientists can build the new bombs without ever testing them.'b'Let the buyer beware. While the program has gotten very little attention here, it is a public-relations disaster in the making overseas. Suspicions that the United States is actually trying to build up its nuclear capabilities are  undercutting Washington\xe2\x80\x99s arguments for restraining the nuclear appetites of Iran and North Korea.'b'Then there\xe2\x80\x99s the tens of billions it is likely to cost. And the most important question: Nearly two decades after the country stopped building nuclear weapons, does it really need a new one? The answer, emphatically, is no. This is a make-work program championed by the weapons laboratories and belatedly by the Pentagon, which hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to get Congress to pay for its other nuclear fantasies.'b'The Rumsfeld team\xe2\x80\x99s first choice was for a nuclear \xe2\x80\x9cbunker buster\xe2\x80\x9d to go after deeply buried targets. The Pentagon got concerned about \xe2\x80\x9caging\xe2\x80\x9d warheads only after it was clear that even the Republican-led Congress, or at least one intrepid House subcommittee chairman, considered the bunker buster too Strangelovian to finance.'b'One crucial argument for the new program took a major hit in November when the Jason \xe2\x80\x94 a prestigious panel of scientists that advises the government on weapons \xe2\x80\x94 reported that most of the plutonium triggers in the current arsenal can be expected to last for 100 years. Since the oldest weapons are less than 50  years old, supporters of the new warhead have fallen back on warnings that other bomb components are also aging, and that the nuclear labs need the work to attract and train the best scientists. But the labs are already spending billions on studying and preserving the current arsenal.'b'Then there\xe2\x80\x99s that guarantee that there will be no need for testing \xe2\x80\x94 one of the few arms-control taboos President Bush hasn\xe2\x80\x99t  broken yet. While experts debate whether the labs can really build a weapon without testing it, the more important question is whether any president would stake America\xe2\x80\x99s security on an untested arsenal.'b'America would be much safer if the president focused on reducing the number of old nuclear weapons still deployed by the United States and the other nuclear powers. The new Congress should stop this program before any more dollars are wasted, or  more damage is done to America\xe2\x80\x99s credibility.'b'New Orleans'b'I was surprised recently by a sudden shift in the tone of a veteran cabdriver, Stanley Taylor, who had been kind enough to take me on a nearly four-hour tour of the flood-wrecked regions of the city.'b'For most of the afternoon, Mr. Taylor had been wonderfully informative and polite, and his comments had been filled with sympathy for those who had lost so much to Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath.'b'But as we headed back to my hotel, and darkness began to fall over the eerily still neighborhoods, his tone became unmistakably bitter. We had been talking casually about the thousands of extremely poor evacuees, most of them black, who were still stranded outside  New Orleans, some of them scattered to the far reaches of the United States.'b'Mr. Taylor, who is black, snapped that maybe it would be better if some of them didn\xe2\x80\x99t come back. \xe2\x80\x9cThe poor people that\xe2\x80\x99s gone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have to stay gone. That\xe2\x80\x99s where all the crime was coming from, see? Folks here want people to come back, but they want people with money to come back. The criminals? Shame on \xe2\x80\x99em. Sorry for \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'During the immediate post-Katrina period, there were essentially two visions of a resurgent New Orleans. One, widely decried as racist, saw the new, improved New Orleans as smaller, whiter and more prosperous.'b'This was openly advocated. Just a few days after the storm,  a wealthy member of the city\xe2\x80\x99s power elite, James Reiss, told The Wall Street Journal: \xe2\x80\x9cThose who want to see this city rebuilt want to see it done in a completely different way: demographically, geographically and politically.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Reiss, who is white and served in Mayor C. Ray Nagin\xe2\x80\x99s administration as chairman of the Regional Transit Authority (he has since left the government), said that he and many of his colleagues would leave town if New Orleans did not become a city with better services and fewer poor people.'b'An alternative (and more widely desired) model of the city coincided with the approach that President Bush seemed to be taking when he made his dramatic appearance in floodlit Jackson Square in mid-September 2005. Mr. Bush promised not just to help rebuild New Orleans, but to confront the long-simmering problems of race and poverty with \xe2\x80\x9cbold action.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Supporters of this approach envisioned an effort that would bring desperately needed assistance to the hurricane victims, helping to get them housed and back on their feet, while at the same time constructively engaging the contentious issues that have kept America\xe2\x80\x99s blacks and whites in a state of perpetual hostility, and much of the poor in an all-but-permanent morass of ignorance and deprivation.'b'What is actually happening is worse than anyone had imagined.'b'New Orleans is a mess. It was brought to its knees by Katrina, and is being kept there by a toxic combination of federal neglect and colossal, mind-numbing ineptitude at the local level.'b'The police department here is a sour joke, and crime is out of control. More than 16 months after the storm, children roam the streets with impunity during school hours. Debris still covers much of the city. Doctors, hospitals and mental-health facilities are in woefully short supply. Thousands of residents are still living in trailers, and many thousands more are stuck more or less permanently out of town.'b'The result is that blacks and whites, feeling unsafe physically and frightened by the long-term prospect of dwindling opportunities, are eyeing the exits.'b'Lt. Gov.  Mitch Landrieu, who lost the mayoral race last May to Mr. Nagin, offered a grim assessment. While the ethnic breakdown may remain roughly the same, he said, the city is on its way to becoming \xe2\x80\x9csmaller, poorer and worse than it was before.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Class, at the moment, is trumping race, which is how Mr. Reiss and Mr. Taylor, the cabdriver, came unwittingly to similar stereotyped conclusions. Unless the foundations of a livable city can be put in place \xe2\x80\x94 and they are not being put in place now \xe2\x80\x94 those with the ability to leave will do so. The poor, neglected as always, will be left behind.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe same thing is moving African-Americans as is moving whites,\xe2\x80\x9d  Mr. Landrieu said. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone is asking:  \xe2\x80\x98Is it safe? What\xe2\x80\x99s the school situation? Can my kids play outside? What does the future hold for them?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'b'Without a creative new plan and energetic new leadership, New Orleans will be unable to save itself. Right now it\xe2\x80\x99s a city sinking to ever more tragic depths.'b'SUNDAY, Jan. 7. Newark International Airport.'b'I disembark at Gate C85, with my two daughters, from Continental Flight 488 at 5:55 a.m. We\xe2\x80\x99ve just arrived from Puerto Rico, our skin tight with sunburn and salt. I navigate the terminal at the minimal level of consciousness required to find the baggage claim, collect our suitcases, and get into the taxi line.'b'Tempted to buy coffee from the kiosk between Baggage Carousels 2 and 3, I discover I don\xe2\x80\x99t have my wallet. I must have left it on or around my seat, 23B, where I paused to rifle through my carry-on to be sure I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t leaving any of my younger daughter\xe2\x80\x99s  toys or games behind.'b'Jolted by adrenaline, I instruct my daughters, ages 16 and 6, to remain at the baggage claim while I try to retrieve my wallet. Carrying only my passport, I run upstairs to find someone who can issue me a gate pass allowing my return through security to Concourse C.'b'Impressing the validity of my request on one distracted airline employee after another takes a discouragingly long time. I am referred to and from and back again to the agent at Desk 72. By the time I pass through the gantlet of uniformed security personnel busy separating travelers from their toothpaste and emollients, I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost 30 minutes, more than long enough for a cleaning crew to straighten, vacuum and de-wallet the airplane. I run, my shoes in one hand, passport in the other, to Gate C85, at the end of the abandoned concourse. Gates 85, 84, 83 \xe2\x80\x94 all gates in sight \xe2\x80\x94 are bereft of both airline and airport personnel, but my plane\xe2\x80\x99s still there; I can see it through the window.'b'I stand at the closed metal door that separates Gate 85 from its jetway. 'b'Hello'b', I call, idiotically, and I knock, as loudly as possible, using the heel of  my shoe. Surprisingly, when I turn the handle of the door to the jetway, I find it unlocked. Unsurprisingly, when I push it open, an alarm goes off. I stand there, holding the handle, waiting for someone official to come, expecting to be chastised and confident that, as I am holding a valid United States passport and making no attempt to flee, I can explain my predicament.'b'But no one answers the alarm, which is shatteringly loud and still ringing. The handful of travelers in the waiting area, rumpled middle-aged men, watch without expression as I prop the door open with my little black shoe \xe2\x80\x94 in case it\xe2\x80\x99s locked from the other side \xe2\x80\x94 and disappear down the jetway toward the plane. Am I a federal criminal now? Does anyone care?'b'The airplane\xe2\x80\x99s front hatch is open, and I enter, disappointed to see that each seat already holds a tidy white pillow and plastic-wrapped blanket. The cleaning crew has come and gone. I search under and around Seat 23B. My wallet is nowhere to be found. Back at the gate, my little black shoe still holds the door open, the alarm still rings, and the rumpled middle-aged men in the waiting area continue to read their Sunday papers. I retrieve my shoe; the door closes; the alarm stops.'b''b'You what!'b' says the woman at Continental\xe2\x80\x99s customer service desk after I\xe2\x80\x99ve told her what I\xe2\x80\x99ve just done. 'b'You can\xe2\x80\x99t, you cannot, do tha'b''b't. You cannot.'b' I know, I tell her, but my wallet is missing, I\xe2\x80\x99ve left my children at the baggage claim, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no one at Gate 85 or any of the adjacent gates. Anyway, I say, I waited for security but no one came.'b''b'It\xe2\x80\x99s your own fault you lost your wallet'b', she says when I ask her to contact the cleaning crew. She gives me a sharp look I interpret as her judgment that violators of federal airline security regulations deserve no special courtesies.'b'Back at the baggage claim area, I file a lost item report, collect my children and  our luggage, and use my cellphone to wake my husband. Does he have enough cash to pay our cab fare from Newark  to Brooklyn? I\xe2\x80\x99ll explain when we get home, I tell him.'b'When I do, he shakes his head. 'b'Let me get this straight,'b' he says. 'b'Unauthorized, you open the gate door to the airplane. You set off a very loud security alarm. You wait a few minutes, and then take it upon yourself to enter the empty aircraft. You spend some time moving around its interior. No one sees you there. You leave of your own accord. You exit the way you came and you stop the alarm from ringing. And you confessed this, chapter and verse, to airline personnel and nothing happened?'b''b'Yes, I say. Exactly so.'b'The Senate\xe2\x80\x99s promising start in reforming its ethical shortcomings is showing signs of slippage. Senators ducked a worthy amendment that would bar members from putting family members on campaign payrolls, or see kin become lobbyists. The proposal was ruled unrelated to the debate over lobbyist and ethics reforms, which is hardly the case.'b'Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, insisted that there\xe2\x80\x99s no such problem in the Senate. Critics instantly noted that her fellow Californian, Senator Barbara Boxer,  paid $130,000  from her campaign funds to her son\xe2\x80\x99s political consultant firm. In the House, the campaign kitty of Representative John Doolittle, Republican of California, paid $200,000 to his  wife as a designated campaign consultant working at home.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99s reputation cannot afford more such embarrassments.'b'As the Senate debate continues, there are   key proposals that will test how real all the talk is about reform. Some lawmakers are already trying to water down  the proposal of the majority leader,   Harry Reid, which would  stop senators from accepting the nearly free use of corporate jets. Opponents on both sides of the aisle  are also intent on blocking a measure from Senators Barack Obama and Russell Feingold, which  would force lobbyists to disclose the vast campaign funds they routinely raise from corporate donors eager to grease access to lawmakers. The money would still flow, but special-interest bagmen would have to list the take on  public record.'b'Equally vital is the proposal to make lobbyists and their employers regularly disclose their \xe2\x80\x9cearmarking\xe2\x80\x9d rounds, where lawmakers are induced to pepper money bills with small fortunes in favors without debate or public notice. Lobbyists would have to list the specific earmark they sought, their client and the lawmakers they approached.'b'Another important measure would force disclosure of who is paying  for media campaigns in the name of fake grass-roots politicking. Such shell games could still go on as free speech, but the public could find out who\xe2\x80\x99s paying the bill. These measures give senators a much-needed opportunity to prove they are on the side of the voter, not the lobbyist.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cAs Obesity Fight Hits Cafeteria, Many Fear a Note From School\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 8):'b'The simple fact is that most parents of overweight children do not want to be told that their child is overweight.'b'While it is assumed that this important information is explained to parents by their pediatrician, this rarely takes place.

It also removes the role of parents, who for generations have helped boost their children up the ladder to the slide, mediate sandbox disputes and watch as they embark on flights of physical self-discovery.'b'Hillary Kessler-Godin 'b'\nTeaneck, N.J., Jan. 10, 2007'b''b'\xe2\x80\xa2'b'To the Editor:'b'Hooray!

Barrie financed the construction of the original playground a century ago), it features a huge wooden pirate ship, teepees, a fortress, swings and an elaborate climbing structure.'b'Even our 8-year-old, who is bored stiff by the hyper-safety-conscious (and hence unchallenging) playgrounds near our home on Riverside Drive, was enraptured and created an elaborate fantasy based on the provocative equipment.'b'Forget the trained \xe2\x80\x9cplay workers\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 what children need is varied, original playground design, not the standard assembly-line structures found in most New York City playgrounds.'b'Linda Kahn 'b'\nNew York, Jan. 10, 2007'b''b'\xe2\x80\xa2'b'To the Editor:'b'While it sounds like a bold and exciting experiment for the children who will play in the new setting, what about making sure New York City has lovely, clean and safe playgrounds in all our neighborhoods first?'b'Then, start putting the money into new and innovative places for our children to enjoy themselves.'b'Beth Rosen 'b'\nNew York, Jan. 10, 2007'b''b'\xe2\x80\xa2'b'To the Editor:'b'As a playground safety consultant who, in the 1970s, petitioned for and participated in the development of safety guidelines for playgrounds under the aegis of the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission,  I think it\xe2\x80\x99s evident from the current \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d proposal to install nets, water play and sandboxes in a New York City playground that those who don\xe2\x80\x99t learn from history are doomed to repeat it.'b'What might be feasible in a controlled area with  round-the-clock maintenance is simply not practical in an urban play space: sandboxes attract animals, which contaminate them, nets are extremely difficult to maintain and are easy targets of vandalism, and water play carries the constant risk of tragedy for toddlers, who can drown in an inch of water.'b'Although the use of play leaders is an idea that harks back to the late 19th century, reviving such a program would require careful screening of those put in charge of young children, and as such would bring its own safety concerns.'b'Theodora Briggs Sweeney'b'\nHorsham, Pa., Jan. 11, 2007'b''b'\xe2\x80\xa2'b'To the Editor:'b'I urge the city park planners not to stop maintaining the city\xe2\x80\x99s older-style playgrounds.'b'The reason: Not all children need cooperative play during an afternoon jaunt to the playground. Some just want to be alone.'b'Planners shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forget what children\xe2\x80\x99s days are like these days. In the classroom, they sit in open circles or small groups designed to foster teamwork. Young children go to playgroups where they work on sharing and developing \xe2\x80\x9csocial skills,\xe2\x80\x9d and children of all ages often go to several extracurricular classes a week, where they are told what to do by their teachers and coaches.'b'I love to go out for a jog to clear my mind. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the same effect of solitary physical activity on my children, pumping away on a swing or hanging from a monkey bar.

The Catholic Church played too central and heroic a role in the Polish resistance to Communist dictatorship (think of Lech Walesa taking communion at the Gdansk shipyard, or Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski, or Pope John Paul II) for anyone who is known to have collaborated with the secret police to have so prominent a role. Yet I find myself pausing to reflect for a moment about Bishop Wielgus and about how surviving in that world, especially for anyone in a position of authority, presented excruciating choices, again and again.'b'There are huge numbers of names in those cursed secret-police archives left behind in Poland and all other police states past and present, and many are people whose only crime was that they were not heroes. In that same Communist Poland, a Polish friend once came to me, distraught. The secret police had come to him and had ordered him to serve as an informer; if he did not, his only child would be expelled from the university. Just telling me was an act of courage. In the end, my friend was saved by the demise of Communist rule. But his terrible dilemma was shared by millions of people in the Soviet empire.'b'Under Stalin, the coercion had been crude and brutal. But even after the Gulag was largely shut down, the Communist state demanded constant and total fealty. The levers were fear and total control over every aspect of every life. A child\xe2\x80\x99s education, a promotion, a trip abroad, a new apartment, everything depended on playing the game. The price ranged from silence, passivity and marching in the May Day parade all the way to informing and active collusion.'b'In his book about the legacies of World War II in Germany and Japan, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wages of Guilt,\xe2\x80\x9d Ian Buruma wrote that it was not the resistance heroes who fascinated him as a youth in Holland during the war, but the \xe2\x80\x9cfrightened man who betrayed to save his life, who looked the other way, who grasped the wrong horn of a hideous moral dilemma.\xe2\x80\x9d I had that same reaction when I was a correspondent in the Soviet Union, perhaps because, like Mr. Buruma, I could never be sure which horn I would have grasped in that life.'b'Of course there were villains, people who enrolled in the system for the power, who reveled in humiliating and persecuting the helpless. But otherwise honorable people often compromised \xe2\x80\x94 not out of malice, but because they found all the choices were bad. The Russian Orthodox patriarch, Aleksy II, who had been a priest or a bishop for 40 years under the Communists, acknowledged that his ministry required accommodation with the state.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDefending one thing, it was necessary to give somewhere else,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me in an interview in 1991. \xe2\x80\x9cWere there any other organizations, or any other people among those who had to carry responsibility not only for themselves but for thousands of other fates, who in those years in the Soviet Union were not compelled to act likewise?"'b'Many of the people caught in that web set their own red line beyond which compromise turned to surrender. These were fine lines: one person might convince himself that it was acceptable to report who had been to a secret poetry reading, but not to divulge who retyped the forbidden manuscript. As long as people held to their line, they could hold their heads high.'b'Bishop Wielgus argued that he never hurt anyone, that he only reported on his own doings to be allowed to continue studies abroad.'b'But how can he know whom he hurt, and how can we know what any of them really did? One of the problems with those files is that they were compiled by professional liars, who were often trying to impress their bosses with mythical conquests. As Cardinal Jozef  Glemp, the primate of Poland, said in defense of Bishop Wielgus, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of a judgment was it, based on some documents and shreds of paper photocopied three times over?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There is no single answer to these questions. We have to know what happened, and the chief offenders should be held responsible. But as we judge others for whom smaller accommodations were the price of survival, we should ask ourselves what we would have done in their place.'b'To the Editor:'b'I take this timely opportunity to tell how much I, and many thousands of others deeply concerned with the continuing world problems of the last 10 years, are grateful for the tenure of Kofi Annan at the United Nations.'b'In terms of dedication to democratic justice, objective analysis, wise forethought and necessary action without fear of the inevitable criticism, his occupation of the secretary general\xe2\x80\x99s hot seat restored the belief that great intelligence and calm insight into the political, economic and social human condition can still exist in an office of virtually universal responsibility.'b'Thank you, Kofi Annan, for all that you have done for the citizens of the world; for your sanity in its madness, for your rejection of any personal aggrandizement.'b'I trust that Mr. Annan is not going to become a private citizen now, although he has every right to grant himself this. We need him to take up some continuing position high in public life that will give the international order \xe2\x80\x94 or rather, disorder \xe2\x80\x94 of the world\xe2\x80\x99s resources, material and human, the benefit of his invaluable knowledge and courageous response to the challenges of practical action to achieve peace as the base of international development, fulfillment for nations, peoples and the individual.  Nadine Gordimer'b'Johannesburg, Jan. 8, 2007'b'Knoxville, Tenn.'b'IT\xe2\x80\x99S a phenomenon that gives the term \xe2\x80\x9cgun control\xe2\x80\x9d a whole new meaning: community ordinances that encourage citizens to own guns.'b'Last month, Greenleaf, Idaho, adopted Ordinance 208, calling for its citizens to own guns and keep them ready in their homes in case of emergency. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a response to high crime rates. As The Associated Press reported, \xe2\x80\x9cGreenleaf doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really have crime ... the most violent offense reported in the past two years was a fist fight.\xe2\x80\x9d Rather, it\xe2\x80\x99s a statement about preparedness in the event of an emergency, and an effort to promote a culture of self-reliance.'b'And it may not be a bad idea. While pro-gun laws like the one in Greenleaf are mostly symbolic, to the extent that they actually make a difference, it is likely to be a positive one.'b'Greenleaf is following in the footsteps of Kennesaw, Ga., which in 1982 passed a mandatory gun ownership law in response to a handgun ban passed in Morton Grove, Ill. Kennesaw\xe2\x80\x99s crime dropped sharply, while Morton Grove\xe2\x80\x99s did not.'b'To some degree, this is rational. Criminals, unsurprisingly, would rather break into a house where they aren\xe2\x80\x99t at risk of being shot. As David Kopel noted in a 2001 article in The Arizona Law Review, burglars report that they try to avoid homes where armed residents are likely to be present. We see this phenomenon internationally, too, with the United States having a lower proportion of \xe2\x80\x9chot\xe2\x80\x9d burglaries \xe2\x80\x94 break-ins where the burglars know the home to be occupied \xe2\x80\x94 than countries with restrictive gun laws.'b'Likewise, in the event of disasters that leave law enforcement overwhelmed, armed citizens can play an important role in stanching crime. Armed neighborhood watches deterred looting in parts of Houston and New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.'b'Precisely because an armed populace can serve as an effective backup for law enforcement, the ownership of firearms was widely mandated during Colonial times, and the second Congress passed a statute in 1792 requiring adult male citizens to own guns.'b'The twin purposes of self and community defense may very well lie behind the Second Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s language encompassing both the importance of a well-regulated militia and the right of citizens to keep and bear arms. As the constitutional and criminal law scholar Don Kates has noted in the journal Constitutional Commentary, thinkers at the time when the Constitution was written drew no real distinction between resisting burglars, foreign invaders or domestic tyrants: All were wrongdoers that good citizens had the right, and the duty, to oppose with force.'b'Greenleaf\xe2\x80\x99s ordinance is consistent with this approach. But it may also serve another purpose.'b'Experts don\xe2\x80\x99t think the Kennesaw ordinance, which has never actually been enforced, did much to change gun ownership rates among Kennesaw residents. And, given that Greenleaf\xe2\x80\x99s mayor has estimated that 80 percent of the town\xe2\x80\x99s residents already own guns, the new ordinance can\xe2\x80\x99t make all that much of a difference. But criminals are likely to suspect that towns with laws like these on the books will be unsympathetic to malefactors in general, and to conclude that they will do better elsewhere.'b'To the extent that\xe2\x80\x99s true, we\xe2\x80\x99re likely to see other communities adopting similar laws so that criminals won\xe2\x80\x99t see them as attractive alternatives. The result may be a different kind of \xe2\x80\x9cgun control.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Genocide may be the worst of crimes, but historically it has also brought out the best in some people.'b'The Raoul Wallenbergs of 2007 speckle America and the globe. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t just mean the aid workers  \xe2\x80\x94 13 of whom have been murdered for their efforts in Darfur since last May  \xe2\x80\x94 but also those ordinary Americans who have united in a grass-roots campaign to try to stop genocide half a world away in Sudan.'b'President Bush and other world leaders have dropped the ball on Darfur. But that vacuum of moral leadership has been filled by university students, churches and temples, celebrities like George Clooney and Mia Farrow, and armies of schoolchildren.'b'Their arsenal  \xe2\x80\x94 green armbands, phone calls to the White House, bake sales to raise money  \xe2\x80\x94 all seem pallid. How can a \xe2\x80\x9cSave Darfur\xe2\x80\x9d lawn sign in Peoria intimidate government-backed raiders in Sudan or Chad who throw babies into bonfires?'b'Yet, finally, we see evidence that those armbands and lawn signs can make a difference. Last week, the 'b'Save Darfur Coalition'b'  \xe2\x80\x94 the grass-roots organization that puts out those lawn signs  \xe2\x80\x94 sponsored a trip by Bill Richardson, the New Mexico governor, to Khartoum to negotiate with President Omar al-Bashir.'b'Sure, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little weird when a private advocacy group undertakes freelance diplomacy. But if George W. Bush, Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac and Hu Jintao twiddle their thumbs, then more power to the freelancers.'b'Mr. Richardson worked out a joint statement in which Sudan agreed to a 60-day cease-fire to allow peace talks to resume, provided the Darfur rebels go along as well. Mr. Bashir also agreed that Sudan would prosecute rapes and stop painting its military aircraft to look as if they belong to the U.N.'b'The first thing to say is that Mr. Bashir has repeatedly broken his pledges in the past. Count me deeply skeptical about whether it will be any different this time. Mudawi Ibrahim Adam, a Sudanese human rights campaigner, told me he thinks that President Bashir simply made cosmetic concessions in hopes of winning the chairmanship of the African Union later this month.'b'That said, there may be a path forward here. While U.N. peacekeepers and a no-fly zone are needed, ultimately the only way to end the slaughter is to achieve a peace agreement in Darfur. And that seems more feasible today than it was a week ago.'b'Most striking, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the cease-fire was a consequence of all those armbands and lawn signs. Mr. Richardson told me that Mr. Bashir was motivated by concern at the way the killings have been spotlighted by Darfur activists. Mr. Richardson quoted him as saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThese guys have caused me a lot of damage.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ken Bacon, who heads Refugees International and accompanied Mr. Richardson, said of President Bashir: \xe2\x80\x9cOne thing that was very clear was that the Save Darfur movement has gotten under his skin. The vilification of the Khartoum regime in columns and editorials and ads is making a difference.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'So cherish this historical moment. The long record of genocide is one overwhelmingly of acquiescence, but this time ordinary citizens are trying to write a different ending.'b'There are the students at Santa Clara University in California who replicated a mini refugee camp and slept in it. They limited themselves to 1,000 calories a day  \xe2\x80\x94 because that\xe2\x80\x99s what Darfuris are limited to  \xe2\x80\x94 and donated the savings to aid groups.'b'Or there\xe2\x80\x99s Jason Miller, a California M.D./Ph.D student who in his spare time has become the foremost expert on how investments by foreign companies underwrite the Sudanese genocide.  Or Beth Reilly, a stay-at-home mom in Indiana who works on Darfur a little bit every day. Or the legions of schoolkids who organize car washes, and ask for donations in lieu of birthday presents, in hopes of saving other children halfway around the globe.'b'Sudan\xe2\x80\x99s leaders are used to bullying everyone. Jan Pronk, who was the United Nations envoy in Sudan until Khartoum ejected him, reports in his Weblog that a U.N. official recently went to the authorities in Darfur to complain about human rights violations. A Sudanese official retorted: \xe2\x80\x9cYou better shut up. We can always expel you, as we have proven.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But finally President Bashir is confronting people whom he can\xe2\x80\x99t bully. Let\xe2\x80\x99s have no illusions about how much more pressure will be necessary to stop the slaughter, but let\xe2\x80\x99s also celebrate this moment. Mr. Bashir has blinked, showing that it just may be possible to fight genocide with moral courage and lawn signs.'b'The new Congress is promising far tighter oversight of Bush administration spending programs, and few targets are more in need of scrutiny and daylight than the outsourcing of government programs to private contractors. This highly lucrative world quietly ballooned by 86 percent \xe2\x80\x94 to $377 billion annually \xe2\x80\x94 during the first five years of the Bush administration, according to Congressional estimates. Outsourced spending, on Iraq, Katrina and other bonanzas, has grown twice as fast as other discretionary spending, according to Representative Henry Waxman, the California Democrat who is chairman of the oversight and reform committee.'b'Mr. Waxman is fairly itching to finally map the waste, fraud and abuse in private contracting that went largely ignored by the previous Republican Congress. Taxpayers should wish him well.'b'In a preliminary glimpse, 118 contracts worth $745 billion were found by government auditors to be rife with questionable award procedures, mismanagement, overcharging and skimpy to nonexistent oversight. Full inquiries and public hearings are vital if the rich and shadowy world of privatization is ever to be plumbed for the scandal it is nurturing. Taxpayers have only a vague notion of what\xe2\x80\x99s gone on, mainly through reporting on the fantastic good fortune of Halliburton, Vice President Dick Cheney\xe2\x80\x99s former company, whose contracts increased a whopping 600 percent across five years as the Iraq war costs cascaded. Not incidentally, privatization has been a cash cow in stirring campaign donations from successful contractors.'b'According to one recent audit reported in The Washington Post, among 49 privatized contracts, three out of five were awarded noncompetitively, lacked oversight, and raised questions of legality.

Decades ago, audiocassette and videocassette recorders gave consumers the power to copy audiotapes and videotapes \xe2\x80\x94 a power previously reserved for a locked world of retailers and distributors.'b'The 1984 Betamax case, in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that technology companies aren\xe2\x80\x99t liable for copyright infringement when people misuse their products, encouraged still more innovation. There was a flood of gadgets that enabled us to copy things, including personal computers, CD burners and TiVo.'b'Since then, the entertainment industry has put pressure on electronics manufacturers to limit the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s ability to make copies.

Ice caps are melting, ocean levels are rising, hurricanes are intensifying, tropical diseases are spreading and the threat of droughts, floods and famines looms large. Can planting a tree help stop all this from happening?'b'To some, it\xe2\x80\x99s a no-brainer: We add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere every time we use energy from coal, oil or gas; but each tree can remove more than a ton of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere over its lifetime. Based on this logic, it might seem a good idea to go out and plant a tree to slow global heating.'b'And if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have the time, projects have sprung up throughout the world claiming to help cool the earth, ready to accept your money and plant a tree in your name. The computer company Dell will now donate $2 from every laptop sale to planting trees in an effort to offset the carbon dioxide emissions that result from powering their computers. For a 2 percent to 4 percent surcharge on bills, Pacific Gas and Electric will offer to offset its customers\xe2\x80\x99 carbon emissions by helping to preserve California\xe2\x80\x99s carbon-storing forests.'b'While preserving and restoring forests is unquestionably good for the natural environment, new scientific studies are concluding that preservation and restoration of forests outside the tropics will do little or nothing to help slow climate change. And some projects intended to slow the heating of the planet may be accelerating it instead.'b'Trees don\xe2\x80\x99t just absorb carbon dioxide \xe2\x80\x94 they soak up the sun\xe2\x80\x99s heating rays, too. Forests tend to be darker than farms and pastures and therefore tend to absorb more sunlight. This has a warming influence that appears to cancel, on average, the cooling influence of the forest\xe2\x80\x99s carbon storage. This effect is most pronounced in snowy areas \xe2\x80\x94 snow on bare ground reflects far more sunlight back to space than does a snowed-in forest \xe2\x80\x94 so forests in areas with seasonal snow cover can be strongly warming.'b'In contrast, tropical forests appear to be doubly valuable to the earth\xe2\x80\x99s climate system. Not only do they store copious amounts of carbon, the roots of tropical trees reach down deep, drawing up water that they evaporate through their leaves. In the atmosphere, this water may form clouds that reflect sunlight back to space, helping to cool the earth.'b'These findings have important policy implications. It has been suggested that agreements to limit climate change should consider carbon stored in forests. If so, they would need to consider the direct climate effects of forests so as to avoid perverse incentives to plant warming forests in places like the United States, Canada, Europe and the former Soviet Union. However, tropical forests, which are generally found in developing countries, may be due a double climate credit \xe2\x80\x94 one for their carbon storage and another for their cooling clouds.'b'What does this mean for local reforestation efforts? Consider Pacific Gas and Electric\xe2\x80\x99s surcharge plan. While the carbon soaked up by California\xe2\x80\x99s forests reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations everywhere, cooling Crete, Canc\xc3\xban and Calcutta, the sunlight they absorb warms the state and the surrounding region. So, it might even cool us if we were to cut down those dark forests. Lumber interests might look gleefully upon the prospect.'b'Clear-cutting mountains to slow climate change is, of course, nuts. The broadest goal is neither to slow the growth of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere nor to slow climate change, but rather to preserve the irreplaceable natural balance that sustains life as we know it on this planet. We want to avoid climate change so that we might pass these diverse natural riches on to future generations. In this light, preserving and restoring forests is a valuable activity, regardless of its impact on climate \xe2\x80\x94 we need more trees, not fewer.'b'But the notion that we can save the planet just by planting trees is a dangerous illusion. To preserve our environment, we must drastically reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and this will require a major transformation of our energy system. A primary goal for the next half-century should be to transform our energy system to one based on clean, safe and environmentally acceptable energy sources like wind, solar and perhaps nuclear. This means solving the real problems involved with storing and distributing power, providing energy for transportation, and using nuclear plants.'b'We cannot afford to indulge ourselves with well-intentioned activities that do little to solve the underlying problem. Instead, we must demand that our political leaders do more to revolutionize our energy system and preserve our environmental inheritance for future generations.'b'And then we can plant a tree.'b'Nixzmary Brown was just 7 when she died, one year ago this month in Brooklyn, an apparent victim of brutality at home and neglect by the child welfare system.

Eliot Spitzer should put the Family Court high on his judicial reform agenda.'b'Lawyers for the city in Family Court are often poorly prepared. Legal Aid lawyers are spread unreasonably thin. Judges can handle as many as 2,500 cases a year, leaving them as little as 10 minutes on the bench for each one.'b'Bill de Blasio, a City Council member from Brooklyn, has called attention to the court\xe2\x80\x99s problems while asking hard questions about the child welfare system. He is also pressing for money that was allotted to support the system last year, about $13 million, to be made permanent.

In the age of professional parenting, it is something of a mystery that any of us survived, much less learned to add, dream or brush our teeth.'b'Last week, New York City officials unveiled plans for a cutting-edge downtown playground, conceived as the first of many.

As has been noted, kids will turn anything into a rocket ship, including dinner plates.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m the first to admit that it takes a village. I would no sooner vote against foam blocks or burlap bags than against the tooth fairy, especially in Lower Manhattan; my eldest was raised indoors, at the Winter Garden. But as Tom Perrotta made splendidly clear in \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Children,\xe2\x80\x9d the only toxic element on a playground tends to be the adults. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean the child molesters.

They decimate your bank account, your furniture and your immune system. Your nerves, your abs, your attention span will never be the same. Even their dietary habits undermine ours; a new study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveals that those of us who live with children eat more fat and more saturated fat. But if on the surface they seem to have invaded our world, I\xe2\x80\x99d argue we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually colonized theirs. Surely something other than affluence and overthinking is at work here. Is it just a little bit possible that we\xe2\x80\x99re using our kids as an excuse not to grow up?'b'Participatory parenting happens after all to make for participatory childhood. Which would explain why cupcakes are back in vogue; why the grown-ups are reading \xe2\x80\x9cHarry Potter\xe2\x80\x9d; why my wardrobe is indistinguishable from my 13-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s. Where children once counted as miniature adults, adults today look like outsized children. Somewhere along the way we repealed the generation gap.

Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s overpromising has included a forecast that we would all be buying hydrogen-fueled cars in 20 years and his pledge a year ago to rid the country of its addiction to oil.'b'Still, we must hope that Mr. Bush is serious this time,  because we simply cannot continue to hold our national security and the health of the planet hostage to our appetite for fossil fuels.'b'America\xe2\x80\x99s closest allies, and increasingly its governors, know this.  Last week, the European Union \xe2\x80\x94 shaken by Russia\xe2\x80\x99s threatened shutdown of oil passing through Belarus \xe2\x80\x94 announced a menu of initiatives aimed at reducing Europe\xe2\x80\x99s dependence on unreliable suppliers while cutting greenhouse gas emissions with cleaner fuels and new technologies.'b'Here at home, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ordered his regulators in California to require fuel oil companies and refiners to start reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other global-warming gases. The order is expected to help jump-start the production of biofuels and, over time, hydrogen for fuel cell cars. It follows an earlier California directive requiring more fuel-efficient vehicles, and represents an important element in the state\xe2\x80\x99s broad plan to cut global-warming emissions from all sources by 25 percent by 2020.'b'For its part, Congress is churning out energy bills. But this is a recipe for paralysis unless it observes a few basic guideposts.'b'\xc2\xb6The last thing America needs is another multi-year debate leading to yet another giant bill that offers something for everyone without really changing the way this country produces and uses energy. Senators Harry Reid and Jeff Bingaman have produced the outlines of a bill that could become the template for more specific action. It sets two basic goals: reducing the country\xe2\x80\x99s dependency on oil and reducing the risks of global warming. And it focuses on a handful of remedies, including more efficient automobiles, the rapid development of alternative fuels and cleaner ways of producing power.'b'\xc2\xb6Partisanship and posturing must be resisted. Right now, House Democrats are fixated on eliminating unnecessary tax breaks and closing loopholes that favor the oil and gas industry. Fair enough, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not an energy policy. The House has been notoriously unenlightened on energy issues, and Nancy Pelosi, the speaker, has some heavy educating to do to make her colleagues full partners in this essential national enterprise.'b'\xc2\xb6Doing things right will take serious money. In recent days, for instance, Gov. Brian Schweitzer of Montana and Senators Barack Obama of Illinois and Jim Bunning of Kentucky \xe2\x80\x94 any  politician, that is, with coal to sell \xe2\x80\x94 have jumped aboard the coal-to-gasoline bandwagon as the answer to dependence on foreign oil.'b'The world has lots of coal, which can indeed be converted to gasoline. But the process releases enormous amounts of carbon, far more than refining oil into gasoline does. Unless we are willing to invest in technologies that can sequester carbon emissions and keep them out of the atmosphere, turning to coal could be a disaster for global warming.'b'So far, nobody \xe2\x80\x94 not the coal industry, Congress or the White House \xe2\x80\x94 has displayed much interest in making these investments, just as nobody except for a few states like New York and some plucky private investors has shown much interest in the investments necessary to produce biofuels on a commercial scale.

That burden will be lifted at some airports shortly \xe2\x80\x94 for those willing to pay about $100 a year for the privilege.'b'The Transportation Security Administration  has recently approved a new device that will scan your shoes while you are still wearing them. It uses quadrupole resonance technology, similar to a medical M.R.I., to determine whether explosives or weapons might be hidden in your shoes. It is the first important new technology to emerge from the for-profit registered traveler programs.'b'The hitch is that, for now, you have to pay to join a program in which private companies pledge to move you through the security lines a bit faster if you submit to a government background check in advance and supply biometric data \xe2\x80\x94 like a thumbprint or iris scan \xe2\x80\x94 that can be used to identify you at the airport.'b'The lead company in the field, founded by Steven Brill, operates the registered traveler lanes in Orlando, Fla., where use of the shoe scanner started yesterday, and plans to open lanes at four more airports in coming weeks. That will include Kennedy Airport, where one lane opened yesterday but with its shoe scanner not yet operational.'b'The scanner was developed for Mr. Brill\xe2\x80\x99s company by G.E. Security, a subsidiary of General Electric. It is part of a kiosk that also includes a device to scan fingertips for traces of chemicals that might indicate recent contact with explosives. That technology, if approved by the federal government, could make it possible for travelers to be X-rayed for hidden explosives without first having to take off their coats. Another company is exploring backscatter X-ray technology that can see through clothing to detect hidden objects, although that carries privacy implications. Also down the road is a technology to scan laptops without removing them from their cases.'b'These technology advances could become the major contribution of registered traveler programs, which otherwise simply offer those willing to pay an annual fee a designated fast lane to a set of the airport\xe2\x80\x99s standard metal detectors and X-ray scanners. The kiosks cost a hefty $150,000, probably too much for the government to swallow. But G.E. would surely relish a broad market, and volume production would presumably reduce the price.

The new comptroller will play an enormous but  largely unseen role in safeguarding the state\xe2\x80\x99s finances for the next four years. There will be great pressure to make a political choice, but legislators should resist that instinct and vote for the most able and independent candidate.'b'We are not ready to endorse a candidate, but it is not too early to lay out the job qualifications, starting with fearless independence. The new comptroller will not only have to audit Gov. Eliot Spitzer\xe2\x80\x99s administration, but may also look at any state spending \xe2\x80\x94 including how the Legislature doles out its pork and other political favors. For this reason, the five or so Democratic Assembly members who want the position bear the heaviest burden of showing their independence. Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, who controls the largest bloc in the Legislature, will play the biggest role in choosing the next comptroller. It should not be someone who goes easy on Mr. Silver and his colleagues in return for getting the job.'b'Financial expertise is also a must. The new comptroller will single-handedly be responsible for investing $146 billion in state pension money. The state needs someone with a sure hand to protect the state\xe2\x80\x99s retirees, and someone who knows how to use the power of that fund to promote good corporate governance and socially responsible investments.'b'The next comptroller should have a proven record as a reformer. He or she will have to reject pleas to waste scarce positions on the politically connected, and be willing to shake things up, from wasteful public authorities to mismanaged school districts. The person should promise to work for public campaign financing for the comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s job.'b'Mr. Spitzer and the leaders of the State Senate and Assembly have agreed on what sounds like a good process. There will be public hearings, and a group of former comptrollers will winnow the field down to five contenders. But in the end legislators will choose. Their responsibility is to choose someone who will look out for the interests of all New Yorkers, not simply those who did the choosing.'b'The Census Bureau typically uses the decennial census to test data-collection methods that become routine later on. The 2010 census should include a test run at counting the nation\xe2\x80\x99s 1.4 million prison inmates at their permanent addresses instead of in prisons. That would help bring an end to a corrosive but little known practice that distorts the political process in virtually every corner of the country.'b'Inmates are denied the right to vote in all but two states. But state lawmakers treat them as residents of the prisons when drawing legislative maps, to inflate the head count in lightly populated rural areas where prisons are typically built. This creates legislative districts where none would ordinarily be, shifting political influence from the heavily populated urban districts where inmates live.'b'Once inflated, these towns and counties siphon an outsized portion of state and federal aid. Politicians in districts with prisons sometimes brag openly about the windfall, as they mock \xe2\x80\x9cconstituents\xe2\x80\x9d who are powerless to remove them from office and are packed onto buses and driven hundreds of miles to their real homes the minute they leave the prison walls.'b'The Census Bureau was made pointedly aware of this problem last fall. A report it commissioned noted that counting inmates at prisons distorted the political process and raised legitimate concerns about the fairness of the census itself. That report, by the National Research Council, recognized that the methods would not be simple to change, but urged the bureau to seeks ways to do it.'b'Collecting and verifying residential information for prison inmates is a complicated job. But the report suggested a perfectly reasonable interim solution. The bureau could publish detailed counts of the prison populations, so that the inmates could be subtracted at redistricting time. These figures would illuminate corrupt redistricting committees that use prison counts to pad districts that fall short of federal population requirements.'b'The Census Bureau has a crucial role to play in putting and end to this despicable practice.

More often, institutionalization follows an accident or sudden illness. The broken hip is a typical trigger. First the patient goes to the hospital, and then to the nursing home for rehab.

That would be expensive. The average charge for a health aide is $19 per hour. So to keep someone with you around the clock for a year would cost at least $166,000, more than double your $75,000.'b'But three frail elderly people could share an apartment and a 24-hour aide and, by pooling the cost, have more than $58,000 left over among them for food, clothing, shelter, physical therapy and even fun and frolic.'b'In many cases, a nursing home offers services far beyond what a patient needs. Many people need only a little help \xe2\x80\x94 someone to dispense their medicines, prepare their meals and help them get in and out of bed. Others might need 24-hour care, but not a nursing home.'b'Assisted living \xe2\x80\x94 the halfway house between home-sweet-home and the nursing home \xe2\x80\x94 would fit the bill. But Medicaid won\xe2\x80\x99t pay for assisted living.

Unnecessarily shuttling people into the most restrictive setting grossly violates this standard.'b'The idea of pooled resources and cooperative living arrangements is not new, nor does it originate in elder care. In 1963, George Fairweather, a psychologist, created \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity lodges,\xe2\x80\x9d where psychiatric patients could live cooperatively outside hospitals. Groups of patients would pool their government benefits, buy or rent lodging and hire professionals to meet their special needs. Today, lodge programs modeled on this concept exist across the nation, enabling psychiatric patients to have control of their own lives.'b'Aging at home is an idea that has an intrinsic appeal to my iconoclastic baby-boom generation. We are faced with a public health system that resists innovation, but the sheer size of our generation may force the issue. Everyone is worrying about how the diminutive X, Y and Z generations will pay for all of us in our dotage. Financial shortfalls may divert money into more cost-effective, less restrictive, more consumer-controlled environments for the elderly who need help.'b'And that would be a stroke of good luck for all of us.'b'The one crucial assumption behind everything President Bush proposed on Iraq last week was that Washington would have the wholehearted support of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. None of Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s ideas  \xe2\x80\x94 his plan to send more American soldiers to fight alongside Iraqi units in Baghdad, his program for jump-starting the Iraqi economy, his hope of reconciling rival sectarian communities and heading off civil war  \xe2\x80\x94 can possibly succeed without the full cooperation of the Iraqi government.'b'Yet in the days following Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s address, as in the days before, Mr. Maliki has demonstrated how far his own goals diverge from America\xe2\x80\x99s best interests or any reasonable path for containing Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s civil war. Consider, for example, Mr. Maliki\xe2\x80\x99s designation of Lt. Gen.

If General Qanbar and Mr. Maliki plan to continue shielding militias like the Mahdi Army, this new drive will be doomed before it begins.'b'What another failure would mean was underscored in a particularly grim way yesterday when the United Nations reported that some 34,000 Iraqi civilians died violently last year, a staggering number in a country of less than 27 million people. Yesterday, more than 100 Iraqis died in Baghdad alone.'b'Consider also the grisly decapitation over the weekend of Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, Saddam Hussein\xe2\x80\x99s co-defendant and half brother.  Two weeks of watching how the lynch mob atmosphere of Mr. Hussein\xe2\x80\x99s execution instantly turned a monster into a martyr throughout the Sunni Arab world should have put Mr. Maliki on notice to get this one right. But whether deliberately or through breathtaking incompetence, the Iraqi government did not get it right, once again fanning sectarian flames.'b'Unless President Bush insists that Mr. Maliki accept specific and enforceable policy benchmarks and timelines \xe2\x80\x94 starting with the disarming of sectarian militias \xe2\x80\x94 the United States will remain hostage to the Iraqi prime minister and his radical Shiite agenda.'b'Mr. Bush needs to make clear to the Iraqi leader that continued American support will depend on his active cooperation.

McAllister'b'\nPalm Beach, Fla., Jan. 13, 2007'b''b'Los Angeles'b'IN late 2001, three months before my son, the Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, was kidnapped, he interviewed the influential Qatari cleric Sheik Yusuf al-Qaradawi, and asked him about suicide bombings against Israeli civilians. The sheik replied with a novel twist of logic. \xe2\x80\x9cIsraeli society in general is armed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, implying that Israeli civilians \xe2\x80\x94 including women and children, doctors and journalists \xe2\x80\x94 are legitimate targets.'b'At the time, it was still surprising to see an authoritative Muslim cleric give religious license to the ideology of terror \xe2\x80\x94 granting the faithful permission to elevate their own grievances above the norms of civilized society.'b'Daniel would fall victim to that same ideology when he was abducted and murdered in Pakistan. After his death, I discovered that Sheik Qaradawi is the host of a weekly program on the Qatar-based TV news network Al Jazeera called \xe2\x80\x9cSharia and Life.\xe2\x80\x9d He uses this forum to preach his new morality to millions of Arabic-speaking viewers, including Hamas operatives, Al Qaeda recruits, schoolteachers and impressionable Muslim youths.   \xe2\x80\x9cWe have the \xe2\x80\x98children bomb,\xe2\x80\x99 and these human bombs must continue until liberation,\xe2\x80\x9d he told his audience in 2002. Consistent with this logic and morality, Sheik Qaradawi later extended his Koranic blessing to suicide bombing against American civilians in Iraq.'b'A few in the Arab world have taken issue with his calls for violence. Al Ittihad, a newspaper in the United Arab Emirates, editorialized in 2004 that the beheading of two American hostages in Iraq happened \xe2\x80\x9cin direct response to Qaradawi\xe2\x80\x99s fatwa and incitement, which permits the killing of American civilians.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet few, in the Middle East or the West, seem willing to condemn Al Jazeera\xe2\x80\x99s management for giving the cleric regular airtime.'b'None of this might seem to matter much to Americans except that for two months now Al Jazeera has been taking its mixture of news coverage and extremist propagandizing to our front door through an English-language station. Called Al Jazeera English, the network can be received via satellite or streamed over the Internet. It has bureaus in London and Washington, and has recruited such high-profile Western journalists as Sir David Frost as correspondents.'b'In part, this is promising. The Arabic version of Al Jazeera and its various spinoffs on satellite TV and the Internet are usually credited with having a positive influence on Arab society. True, Al Jazeera\xe2\x80\x99s coverage has placed an emphasis on younger leaders, reformers and successful businessmen who may serve as role models for today\xe2\x80\x99s Arab youth. And it has brought \xe2\x80\x94 as the press usually does \xe2\x80\x94 a degree of inquisitiveness and openness that could become a useful engine of reform in the region.'b'Westerners have been quick to point out these benefits. A critic for The Times said that \xe2\x80\x9cthough Al Jazeera English looks at news events through a non-Western prism, it also points to where East and West actually meet.\xe2\x80\x9d Time magazine noted, \xe2\x80\x9carguably nothing \xe2\x80\x94 including the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s panoply of democratization programs \xe2\x80\x94 has done more than Al Jazeera to open minds and challenge authority in the Middle East.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But what should concern Westerners is that the ideology of men like Sheik Qaradawi saturates many of the network\xe2\x80\x99s programs, and is gaining wider acceptance among Muslim youths in the West. In its \xe2\x80\x9cstraight\xe2\x80\x9d news coverage on its Arabic TV broadcasts and Web sites, Al Jazeera\xe2\x80\x99s reports consistently amplify radical Islamist sentiments (although without endorsing violence explicitly).'b'For example, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwar on terror\xe2\x80\x9d is invariably preceded by the contemptuous prefix \xe2\x80\x9cso-called.\xe2\x80\x9d The words \xe2\x80\x9cterror\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinsurgency\xe2\x80\x9d are rarely uttered with a straight face, usually replaced with \xe2\x80\x9cresistance\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cstruggle.\xe2\x80\x9d The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwar in Iraq\xe2\x80\x9d is often replaced by \xe2\x80\x9cwar on Iraq\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwar against Iraq.\xe2\x80\x9d A suicide bombing is called a \xe2\x80\x9ccommando attack\xe2\x80\x9d or, occasionally, a \xe2\x80\x9cparadise operation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Al Jazeera\xe2\x80\x99s Web site can be less subtle. On Dec. 12, after religious leaders and heads of state all over the world condemned President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran for staging a Holocaust denial conference in Tehran, the headline on the site read, \xe2\x80\x9cAhmadinejad Praised by Participants of the Holocaust Conference in Tehran, but Condemned by Zionists in Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In short, Al Jazeera\xe2\x80\x99s editors choreograph a worldview in which an irreconcilable struggle rages between an evil-meaning Western oppressor and its helpless, righteous Arab victims. Most worrisome, perhaps, it often reports on supposed Western conspiracies behind most Arab hardships or failings, thus fueling the sense of helplessness, humiliation and anger among Muslim youths and helping turn them into potential recruits for terrorist organizations.'b'The question is, to what extent will this pathological worldview infiltrate Al Jazeera\xe2\x80\x99s English channel, which is still trying to find its voice? David Marash, a former \xe2\x80\x9cNightline\xe2\x80\x9d correspondent who is the American anchor on Al Jazeera English, acknowledges such a possibility, but dismisses the responsibility of the network. \xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly, some Al Jazeera programs may have inspired some social misfits to undertake terrorism,\xe2\x80\x9d he told The New York Sun. \xe2\x80\x9cThe danger with information is that some people will take it the wrong way.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Still, with the growing number of social misfits in society, and the growing confusion between \xe2\x80\x9cinformation\xe2\x80\x9d and deception in the news media, the danger of fueling combustible anger in some viewers cannot be ignored, especially when pumped subliminally by well-respected Western anchors.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s face it: when a terrorist attack is described as a \xe2\x80\x9cmartyrdom\xe2\x80\x9d in a thick Middle Eastern accent, it can be dismissed by Americans as a peculiarity of cultural differences. But imagine the effect of the word if spoken in David Frost\xe2\x80\x99s cultured British tones. This is why, even if Al Jazeera English waters down its alarmist content, it should still be seen as a potential threat: it will bestow respectability upon the practices of its parent network in Qatar, which continues, among other things, to broadcast Sheik Qaradawi\xe2\x80\x99s teachings.'b'I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call for banning Al Jazeera English in the United States even if that were possible. It is important to extend a hand to the network because it can become a force for good; but it is as important for our news organizations to scrutinize its content and let its viewers know when anti-Western wishes are subverting objective truth. As Al Jazeera on the whole feels the heat of world media attention, we can hope that it will learn to harness its popularity in the service of humanity, progress and moderation.'b'WASHINGTON'b'Being president can be really, really hard.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes you\xe2\x80\x99re the commander in chief,\xe2\x80\x9d W. explained to Scott Pelley on \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes you\xe2\x80\x99re the educator in chief, and a lot of times you\xe2\x80\x99re both when it comes to war.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'President Bush has been dutifully making the rounds of TV news shows, trying to make the case that victory in Iraq is \xe2\x80\x9cdoable.\xe2\x80\x9d He thinks the public will support the Surge if he can simply illuminate a few things that we may have been too thick to understand.

The president elucidating the Iraqi insurgency for us is learning about the Algerian insurgency from the man who failed to quell the Vietcong insurgency.'b'During his \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes\xe2\x80\x9d interview, Mr. Bush mentioned that he was reading Alistair Horne\xe2\x80\x99s classic history, \xe2\x80\x9cA Savage War of Peace,\xe2\x80\x9d about why the French suffered a colonial disaster in a guerrilla war against Muslims in Algiers from 1954 to 1962.'b'The book was recommended to W. by Henry Kissinger, who is working on an official biography of himself with Mr. Horne.'b'Mr. Horne recalled that Dr. Kissinger told him: \xe2\x80\x9cThe president\xe2\x80\x99s one of my best students. He reads all the books I send him.\xe2\x80\x9d The author asked the president\xe2\x80\x99s foreign affairs adviser if W. ever wrote any essays on the books. \xe2\x80\x9cHenry just laughed,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Horne said.'b'It seems far too late for Mr. Bush to begin studying about counterinsurgency now that Iraq has cratered into civil war. Can\xe2\x80\x99t someone get the president a copy of \xe2\x80\x9cGone With the Wind\xe2\x80\x9d?'b'Maybe it was inevitable, once W. started reading Camus\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cL\xe2\x80\x99Etranger,\xe2\x80\x9d set in Algeria, that he would move on to Mr. Horne.  As The Washington Post military correspondent Tom Ricks wrote in November, the Horne book has been an underground best-seller among U.S. military officers for three years, and \xe2\x80\x9cAlgeria\xe2\x80\x9d has become almost a code word among counterinsurgency specialists  for the mess in Iraq. The Pentagon screened the 1966 movie \xe2\x80\x9cThe Battle of Algiers\xe2\x80\x9d in 2003, but the commander in chief must have missed it.'b'I asked Mr. Horne, who was at his home in a small village outside Oxford, England, what the president could learn from his book.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe depressing problem of getting entangled in the Muslim world,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cAlgeria was a thoroughly bloodthirsty war that ended horribly and cost the lives of about 20,000 Frenchmen and a million Algerians. There was a terrible civil war.  ...De Gaulle ended up giving literally everything away and left without his pants.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'President de Gaulle had all the same misconceptions as W., that his prestige could persuade the Muslims to accept his terms; that the guerrillas would recognize military defeat and accept sensible compromise; and that, as Mr. Horne writes, \xe2\x80\x9ctime would wait while he found the correct formula and then imposed peace with it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Horne also sees sad parallels in the torture issue: \xe2\x80\x9cThe French had experience under the Nazis in the occupation and practiced methods the Germans used in Algeria and extracted information that helped them win the Battle of Algiers. But in the long run it lost the war, because it caused such revulsion in France when the news came out, and there was huge opposition to the war from Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In May 2005, Mr. Horne gave a copy of his book to Rummy, with passages about torture underlined. \xe2\x80\x9cI got a savage letter back from him,\xe2\x80\x9d the author said.'b'The best thing now, he said, is to try to \xe2\x80\x9cget around the mullahs\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cget non-Christian forces in there as quickly as possible, mercenaries. As Henry said the other day, if only we had two brigades of Gurkhas to send to Baghdad.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Meanwhile, maybe W. should move on to reading Sartre. \xe2\x80\x9cNo Exit,\xe2\x80\x9d perhaps.'b'To the Editor:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPicking Up the Pieces\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 14) might have reminded the world that we are witnessing the consequences of a bumbling, misguided  presidency wielding immense  power to do harm.'b'Nearly half a trillion dollars is down the drain and billions more in a pipeline to nowhere.

As ordinary residents of New Orleans continue to suffer, the rest of the nation has casually turned away. The debacle is no longer being televised. So it must be over.'b'Dr. King held the unfashionable view that we had an obligation to help those who are in trouble, and to speak out against unfair treatment and social injustice. \xe2\x80\x9cOur lives begin to end,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe day we become silent about things that matter.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'New Orleans matters. And the long dark night of the war in Iraq must surely matter. But not enough voices of protest are being raised in either case. The anger quotient is much too low. You can\xe2\x80\x99t stop America\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in a senseless war or revive a dying American city if your greatest passion is kicking back with pizza and beer and tuning in to \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Idol.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The quality of life for black Americans more than 38 years after the death of Dr. King is a mixed bag. Blacks are far better off economically and educationally than ever before. Barack Obama is a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for president, and the last two secretaries of state have been black.'b'But the ominous shadow of racial prejudice is still with us. Even President Bush acknowledged that conditions in New Orleans pre-Katrina were proof of that. The nation\xe2\x80\x99s prisons are filled to the bursting point with black men who have failed, or been failed, and have no viable future. And too many black Americans are willing and even eager to see themselves in the culturally depraved lineup of gangsters, pimps and whores.'b'Dr. King would be 78 now, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe that he would be too thrilled by what\xe2\x80\x99s going on. In his view: \xe2\x80\x9cHe who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We miss his leadership, all of us, whether we\xe2\x80\x99re wise enough to realize it or not.'b'Washington'b'SOMETHING odd happened on Capitol Hill this week. Something that seemed to start out as a publicity stunt \xe2\x80\x94 the House Democratic leadership\xe2\x80\x99s 100-hour agenda \xe2\x80\x94 actually turned into a ...qualified success.'b'The passage of the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 eight-part legislative package \xe2\x80\x94 to be completed today \xe2\x80\x94 sets the stage for striking possibilities, some advantageous to the party, others threatening.'b'In the short term, the leadership has achieved two goals:'b'First, Democrats have shown basic competence and authority after four decades of defeat and division, whether in the majority or minority.'b'Second, the House has now approved legislation directly addressing public concerns: raising the minimum wage, ethics reform, interest rate reductions on subsidized college loans  and expanded federal support for stem cell research. It has put in place rule changes to promote fiscal responsibility and adopted recommendations from the 9/11 commission. Today, the House is expected to repeal tax breaks for oil companies. Poll-tested and guaranteed to be political winners, these achievements constitute a modest start toward a saleable centrist agenda for a party too often in the past labeled as extreme.'b'More important in terms of substantive future legislation, the ability of the Democrats to win over significant numbers of Republicans on most votes signals the slim but enticing possibility of Democratic mastery over a demoralized Republican Party \xe2\x80\x94 one that has thrived on polarized partisan warfare in recent years.'b'If the new bipartisanship takes root, the prospects for health care legislation and immigration reform sharply improve. These proposals cannot survive without backing from both Democrats and Republicans. When it comes to health care, a key corporate lobby, the Business Roundtable, has already formed a tentative alliance with organized labor, thereby giving cover to wavering members of Congress from both ends of the political spectrum. A parallel alliance among business, Roman Catholic Church leaders and progressive organizations like the National Council of La Raza has already formed in support of immigration legislation.'b'Similarly, Republican willingness to cross the aisle strengthens the hand of those who want to build Congressional opposition to the Iraq war. Every Republican who joins the opposition makes it easier for Democrats in red states and districts to become public critics of the war, and for more Republicans to join with them. (Witness the suddenly outspoken Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon.) Without some measure of Republican support, Democrats who challenge the war \xe2\x80\x94 particularly those who vote to deny appropriations \xe2\x80\x94 run the risk of being portrayed as unpatriotic and unwilling to support American troops in the midst of battle.'b'The potential for Republican defection is a new thing. Conservatives have long recognized \xe2\x80\x94 and worked hard to prevent \xe2\x80\x94 the danger of a breakdown in party discipline. In 1993, William Kristol, then chairman of the Project for the Republican Future, orchestrated the defeat of the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 health care plan. In an influential memo, Mr. Kristol wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cAny Republican urge to negotiate a \xe2\x80\x98least bad\xe2\x80\x99 compromise with the Democrats, and thereby gain momentary public credit for helping the president \xe2\x80\x98do something\xe2\x80\x99 about health care, should also be resisted. ...The plan should not be amended; it should be erased.\xe2\x80\x9d Judging from the early days of this Congress, however, Republican solidarity has begun to erode.'b'On another front, the restoration of Congressional bipartisanship may well have unintended consequences. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois has based his presidential campaign on a dysfunctional political system: \xe2\x80\x9cPolitics has become so bitter and partisan, so gummed up by money and influence, that we can\xe2\x80\x99t tackle the big problems that demand solutions,\xe2\x80\x9d he told supporters this week.'b'Insofar as Congress regains efficacy, a compelling rationale of the Obama campaign is undermined. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has cast herself as working effectively within the system, can only benefit when the system appears to be functional. A functional Congress also potentially diminishes the taint of Washington tenure for candidates like Senator  Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware and former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina.'b'While there are upsides to the early success of House Democrats, they are by no means home free. Many Republicans see Democrats undermining themselves with the adoption of pay-as-you-go budget rules, which require new expenditures to be accompanied by equivalent spending reductions or tax hikes. At some point, Republicans argue, Democrats will be forced to make unwelcome cuts, raise taxes, or go back on their word. With these rules, argues Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, Democrats have set the stage to once again become the \xe2\x80\x9ctax and spend\xe2\x80\x9d party.'b'Mr. Norquist may have a point. A yet-to-be-released post-election poll of 36,000 respondents by the Cooperative Congressional Election Survey showed virtually no public support for a tax increase. Asked to pick alternative ways to reduce the deficit, 49 percent said they would cut domestic spending, 32 percent said they would cut defense spending and only 15 percent said they would raise taxes. For freshman Democrats who won seats in centrist states like Indiana and Kansas, support for a tax increase would probably be political suicide.'b'Many Democrats acknowledge that the pressure to raise taxes will intensify, especially if expensive health care programs make it onto the agenda. Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, asked about taxes on \xe2\x80\x9cFace the Nation,\xe2\x80\x9d said that any tax increase would be limited to the wealthy. Taking back \xe2\x80\x9ctax cuts for those making over a certain amount of money \xe2\x80\x94 $500,000 a year \xe2\x80\x94 might be more important to the American people than ignoring the educational and health needs of America\xe2\x80\x99s children,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not going to start with repealing tax cuts, but they certainly are not off the table for people making over half a million dollars a year ... It\xe2\x80\x99s an option, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a first resort.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Democratic Party is walking a tightrope. Arguably, the party had the last election handed to it on a plate \xe2\x80\x94 war, corruption, pederasty \xe2\x80\x94 what more could one ask for? In addition,   voter repudiation of the president\xe2\x80\x99s strategy in the Middle East does not mean Americans trust Democrats on national security.'b'There are plenty of other reasons to be skeptical of continued Democratic success. Middle-class anxiety about jobs, retirement and health care are in fact scarcely touched by the 100 hours. Race and ethnic prejudice have not evaporated. And George Bush won\xe2\x80\x99t be here to kick around forever.'b'Still, the first days of this new Democratic-led Congress turned out better than anyone might have expected. Given the party\xe2\x80\x99s recent Congressional history, any success is notable \xe2\x80\x94 even if it\xe2\x80\x99s only 100 hours long.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c51% of Women Are Now Living Without Spouse\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 16):'b'Being an \xe2\x80\x9cold wife\xe2\x80\x9d can be the most dreary prospect a mature woman can imagine; being a new woman the most pleasantly challenging and rewarding situation to awaken to.'b'After all, after a lifetime of servitude to a husband who has morphed into an increasingly petulant and dissatisfied ungrateful wretch of a so-called partner who wants to \xe2\x80\x9cmove on,\xe2\x80\x9d newly emancipated older women, former \xe2\x80\x9cold wives,\xe2\x80\x9d can discover how delicious it is to be alone.'b'What carry the day are imagination, enthusiasm, skills honed through years of managing an entire household now so simple for one\xe2\x80\x99s self.

Why are people continually expected to swim against the tide?'b'Karin J. Lauria'b'Marlborough, Mass., Jan. 11, 2007'b'Of the many ways that President Bush has trampled civil liberties and the balance of powers since the 9/11 attacks, one of the most egregious was his decision to order wiretaps of Americans\xe2\x80\x99  international calls and e-mail without court approval. It was good news, then, when the administration announced yesterday that it would now seek a warrant from the proper court for that sort of eavesdropping.'b'The president\xe2\x80\x99s decision hardly ends this constitutional crisis. Among other things, the public needs to know why Mr. Bush broke the law for more than five years and what should be done to ensure there will be no more abuses of the wiretap statute.'b'But we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee that Mr. Bush had decided to end the warrantless program. He said the administration had worked out a way to speed the process of getting a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to intercept communications to and from the United States \xe2\x80\x9cwhere there is probable cause to believe that one of the communicants is a member or agent of Al Qaeda or an associated terrorist organization.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He said the court \xe2\x80\x94 created by the 1978 law on domestic wiretapping \xe2\x80\x94 issued an order on Jan. 10 governing this new process and that eavesdropping under \xe2\x80\x9cthe terrorist surveillance program\xe2\x80\x9d would be subject to the court\xe2\x80\x99s approval. There are still some big unanswered questions. For one thing, because the new warrant process is secret, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether the court has issued a blanket approval for wiretapping, which would undermine the intent of the law, or whether the administration agreed to seek individual warrants.'b'It was also troubling that Mr. Gonzales repeated his insistence that the warrantless spying was legal. That suggests that the administration \xe2\x80\x94 which has never explained why it could not have sought warrants from the start and turned down offers to amend the law \xe2\x80\x94 will continue to resist legislative oversight of the wiretapping. It\xe2\x80\x99s also likely to argue that the lawsuits challenging the eavesdropping should be dismissed. The damage has already been done by the president\xe2\x80\x99s decision to ignore the law, and the lawsuits should proceed.'b'Mr. Gonzales\xe2\x80\x99s announcement clearly was politically timed: he will appear today before the Judiciary Committee, now controlled by Democrats who have vowed to investigate the eavesdropping.'b'We hope they will do that. Congress has a legitimate interest in the creation of this program, which has always seemed motivated more by the president\xe2\x80\x99s relentless campaign to expand his powers than by a real need to speed intelligence gathering.'b'We strongly agree with John Rockefeller IV, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe administration\xe2\x80\x99s go-it-alone approach, effectively excluding Congress and the courts and operating outside the law, was unnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d and that the White House should turn over documents on the creation of the wiretapping program.

But we drove through flurries in the Mojave Desert, and the traffic jam was caused by more snow falling on the San Bernardino side of the pass than we had seen at home in all of November and December.

The scale of the road system \xe2\x80\x94 the volume and velocity of its traffic \xe2\x80\x94 seemed grievous.

By coincidence, we began the book as we crossed the Mississippi into St. Louis, and whenever Parkman mentioned the trail to Santa Fe, we felt a historical serendipity, as if we had more in common with him than the fact that we were pointed west.'b'From the distance of 160 years, it is easy to see the boundaries of Parkman\xe2\x80\x99s historical epoch. Every buffalo he comes across is \xe2\x80\x9cstupid,\xe2\x80\x9d and of the bulls he writes, \xe2\x80\x9cThousands of them might be slaughtered without causing any detriment to the species, for their numbers greatly exceed those of the cows.\xe2\x80\x9d He feels a profound ambivalence toward the emigrants who are just beginning to crowd the trails west. He can praise the Indians he meets only by comparing their bodies to the works of ancient Greek sculptors.'b'Parkman was not yet 23, and he carried a large quiver of judgments, all of them sharp-edged and many utterly wrong. Most of them he eventually set aside, becoming one of America\xe2\x80\x99s greatest historians. We listened to him not for his prejudices but for his powers of observation, his ability to translate the freshness of the prairie in language that still sounds newly felt. While Lindy drove, I thought about a sentence of Parkman\xe2\x80\x99s, something he says after an unnamed Indian looks at a vacated campsite and names the very men who stopped there. \xe2\x80\x9cBy what instinct he had arrived at such accurate conclusions,\xe2\x80\x9d Parkman writes, \xe2\x80\x9cI am utterly at a loss to divine.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The real question, of course, is by what instinct Parkman chalked up the careful observations of a very different mind to instinct. It was a way of asserting primacy, of assuming that that Indian knew what he knew without knowing how.

He was informed that he had just been replaced by J. Timothy Griffin, a Republican political operative who has spent the last few years working as an opposition researcher for Karl Rove.'b'Mr. Cummins\xe2\x80\x99s case isn\xe2\x80\x99t unique. Since the middle of last month, the Bush administration has pushed out at least four U.S. attorneys, and possibly as many as seven, without explanation. The list includes Carol Lam, the U.S. attorney for San Diego, who successfully prosecuted Duke Cunningham, a Republican congressman, on major corruption charges. The top F.B.I. official in San Diego told The San Diego Union-Tribune that Ms. Lam\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal would undermine multiple continuing investigations.'b'In Senate testimony yesterday, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales refused to say how many other attorneys have been asked to resign, calling it a \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel matter.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In case you\xe2\x80\x99re wondering, such a wholesale firing of prosecutors midway through an administration isn\xe2\x80\x99t normal.

For  six years ethical problems and conflicts of interest have been the rule, not the exception.'b'For a long time the administration nonetheless seemed untouchable, protected both by Republican control of Congress and by its ability to justify anything and everything as necessary for the war on terror. Now, however, the investigations are closing in on the Oval Office. The latest news is that  J. Steven Griles, the former deputy secretary of the Interior Department and the poster child for the administration\xe2\x80\x99s systematic policy of putting foxes in charge of henhouses, is finally facing possible indictment.'b'And the purge of U.S. attorneys looks like a pre-emptive strike against the gathering forces of justice.'b'Won\xe2\x80\x99t the administration have trouble getting its new appointees confirmed by the Senate? Well, it turns out that it won\xe2\x80\x99t have to.'b'Arlen Specter, the Republican senator who headed the Judiciary Committee until Congress changed hands, made sure of that last year. Previously, new U.S. attorneys needed Senate confirmation within 120 days or federal district courts would name replacements.  But as part of a conference committee reconciling  House and Senate versions of the revised Patriot Act,  Mr. Specter slipped in a clause eliminating that rule.'b'As Paul Kiel of 'b'TPMmuckraker.com'b'  \xe2\x80\x94 which has done yeoman investigative reporting on this story  \xe2\x80\x94 put it, this clause in effect allows the administration \xe2\x80\x9cto handpick replacements and keep them there in perpetuity without the ordeal of Senate confirmation.\xe2\x80\x9d How convenient.'b'Mr. Gonzales says that there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing political about the firings. And according to The Associated Press, he said that district court judges shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t appoint U.S. attorneys because they \xe2\x80\x9ctend to appoint friends and others not properly qualified to be prosecutors.\xe2\x80\x9d Words fail me.'b'Mr. Gonzales also says that the administration intends to get Senate confirmation for every replacement. Sorry, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not at all credible, even if we ignore the administration\xe2\x80\x99s track record. Mr. Griffin, the political-operative-turned-prosecutor, would be savaged in a confirmation hearing. By appointing him, the administration showed that it has no intention of following the usual rules.'b'The broader context is this: defeat in the midterm elections hasn\xe2\x80\x99t led the Bush administration to scale back its imperial view of presidential power.'b'On the contrary, now that President Bush can no longer count on Congress to do his bidding, he\xe2\x80\x99s more determined than ever to claim essentially unlimited authority  \xe2\x80\x94 whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the authority to send more troops into Iraq  or the authority to stonewall investigations into his own administration\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.'b'The next two years, in other words, are going to be a rolling constitutional crisis.'b''b'Correction Appended'b''b'It is hard to render a convincing apology when you are not really apologizing. Consider Charles Stimson, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for detainee affairs, who has been trying to spin his way out of his loathsome attempt to punish lawyers who represent inmates of the Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay internment camp.'b'Last week, Mr. Stimson expressed his \xe2\x80\x9cshock\xe2\x80\x9d that major American law firms would represent terrorism suspects, hinted that they were paid by unsavory characters and suggested that companies should reconsider doing business with them. On Wednesday, Mr. Stimson said he apologized and regretted that his comments \xe2\x80\x9cleft the impression\xe2\x80\x9d that he was attacking the integrity of those lawyers.'b'It was not just an impression.  It was exactly what he did. Mr. Stimson actually read out a list of law firms during an interview with a radio station friendly to the Bush administration.'b'Mr. Stimson clearly had no regard for his position as a public official who helps set policy on the detainees, never mind the small matter of people\xe2\x80\x99s basic right to representation. He connected the detainees to the 9/11 attacks, even though he certainly knows that the very few detainees who have a connection to 9/11 don\xe2\x80\x99t have legal representation.'b'President Bush and Defense Secretary Robert Gates should have fired him. Their silence was deafening, although hardly surprising given the administration\xe2\x80\x99s record of trampling on people\xe2\x80\x99s rights in the name of fighting terror. But Attorney General Alberto Gonzales was not silent. In an interview with The Associated Press, Mr. Gonzales actually expanded the attack on lawyers, claiming that it has taken as long as five years to bring detainees to trial because of delays caused by their lawyers.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s no truth to that. The cause of the delay in bringing any Guant\xc3\xa1namo detainee to trial is Mr. Bush himself. He refused to hold trials at first, then refused to work with Congress on the issue and claimed the power to devise his own slanted court system. Mr. Bush went to Congress only when the Supreme Court struck those courts down. The result was a bill establishing military tribunals for detainees that is a mockery of American justice.'b'Mr. Stimson\xe2\x80\x99s appalling behavior should not be overlooked by the relevant bar disciplinary committee.  Existing rules for lawyers deem  it professional misconduct to do things that are prejudicial to the administration of justice. Even if the administration does not, the legal profession imposes a higher duty on those holding public office to obey proper standards of behavior.'b'It is bad enough for troops in Iraq to learn that their tours of duty have been extended. It is terrible for them to have to hear about it from loved ones at home rather than from their military commanders.'b'This is what happened to about 150 New Jersey National Guard troops who had been scheduled to return home in March after having served in Iraq for a year. Their tours of duty were extended for up to 125 days as a result of President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s decision to send more than 20,000 additional troops to Iraq.'b'A day after Mr. Bush announced the troop increase in a televised speech, the National Guard in New Jersey told family members that their relatives would have to stay on. The news quickly made it back to the troops in Iraq through anguished phone calls and e-mail.'b'Not until Sunday \xe2\x80\x94 four days after Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s speech \xe2\x80\x94 were the troops notified by their Army commanders, after Gov. Jon Corzine of New Jersey made two phone calls to Army officials.'b'Mr. Corzine, who had learned of the lapse from outraged family members, said that Pentagon officials expressed regret and blamed the delay on a \xe2\x80\x9cbreakdown in the chain of command on the ground in Iraq.\xe2\x80\x9d The governor rightly called what happened \xe2\x80\x9cunacceptable.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But given all that has gone wrong with the misguided American adventure in Iraq, the foul-up is hardly surprising.

The reforms are not perfect, and some details remain sketchy, but they are an important step toward making the movies rating more transparent and fair.'b'Movie ratings help shape the culture. An NC-17 rating can be so harmful at the box office that moviemakers self-censor to avoid one. The documentary \xe2\x80\x9cThis Film Is Not Yet Rated\xe2\x80\x9d shined a highly unflattering light on how these ratings are handed out.'b'It revealed that most of the people who do the ratings are anonymous, so the public cannot tell if they are qualified and impartial. Some of the \xe2\x80\x9cparents\xe2\x80\x9d who rate movies are parents of adult children, not the sort the public thinks are involved. When moviemakers appeal a rating they are, bizarrely, prohibited from citing the ratings of other movies.'b'Under the new rules, which have been spearheaded by Dan Glickman, chairman of the Motion Picture Association of America, the top three movie raters will be named on the association\xe2\x80\x99s Web site, and there will be descriptive information about the other raters. The Web site will also include the rules of the rating system, now available only on request.'b'Raters will be retired when their children grow up. Filmmakers will be able to cite other films in their appeals, though it remains unclear how much weight these appeals to precedent will carry.'b'The reforms \xe2\x80\x94 which will be more fully explained in the next few days \xe2\x80\x94 are laudable, but do not go as far as they should. The identity of anyone who rates a film or rules on an appeal should be public. Good conflict-of-interest rules can prevent them from being exposed to undue influence, while identifying the raters would increase public confidence.'b'Mr. Glickman, who inherited the system from his predecessor, deserves credit for pushing for these changes. He says there are likely to be more reforms ahead, which is good, because there is still more to be done.'b'In the long and sordid story of Hurricane Katrina, a new low may be approaching. In Louisiana alone, tens of thousands of displaced families who rely on the government to provide trailers or rent will lose their temporary housing next month  \xe2\x80\x94 unless the Bush administration extends the standard 18-month time limit for their federal aid.'b'A year and a half is a long time for anything that is supposed to be transitional, as the families still trapped in cramped, flimsy trailers can testify. But the temporary help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency cannot end until the victims have somewhere else to go. And the federal and local governments have moved far too slowly in providing the necessary reconstruction money and building guidance. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita destroyed more than 200,000 homes in Louisiana, and only a small fraction have been replaced. (Neither the state nor the New Orleans city government knows how many have been completed.) A sky-high murder rate has dominated the news. The success of the Saints professional football team is not enough of a distraction.'b'The response to the drowning of New Orleans has been a failure on every level. President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s eloquent promise in Jackson Square to rebuild \xe2\x80\x9chigher and better\xe2\x80\x9d soothed the nation. But since then there has been no concrete action plan for reconstruction \xe2\x80\x94 only a patchwork of programs marked by dithering, bickering and bureaucratic finger-pointing throughout. The federal response was, after great delay, largely to cut a check and let overmatched local officials try to sort it out.'b'The president\xe2\x80\x99s Katrina czar, Donald Powell, sees his role as one of a convener, adviser and advocate rather than leader of a domestic Marshall Plan \xe2\x80\x94 which is what New Orleans needs. He says that local officials should take the lead. But the local reconstruction plan has yet to materialize. City officials hope that it will be out by the end of the month.'b'There is some local optimism that when it does arrive there will be a burst of rebuilding effort. Developers are finally beginning to break ground on apartment complexes. The city has issued more than 55,000 residential building permits since the storm, finally moving at a faster rate than before Katrina.'b'But the time is long past to turn from planning to action. And those in need of shelter today cannot take comfort in housing that won\xe2\x80\x99t be ready for another two years. The administration must extend the temporary housing provisions immediately, then make every effort to shift aid recipients to the longer-term Section 8 voucher program.'b'The new Democratic leaders in Congress also need to recognize that the many failures of Hurricane Katrina are more than just another reason to criticize the president. They need to quickly outline their own plans for salvaging New Orleans, so evacuees can once again call their city home.'b'That New Orleans remains a shattered city is a sad monument to impotence for the most powerful country in the world.

Many of the students I\xe2\x80\x99ve known won\xe2\x80\x99t sit down unless they\xe2\x80\x99re repeatedly asked to (maybe not even then), and they don\xe2\x80\x99t listen just because the teacher is speaking; even \xe2\x80\x9cgood teachers\xe2\x80\x9d are occasionally drowned out by the din of 30 students  simultaneously using language that would easily earn a movie an NC-17 rating.'b'When a fight breaks out during an English lesson, Ms. Gruwell steps into the hallway and a security guard immediately materializes to break it up.

This is  the Myth of the Great Teacher.'b'Films like \xe2\x80\x9cFreedom Writers\xe2\x80\x9d portray teachers more as  missionaries than professionals, eager to give up their lives and comfort for the benefit of others, without need of compensation. Ms. Gruwell sacrifices money, time and even her marriage for her job.'b'Her behavior is not represented as obsessive or self-destructive, but driven \xe2\x80\x94 necessary, even. She is forced into making these sacrifices by the aggressive neglect of the school\xe2\x80\x99s administrators, who won\xe2\x80\x99t even let her take books from the bookroom.

In order to be a good teacher, she has to be a hero.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFreedom Writers,\xe2\x80\x9d like all teacher movies this side of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,\xe2\x80\x9d is presented as a celebration of teaching, but its message  is that poor students need only love, idealism and martyrdom.'b'I won\xe2\x80\x99t argue the need for more of the first two, but I\xe2\x80\x99m always surprised at how, once a Ms. Gruwell  wins over a class with clowning, tears, rewards and motivational speeches, there is nothing those kids can\xe2\x80\x99t do. It is as if all the previously insurmountable obstacles students face could be erased by a 10-minute pep talk or a fancy dinner. This trivializes not only the  difficulties many real students must overcome, but also the hard-earned skill and tireless effort real teachers must use to help those students succeed.'b'Every year young people enter the teaching profession hoping to emulate the teachers they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in films. (Maybe in the back of my mind I felt that I could be an inspiring teacher like Howard Hesseman or Gabe Kaplan.) But when you\xe2\x80\x99re confronted with the reality of teaching not just one class of misunderstood teenagers (the common television and movie conceit) but four or five  every day, and dealing with parents, administrators, mentors, grades, attendance records, standardized tests and individual education plans for children with learning disabilities, not to mention multiple daily lesson plans \xe2\x80\x94 all without being able to count on the support of your superiors \xe2\x80\x94 it becomes harder to measure up to the heroic movie teachers you thought you might be.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that half the teachers in poor urban schools, like Erin Gruwell herself, quit within five years. (Ms. Gruwell now heads a foundation.)'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to be thought of as a hero for doing my job. I do expect to be respected, supported, trusted and paid. And while I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that Hollywood will stop producing movies about gold-hearted mavericks who play by their own rules and show the suits how to get the job done, I do hope that these movies will be kept in perspective.'b'While no one believes that hospitals are really like \xe2\x80\x9cER\xe2\x80\x9d or that doctors are anything like \xe2\x80\x9cHouse,\xe2\x80\x9d no one blames doctors for the failure of the health care system. From No Child Left Behind to City Hall, teachers are accused of being incompetent and underqualified, while their appeals for better and safer workplaces are systematically ignored.'b'Every day teachers are blamed for what the system they\xe2\x80\x99re just a part of doesn\xe2\x80\x99t provide: safe,  adequately staffed schools with the highest expectations for all students. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not something one maverick teacher, no matter how idealistic, perky or self-sacrificing, can accomplish.'b'Well, so much for our daffodils! They all bloomed in our front yard last week. They now form a nice bright yellow cluster at the bottom of our driveway. Temperatures of 65 degrees in Washington in January will do that.

Maybe next year we\xe2\x80\x99ll try for roses in February.'b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t know about you, but when I see things in nature that I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen in my life, like daffodils blooming in January, it starts to feel creepy, like a \xe2\x80\x9cTwilight Zone\xe2\x80\x9d segment. I half expect to wake one day and find Rod Serling mowing my lawn  \xe2\x80\x94 in shorts.'b'Why not? Last December was the fourth warmest on record, and 2006 was the hottest year in America since 1895. It was declared the hottest in Britain since 1659.'b'Even the White House seems to have noticed. Al Hubbard, the president\xe2\x80\x99s economic adviser, says Mr. Bush will soon unveil an energy independence strategy that will produce \xe2\x80\x9cheadlines above the fold that will knock your socks off.\xe2\x80\x9d Since everything the president has done on energy up to now has left my socks firmly in place, I will be eager to hear what Mr. Bush says.'b'Neither the White House nor the Democratic Party seems to grasp that the public and business community are miles ahead of them on this energy/environment issue. The presidential candidate who finally figures that out, though  \xe2\x80\x94 and comes up with a compelling energy/environment agenda  \xe2\x80\x94 is going to have a real leg up in 2008.'b'What would be compelling? I used to think it would be a \xe2\x80\x9cManhattan Project\xe2\x80\x9d on energy. I don\xe2\x80\x99t any longer. I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned that there is no magic bullet for reducing our dependence on oil and emissions of greenhouse gases  \xe2\x80\x94 and politicians who call for one are usually just trying to avoid asking for sacrifice today.'b'The right rallying call is for a \xe2\x80\x9cGreen New Deal.\xe2\x80\x9d The New Deal was not built on a magic bullet, but on a broad range of programs and industrial projects to revitalize America. Ditto for an energy New Deal. If we are to turn the tide on climate change and end our oil addiction, we need more of everything: solar, wind, hydro, ethanol, biodiesel, clean coal and nuclear power \xe2\x80\x94 and conservation.'b'It takes a Green New Deal because to nurture all of these technologies to a point that they really scale would be a huge industrial project. If you have put a windmill in your yard or some solar panels on your roof, bless your heart. But we will only green the world when we change the very nature of the electricity grid  \xe2\x80\x94 moving it away from dirty coal or oil to clean coal and renewables. And that is a huge industrial project \xe2\x80\x94 much bigger than anyone has told you. Finally, like the New Deal, if we undertake the green version, it has the potential to create a whole new clean power industry to spur our economy into the 21st century.'b'To spark a Green New Deal today requires getting two things right: government regulations and prices. Look at California. By setting steadily higher standards for the energy efficiency of buildings and appliances  \xe2\x80\x94 and creating incentives for utilities to work with consumers to use less power  \xe2\x80\x94 California has held its per-capita electricity use constant for 30 years, while the rest of the nation has seen per- capita electricity use increase by nearly 50 percent, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. That has saved California from building 24 giant power plants.'b'Had Ronald Reagan not rolled back the higher fuel efficiency standards imposed on Detroit, we might need no Middle East oil today. High standards force innovation, and innovation leads to conservation at scale.'b'But prices also matter. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care whether it is a federal gasoline tax, carbon tax, B.T.U. tax or cap-and-trade system, power utilities, factories and car owners have to be required to pay the real and full cost to society of the carbon they put into the atmosphere. And higher costs for fossil fuels make more costly clean alternatives more competitive.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe regulated utilities are the most important consumers from the perspective of long-term investment, and if they are not required to value carbon reduction then they will under-invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter Darbee, chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric, said to me.'b'This isn\xe2\x80\x99t rocket science. Government standards matter. They drive innovation and efficiency. And prices matter. They drive more and cleaner energy choices. So when the president unveils his energy proposals, if they don\xe2\x80\x99t call for higher efficiency standards and higher prices for fossil fuels  \xe2\x80\x94 take your socks off yourself. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to get hot around here.'b'Washington'b'WITH each new round of argument, the ethical questions at the heart of the embryonic stem cell debate get buried under more layers of hype and confusion.'b'Backers of a House bill, approved last week, that would loosen the limits on federal support for the research argue that there is now a \xe2\x80\x9cban\xe2\x80\x9d on financing, that embryonic stem cells will cure tens of millions and that current federal policy sets American scientists behind their foreign counterparts. But the Bush administration has spent more than $100 million on embryonic stem cell research in the past six years; the research, while promising, remains purely speculative; and American scientists hold a huge and steady lead that no other country comes close to challenging.'b'Defenders of the president\xe2\x80\x99s policy, meanwhile, too often get caught up in comparing adult and embryonic stem cell research. This leads them to deny the utility of embryonic cells, which scientists clearly do find useful, rather than articulating the moral justification for a policy that avoids the destruction of developing life.'b'All of this leaves us confused over just what the debate is about. It is, to begin with, not about stem cell research, any more than an argument about the lethal extraction of livers from Chinese political prisoners would be a debate about organ transplantation. There are ethical and unethical ways to transplant organs, and there are ethical and unethical ways to conduct stem cell research. The question is to which category a particular technique \xe2\x80\x94 the destruction of living embryos for their cells \xe2\x80\x94 belongs.'b'The debate is also not about whether there ought to be ethical limits on science. Everyone agrees there should be strict limits when research involves human subjects. The question is whether embryos destroyed for their cells are such human subjects.'b'But that does not mean the stem cell debate is about when human life begins. It is a simple and uncontroversial biological fact that a human life begins when an embryo is created. That embryo is human, and it is alive; its human life will last until its death, whether that comes days after conception or many decades later surrounded by children and grandchildren.'b'But the biological fact that a human life begins at conception does not by itself settle the ethical debate. The human embryo is a human organism, but is this being \xe2\x80\x94 microscopically small, with no self-awareness and little resemblance to us \xe2\x80\x94 a person, with a right to life?'b'Many advocates of federal financing for embryo-destructive research begin from a negative answer to that question. They argue that the human embryo is just too small, too unlike us in appearance, or too lacking in consciousness or sensitivity to pain or other critical mental capacity to be granted a place in the human family. But surely America has learned the hard way not to assign human worth by appearances. And surely we would not deny those who have lost some mental faculties the right to be regarded with respect and protected from harm. Why should we deny it to those whose faculties are still developing?'b'At its heart, then, when the biology and politics have been stipulated away, the stem cell debate is not about when human life begins but about whether every human life is equal. The circumstances of the embryo outside the body of a mother put that question in perhaps the most exaggerated form imaginable, but they do not change the question.'b'America\xe2\x80\x99s birth charter, the Declaration of Independence, asserts a positive answer to the question, and in lieu of an argument offers another assertion: that our equality is self-evident. But it is not. Indeed, the evidence of nature sometimes makes it very hard to believe that all human beings are equal. It takes a profound moral case to defend the proposition that the youngest and the oldest, the weakest and the strongest, all of us, simply by virtue of our common humanity, are in some basic and inalienable way equals.'b'Our faith in that essential liberal proposition is under attack by our own humanitarian impulses in the stem cell debate, and it will be under further attack as biotechnology progresses. But the stem cell debate, our first real test, should also be the easiest. We do not, at least in this instance, face a choice between science and the liberal society. We face the challenge of championing both.'b'President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s stem cell policy seeks to meet that challenge. It encourages scientists to pursue the cells they seek without destroying life. Scientific advances in the past two years have suggested that this can be done: that \xe2\x80\x9cpluripotent\xe2\x80\x9d cells could be developed without harming human embryos; that stem cell science and ethics can be reconciled. But some members of Congress nonetheless insist on a policy that sets the two at odds.'b'If we cannot pass this first and simplest test of our devotion to human equality and dignity in the age of biotechnology, we will have little chance of meeting the far more difficult challenges to come. Biomedical science can offer us tremendous benefits, but only if we make sure they do not come at the cost of our highest ideals.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cWhat $1.2 Trillion Can Buy\xe2\x80\x9d (Business Day, Jan. 17):'b'David Leonhardt\xe2\x80\x99s column about the opportunity costs of the Iraq war was long overdue, because it put those costs in perspective.'b'This war is tragic when viewed through any lens, but it is especially so when one considers the diseases that could have been eradicated, the energy dilemmas resolved, the cities that could have been rebuilt, and the knowledge, culture and good will that could have been nurtured with a trillion dollars.'b'Shock and awe indeed.'b'Alan H.

Roosevelt dedicated the first federal presidential library \xe2\x80\x94 actually an archive and history museum \xe2\x80\x94 in 1941, each president has had a hand in developing his own memorial. The National Archives and Records Administration now oversees 11 presidential libraries that draw about two million tourists and thousands of scholars each year.'b'The uproar over President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s plans to store his papers at Southern Methodist University has drawn new attention to the role of our system of presidential libraries. It is a system facing at least six challenges that need to be addressed by Congress, current and former presidents, host universities and the American public.'b'First, according to the Office of Presidential Libraries, it will take up to 100 years  for the papers and records at the recent presidential libraries to be processed, primarily because of an explosion in the number of records created by the executive branch. The Roosevelt Library has 17 million pages of documents, while the Clinton Library has more than 76 million, but the number of archivists has not kept pace.'b'A wait of 100 years is unacceptable. To be able to learn from our history, scholars, journalists and the public need access to a majority of records in presidential libraries within 20 years after a president leaves office. To meet this challenge, the newer libraries must add a substantial number of archivists, as well as new processing protocols and systems.'b'Second, we should insist on historical accuracy, completeness and balance in the museums in presidential libraries. Although the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Presidential Libraries states that the museum exhibits in presidential libraries should be accurate, historical amnesia is common in relation to a president\xe2\x80\x99s mistakes and controversial policies. For example, the museum in the Reagan Library does not mention the Iran-contra scandal.'b'The exhibits in newer presidential libraries often amount to little more than extended campaign commercials in museum form, because the former president and his supporters essentially control the content. If a president wants a museum of political propaganda, let him make that plain by not asking the federal government to administer it, but instead raising the large endowment needed to run it as a private memorial.'b'Since 99 percent of visitors to presidential libraries are there for the museum exhibits, this is an important issue. The exhibitions in older libraries usually improve after the president dies and the power of his supporters slowly wanes, but it should not take 20 to 50 years to get historically accurate displays in taxpayer-supported museums.'b'The Office of Presidential Libraries, however, bows to presidents\xe2\x80\x99 wishes for whitewashed museums. Congress should pass appropriate legislation on this issue. Each museum should be evaluated in a non-partisan fashion by a group of historians, and then changes should be made to ensure that the public gets the quality of information expected from a branch of the National Archives.'b'Third, the fund-raising for presidential libraries needs to be made transparent. Starting with Roosevelt, presidents have raised money from private sources and then turned their libraries over to be administered by the federal government. Currently donations are unregulated, and donors \xe2\x80\x94 whether individuals, corporations or even foreign governments \xe2\x80\x94 can remain anonymous. These donors can potentially wield real influence over a sitting president, without the knowledge of the public. Congress should require the disclosure of the identities of large donors and of the amounts involved.'b'Fourth, only a few libraries have strong educational programs. The Truman Library, for one, has developed an innovative program for middle and high school students called the White House Decision Center. The Decision Center recreates some areas of the West Wing, where students play the roles of President Truman, his advisers and members of his cabinet while dealing with a variety of historical crises. The Decision Center curriculum meets state and national standards for social studies, sharpening students\xe2\x80\x99 skills in cooperative group work, problem solving, and communication, while teaching them history using copies of primary documents from the library\xe2\x80\x99s archive. Libraries and Congress should find the private and public funds to develop other educational programs with serious historical content.'b'Fifth, presidential policy institutes associated with universities should be subject to academic oversight. This oversight should involve the appointment of a significant number of people from a variety of departments from the sponsoring university to the institute\xe2\x80\x99s governing board. The administration of the institute should be designed so that the university and the institute both gain from the association.'b'Finally, President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s 2001 executive order limiting access to the records in presidential library archives needs to be overturned. This order allows current and former presidents to block the release of materials from their presidential libraries for any reason, even because they are politically damaging. Records that might compromise national security are already protected from release by other laws and statutes, so this directive is clearly about political expediency.'b'President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s order is contrary to the spirit and letter of the laws that previously governed presidential libraries. Although so far only a small number of records have been blocked from release, the potential for the abuse of power exists. Congress should overturn this executive order.'b'Presidents are not required to have presidential libraries. Since Watergate, presidential records are not owned by each president but by the nation; a president could simply hand over his or her records to the National Archives. But if a president chooses to have a library, it is up to Congress, current and former presidents, host universities and the public to ensure that each library operates in the public interest.'b'At their best, presidential libraries are vital institutions that help us learn from our history. But if we give in to the worst impulses of presidents and their supporters, these libraries risk becoming temples of political propaganda.'b'It may seem odd to celebrate a prefix. After all, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t even a whole part of speech. It does for a word, visually, what a big cigar does for a small man. But even as prefixes go, \xe2\x80\x9cpost-\xe2\x80\x9d is unusually adaptable. It signifies transcendence, surpassing, moving past, leaving behind, and yet it does all these things while remaining attached to the very thing the prefix is leaving in the dust.'b'It is even capable of compounding itself. We are, of course, no longer postmodern but post-postmodern, if not in fact post-post-postmodern, which would make us not pomo, but popomo. We cling to post- in part because we have no idea what we are pre-. In these prefixes \xe2\x80\x94 post- and pre- \xe2\x80\x94 there is a world of wonderful confusion. Think only of the Pre-Raphaelites who were actually Victorians and thus, in fact, Post-Raphaelites.'b'The most innovative user of the prefix post-these days is the post-Austrian governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who says that he is now engaging in \xe2\x80\x9cpost-partisan\xe2\x80\x9d politics. He has a serious point, which is that the number of independent voters in the state is growing even as the number of registered Republicans and Democrats is dropping. To many of those independent voters, the arcane machinery of party politics may look a little antiquated, especially since the current occupant of the White House seems to be post-Republican \xe2\x80\x94 even post-electoral \xe2\x80\x94 though, of course, never post-partisan.'b'But calling himself post-partisan is really Mr. Schwarzenegger\xe2\x80\x99s way of cutting himself free from the political agenda of his nominal party. A few other politicians \xe2\x80\x94 Michael Bloomberg, for instance \xe2\x80\x94 might well use the word too.'b'The beautiful irony of it all is that there is nothing remotely post-political in being post-partisan.

Morton Mintz'b'Washington, Jan. 13, 2007'b'Dallas'b'WHEN I was a graduate student at Duke in 1981, the university was faced with a difficult decision: Should it accept the papers of its law school alumnus, Richard M. Nixon, and build a library and museum named for one of the most controversial presidents in American history? Some within the university said that to accept the papers would be to embrace a failed president who resigned in disgrace to avoid impeachment. Others argued that the documents would be a treasure trove for future scholars seeking to understand what happened during the turbulent years of the Nixon presidency.'b'At the time I had the luxury of watching this drama unfold from the sidelines. Today I do not. As the director of a center for political studies at Southern Methodist University, I was invited to sit on an academic planning committee for the George W. Bush presidential library. By agreeing to serve on this committee, I took a stand in favor of Southern Methodist University\xe2\x80\x99s bid for the library, in part because I think Duke made a mistake in not accepting the Nixon library.'b'George W. Bush \xe2\x80\x94 like Harry Truman, Richard Nixon, Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter in their day \xe2\x80\x94 is a controversial president for difficult times. But we must put partisanship aside and strive for historical perspective. We must consider the importance of having presidential libraries to help generations of scholars understand the times in which we live, and to inform future policy debates.'b'Whether one supports or opposes the Bush policies, there is no question that they have been momentous for the country and the world. Precisely because of the controversial nature of this presidency, the question of how George W. Bush made his decisions begs for scholarly research and discourse. The library will be a gold mine for scholars, and its location on a university campus symbolizes the need for study.'b'At Duke more than 20 years ago and at Southern Methodist today, opponents of such libraries have said that by building a presidential library and creating schools or institutes, a university compromises its values and endorses the policies of the president whose papers it accepts. I do not think this is the case. It is legitimate for anyone to criticize the president and his policies, but it is presumptuous for us as scholars to say that we know in advance and with certainty what the legacy of a sitting president will be.'b'Campuses are good places to situate presidential libraries because universities are vital to the American marketplace of ideas, and they are bulwarks of our free society. They can serve as repositories of archives from which we will learn and grow as a nation. But the faculty is a university\xe2\x80\x99s heart and soul, and faculty members are not disconnected from the politics of the moment.'b'As bad as the situation may seem today, back in 1971, when the University of Texas dedicated a library and school named for Lyndon Johnson, the country was in even greater turmoil. A storm of controversy raged over the Johnson papers. But I think the University of Texas made the right decision to accept the papers and build the library and school.'b'Southern Methodist University should do the same. Yes, former presidents are interested in polishing their legacies, and universities must be careful to remain nonpartisan and protect freedom of inquiry. But we must also take the long view, and that means building institutions that will serve generations to come, giving historians the chance to do their work.'b'Benon Sevan no longer works for the United Nations. But his indictment on federal corruption charges stemming from his long maladministration of the Iraqi oil-for-food program points to a continuing problem in the U.N. appointments system that Secretary General Ban Ki-moon needs to tackle without further delay.'b'Three successive secretaries general chose Mr. Sevan for a series of important jobs, despite his decidedly mixed performance. He is a typical product of a system in which who you know and where you come from count far more than merit or vision.'b'Mr. Sevan, a Cypriot, is accused, together with Ephraim Nadler, an Egyptian-born American citizen, of taking kickbacks from an Egyptian oil trader to help him win Iraqi oil contracts. Mr. Nadler happens to be a relative of Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the former secretary general. And Mr. Boutros-Ghali happens to have been one of the key promoters of Mr. Sevan\xe2\x80\x99s United Nations career.'b'The legal question of Mr. Sevan\xe2\x80\x99s guilt or innocence cannot be properly resolved unless he returns to this country for trial. He may choose not to, since he faces a possible 50-year jail sentence. Some of the charges in the indictment are backed up by the scathing findings of the earlier Volcker commission investigation of the oil-for-food scandal.'b'There is plenty of blame to go round. The program actually succeeded in its main aim of helping to shield innocent Iraqis from the pain of prolonged international sanctions against Saddam Hussein\xe2\x80\x99s regime. But Security Council members, including the United States, failed to monitor its administration diligently and deliberately winked at Iraqi oil smuggling that benefited American allies.'b'But eliminating the dirty little bargains that have always characterized international diplomacy will be a lot harder than reforming the United Nations\xe2\x80\x99 dysfunctional personnel system. That system\xe2\x80\x99s multiple failings, of which this is only the best-known example, has badly hurt the United Nations\xe2\x80\x99 credibility and effectiveness and handed a ready stick to its many enemies.'b'Mr. Ban has repeatedly talked about reforming this disastrous personnel system. But his early appointments show little sign of actually doing so. Mr. Sevan\xe2\x80\x99s indictment should be a reminder of why Mr. Ban needs to do better.'b'China spread alarm and consternation among space powers when it destroyed one of its own satellites last week with a missile fired from the ground, thus becoming the first nation in more than two decades to successfully test an antisatellite weapon. This aggressive show of force puts a wide range of United States military and intelligence satellites at risk and holds the danger of starting an arms race in space. Too bad the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s own bellicose attitudes \xe2\x80\x94 and adamant refusal to consider an arms control treaty for space \xe2\x80\x94 give it scant standing to chastise the Chinese. The administration needs to reverse course promptly and join in talks aimed at banning further tests or use of antisatellite weapons.'b'The Chinese test, which Beijing has not acknowledged but was tracked by intelligence agencies, destroyed an aging communications satellite some 500 miles above the Earth. The missile smashed the satellite into hundreds of pieces large enough to pose a danger for a decade or more to spacecraft or satellites that pass through the debris.'b'The Chinese have now demonstrated that \xe2\x80\x94 should they ever choose \xe2\x80\x94 they could destroy essential American satellites used to conduct military reconnaissance, spot nuclear tests and direct smart weapons. A top intelligence official told reporters last August that China had used a ground-based laser to illuminate an American satellite. That could signal a nascent effort to develop a way to blind satellites or to guide a missile to a target in space.'b'The Bush administration has been flexing its own muscles in space. A national space policy issued in October declared that \xe2\x80\x9cfreedom of action in space is as important to the United States as air power and sea power.\xe2\x80\x9d It asserted a need to deter others from interfering with America\xe2\x80\x99s right to operate in space. The policy did not address whether Washington would place weapons in space \xe2\x80\x94 as some in the Pentagon have been urging \xe2\x80\x94 but the administration continues to oppose any restrictions.'b'Surely it would make military and diplomatic sense to pursue the opposite course and seek to ban all tests and any use of antisatellite weapons.'b'The United States and the Soviet Union successfully tested such weapons decades ago and have no overriding need to develop better versions, although the United States is clearly trying. China\xe2\x80\x99s success in matching the feat reportedly came after three earlier tests failed, so the Chinese could only benefit from additional testing. The United States, with many more satellites in orbit than any other power and a military that has become increasingly dependent on satellites, has the most to lose from an unbridled space arms race.'b'Some experts suggest that China\xe2\x80\x99s latest test is intended to prod the United States to join serious negotiations. The way to counter China or any other potentially belligerent space power is through an arms control treaty, not a new arms race in space.'b'How to get a job in Washington, that balmy, bipartisan town: Direct an organization that opposes contraception on the grounds that it is \xe2\x80\x9cdemeaning to women.\xe2\x80\x9d Compare premarital sex to heroin addiction.

Dr. Keroack, a 46-year-old Massachusetts ob-gyn,  today oversees the $280 million Title X program, the only federal program \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to provide access to contraceptive supplies and information to all who want and need them, with priority given to low-income persons.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not a job that plays to Dr. Keroack\xe2\x80\x99s talents, which happen to be prodigious. In the PowerPoint presentation that has cemented his reputation, he makes the case that premarital sex suppresses the hormone oxytocin, thereby impairing one\xe2\x80\x99s ability to forge a successful long-term relationship. If forced to mince words you might call this fanciful or speculative. Otherwise you\xe2\x80\x99d call it wacko. \xe2\x80\x9cReally, really scary\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cutterly hilarious\xe2\x80\x9d were the first two reactions I heard from scientists.'b'Each of us owes a rather critical debt to oxytocin. It\xe2\x80\x99s what moves a new mother to comfort and nurse a squalling baby rather than to toss it from the window, as common sense might dictate. It is  \xe2\x80\x94 you knew your husband was missing something  \xe2\x80\x94 the hormone of intimacy. (No, you can\xe2\x80\x99t buy supplements across the border. And yes, OxyContin is something different. Rush Limbaugh was not working on his bonding instincts.)'b'Louann Brizendine, a neuropsychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco,   calls oxytocin the Glinda the Good Witch of her field. It is the drug of trust and partnership and attachment, commonly known by their street name: love. Oxytocin mellows, elates, and throws you into a mental fog. Rats prefer it to cocaine. While the rush at childbirth is particularly dramatic, the hormone swells with physical and emotional bonding of all kinds.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSurge\xe2\x80\x9d has not always been a dirty word.'b'But no one has had as much good, clean fun with oxytocin as Dr. Keroack, for whom it is \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s superglue.\xe2\x80\x9d Extrapolating in part from research with prairie voles, which are monogamous, he postulates that oxytocin cannot survive too much sex, at least with multiple partners, at least prior to marriage. By way of demonstration he proposes the duct tape test: you need only an adhesive and a hairy arm. The tape represents the brain. Press it down. Now reapply. See what happens? Less sticky, right? Concludes Keroack: \xe2\x80\x9cBasically, you will end up damaging your brain\xe2\x80\x99s ability to use the oxytocin system as a chemical mechanism that serves to help you successfully bond in future relationships.\xe2\x80\x9d Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask about his illustrations. They are offensive.'b'Keroack presents this as gospel truth, though the scientists on whose research he bases his theory balk. One called it a wild leap. \xe2\x80\x9cA bungee jump without a cord,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested another expert. Dr. Brizendine had a less kind word for it. She adds that while premarital sex cannot ruin your oxytocin response, it has been shown  \xe2\x80\x94 in the absence of options  \xe2\x80\x94 to ruin your life. Something tells me that Dr. Keroack is not planning a 34th anniversary bash on Monday for Roe v. Wade.'b'I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking: if Dr. Keroack can write stuff this outlandish he\xe2\x80\x99s spelling his name wrong. As the other Kerouac said  \xe2\x80\x94 arguably with a firmer grasp of neurochemistry  \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cI had nothing to offer anybody but my own confusion.\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Keroack may want to borrow the disclaimer that prefaces Michael Crichton\xe2\x80\x99s newest best-seller: \xe2\x80\x9cThis novel is fiction, except for the parts that aren\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d It takes an agenda rather than a medical degree to engage in this kind of science. Or an imagination.'b'In all fairness, Dr. Keroack has long been a little clumsy as an analogist. In a 2001 letter to the Massachusetts Legislature he explained the logic of performing sonograms on women considering abortion: \xe2\x80\x9cEven Midas lets you look at your old muffler before they advise you to change it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There are many ways to define demeaning.'b'The Senate has finally passed credible reforms of its shabby ethics code, reining in lawmakers\xe2\x80\x99 more egregious quid pro quo dealings with their fund-raising cohorts in the lobbying industry. The Republican minority had second thoughts about how its transparently obstructionist tactics would look to constituents. And an overwhelming majority then approved the first serious anticorruption strictures since the Watergate era, banning gifts, entertainment, travel and other inducements that lobbyists and their employers use in greasing privileged access to lawmakers and their staffs.'b'The Senate action is particularly praiseworthy for zeroing in on the money-sweet heart of the matter: lobbyists will have to disclose the way they \xe2\x80\x9cbundle\xe2\x80\x9d multiple corporate donations as campaign sweeteners for grateful lawmakers. Also, senators must henceforth pay full charter rates for the lobbyist-catered corporate jets they have been flying for token fees. And they will have to own up to the purpose and cost of their last-minute \xe2\x80\x9cearmarks\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 lucrative contracts for favored pleaders that are stealthily approved without debate.'b'The Senate also voted to end the lavish parties paid for by fawning fat cats to \xe2\x80\x9chonor\xe2\x80\x9d key politicians at the presidential conventions. And it voted against a growing scandal closer to home, barring spouses of newly elected members from lobbying the Senate.  Lawmakers also banned members from secretly negotiating for prized jobs in industries too often under their official purview.'b'These are strong measures, and Harry Reid, the majority leader, deserves credit for prevailing with a bipartisan approach despite his lobbyist-friendly instincts. Unfortunately, the Senate again failed to create an independent anticorruption monitor to reach beyond the clubby traditions that have masked abusers. Mr. Reid should join House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in pursuing this needed measure.'b'It was heartening to see that the bill was toughened, not undercut, by amendments from two Democrats and a Republican. Notably absent from the infighting was John McCain of Arizona, a past advocate for reform who may be too busy placating G.O.P. powers for his expected bid for the presidency. The Senate did well enough without him.'b'An Op-Ed article on Jan. 2, about coastal shipping, misstated a provision of the Merchant Marine Acts.

Mr. Fraser agrees that W. should have read the original \xe2\x80\x9cFlashman\xe2\x80\x9d before invading Afghanistan. It could have given him invaluable, if politically incorrect, insights that might have helped in the effort to catch Osama at Tora Bora and in the new push to stop the Taliban slouching toward Kandahar.'b'On a recent visit to Afghanistan, Robert Gates told nervous military commanders that he was open to sending more troops to thwart the Taliban from regrouping. Congressman John McHugh, who just returned from a trip to Afghanistan with Hillary Clinton and Evan Bayh, said that everyone they talked to had warned \xe2\x80\x9cthat when the snows melt in the mountains, it will bring a new onslaught from Al Qaeda and the Taliban ... one that directly threatens not just the Karzai presidency, but threatens Afghanistan itself, and logically, it follows, threatens our investment in blood and treasure.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFlashman\xe2\x80\x9d is based on a devastating British defeat during one of their wars in Afghanistan. After invading Kabul in 1839 and setting up an unpopular puppet shah, the British trekked through the snowy mountains to Jalalabad. Of more than 16,000 troops and camp followers, only one doctor survived; the rest were picked off in ambushes by Afghan warriors.'b'The lesson is that Afghanistan is a no man\xe2\x80\x99s land that can\xe2\x80\x99t be tamed by gringos. The British Empire, on which the sun never set, never succeeded in occupying Afghanistan even as it  engaged in the Great Game with the Russians for influence there. It was terra incognita and terra fuggedaboutit.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou could never forget that in Afghanistan you are walking a knife-edge the whole time,\xe2\x80\x9d Harry Flashman notes, adding that, like himself, the Afghans could be \xe2\x80\x9ccruel and bloodthirsty,\xe2\x80\x9d turning on you with no warning.'b'Mr. Fraser echoed those sentiments when I tracked him down at his home on the Isle of Man. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one has ever succeeded in invading Afghanistan,\xe2\x80\x9d the octogenarian who fought in Burma in World War II boomed with a trace of Scottish accent.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Afghans are extraordinary fighters, tough and resourceful and cruel, and they know their business inside out,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOn their own territory, they\xe2\x80\x99re unbeatable. They love fighting and dealing with invaders. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost a game to them. The country is Death Valley 10 times over. You see them on television in their robes with their weapons and that\xe2\x80\x99s all. The American and British troops are loaded with rubbishy equipment.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEventually, I suppose, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get out of Iraq and pretend it\xe2\x80\x99s been a success when it\xe2\x80\x99s just a mess. ... \xe2\x80\x9cAfghanistan is slightly different. You cannot ever win. When you consider the Russians put in more than 100,000 troops and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it.

According to the Connecticut Economic Resource Center, between 1990 and 2000, we lost a larger percentage of 18- to 34-year-olds than any other state, 23 percent, or more than 200,000 people.'b'One big reason is that it is becoming difficult for any person, particularly a young person, to buy a home here without having a very high salary. Rents, too, are exorbitant. The median price of a single-family home in Fairfield County was more than a half-million dollars in 2005, and monthly rents for two-bedroom apartments in the Stamford-Norwalk area on average were around $1,500.'b'The lack of affordable housing has created a huge problem for businesses who are finding fewer bright applicants. The high price of homes not only turns people away but also forces those who have jobs to live further and further from their workplace, contributing to highway gridlock and adding to Connecticut\xe2\x80\x99s considerable traffic woes.'b'Transportation and housing are linked. How the state handles these two issues will determine the health of the economy. The state has made a good start with transportation, earmarking billions of dollars for more trains and revamped highways. But affordable housing is a more difficult issue.'b'The state has had an affordable housing law for nearly 20 years that allows developers, under certain conditions, to bypass zoning laws to build housing without the blessing of town hall, as long as a percentage of units are low cost. But the law has largely been a failure because it infuriates local governments, enables development to take place on unsuitable sites and creates litigation. As it stands, in only 30 towns and cities does affordable housing make up 10 percent or more of existing homes. In most of the other 139 towns, affordable housing makes up 5 percent or less of housing units.'b'The nonprofit Partnership for Strong Communities, a housing advocacy group, suggests scrapping the law. It also suggests that the state help communities pay the cost of affordable housing with subsidies for infrastructure, giving  communities   some say in where the housing is built.'b'Proponents of a new law suggest that the state should pick up the costs of educating any additional schoolchildren as an incentive to communities that resist affordable housing because they feel it would overburden their school systems. But asking the state to entice already-wealthy towns to build housing they should have welcomed years ago seems contradictory at a time when the state can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to find the money to help genuinely needy communities struggling with high special education costs.'b'That said, the state cannot afford to ignore the astronomical cost of housing here and pretend that the problem will fix itself.

When the vice president went on a tear like this in 2003, hawking Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s nonexistent W.M.D. and nonexistent connections to Mohamed Atta, he set the stage for a war that now kills Iraqi civilians in rising numbers ('b'34,000-plus last year'b') that are heading into the genocidal realms of Saddam. Mr. Cheney\xe2\x80\x99s latest sales pitch is for a new plan for \xe2\x80\x9cvictory\xe2\x80\x9d promising an even bigger bloodbath.'b'Mr. Cheney was honest, at least, when he said  that the White House\xe2\x80\x99s Iraq policy would remain \xe2\x80\x9c'b'full speed ahead!'b'\xe2\x80\x9d no matter what happened on Nov. 7. Now it is our patriotic duty \xe2\x80\x94 politicians, the press and the public alike \xe2\x80\x94 to apply the brakes. Our failure to check the administration when it rushed into Iraq in 2003 will look even more shameful to history if we roll over again for a reboot in 2007. For all the belated Washington scrutiny of the war since the election, and for all the  heralded (if so far symbolic) Congressional efforts to challenge it, too much lip service is still being paid to the deceptive P.R. strategies used by the administration to sell its reckless policies. This time we must do what too few did the first time: call the White House on its lies. Lies should not be confused with euphemisms like \xe2\x80\x9cincompetence\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdenial.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Cheney\xe2\x80\x99s performance 'b'last week on \xe2\x80\x9cFox News Sunday\xe2\x80\x9d'b' illustrates the problem; his lying is nowhere near its last throes. Asked by Chris Wallace about the White House\xe2\x80\x99s decision to overrule commanders who recommended against a troop escalation, the vice president said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99ve overruled the commanders.\xe2\x80\x9d He claimed we\xe2\x80\x99ve made \xe2\x80\x9cenormous progress\xe2\x80\x9d in Iraq. He said the administration is not \xe2\x80\x9cembattled.\xe2\x80\x9d (Well, maybe that one is denial.)'b'This White House gang is so practiced in lying with a straight face that it never thinks twice about recycling its greatest hits. Hours after Mr. Cheney\xe2\x80\x99s Fox interview, 'b'President Bush was on \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' claiming that before the war \xe2\x80\x9ceverybody was wrong on weapons of mass destruction\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cthe minute we found out\xe2\x80\x9d the W.M.D. didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist he \xe2\x80\x9cwas the first to say so.\xe2\x80\x9d Everybody, of course, was not wrong on W.M.D., starting with the 'b'United Nations weapons inspection team in Iraq'b'. Nor was Mr. Bush the first to come clean once the truth became apparent after the invasion. On May 29, 2003 \xe2\x80\x94 two days after a 'b'secret Defense Intelligence Agency-sponsored mission'b' found no biological weapons in trailers captured by American forces \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Bush 'b'declared'b': \xe2\x80\x9cWe found the weapons of mass destruction. We found biological laboratories.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But that\xe2\x80\x99s all W.M.D under the bridge. The most important lies to watch for now are the new ones being reiterated daily by the administration\xe2\x80\x99s top brass, from Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney on down. You know fiasco awaits America when everyone in the White House is reading in unison from the same fictional script, as they did back in the day when \xe2\x80\x9cmushroom clouds\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9curanium from Africa\xe2\x80\x9d were the daily drumbeat.'b'The latest lies are custom-made to prop up the new \xe2\x80\x9cway forward\xe2\x80\x9d that is anything but. Among the emerging examples is a rewriting of the history of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s sectarian violence. The fictional version was initially laid out by Mr. Bush in his Jan. 10 'b'prime-time speech'b' and has since been repeated on television by both Mr. Cheney and the 'b'national security adviser, Stephen Hadley,'b' last Sunday and by Mr. Bush again 'b'on PBS\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cNewsHour\xe2\x80\x9d on Tuesday'b'. It goes like this: sectarian violence didn\xe2\x80\x99t start spiraling out of control until the summer of 2006, after Sunni terrorists bombed the Golden Mosque in Samarra and forced the Shiites to take revenge.'b'But as Mark Seibel of McClatchy Newspapers 'b'noted last week'b', \xe2\x80\x9cthe president\xe2\x80\x99s account understates by at least 15 months when Shiite death squads began targeting Sunni politicians and clerics.\xe2\x80\x9d They were visible in embryo long before that; The Times, among others, reported 'b'as far back as September 2003'b' that Shiite militias were becoming more radical, dangerous and anti-American. The reasons Mr. Bush pretends that Shiite killing started only last year are obvious enough. He wants to duck culpability for failing to recognize the sectarian violence from the outset \xe2\x80\x94 much as he failed to recognize the Sunni insurgency before it \xe2\x80\x94 and to underplay the intractability of the civil war to which he will now sacrifice fresh American flesh.'b'An equally big lie is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s constant claim that it is on the same page as Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki as we go full speed ahead. Only last month Mr. Maliki 'b'told The Wall Street Journal'b' that he wished he \xe2\x80\x9ccould be done with\xe2\x80\x9d his role as Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s leader \xe2\x80\x9cbefore the end of this term.\xe2\x80\x9d Now we are asked to believe not merely that he is a strongman capable of vanquishing the death squads of the anti-American cleric Moktada al-Sadr, his political ally, but also that he can be trusted to produce the troops he failed to supply in last year\xe2\x80\x99s failed Baghdad crackdown. Yet 'b'as recently as November'b', there still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a single Iraqi battalion capable of fighting on its own.'b'Hardly a day passes without Mr. Maliki mocking the White House\xe2\x80\x99s professed faith in him. In the past week or so alone, he has presided over a 'b'second botched hanging'b' (despite delaying it for more than two weeks to put in place new guidelines), charged Condi Rice with giving a \xe2\x80\x9c'b'morale boost to the terrorists'b'\xe2\x80\x9d because she criticized him, and overruled American objections to appoint an 'b'obscure commander from deep in Shiite territory'b' to run the Baghdad \xe2\x80\x9csurge.\xe2\x80\x9d His government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even try to hide its 'b'greater allegiance to Iran'b'. Mr. Maliki\xe2\x80\x99s foreign minister has asked for the release of the five Iranians detained in an American raid on an Iranian office in northern Iraq this month and, on Monday, called for setting up more Iranian \xe2\x80\x9cconsulates\xe2\x80\x9d in Iraq.'b'The president\xe2\x80\x99s pretense that Mr. Maliki and his inept, ill-equipped, militia-infiltrated security forces can advance American interests in this war is Neville Chamberlain-like in its naivet\xc3\xa9 and disingenuousness. An American military official in Baghdad 'b'read the writing on the wall to The Times last week'b': \xe2\x80\x9cWe are implementing a strategy to embolden a government that is actually part of the problem. We are being played like a pawn.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s why the most destructive lie of all may be the White House\xe2\x80\x99s constant refrain that its doomed strategy is the only one anyone has proposed. Administration critics, Mr. Cheney said last Sunday, \xe2\x80\x9chave absolutely nothing to offer in its place,\xe2\x80\x9d as if the 'b'Iraq Study Group'b', 'b'John Murtha'b' and 'b'Joseph Biden-Leslie Gelb'b' plans, among others, didn\xe2\x80\x99t predate the White House\xe2\x80\x99s own.'b'In reality we\xe2\x80\x99re learning piece by piece that it is the White House that has no plan. Ms. Rice has now downsized the surge/escalation into an \xe2\x80\x9c'b'augmentation'b',\xe2\x80\x9d inadvertently divulging how the Pentagon is improvising, juggling small deployments in fits and starts. No one can plausibly explain how a 'b'parallel chain of command'b' sending American and Iraqi troops into urban street combat side by side will work with Iraqis in the lead (it will report to a \xe2\x80\x9ccommittee\xe2\x80\x9d led by Mr. Maliki!). Or how 'b'$1 billion in new American reconstruction spending'b' will accomplish what the 'b'$30 billion thrown down the drain in previous reconstruction spending'b' did not.'b'All of this replays 2003, when the White House refused to consider any plan, including existing ones in the Pentagon and State Department bureaucracies, for coping with a broken post-Saddam Iraq. Then, as at every stage of the war since, the only administration plan was for a propaganda campaign to bamboozle American voters into believing \xe2\x80\x9cvictory\xe2\x80\x9d was just around the corner.'b'The next push on the \xe2\x80\x9cway forward\xe2\x80\x9d propaganda campaign arrives Tuesday night, with the State of the Union address. The good news is that the Democrats have chosen Jim Webb, the new Virginia senator, 'b'to give their official response'b'. Mr. Webb, a Reagan administration Navy secretary and the father of a son serving in Iraq, has already provoked a 'b'testy exchange about the war with the president'b' at a White House reception for freshmen in Congress. He\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of guy likely to keep a scorecard of the lies on Tuesday night. But whether he does or not, it\xe2\x80\x99s incumbent on all those talking heads who fell for \xe2\x80\x9cshock and awe\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMission Accomplished\xe2\x80\x9d in 2003 to not let history repeat itself in 2007. Facing the truth is the only way forward in Iraq.'b'FIRST there were the tree lights at New York City\xe2\x80\x99s famous Tavern on the Green. The single big elm and several London plane trees there have been wrapped with 10 miles of white mini-lights for decades.'b'The glow through the woods of Central Park is pretty wonderful \xe2\x80\x94 sort of a ghost-tree vision in the darkest months of the year. Christmas carols have faded from the air but the tree lights remain until the days get considerably longer than the nights and we have green leaves again.'b'Walking west in the dark from the Tavern on the Green tree spectacle a couple of weeks ago, I came upon a block just off the park where almost all the street trees had cords of small white lights wrapped around their skinny trunks and around the branches up to the tips. This phenomenon is not limited to here in Manhattan; these tiny white lights outline trees in front of restaurants and stores throughout the suburbs on main streets and in shopping malls.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m absolutely in favor of tree lights strung in plain old Christmas-tree fashion. And even more in favor of lights along fences and around windows. God knows we\xe2\x80\x99re starved for light this time of year. But tree-wrapping, winding the cords round and round each trunk and branch, seems to have become a pandemic. It\xe2\x80\x99s beginning to look like bondage, especially when the tree in question is a young thing trying to stay alive in a sidewalk tree pit. Street trees are already being urinated on by dogs and wounded by cars and starved by poor soil, to mention only a few of their miseries.'b'I thought at first that the heat and light through the winter might hurt the tree, but it turns out the problem is more mechanical than physiological. Touch the little bulbs and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see they\xe2\x80\x99re not very hot. The extra light could have some effect, but most of the trees have lights put on them when they\xe2\x80\x99re already deeply dormant. The problem for the tree starts when people lay hands on them. They\xe2\x80\x99re at risk when people are putting the lights up and at more risk when people are taking them down. The greatest risk is when the lights aren\xe2\x80\x99t taken off at all.'b'Professional decorators put the lights on with care. It takes six weeks and a cherry picker to put the lights on the trees at Tavern on the Green. The same head gardener, a person with a stake in the trees\xe2\x80\x99 continuing good health, is in charge of putting the lights up and taking them down. In spring the cords are sheared and the lights are thrown away. (The area\xe2\x80\x99s two most distinguished exemplars of good horticulture practices, by the way, do not indulge in this kind of tree-wrapping. The Brooklyn Botanic Garden doesn\xe2\x80\x99t wrap any of its living trees. At the New York Botanical Garden, a lighting engineer puts lights on three small cherry trees in containers by the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 center with watchful horticulture staff standing by.)'b'As for taking the cords off, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost impossible to unwind them gently come spring. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever undressed a Christmas tree you know how tempting it is to give a yank. On a cut tree that\xe2\x80\x99s not a big deal; on a live tree it could pull off branch tips or whole branches. While professional decorators working on other trees have probably put the lights on attentively (with their invoices still to be presented), they note that they\xe2\x80\x99re not removed with the same care.'b'The worst damage to the tree occurs when the strings of lights are simply left on to shine again next winter. As the trunk and branches grow thicker, the circling cords dig into the bark and impede the movement of food and water up and down the tree. Girdling trees (not with light cords, but by taking off a thin strip of bark all the way around the trunk) is what early American farmers did when they wanted to kill off trees and clear a field. Nowadays you can see cords cutting into the trunks of banyan trees in Honolulu and palm trees in Miami Beach, which are wrapped with lights year-round.'b'My husband refuses to see what I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to term \xe2\x80\x9ctree-throttling\xe2\x80\x9d as an outrage, and of course there are more terrible crimes against nature. The lights are pretty, he says, and they highlight the shape of the tree. Yes, but plain old Christmas-tree-style lights strung along \xe2\x80\x94 but not around \xe2\x80\x94 the branches are also pretty and without the garrote effect. A river birch or maple or palm or banyan is beautifully highlighted with a spotlight shining on it from the ground below.'b'Glowing trees fill a need. What bothers me is that in trying to cheer ourselves in winter we\xe2\x80\x99re not fully taking in the fact that these trees are alive, that given care they will be useful and beautiful in other seasons \xe2\x80\x94 and that they\xe2\x80\x99re more than our accessories.'b'Every Thursday, the line forms at the door of the 164 Wilson Food Pantry in Richmond Hill, one of Stamford\xe2\x80\x99s poorest neighborhoods, for the pantry\xe2\x80\x99s weekly dispersal of groceries to the needy. But the fourth Thursday of the month is usually the toughest, says Joyce Gumbus, the pantry\xe2\x80\x99s coordinator. That is when people who struggle to make a Social Security check or a disability check last generally run out of money, and the line winds around the building. Instead of the usual 150 to 200 people who need help, sometimes 300 to 400 show up.'b'People do not think of Connecticut, and especially Fairfield County, as a place with pockets of the poor. But it is precisely because the cost of living is so high here that members of the working poor have such a difficult time eking out an existence \xe2\x80\x94 especially if they are paid the minimum wage. Directors of soup kitchens, food pantries and the regional food banks that supply them report that it is utterly ordinary for the poor in Connecticut to have to make a routine choice between paying the rent or going hungry. Too often, they, and their children, go hungry. And with the rise in energy prices in the last several years, demand for food is growing.'b'The Food Bank of Lower Fairfield County says it distributed 968,000 pounds of food last year. This winter has been relatively mild, freeing up more money for groceries. Yet those who help the poor know that with colder weather this past week, they will be especially busy \xe2\x80\x94 and donors will not have the holidays to remind them to bring a bag of groceries or a check to help those less fortunate.'b'Hunger does not fade once the wreaths come down. Those who believe in generosity no matter what the season might check into their local food pantries and ask how full the shelves are.'b'To the Editor:'b'A senior at Great Neck North High School, I was stunned by \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Hey, Let\xe2\x80\x99s Ride Bikes to School (Yeah, Right)'b',\xe2\x80\x9d by Corey Kilgannon (The Island column, Jan. 14).

New Yorkers take pride in their egalitarian green spaces, which are open to everyone. But acreage has always been at a premium, and public money cannot keep pace with the costs of upkeep and improvements. Over the years, the city has thus come to depend on private donations to fill the gaps.'b'Public-private partnerships can reap great benefits, as long as private interests don\xe2\x80\x99t overtake the public\xe2\x80\x99s right of access. The city will have to work hard not to tip that balance the wrong way on Randall\xe2\x80\x99s Island, a 480-acre public park that sits in the waters separating East Harlem, the South Bronx and Astoria, Queens.'b'Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe want to enter into a contract that would allow students at 20 of Manhattan\xe2\x80\x99s  wealthiest private schools  exclusive use of most of the island\xe2\x80\x99s playing fields during prime after-school hours for the next 20 years. In return, the city would get a real prize: upgraded and repaired fields which those schools have already been using for soccer, softball and other sports for 15 years, along with dozens of new fields, all financed by the private schools. Their total investment could be more than $80 million.'b'The schools had originally wanted a 30-year contract and exclusive rights to 80 percent of the fields during prime time. They\xe2\x80\x99ve scaled that back to 20 years and two-thirds of the fields, leaving public schools and community groups with access to one-third of the space after school hours. The city should claim a larger share of prime  time for public schools \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps 40 percent to start, with a possible increase to 50 percent if demand materializes.'b'There are also objections in principle. New Yorkers for Parks, an independent monitor, warns the deal   could set a dangerous precedent, in effect selling off public parkland to the wealthy and giving a new twist to the words \xe2\x80\x9cpay to play.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s another very important point here, lost in the back-and-forth over contractual details. For people   without private transportation \xe2\x80\x94 and that means public school children  \xe2\x80\x94  Randall\xe2\x80\x99s Island is reachable only by a footbridge or the Triborough Bridge, with ferry service added for special events, like concerts.

Another two million or three million used guns change hands in \xe2\x80\x9csecondary market\xe2\x80\x9d sales that are almost entirely unregulated.'b'Gun ownership may well exert some deterrent effect on criminals, but these benefits seem to be outweighed by the costs to society. In a 2006 study Professor Cook and I published in The Journal of Public Economics, we estimate that the net social cost of household gun ownership is somewhere in the range of $100 to $1,800 per year.'b'Society might be better off taxing, rather than encouraging, private gun ownership.'b'Jens Ludwig 'b'Washington, Jan. 16, 2007'b''b'The writer is a professor of public policy at Georgetown University.'b''b''b''b'\xe2\x80\xa2'b'To the Editor:'b'Here in rural Kentucky, no one would plan a burglary around the idea of finding the victims unarmed.'b'My own arsenal \xe2\x80\x94 inherited from my grandfather \xe2\x80\x94 consists of a well-worn single-barrel shotgun, last fired in the 1970s.

Instead, Mr. Parnell drove over the Bradley Overpass out of Merced to an unheated cabin off Highway 140. Mr. Parnell put the boy to bed and, the next night, took him to Yosemite and molested him.'b'Mr. Parnell kept Steven in his room at the lodge where he worked for the next week, and then he brought the boy a puppy. He told Steven that his parents no longer wanted him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve adopted you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYour name is now Dennis, and I\xe2\x80\x99m Dad.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Steven named the puppy Queenie. He did not try to run away, not that night or the next week or the next year or the six after that. They moved from Yosemite to Santa Rosa to the hills of Mendocino County, and Ken Parnell fed him and clothed him and sent him to school. To any strangers glancing at the two \xe2\x80\x94 any strangers who didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that Mr. Parnell was repeatedly raping the boy \xe2\x80\x94 they appeared as just another drifting father and son scraping by on the fringes.'b'In 1980, with Steven galloping into puberty, Ken Parnell kidnapped another boy, this one only 5. Steven by then understood that children shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be raped \xe2\x80\x94 so he fled into the darkness with the smaller boy to the police station in Ukiah, Calif.'b'And then he became famous. Even in 1980, when there were only three networks and the news was slotted in before the prime-time sitcoms, Steven was a sensation. He missed school to appear on the morning shows, and all the adults in Merced welcomed him back as a hero for escaping a pedophile and rescuing another victim, too.'b'And yet the question lingered: Why would a boy stay with a rapist for more than seven years? There is no answer, and a thousand answers. Maybe he was scared when he was seven. Maybe he believed his parents didn\xe2\x80\x99t want him. Maybe he developed a form of Stockholm Syndrome. Or maybe he was just a kid and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t explain it in a way that any grown-up watching television would understand.'b'I learned about Steven\xe2\x80\x99s story when I met his older brother, Cary, a few years ago. Cary grew up to become \xe2\x80\x94 and this is quite possibly only a grotesque coincidence \xe2\x80\x94 a serial killer who murdered four women in Yosemite. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t know why Steven stayed. When I tracked down Ken Parnell in his dirty apartment in Berkeley, Calif. in 1999, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know, either. But I doubt he thought very deeply about it: mostly, after five years in prison, he seemed disappointed that Steven hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come to visit him. \xe2\x80\x9cHis parents wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let him,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me, and he sounded genuinely wounded. (He\xe2\x80\x99s back in prison now, sentenced to 25 years to life in 2004 for trying to arrange a young boy\xe2\x80\x99s abduction.)'b'All of which would be a sad and detestable bit of history, except that it is happening again. More than 25 years later, another adolescent boy, this time from a small town in Missouri, has come home from captivity. That boy was allegedly kidnapped more than four years ago, when he was 11, by a pizzeria manager named Michael Devlin, and he was rescued on Jan. 12 \xe2\x80\x94 several days after Mr. Devlin supposedly snatched another, younger boy. And now those two boys are famous, their names and faces inked into newspapers and broadcast across what is now a universe of 24-hour cable networks.'b'Their return is rightly celebrated. But in that celebration, one of the few sacrosanct rules of modern journalism \xe2\x80\x94 the self-imposed prohibition against naming people who may be victims of sexual assault \xe2\x80\x94 has been abandoned in favor of a fetishistic drama. To date, Mr. Devlin has not been charged with sex crimes, but any journalist who professes to believe there is not a sexual element in a 41-year-old man kidnapping pubescent boys is disingenuous or incompetent.'b'The legal distinction is obviously significant, but the journalistic one is merely parsing. Had either boy been molested by an uncle, had either been brutalized in an alley, had either claimed, even falsely, to have been gang-raped at an elite university, he would remain anonymous. We would not know his name, and we would not recognize his face.'b'There is a reason for that rule. Yes, it is occasionally debated, the argument usually being that cloaking rape victims in anonymity implies that they should be ashamed for having been victimized. That is a fine academic discussion. But in the real world, few rape victims would want their faces broadcast, their suffering shoveled onto the talk shows and into the tabloids. And no child, no matter how brave, deserves it.'b'Because still the questions linger. Bill O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly, for instance, on Fox News asked the most obvious one about the older boy in Missouri: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t he escape when he could have?\xe2\x80\x9d Later in that broadcast, he offered an answer: \xe2\x80\x9cThe situation here for this kid looks to me to be a lot more fun that what he had under his old parents.\xe2\x80\x9d And still later: \xe2\x80\x9cThere was an element here that this kid liked about his circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He said that, to millions of  viewers, about a 15-year-old boy who is famous simply because he\xe2\x80\x99d been kidnapped and held captive for four years.'b'People whispered the same things about Steven Stayner. According to his brother and others, he came back to Merced a deeply wounded boy, wild and angry and scarred. Yet he received no therapy \xe2\x80\x94 his parents believed that was for weak people \xe2\x80\x94 and was granted no time to rebuild his life quietly and privately. Sure, the networks and the grown-ups all called him a hero, but the teenagers in the town where he had to live taunted him, questioning his sexuality.'b'His fame brought him small riches \xe2\x80\x94 $30,000 for a television movie, $15,000 for rescuing the other boy \xe2\x80\x94 but he blew much of the money on drugs and cars. He ended up delivering pizzas to make a living, and on a rainy night in 1989, a few months after \xe2\x80\x9cI Know My First Name Is Steven\xe2\x80\x9d was broadcast, he got on his motorcycle without a helmet or a license and drove into the side of a car that pulled in front of him. He was 24 when he died, married with two kids, and still famous because he\xe2\x80\x99d been kidnapped and raped as a boy.'b'And now two new boys are famous because terrible things were likely done to them. They led the news shows, made the cover of People, and, on Thursday, the older one and his family sat down with Oprah Winfrey. She asked his parents if they thought he\xe2\x80\x99d been molested. She asked the boy, off-camera, why he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t tried to escape. It was all very tasteful, as these things go, but also dreadfully and permanently public. And that\xe2\x80\x99s the last thing either boy needs.'b'One of the most worrying parts of President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s Iraq strategy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to do with Iraq. It\xe2\x80\x99s the way he\xe2\x80\x99s ramping up a confrontation with Iran.'b'Across a broad spectrum of policy levers, Mr. Bush is raising the pressure on Iran, increasing the risk that he will drag the U.S. into a third war in an Islamic country in six years. Instead of disengaging from war, he could end up starting another.'b'We could have taken another route. In 2003, Iran sent the U.S. a detailed message offering to work together to capture terrorists, to stabilize Iraq, to resolve nuclear disputes, to withdraw military support for Hezbollah and Hamas, and to moderate its position on Israel, in exchange for the U.S. lifting sanctions and warming up to Iran.'b'Some diplomats liked the idea, but administration hawks rejected it at once. Lawrence Wilkerson, a former chief of staff to Colin Powell, says that the State Department sent a cable to the Swiss ambassador in Tehran, who looks after U.S. interests in Iran, scolding him for even forwarding the package to Washington.'b'Obviously, Iran\xe2\x80\x99s offer might have led nowhere. But it\xe2\x80\x99s plain where rejection of the offer has taken us: more Americans are dying in Iraq, and some experts worry about clashes with Iran itself.'b'The Iraq Study Group proposed engagement with Iran, but instead Mr. Bush has been escalating the rhetoric and military pressure.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have such a buildup and have zero communications, and you have an arena like Iraq where you may step on each other\xe2\x80\x99s toes, you could have rapid escalation,\xe2\x80\x9d warns Vali Nasr, an expert on the region at the Naval Postgraduate School.'b'It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear that Mr. Bush wants a war with Iran. His aim seems to be a show of force to deter Iran and reassure our allies in the region. But he is on a path that may easily lead to escalation.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate that we are ratcheting up the military pressure, because the administration has quietly taken one very useful step against Iran: squeezing its access to international banking transactions. That has caused real economic pain and has added to the unpopularity of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s hard-line president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Those banking sanctions, not military moves, are a reason Mr. Ahmadinejad has been rebuked by the country\xe2\x80\x99s supreme leader.'b'Unfortunately, both Mr. Bush and Mr. Ahmadinejad benefit from confrontation. Both are unpopular domestically but can use a crisis to distract from their policy failures.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe current strategy benefits Ahmadinejad,\xe2\x80\x9d says Professor Nasr. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to divert attention at the popular level from democracy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Ahmadinejad is facing growing criticism: he has been heckled by university students and scolded in the press, and his candidates did poorly in recent elections. Ordinary Iranians love the U.S. \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s the most pro-American country in the Middle East I\xe2\x80\x99ve visited \xe2\x80\x94 and a civil society is struggling to be born.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf there is any military strike on Iran, all this movement will end,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shirin Ebadi, the Iranian lawyer and Nobel Peace Prize winner.'b'Even some Republicans opposed to a \xe2\x80\x9cgrand bargain\xe2\x80\x9d favor some kind of engagement. Mitchell Reiss, a former senior State Department official under Mr. Bush, proposes technical talks with Iran about drug trafficking and maritime security. \xe2\x80\x9cEven if they are a nonstarter for Tehran, I think we score points in the region for trying,\xe2\x80\x9d Ambassador Reiss said.'b'Granted, Mr. Bush is right to be frustrated by Iran and the way it\xe2\x80\x99s defying the international community with its nuclear program.'b'Unfortunately, Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s military pressure may end up making Iraq bloodier than ever. Instead of being cowed, Iran may use its proxies in Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon and elsewhere to kill more American officials and troops.'b'Or even ordinary Americans here at home. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good assumption that they have, if not operatives, at least sympathetic actors and affiliated groups\xe2\x80\x9d in the U.S., said Henry Crumpton, the State Department coordinator for counterterrorism.'b'Mr. Bush is absolutely right to denounce Iran\xe2\x80\x99s leaders for stealing elections, suppressing their people and dabbling in terrorism. But we ourselves are partly to blame for the awful government in Tehran.'b'By instigating a coup in 1953 and seeking special legal privileges for American troops in 1964, we empowered extremists like Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and allowed them to tap nationalist outrage. So it would be in keeping with tradition if Mr. Bush, by shortsightedly stoking a confrontation with Tehran, now inadvertently helped Iranian hard-liners crush Iran\xe2\x80\x99s democracy movement.'b'London'b'NOW that the mystery smells of Manhattan have abated, are you still wondering whether the Grim Reaper\xe2\x80\x99s cologne will smell like maple syrup or rotten eggs when he comes for you?'b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, because here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing: the more powerful the stench, the less likely it is to do harm. Indeed, the smell that\xe2\x80\x99s typically associated with natural gas is deliberately put in to warn you of its otherwise odorless presence \xe2\x80\x94 you\xe2\x80\x99ll call Con Edison before it all goes bang. In this case, it is not the thing that smells that will harm you, but the thing that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t smell.'b'As a kind of perverse perfumery, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company offers 24 different compositions of sulfur compounds as part of its Scentinel line of gas odorants. A few well-dispersed ounces of Scentinel A, which is made of ethyl mercaptan, the odorant added to natural gas, are enough to stink up all of Manhattan, but by themselves, they won\xe2\x80\x99t blow anything up.'b'So why do we find the sulfur smell by itself so objectionable? One hundred years ago, the most feared smells were those of putrefaction, which were thought to carry disease. These days, the chain of cold that takes perishables from fridge to fridge has all but eliminated smells of rot \xe2\x80\x94 though many people still use the expression \xe2\x80\x9crotten egg smell,\xe2\x80\x9d few have ever encountered it. Instead, what we fear today when we smell sulfur is the possibility that manufactured poisons are present.'b'In response to the widespread suspicion of smells, industry goes to great lengths to avoid generating them, and government agencies pay employees to scour the countryside to identify reported malodors. Nowadays, even huge fragrance plants like Symrise\xe2\x80\x99s, which bestrides the bucolic town of Holzminden in central Germany, can be virtually odorless, thanks to better technology. They have to be or they would have been kicked out of town.'b'If, in Lord Palmerston\xe2\x80\x99s famous phrase, dirt is \xe2\x80\x9cmatter in the wrong place,\xe2\x80\x9d then a stink is a scent in the wrong space. We worry about what we feel and can\xe2\x80\x99t see. We want smell to be predictable, to lead us to the object that produces it, and to stay reasonably close to its origin on a leash no more than a few yards long. Anything that reeks beyond a city block is an invisible snarling dog with unknown intentions, even if, in the right context, the smell itself would be innocuous. Therefore, people complain.'b'Yet some of the most dangerous things have no smell at all and generate no complaints. Consider that on a desolate and beautiful stretch of beach near Hartlepool, England, sits a factory that manufactures the smelliest flavors, those that make the instant noodle soup in the office microwave smell of leeks two floors down. Next to it is a nuclear power station. When the wind is from the northeast, the guys producing nuclear waste phone to complain about the smell of noodle soup.'b'Yet there do appear to be two smells that are bad in any context: ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, respectively rotten fish and rotten eggs. Both are products of the decay of proteins, and any early human unable to smell them would have soon died, probably from food poisoning. The wiring of our sense of smell evolved millions of years ago in days when all molecules were \xe2\x80\x9corganic\xe2\x80\x9d in the New Age use of the word, meaning natural. During the last 200 years, proper organic, meaning carbon-based, chemistry has made more than eight million new compounds never seen before on earth. A majority of these compounds turns out to be nontoxic; a minority of them smell.'b'In this great molecular crowd, the chemicals that are both volatile enough to inhale and highly toxic are remarkably sparse. The intensely smelly hydrogen sulfide, the pleasant almond-scented hydrogen cyanide and the totally odorless carbon monoxide all kill you in a similar way. They attach to the iron in your cells and dethrone another small, odorless fellow we rely upon to live: oxygen.'b'Very few people ever die of hydrogen sulfide poisoning because, like the stuff in natural gas, it has such a strong and unpleasant odor that you will run for your life long before it can do any harm. Cyanide too, as long as you recognize you are not smelling amaretto, will give you time to get out. Carbon monoxide, because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t smell, is much more dangerous. Then there are gases used in warfare that are deliberately designed by man to kill.'b'Mario Sartori\xe2\x80\x99s textbook on such gases, published in 1939, describes in terrifying detail the properties of many of these chemical Furies, which sometimes even smelled good. Phosgene, responsible for permanently crippling so many World War I soldiers, is described as having a smell reminiscent of hay; while dichlorodiethyl sulfide or Yperite (named after the Belgian city Ypres, where it was first used) is said to smell like mustard. Some of the worst, like sarin, have no smell at all.'b'So relax if you can, and remember that a widespread stench with no obvious source means a powerfully smelly molecule is in the air. If so, a little goes a long way, and a little can do no harm.'b'You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be a space or climate expert to recognize that this country\xe2\x80\x99s ability to track climate and environmental changes from space is heading in the wrong direction. At a time when concerns about global warming are rising, the Bush administration is sharply reducing the number of satellites that can measure the impact of rising temperatures and a host of other environmental trends.'b'The administration\xe2\x80\x99s hypocrisy is stunning. For years, the president and top officials have justified their refusal to grapple seriously with global warming by insisting that more research is needed. Now, after pledging that such research would be the centerpiece of a new climate change strategy, the administration is underfinancing some of the most important efforts to gather data.'b'A report issued last week by the National Academy of Sciences projected an alarming decline in vital studies and monitoring. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration currently has a sizable number of Earth-observing satellites and instruments in orbit, but since 2000 its budget for earth sciences has decreased over 30 percent when adjusted for inflation.'b'By 2010, the number of operating sensors and instruments on NASA satellites that observe the Earth is likely to drop by 40 percent as old equipment fails and is not promptly replaced. Meanwhile, at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, huge cost overruns and technical problems have delayed planned launchings of key climate and weather-monitoring satellites and forced the elimination of instruments essential for climate science.'b'The setbacks are bound to hobble efforts to understand whether hurricanes and heat waves are becoming more frequent and intense, whether ice sheets will collapse and drive sea levels dangerously high, and how fish stocks, deforestation, drinking water supplies and air pollution are affected as populations grow and economies take off. We clearly need more data in coming years, not less.'b'The academy\xe2\x80\x99s panel estimates that some $7.5 billion in new money is needed through 2020, mostly at NASA, to conduct high-priority observational missions. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s resources are already grievously overextended. It must finish building the international space station, keep flying the rickety shuttle fleet and start developing a follow-on spacecraft to explore the Moon and get ready to travel to Mars.'b'With little new money to carry out these costly tasks, the agency has been forced to rein in other parts of its budget, including earth science studies. Unless Congress gives NASA more funds, the agency should shift money internally to give Earth observations higher priority. Studies that could affect the livability of the planet seem vastly more consequential than completing a space station or returning to the Moon by an arbitrary date.'b'THE mysterious odor that blanketed Manhattan on Jan. 8 remains, well, a mysterious odor. Last week, officials in New York and New Jersey gave up on finding the source of the smell.'b'But we haven\xe2\x80\x99t, and we think we can support one of the theories of the odor\xe2\x80\x99s source that has been suggested. Based on our familiarity with the local aquatic environment and regional meteorology, we believe that the odor was caused by gases released from saltwater marshes in the metropolitan area.'b'Let us explain. The intertidal sediments in this region are home to micro-organisms that produce sulfur compounds. When these sediments interact with saltwater that contains low levels of oxygen, gases are released. These gases include hydrogen sulfide and a variety of thiols (like the gas additives thiophane and mercaptan) \xe2\x80\x94 all of which have an odor similar to rotten eggs.'b'While the release of these gases from marsh sediments occurs more or less continually, we suggest that something out of the ordinary occurred on Jan. 8.'b'First, there was a low tide in the coastal marshes from roughly 4 a.m. to 6 a.m. Second, we experienced winds from the south and an atmospheric inversion, which created something like a low-lying bubble of air.'b'The result of the two factors? The low tide exposed the marsh sediments and hastened the release of sulfur gases into the atmosphere. The inversion trapped the odor close to the ground and the southerly winds then carried it to Lower Manhattan, where it remained until atmospheric conditions changed.'b'On what do we base our assumptions?'b'For starters, independent data and Columbia University instruments on rooftops in Manhattan show a consistent trend in wind speed and direction surrounding New York City. On Jan. 7, the night before the odor was noticed, the dominant winds were moderate and from the south. Such winds would travel over large marshlands like Jamaica Bay and Kill Van Kull before hitting Manhattan.'b'Early the next day, the atmospheric inversion developed, and remained stable, encapsulating the odor, until wind speed rapidly increased in late morning. At that point, the capping inversion was disrupted and the air mass was dispersed.'b'And what about the smell? To test this possibility, we calculated the amount of hydrogen sulfide that would need to be released into air volumes of various dimensions, given an odor threshold for the human nose of one part in a million for hydrogen sulfide.'b'Together with additional estimates of the area of intertidal sediments to the south of the city and the rate of sediment-air gas exchange, we concluded that marsh sediments could indeed supply enough hydrogen sulfide gas to cause the widespread odor New Yorkers experienced.'b'Our explanation highlights the consequences of excessive nutrient loading and the resulting low oxygen levels in local coastal waters. (By nutrient loading, we mean exposing water to sewage, fertilizer, chemicals or other pollutants.) Of course, these consequences go beyond odor \xe2\x80\x94 they kill marsh vegetation, degrade the wider marine habitat and make it unsafe to swim or fish.'b'Yes, water quality in the New York area has become better in recent decades. But there is still much room for improvement, and conditions like those that took place earlier this month may become more common if local population growth results in more pollutants ending up in coastal waters \xe2\x80\x94 and if the frequency of unusually warm air temperatures increases with climate change.'b'While these odors do not cause a health threat at low concentrations, they are undesirable. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, they are troubling for what they may signal: an environment in need of our attention.'b'\xe2\x80\x94 'b'GREG O\xe2\x80\x99MULLAN,'b' 'b'WADE 'b''b'McGILLIS,'b' 'b'RAY SAMBROTTO'b' and 'b'PHILIP ORTON'b', s'b'cientists at Columbia\xe2\x80\x99s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and department of earth and environmental engineering, and BRIAN MAILLOUX, assistant professor of environmental sciences at Barnard.'b''b'We\xe2\x80\x99re in bipartisan nirvana.

Only 0.6 percent of all wage workers make the minimum, and many of those are middle-class teenagers or recent grads.'b'The economists Richard Burkhauser of Cornell and Joseph Sabia of the University of Georgia estimate that a mere 12.7 percent of the benefits of a federal minimum wage hike would go to poor families, while 63 percent would go to families earning more than twice the poverty line. In sum, a poorly targeted publicity measure that will nonetheless help some people in need. Raising the earned-income tax credit would have been better.'b''b''b'Prescription drugs:'b''b' 'b'D.'b' While they were the opposition, Democrats fulminated that the Republicans were so deep in the pockets of Big Pharma that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even let the government negotiate lower drug prices.

A symbolic gesture.'b''b''b'Student loans:'b''b' 'b'C\xe2\x80\x93.'b' House Democrats (and 124 Republicans) voted to cut the interest rates on student loans. This is a nice subsidy for middle-class grads, but will do almost nothing to help working-class kids complete college. Over the past three decades, the federal government has spent more than $750 billion on financial aid, with spending levels exploding over the past 10 years. This money has done little to improve graduation rates. That\xe2\x80\x99s because relatively few students can\xe2\x80\x99t complete college for financial reasons.'b'Study after study has failed to find any link between recent federal subsidy programs and college attendance. Democrats would have been better off streamlining existing aid or focusing their efforts on Pell grants.'b''b''b'Energy policies:'b''b' 'b'A\xe2\x80\x93.'b' Democrats have voted to reduce some of the government\xe2\x80\x99s oil and gas subsidies and shift them toward renewable energy. As Jerry Taylor wrote in The National Review recently, the case for the existing oil subsidies is \xe2\x80\x9claughably thin.\xe2\x80\x9d In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s too bad Congress didn\xe2\x80\x99t take an even bigger slice out of corporate pork.'b''b''b'Sept. 11 commission recommendations:'b''b' 'b'C\xe2\x80\x93.'b' This is another case of governing being a lot harder than complaining. Democrats vowed to enact all the recommendations, but immediately backtracked on the one the commission said was \xe2\x80\x9camong the most difficult and important\xe2\x80\x9d: strengthening Congressional oversight. No guts, no glory.'b''b''b'Stem cell research.'b''b' 'b'B.'b' The House voted 253 to 174 to reverse the Bush restrictions on embryonic stem cell research funding (not enough to overturn a veto). A good move, for most of us. But it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to judge the practical consequences, given how distant the benefits of this research are, and the fact that recent innovations like amniotic stem cells might alter the whole debate.'b'In conclusion, if a wonky Mr. Chips were to step back and render a judgment on the new Congress so far, he\xe2\x80\x99d note that it\xe2\x80\x99s not a terribly ambitious student. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t tried anything big. It has a weakness for showy symbolism and middle-class subsidies. Still, at least it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t humiliated the nation the way the last Congress did, and it looks set to do some modest good.'b'For years now, it has been common knowledge that many of the harsh drug laws enacted in the 70s and 80s not only do not work, but have an unfair impact on minorities. That is especially true of a 1987 New Jersey law setting up 1,000-foot zones around schools where anyone convicted of a drug crime would automatically be sentenced to extra time in prison.'b'The purpose was obvious: to keep drug dealers away from youngsters. But a commission of New Jersey law enforcement officials, legislators and a retired judge found more than a year ago that the law was not protecting children but instead giving blacks and other minority drug offenders far tougher punishment than whites convicted of the same crimes. That is just not right.'b'A study of 90 drug-free zone cases, cited by the commission, showed that not one defendant had sold drugs to a minor. The commission also said that 96 percent of those serving time for drug crimes in drug-free zones were either black or Hispanic.  The reason was that in the cities, where more minority members live, almost every street corner or sidewalk is within 1,000 feet of a school, while in mostly white suburban and rural areas it is easy to get outside the thousand-foot zone. With virtually  entire cities inside  the drug-free zones, the commission said, urban drug offenders have no incentive for staying away from schools.'b'Legislators quickly promised corrective action.  An Assembly committee approved a measure narrowing the zones and a state senator said action would be taken in 2006. Nothing has happened on this issue since then.'b'Shaken by this yearlong lack of action and fearful that penalties in the 1,000-foot zones will be increased, the New Jersey commission is about to renew its demand that legislators and Gov. Jon Corzine take action. What the panel wants is a law that would shrink all drug-free zones to 200 feet, toughen penalties for those convicted of drug crimes within that smaller zone and give judges discretion to lessen penalties when circumstances dictate. The new law would increase penalties to 5 to 10 years rather than the existing three to five.'b'When a commission composed in part of officials who have dealt with the drug problem on a daily basis concludes that a drug punishment law is neither fair nor serving its purpose, it is time for the Legislature and governor to change it. Until they do, minorities will continue paying an unfair price and children will not get the protection they deserve.'b'Despite its many problems, New Jersey enjoys a reputation for tolerance among people of all backgrounds, and deservedly so. The state is one of the most diverse in the nation and its suburbs have increasingly become a home for immigrants from around the world.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s disturbing, therefore, when an occasional ugly incident not only mars this reputation but causes great pain for those it\xe2\x80\x99s aimed at. Two such episodes drew attention this month, and they were especially troublesome because this kind of behavior should have ended decades ago.'b'In South Harrison, a still rural town just 25 miles south of Philadelphia, Charles Tyson took office on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day as the town\xe2\x80\x99s first black mayor. But even before he was sworn in, anonymous callers were telephoning him with racial epithets, and the tires on his car were slashed. Shortly after taking the oath of office, he received a death threat.'b'The incidents stopped after local officials sent letters describing what happened to almost all 2,700 town residents. Town leaders defended their community for being tolerant, but the police chief said the calls were bias crimes. Mr. Tyson expressed disbelief that the incidents could still take place in the town he has lived in for 64 years.'b'In Haledon, a town just outside of Paterson, a gay policeman with 20 years on the force won $450,000 this month in settlement of a sexual harassment lawsuit that claimed, in part, that former town officials referred to him with anti-gay slurs. Sgt. James Len, backed up by other witnesses in sworn testimony, said that after he revealed in 2002 that he was gay, a former mayor described him as a \xe2\x80\x9cthree-dollar bill\xe2\x80\x9d and a former councilman broadcast \xe2\x80\x9chomo, homo, homo\xe2\x80\x9d over the police radio.'b'With the settlement, Haledon is paying a high price for the intolerable actions of a couple of officials, and we would hope that whoever is responsible will brought to justice in South Harrison. The despicable actions of a handful must not be permitted to overshadow the genuine goodwill that the diverse people of New Jersey  have for each other.'b'Las Vegas'b'THE appeal of the underdog is a longstanding one that has most often been applied to sports but long ago spread into public consciousness. The badge of the underdog is (figuratively) adorned with blood, guts and perseverance, and worn with pride \xe2\x80\x94 especially when an underdog inexplicably succeeds.'b'This football season, however, the underdog is a symbol of money. Big money, for Las Vegas bookmakers: they\xe2\x80\x99ve raked in an estimated hundreds of millions of dollars extra betting on the underdog in the National Football League. This is because in the 2006 regular season, NFL teams that were given points (those \xe2\x80\x9c+\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x9d symbols that indicate the spread, as determined by bookmakers) walked off with an overdog-worthy 140-106-7 (55 percent) record against the point spread. In addition, underdogs that were given double-digit points in the plus column (the under-underdogs, if you will) were 20-14-2 (59 percent).'b'According to analysts from 'b'Covers.com'b', a Canadian Web site devoted to betting news, these are the highest winning percentages in those categories in the last 10 years. And because the vast majority of the betting public usually, foolishly, plays the favorite, this season\xe2\x80\x99s pack of underdogs probably outfitted most of the bigger casinos with some lofty accoutrements. If you find the Mirage\xe2\x80\x99s urinals suddenly gold-plated or the Bellagio golf carts equipped with G.P.S. systems, it\xe2\x80\x99s most likely courtesy of the Tennessee Titans or the Buffalo Bills, which had the best records of all of the underdog teams this season.'b'This trend has continued into the playoffs \xe2\x80\x94 last weekend\xe2\x80\x99s divisional rounds saw all four underdog teams (Colts, Eagles, Seahawks and Patriots) beating the point spread in their respective games and, in some cases, winning outright. With these percentages, alongside Rocky Balboa\xe2\x80\x99s  return to cultural legitimacy, does this mean that underdogs are a safe bet through Super Bowl Sunday in Miami?'b'Unfortunately, no.'b'Keith Glantz of Covers.com gives the sobering news: playoffs are a \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent animal\xe2\x80\x9d altogether. He says that teams with big leads in a playoff game used to play it safer than they do now, thanks to the classic 1993  playoff between the Houston Oilers and the Buffalo Bills: Houston led 35-3 at halftime but switched from its touchdown-happy, run-and-shoot offense to a more conservative ground attack \xe2\x80\x94 and lost in overtime, 41-38. The 49ers, the Texans and, on a few occasions, the pitiful Oakland Raiders beat their odds this year, but none of those teams are actually in the playoffs. And playoff teams \xe2\x80\x94 those of the last 15 years, at least \xe2\x80\x94 pile up points until they see zeros on the clock.'b'However, in the playoffs the quality of the teams does matter. Remember, the salary-capped NFL prides itself on Pete Rozelle-era \xe2\x80\x9cparity,\xe2\x80\x9d and some experts have declared that because of that, the NFL is handicapped with across-the-board mediocrity. Yet in this case it makes for exciting football. It\xe2\x80\x99s becoming tougher and tougher to blow a team out in the NFL, regardless of what all the gambling trends indicate and, sometimes, what common sense indicates. To fans and, most notably, to non-gamblers, a game becomes epic regardless of whether your team is playing in it or you\xe2\x80\x99re betting $1,000 on it.'b'But, parity or not, good gamblers know it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that crazy to bet the  battle-scarred New England Patriots, with 5 points last weekend, against the up and coming San Diego Chargers, a team saddled with one of the classic playoff deadweights in coach Marty Schottenheimer. And even though there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a total implosion, trusting Rex Grossman\xe2\x80\x99s bipolar quarterbacking with your $100 and laying 9.5 points to last year\xe2\x80\x99s NFC champions, the Seattle Seahawks would not be a smart bet. Finally, the Saints are a marvelous feel-good story, and playing at home, but it was still a little tough to have Vegas giving a surging, playoff-savvy Philadelphia Eagles team points and expecting a blowout. This year, at least.'b'Regardless of what the numbers say, or what the trends indicate, or how good so-and-so\xe2\x80\x99s defense is when it\xe2\x80\x99s 46 degrees or below in a month that has an R in it, there\xe2\x80\x99s always something that could go horribly, horribly wrong. (Mr. Romo, please pick up your head and step forward.)'b'The best gambling advice going into the final weekend of actual football \xe2\x80\x94 before the Super Bowl spectacle of football \xe2\x80\x94  is to veer away from the allure of the underdog trend (and the promise of a personalized gold-plated urinal).'b'The safest bet, however, is that these games are going to be good.'b'President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s warrantless wiretapping program was once deemed so vital to national security that it could not be subjected to judicial review. Last week, the White House said it was doing just that.'b'In 2005, the White House would not even comment on news reports about the C.I.A.\xe2\x80\x99s prisons because Americans\xe2\x80\x99 safety depended on their being kept secret. In 2006, Mr. Bush held a photo-op to announce that he was keeping them open.'b'The administration has repeatedly insisted that it was essential to the American way of life for Mr. Bush to be able to imprison foreigners without trial or legal counsel. Now the administration claims it was trying to bring those detainees to trial all along but was stymied by white-shoe lawyers.'b'By now, this is a familiar pattern: First, Mr. Bush and his aides say his actions are so vital to national security that to even report on them \xe2\x80\x94 let alone question them \xe2\x80\x94 lends comfort to the terrorists. Then, usually when his decisions face scrutiny from someone other than a compliant Republican Congress, the president seems to compromise.'b'Behind this behavior are at least two dynamics, both of them disturbing.'b'The first is that the policies Mr. Bush is trying so hard to hide have little, if anything, to do with real national security issues \xe2\x80\x94 and everything to do with a campaign, spearheaded by Vice President Dick Cheney, to break the restraints on presidential power imposed after Vietnam and Watergate. And there is much less than meets the eye to Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s supposed concessions.'b'Generally, they mask the fact that he either got what he wanted from Congress or found a way to add some other veneer of legitimacy to his lawless behavior. The campaign to expand presidential power goes on, at the expense of American values.'b'Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s aides don\xe2\x80\x99t try very hard to hide it. The day the shift on domestic wiretapping was  announced, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales gave a speech in which he sneered at the idea of  allowing judges to review national security policies. The next day, he was in the Senate refusing to turn over the agreement that he said would provide judicial review for the wiretapping. And his lawyers were in court arguing that a lawsuit over the  warrantless eavesdropping should be dropped because Mr. Bush said he would stop the operation.'b'We don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly what agreement the White House made with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court about eavesdropping. But there is evidence that Mr. Bush got some broad approval for a wiretapping \xe2\x80\x9cprogram\xe2\x80\x9d rather than the individual warrants required by law. Because the court works in secret, the public may never know whether Mr. Bush really is complying with the law.'b'Nor is there likely to be an explanation of why the White House could not have sought the court\xe2\x80\x99s approval in the first place. The White House\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the process is too cumbersome doesn\xe2\x80\x99t ring true. The law already allows the government to wiretap first and then ask for a warrant within three days. The real reason is almost certainly that the imperial presidency had no desire to share power even with the most secret part of the judiciary.'b'Why else would the president have turned down more than one offer from Congress to amend the 1978 wiretapping law after 9/11 to make getting warrants easier and faster than the three-day rule?'b'For that matter, why did the White House initially refuse to work with senior Republican lawmakers to create a legal court system for the Guant\xc3\xa1namo detainees? Instead, Mr. Bush ordered the creation of kangaroo courts, expanding presidential authority at the expense of Congress and the judiciary, and at the expense of justice.'b'The Republican-led Congress (with the help of cowed Democrats) refused to hold Mr. Bush and his  presidency to account on any of these issues. The Military Commissions Act, passed by Congress just before the midterm elections last year, gave Mr. Bush a pass on what he had already done with the detainees outside the law, and did not stop him from jailing non-Americans indefinitely without due process. Congress absolved American intelligence agents of past abuses of prisoners and approved future abuses, and Mr. Bush happily announced that the C.I.A. prisons would stay open.'b'There are signs, from people like Senator Patrick Leahy, the new chairman of the Judiciary Committee, that the Democrats will be tougher than the Republicans on these issues. The eavesdropping program and Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s secret deal with the surveillance court are a very good place to start.'b'Washington'b'Senator Jim Webb, a spirited Democratic freshman from Virginia, looked uneasy as he hand wrote his very first letter of condolence to a grieving constituent who had just lost her soldier son in the Iraq war. The senator, a lantern-jawed Marine veteran with his own son at war, brightened noticeably as he discussed the surprising invitation from his party\xe2\x80\x99s leaders to deliver the main response for the Democrats to President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union address on Tuesday.'b'Normally, no one pays much attention to the opposition\xe2\x80\x99s rebuttal to a State of the Union address. But the capital\xe2\x80\x99s mood as the war spirals downward is palpably, if not desperately, expectant of some change, somehow. And in Washington, fresh rhetoric must be invested to feed any chance of change.'b'With their narrow victory, the Democrats newly in control of Congress are being turned to as if they are the loyal opposition in the British system, expected to be ready with a shadow cabinet wielding dossiers of perfectly worded alternatives.'b'It won\xe2\x80\x99t work quite that way on Tuesday night when Senator Webb speaks for a perennially discordant party full of upholders of yes-buts and whereases and why-nots. But Mr. Webb, whose upset victory was fueled by stinging, uninhibited criticism of the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s bungling of its war, clearly has something closer to a glinting riposte in mind than some boilerplate response for the record.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy sense is people really want to see something different here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the senator, dismissing the administration\xe2\x80\x99s dispatch of another 20,000 troops as not even a doomed strategy, but a \xe2\x80\x9cflailing around\xe2\x80\x9d for public relations cover. \xe2\x80\x9cSooner or later we are going to withdraw from Iraq,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Webb explained. \xe2\x80\x9cThe circumstances under which we withdraw are the debate.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Tuesday will not be the first time the president and Mr. Webb have had a close encounter. After the election, the senator-elect declined to stand in a reception line and be photographed with Mr. Bush. News reports told of how the president later sought him out, asking, \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s your boy?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to get them out of Iraq, Mr. President,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Webb responded, broadening the question.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not what I asked you,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Bush replied, sounding snappish. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s your boy?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s between me and my boy, Mr. President,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Webb, showing some of the instincts he honed as a former member of a Republican president\xe2\x80\x99s administration and a former boxer.'b'In choosing Mr. Webb, the party seems to be inviting some of his patented iconoclasm to tinge its image, particularly since he is not among the Democrats who first backed the war. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was against the war from the first, journeyed from the House to privately tell her Senate colleagues that the party has nothing less than a moral imperative to move the Iraq issue in a new direction.'b'And so expectations are being raised. Party leaders made sure that Representative Tim Walz of Minnesota, a combat veteran of Afghanistan who speaks knowingly of the troops and their families, had the radio rebuttal last weekend when President Bush accused the Democrats of \xe2\x80\x9cproposing nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d for all their objections to the latest version of his war plan.'b'A former secretary of the Navy for Ronald Reagan, Mr. Webb says he ran as a Democrat because his own politics are rooted in national security interests, and he found that issue despoiled by the Bush administration. \xe2\x80\x9cHurricane Katrina was the thing that pushed me over into running,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cKatrina and the war were parallel situations in terms of failed leadership.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For the senator, the way out of Iraq is \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the outside in\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the full-scale regional diplomacy eschewed by the administration \xe2\x80\x94 rather than from inside Washington\xe2\x80\x99s misplaced sense of being the center of all solutions.'b'He is not alone. Republicans have been talking to  Democrats about the wording of nonbinding resolutions of disapproval of the president\xe2\x80\x99s troop increase. Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine joined Senator Chuck Hagel, a fellow Republican from Nebraska, in the protest. Others were privately dickering.'b'Maybe nobody will be listening on Tuesday. But as a freshman, Senator Webb likes the early feel of things. He has already presided at the head of the chamber, aided by stage cues from a parliamentarian.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI closed the Senate down on Friday, and I was teasing the Republican staffers that since there was nobody on the floor, I was going to ask for unanimous consent to withdraw from Iraq.\xe2\x80\x9d The recollection prompted a booming laugh from the new senator that rolled forth like a preamble to Tuesday night.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTold them we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be out of Iraq by the time I\xe2\x80\x99m done.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To the Editor:'b'Kevin Coyne\xe2\x80\x99s stirring article \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Measuring Eternity, and Lives'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Jersey column, Jan. 14) surely hit a nerve for me, and probably for all parents who recognize what pawns of destiny we are when our children drive or ride in cars.'b'I was particularly struck by Mr. Coyne\xe2\x80\x99s observation about the \xe2\x80\x9cWhy here?\xe2\x80\x9d syndrome.'b'I live in Moorestown, a small place not unlike Freehold.

Mr. Winerip simply chose to fall back on a tired old stereotype.'b'Edith Sachs'b'South Orange, N.J.'b''b'CLEAR, a private service that prescreens travelers for a $100 annual fee, has come  to Kennedy International Airport. To benefit from the Clear Registered Traveler program, which is run by Verified Identity Pass, a person must fill out an application, let the service capture his fingerprints and iris pattern and present two forms of identification. If the traveler passes a federal background check, he will be given a card that allows him to pass quickly through airport security.'b'Sounds great, but it\xe2\x80\x99s actually two ideas rolled into one: one clever and one very stupid.'b'The clever idea is allowing people to pay for better service. Clear has been in operation at the Orlando International Airport since July 2005, and members have passed through security checkpoints faster simply because they are segregated from less experienced fliers who don\xe2\x80\x99t know the drill.'b'Now, at Kennedy and other airports, Clear is purchasing and installing federally approved technology that will further speed up the screening process: scanners that will eliminate the need for cardholders to remove their shoes, and explosives detection machines that will eliminate the need for them to remove their coats and jackets. There are also Clear employees at the checkpoints who, although they can\xe2\x80\x99t screen cardholders, can guide members through the security process. Clear has not yet paid airports for an extra security lane or the Transportation Security Administration for extra screening personnel, but both of those enhancements are on the table if enough people sign up.'b'I fly more than 200,000 miles per year and would gladly pay $100 a year to get through airport security faster.'b'But the stupid idea is the background check. When first conceived, traveler programs focused on prescreening. Pre-approved travelers would pass through security checkpoints with less screening, and resources would be focused on everyone else. Sounds reasonable, but it would leave us all less safe.'b'Background checks are based on the dangerous myth that we can somehow pick terrorists out of a crowd if we could identify everyone. Unfortunately, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t any terrorist profile that prescreening can uncover. Timothy McVeigh could probably have gotten one of these cards. So could have Eric Rudolph, the pipe bomber at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t even a good list of known terrorists to check people against; the government list used by the airlines has been the butt of jokes for years.'b'And have we forgotten how prevalent identity theft is these days? If you think having a criminal impersonating you to your bank is bad, wait until they start impersonating you to the Transportation Security Administration.'b'The truth is that whenever you create two paths through security \xe2\x80\x94 a high-security path and a low-security path \xe2\x80\x94 you have to assume that the bad guys will find a way to exploit the low-security path. It may be counterintuitive, but we are all safer if the people chosen for more thorough screening are truly random and not based on an error-filled database or a cursory background check.'b'I think of Clear as a $100 service that tells terrorists if the F.B.I. is on to them or not. Why in the world would we provide terrorists with this ability?'b'We don\xe2\x80\x99t have to. Clear cardholders are not scrutinized less when they go through checkpoints, they\xe2\x80\x99re scrutinized more efficiently. So why not get rid of the background checks altogether? We should all be able to walk into the airport, pay $10, and use the Clear lanes when it\xe2\x80\x99s worth it to us.'b'As targets of suburban loathing and despair, property taxes get all the attention, particularly in Westchester, whose property taxes are among the highest in the nation. But there are many other tributaries flowing into the sea of taxes in which New Yorkers float.'b'The proliferation of taxing districts \xe2\x80\x94 counties, towns, villages, hamlets, fire departments, sewer and sanitary districts \xe2\x80\x94 has left us all in a trap. We love the amenities of multiple governments but ache under the burden of paying for them all. The cost of living here keeps rising in ways that seem beyond anyone\xe2\x80\x99s control, since children need the best schooling, and other things like garbage collection and gleaming fire trucks, while expensive, are also seen as essential. Or, if not essential, then at least immovable. In many cases the special taxing districts have become politically tenacious fiefdoms: secretive, highly fortified and resistant to siege.'b'People like to complain about the problem, but it took the Nassau County Comptroller, Howard Weitzman, to sink his watchdog\xe2\x80\x99s teeth into it. Last month he issued a report highlighting ways that the more than 200 special taxing districts in Nassau \xe2\x80\x94 whose total tax bill was more than $473 million last year \xe2\x80\x94 could save large amounts of money. Officials in Westchester could learn something from what Mr. Weitzman has to say.'b'Mr. Weitzman says that municipalities can save money without dissolving themselves or consolidating with other districts. These options have often been suggested, most recently by Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who wants to create a Commission on Local Government Efficiency to study the problem across the state, which has more than 4,200 taxing districts. Instead, Mr. Weitzman proposes smart trimming around the edges of the problem by imposing greater oversight and by pooling resources.'b'The first line of defense against special-district overspending \xe2\x80\x94 watchful voters \xe2\x80\x94 is faulty, since special-district elections are obscure rituals in which only the tiniest sliver of the electorate participates. So Mr. Weitzman suggests that town governments step in to control spending. As he interprets state law, towns have the authority to review the budgets of special districts, to compel them to justify expenses and to trim their budgets as needed. Two of Nassau\xe2\x80\x99s three towns \xe2\x80\x94 North Hempstead and Oyster Bay \xe2\x80\x94 have already begun doing so.'b'Mr. Weitzman\xe2\x80\x99s report outlines common-sense ways districts could band together to reduce insurance costs, pooling their risk through group self-insurance and saving money that would otherwise be spent unnecessarily on brokers\xe2\x80\x99 fees and redundant contracts with private companies. The same cooperation could apply to buying goods and services in bulk, or contracting with town governments for services like snow plowing and tree pruning at rates cheaper than those charged by private companies.'b'If there was ever any doubt that special-district spending could be tightened, it was shattered in 2005. That was the year Mr. Weitzman conducted eye-opening audits of sanitary districts in Nassau, finding numerous examples of wastefulness and lack of oversight, and Newsday published a series of articles detailing the sometimes grotesquely lavish spending by volunteer fire districts across Long Island.  Mr.  Spitzer and municipalities everywhere  would do well to take a page, or several, from Mr. Weitzman\xe2\x80\x99s report.'b'Sometimes in politics, as in other vital matters, there occurs just the right combination of will, power and urgency to make real progress. Such a moment has arrived in Albany. The matter at hand is reforming the way Albany does business. All the key players are in alignment. Gov. Eliot Spitzer, still riding his electoral landslide, promises a new day in Albany. The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat like Mr. Spitzer, says that his half of the Legislature is ready, again, to vote on many desperately-needed reforms. And Senator Joseph Bruno, the Republican leader of the other half, finds himself in trouble with investigators and thus in dire need of a few positive headlines.'b'There is another reason Mr. Bruno might be more willing than usual to entertain real reform.  His control over the State Senate threatens to narrow to 32 Republicans and 29 Democrats if a Democrat wins in a special election Feb. 6 on Long Island. And one of the top issues in that race between Craig Johnson, the Democrat, and Maureen O\xe2\x80\x99Connell, the Republican, is government reform.'b'Thus, last week, Mr. Spitzer, Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver stood side-by-side to announce \xe2\x80\x9csweeping reforms\xe2\x80\x9d of the way the state budget is put together. Among the proposed improvements is a requirement that henceforth all lump-sum payments for pet projects in members\xe2\x80\x99 districts be itemized in the budget, thus exposing them to public view. Until a recent court ruling requiring disclosure, these so-called \xe2\x80\x9cmember items,\xe2\x80\x9d amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars, have been shrouded in mystery.'b'The reforms would also require the Legislature to enact a balanced budget. As things stand now, only the governor\xe2\x80\x99s proposed budget has to be in balance; the legislators are free to throw the whole thing out of whack through amendments. The reforms would oblige the legislators to explain the budgetary impact of their amendments. It would also ask the governor to explain how his budget affects local governments.'b'Finally, the proposals would give the state comptroller the authority to resolve disputes over how much revenue is available to the state, which should make it a lot easier for lawmakers to adopt a budget on time by April 1.'b'These changes are not enough, of course. There should be an independent budget office, like New York City\xe2\x80\x99s. There should be a later deadline for the budget \xe2\x80\x94 probably July 1 instead of April 1 to make it easier to assess tax revenues. And New York should move to the best-available budgeting system, using what are known as generally accepted accounting principles.'b'Still, to see state leaders standing together to announce these budget reforms is a lot better than the usual grumbling at separate news conferences. The trick will be for them to pass these changes quickly, preferably over the next two weeks while all three are more or less on the same page.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Amber Fields of Bland'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Jan. 14):'b'Dan Barber is correct: farmers don\xe2\x80\x99t determine what or how they farm.

And they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do something about it.'b'The sky-high cost of health care in the United States isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a challenge for the families that struggle to pay rising premiums and co-payments. It\xe2\x80\x99s also a serious issue for American companies, whose competitors in other countries often benefit from national health insurance programs.'b'As Milt Freudenheim reported recently in The Times ("'b'Company Clinics Cut Health Costs'b'," Jan. 14), some big American-based companies have rediscovered that it\xe2\x80\x99s cheaper in the long run to spend a little more on in-house health clinics.

And despite the article\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that the country has moved right on social issues, demographic trends, particularly young people\xe2\x80\x99s attitudes toward gay rights and marriage, indicate otherwise.'b'Paul Schindler'b'\nEditor in Chief, Gay City News'b'\nNew York, Jan. 16, 2007'b''b''b'San Francisco'b'WHEN the 40-foot-high Kaloko dam collapsed on the Hawaiian island of Kauai last March, its reservoir released a 70-foot-high, 200-foot-wide, 1.6-million-ton wave that carried away 16 cars, hundreds of trees and a cluster of houses,  drowning all seven occupants. At least two bodies were swept three-quarters of a mile to the ocean; four were never recovered.'b'It is tempting to dismiss Kaloko\xe2\x80\x99s collapse as an isolated event, but given the perilous state of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s dams, it is more likely a harbinger. In  2005, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave United States dams a D, a grade that is still justified  two years later.'b'For starters, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s dam stock is rapidly aging. Most dams need major repairs  25 to  50 years after they\xe2\x80\x99re built, and most United States dams are at least 25 years old; some, like the 116-year-old Kaloko, were built more than a century ago.'b'As dams age, their danger increases. This is a matter of not just advancing decrepitude, but \xe2\x80\x9chazard creep\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the tendency of developers to build directly downstream from dams, in the path of floods that would follow dam failures. The result is that even though Americans now build few dams, more and more dams threaten people\xe2\x80\x99s  lives. Chiefly for this reason, the number of dams identified in one estimate as capable of causing death and in need of rehabilitation more than doubled from  1999 to  2006, from around 500 to nearly 1,400. The civil engineers\xe2\x80\x99 2005 report placed the number of unsafe dams much higher, at more than 3,500.'b'On top of that, dam safety officials are so  overworked that in most states, they don\xe2\x80\x99t come close to carrying out all the inspections required by law. According to the engineers\xe2\x80\x99 society,  the average state dam inspector is responsible for 268 dams; in four states the number exceeds 1,200. It is no coincidence that even though Hawaiian law requires dam inspections every five years, Kaloko  was never inspected.'b'We don\xe2\x80\x99t even know how many dams the country possesses. Using one set of criteria, the National Inventory of Dams, maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers, places the number at 79,777, while the sum of dams inventoried by the states is more than 99,000. Even that number is questionable, since it includes suspiciously low counts from several states. In addition, state officials are constantly discovering previously uncounted dams during routine inspection trips. And if the definition of dams is broadened to include the smallest ones, the estimates are as high as several million.'b'Unlike, say, waterways and sanitation plants, a majority of dams  \xe2\x80\x94 56 percent of those inventoried \xe2\x80\x94 are privately owned, which is one reason dams are among the country\xe2\x80\x99s most dangerous structures. Many private owners can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to repair aging dams; some owners go so far as to resist paying by tying up official repair demands in court or  campaigning to weaken state dam safety laws.'b'When the Kauai public works department ordered Kaloko\xe2\x80\x99s owner to stop grading a hilltop next to the reservoir in 1997, the local mayor interceded, instructing the responsible county engineer not to interfere; an investigation by a Hawaiian deputy attorney general published on Jan. 8 found that the owner then covered the earthen dam\xe2\x80\x99s emergency spillway with dirt, in the process weakening the dam\xe2\x80\x99s defenses.'b'Thousands of dams have been abandoned by their owners, and over time, title to them has become obscure \xe2\x80\x94 12 percent of the dams in the Army Corps of Engineers\xe2\x80\x99 inventory have no known owner. As these dams become dilapidated, the  states are left with the expensive task of repairing or dismantling them. Privatization advocates, take heed: this is a cautionary tale.'b'Climate change will also  make dams more dangerous by increasing precipitation  in many parts of the country,  thus undermining the flood assumptions that underlie dam designs. Consider that in October 2005 and last May, two strong but hardly cataclysmic New England rain storms caused the overtopping or breaching of more than 400 dams in three states; a much fiercer storm would compromise far more dams, worsening  flooding and potentially endangering thousands of people.'b'Dams are ranked according to the danger they pose \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9chigh hazard\xe2\x80\x9d dams threaten human life if they fail; \xe2\x80\x9csignificant hazard\xe2\x80\x9d dams threaten property; and \xe2\x80\x9clow hazard\xe2\x80\x9d dams threaten neither. But many dams are inaccurately ranked \xe2\x80\x94 the Kaloko dam, for instance, was rated low hazard.'b'In addition, in most states the rankings do not take into account the potential impact of toxic chemicals from factories, agricultural runoff and mines that gather in sediment behind dams, even though their sudden release can poison humans, wildlife and vegetation far downstream. When a coal tailings dam near Inez, Ky., failed in October 2000,  250 million gallons of coal sludge were sent into  the Big Sandy River and its tributaries, killing aquatic life in the streams.'b'More sobering still, about half the dams in the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 inventory, including many high-hazard ones, do not have emergency plans in case of failure. When these plans are properly executed \xe2\x80\x94 by identifying structures likely to be inundated and keeping up-to-date records of residents\xe2\x80\x99 phone numbers \xe2\x80\x94 they save lives. But the plans that do exist are often inaccurate, and many of the people they\xe2\x80\x99re intended  to protect have no idea of the potential peril they face. California is the only state that even requires property buyers to be informed of potential jeopardy from an upstream dam.'b'The American Society of Civil Engineers estimated in 2005 that repairing dams threatening human life would cost $10.1 billion, while a 2003 study by the Association of Dam Safety Officials placed the cost of repairing all non-federally owned dams in the national inventory at $36.2 billion. In the last session Congress considered legislation to repair dams at a rate of $25 million a year for five years, but even that feeble gesture didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it out of  committee.'b'Americans are easily persuaded to spend hundred of billions of dollars combating debatable terrorist threats from outside the United States, while failing to notice that inside the country, the infrastructure is crumbling. True, outside forces from time to time topple established regimes, but usually not before their insides have started to rot.'b'President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s Saturday radio address was devoted to health care, and officials have put out the word that the subject will be a major theme in tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union address. Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s proposal won\xe2\x80\x99t go anywhere. But it\xe2\x80\x99s still worth looking at his remarks, because of what they say about him and his advisers.'b'On the radio,  Mr. Bush suggested that we should \xe2\x80\x9ctreat health insurance more like home ownership.\xe2\x80\x9d He went on to say that \xe2\x80\x9cthe current tax code encourages home ownership by allowing you to deduct the interest on your mortgage from your taxes. We can reform the tax code, so that it provides a similar incentive for you to buy health insurance.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Wow. Those are the words of someone with no sense of what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to be uninsured.'b'Going without health insurance isn\xe2\x80\x99t like deciding to rent an apartment instead of  buying a house. It\xe2\x80\x99s a terrifying experience, which most people endure only if they have no alternative. The uninsured don\xe2\x80\x99t need an \xe2\x80\x9cincentive\xe2\x80\x9d to buy insurance; they need something that makes getting insurance possible.'b'Most people without health insurance have low incomes, and just can\xe2\x80\x99t afford the premiums. And making premiums tax-deductible is almost worthless to workers whose income puts them in a low tax bracket.'b'Of those uninsured who aren\xe2\x80\x99t low-income, many can\xe2\x80\x99t get coverage because of pre-existing conditions \xe2\x80\x94 everything from diabetes to a long-ago case of jock itch. Again, tax deductions won\xe2\x80\x99t solve their problem.'b'The only people the Bush plan might move out of the ranks of the uninsured are the people we\xe2\x80\x99re least concerned about \xe2\x80\x94  affluent, healthy Americans who choose voluntarily not to be insured. At most, the Bush plan might induce some of those people to buy insurance, while in the process \xe2\x80\x94 whaddya know \xe2\x80\x94  giving many other high-income individuals yet another tax break.'b'While proposing this high-end tax break, Mr. Bush is also proposing a tax increase \xe2\x80\x94 not on the wealthy, but on workers who, he thinks, have too much health insurance. The tax code, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cunwisely encourages workers to choose overly expensive, gold-plated plans. The result is that insurance premiums rise, and many Americans cannot afford the coverage they need.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Again, wow. No economic analysis I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of says that when Peter chooses a good health plan, he raises Paul\xe2\x80\x99s premiums. And look at the condescension. Will all those who think they have \xe2\x80\x9cgold plated\xe2\x80\x9d health coverage please raise their hands?'b'According to press reports, the actual plan is to penalize workers with relatively generous insurance coverage. Just to be clear, we\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about the wealthy; we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about ordinary workers who have managed to negotiate better-than-average health plans.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s driving all this is the theory, popular in conservative circles but utterly at odds with the evidence, that the big problem with U.S. health care is that people have too much insurance \xe2\x80\x94  that there would be large cost savings if people were forced to pay more of their medical expenses out of pocket.'b'The administration also believes, for some reason, that people should be pushed out of employment-based health insurance \xe2\x80\x94 admittedly a deeply flawed system \xe2\x80\x94 into the individual insurance market, which is a disaster on all fronts. Insurance companies try to avoid selling policies to people who are likely to use them, so a large fraction of premiums in the individual market goes not to paying medical bills but to bureaucracies dedicated to weeding out \xe2\x80\x9chigh risk\xe2\x80\x9d applicants \xe2\x80\x94  and keeping them uninsured.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m somewhat skeptical about health care plans, like that proposed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, that propose covering gaps in the health insurance market with a series of patches, such as requiring that insurers offer policies to everyone at the same rate. But at least the authors of these plans are trying to help those most in need, and recognize that the market needs fixing.'b'Mr. Bush, on the other hand, is still peddling the fantasy that the free market, with a little help from tax cuts, solves all problems.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s really striking about Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, however, is the tone. The stuff about providing \xe2\x80\x9cincentives\xe2\x80\x9d to buy insurance, the sneering description of good coverage as \xe2\x80\x9cgold plated,\xe2\x80\x9d is right-wing think-tank jargon.

The Wielgus scandal seemed to portend a new era in the church\xe2\x80\x99s lustration, or the purging of former secret police collaborators. So far, that has been a slow process, because Pope John Paul II guided the Polish church with principles of reconciliation and mercy rather than revenge. Only after his death did the files on the clergy begin to leak out.'b'Today in Poland, lustration has become a tool not only of revenge, but of politics. What may look like an effort to reconcile with the Communist past is something else entirely. It is an assault on reconciliation and a generational bid for power.'b'It has been difficult to deal with the Communist past in Poland in part because the transition was so smooth. Had Communism collapsed abruptly, swift retribution would have been more likely. But the new government promised to establish rule of law, and punishing people retroactively would have violated that basic principle. So a procedure was designed that called for all appointees or candidates for public office (as well as lawyers, but not the clergy) to submit affidavits stating whether or not they had been secret agents. Those who lied were to be disqualified from public service. A special lustration court was established.'b'But defining what made someone an agent proved a crucial problem. Under Communism, the secret service was omnipresent. It harassed large numbers of people, forcing many to sign loyalty declarations or to collaborate. Most people told them lies, signed the declarations and went home. In 2000, the Supreme Court declared that those who had merely appeared to cooperate, but who avoided providing the security services with any vital information, could not be considered collaborators, even if they signed agreements and met with agents.'b'Under such criteria, Bishop Wielgus was not a secret agent, even though he did sign two agreements in the 1970s to act as an informant and agent for Polish intelligence. The documents do not prove that he ever produced any reports.'b'Certainly, there were people in cells of the Solidarity underground who got paid to spy on their best friends, and these people did real damage. Unfortunately, the secret police files do not distinguish at first sight between them and others who didn\xe2\x80\x99t do much harm. To make a valid accusation, it was necessary to analyze the files and other evidence in detail. But this process was too slow for the advocates of de-communization, many of whom have always wanted to use the secret police files as a tool in fighting their opponents.'b'When historians and some journalists received access to the files, leaks soon began to attract media attention. In January 2005, the entire list of more than 120,000 names was leaked from the Institute of National Memory, where the files are held. The list did not discriminate between agents and those who were merely under surveillance. But its release pushed lustration forward. After the 2005 elections, lustration became a mechanism for enormous generational change in Polish politics and society.'b'In the early 1990s, the current president Lech Kaczynski; his twin brother Jaroslaw, who is now the prime minister; and their supporters were alienated from their higher-stature colleagues in Solidarity. President Lech Walesa even purged the Kaczynski brothers from his Chancery. So when the twins decided to create the Law and Justice party, they turned to young people on the far right. Now, driven by resentment against an entire generation of older politicians, the Kaczynskis are happy to see them purged from offices and replaced by their own loyalists.'b'A new lustration law adopted last August seems to fit these purposes well. It weakens procedural safeguards against false accusations, doing away with the presumption of innocence and making it possible to publish the contents of the file of anyone who is active in the public sphere. In other words, now virtually every sitting or aspiring official who lived under Communism is at risk of being slandered.'b'Poland has a history of such offensives on the part of its younger generation. The last one happened in 1968, when a new, home-bred generation of the Communist party used anti-Semitic slogans and accusations of revising the principles of Marxism-Leninism to push out the aging founders of postwar Communism in Poland. The most active force in this operation was the security services.'b'Today, the files produced by the very same security services serve a new generation of decidedly anti-Communist young apparatchiks, who use the past to forward their own careers.'b'This is, of course, sad but not surprising. Politics breeds conflict. And that is why politicians should leave some sensitive realms of morality alone. In South Africa, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was separated from contemporary politics. In Poland, the past has became prey for today\xe2\x80\x99s hunters, proving again that whenever history falls into the hands of politicians, distorted truth becomes an instrument for their own goals.'b'Four major bills have recently been offered in the Senate calling for mandatory controls on carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas. And last week, 10 big companies, including General Electric, Alcoa and progressive utilities like PG&amp;E of California, joined in an informal coalition to press Congress and President Bush for action.'b'All of this has been accompanied by considerable fanfare. But at least as important was a quiet little letter to the members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce from its new chairman, John Dingell.'b'A Michigan Democrat who in recent years has opposed stronger fuel economy standards for automobiles, Mr. Dingell is, at best, agnostic on global warming. But he said he would put climate change at the top of the committee agenda this year and, for good measure, would invite Al Gore \xe2\x80\x94 whose documentary \xe2\x80\x9cAn Inconvenient Truth\xe2\x80\x9d has raised public awareness of the issue \xe2\x80\x94 to testify first.'b'Mr. Gore should quickly accept. Mr. Dingell\xe2\x80\x99s support will be essential to any real progress on curbing emissions. In recent years, serious discussion of climate change has been largely confined to the Senate. But laws must be passed by both chambers, and if anything is to happen in the House, it will need Mr. Dingell\xe2\x80\x99s participation and consent.'b'That is the main reason House Speaker Nancy Pelosi established a select committee on global warming last week \xe2\x80\x94 not to end-run Mr. Dingell\xe2\x80\x99s powers, which she can\xe2\x80\x99t really do, but to elevate an issue she regards as important and to pressure  Mr. Dingell to take a leadership role.'b'Mr. Dingell is 80 now, a formidable warrior who during 51 years in the House has played a pivotal role in pushing through nearly every cornerstone environmental law, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and laws protecting wilderness and endangered species. But while he supported fuel economy standards years ago, his loyalties to Detroit have led him to oppose further restrictions. As for global warming, he has said that he needs to be convinced that the consequences are truly worth worrying about, and if they are, that the problem can be addressed without bankrupting the country.'b'Hardly a believer, in other words, but plainly open to persuasion. Which is why it\xe2\x80\x99s essential for Mr. Gore and others to become part of the conversation Mr. Dingell has invited. In the end, what is most likely to move him forward is not pressure from Ms. Pelosi or anyone else but appeals to his well-documented sense of environmental stewardship.'b'President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to come up with a serious policy on Iraq means that the Democrats will have to goad him toward one. Congress needs to do more than just oppose the latest ill-conceived military escalation. It needs to insist that American troops are not captive to the destructive policies of an Iraqi government for which sectarian revenge counts for more than national unity and civil peace.'b'To do that, it needs to demand that Mr. Bush impose firm, enforceable benchmarks on Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki \xe2\x80\x94 if any American troops are going to remain in Iraq.'b'In the Senate a nonbinding, bipartisan resolution seems headed toward early passage. Sponsored by Joseph Biden, Chuck Hagel and Carl Levin, it expresses strong opposition to sending more troops, citing the failure of the Iraqi government to keep its past promises on national reconciliation.'b'Passing this resolution by the widest possible bipartisan margin would be a good first step. It would make clear to the American people (who called for a change last November), to President Bush (who didn\xe2\x80\x99t listen) and to Mr. Maliki (who didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to notice) that the days of uncritical American support for Shiite misrule are over.'b'Already, the newly questioning tone in Congress has pushed Mr. Maliki to distance himself \xe2\x80\x94 at least publicly \xe2\x80\x94 from his ally Moktada al-Sadr, whose Mahdi Army has been responsible for some of the worst outrages against Baghdad\xe2\x80\x99s Sunni population. It is too early to say whether this is a public relations ploy, or whether Mr. Maliki will now allow the Americans and his own army to move against Mahdi Army strongholds.

They have become so glaring, in fact, that there is even speculation that the president, a good friend to the energy industry, might speak about them in his State of the Union address tonight.'b'If he does, he would only be about a term-and-a-half too late. Our government\xe2\x80\x99s record on resource revenue management \xe2\x80\x94 a bipartisan record, one should add \xe2\x80\x94 looks more like that of a corruption-ridden failing state than that of an advanced industrial country. Many of the same failures we criticize elsewhere \xe2\x80\x94 for example, the mismanagement of the Iraqi oil industry \xe2\x80\x94 are rampant here.'b'Like the Iraqi government, the United States government lacks the systems to determine exactly how much oil and gas is being produced on federal properties. Private lawsuits and state investigations have exposed systematic underpayment by companies on gas leases, yet the Interior Department relies on these companies to tell the government how much they owe, with no independent verification.'b'The department\xe2\x80\x99s inspector general, Earl E. Devaney, found that the government\xe2\x80\x99s bookkeeping is so poor that it does not actually know how much money it recovered, nor how many audits it conducted. The inspector general also found the department unable to verify quantities and prices for payments-in-kind (when the government takes a share of the oil and gas instead of cash), which are a growing portion of the royalties the government collects.'b'Interior\xe2\x80\x99s mismanagement is compounded by the secrecy that surrounds the entire enterprise. Though these are payments to the government for oil and gas extracted from public lands, companies are not required to disclose either payments or production levels to the public. The department says such data must be protected, because it could reveal pricing strategies and cost structures.'b'Such secrecy is contrary to the public\xe2\x80\x99s right to know what is being done on public lands. It is also contrary to an emerging international standard of transparency and accountability regarding oil, gas and mining revenues \xe2\x80\x94 standards that the United States is pressing developing countries to adopt.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s more, energy companies have shown a willingness to comply with these standards. BP almost got kicked out of Angola for trying to disclose its payments there without Angola\xe2\x80\x99s permission. Newmont and other mining companies have started posting on their Web sites information about taxes and fees they pay to individual governments. Statoil, a large international operator, is required by Norwegian law to report, country by country, all taxes paid at home and to foreign governments.'b'ExxonMobil, ChevronTexaco, Shell, Total, Anglo American and many other international oil and mining companies are part of the international Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative \xe2\x80\x94 under which they report all royalties, taxes, fees, bonuses and payments-in-kind.'b'In some countries that take part in the initiative, company payments are lumped together before publication. Nigeria, however, requires individual disclosure. Surely the United States should not have a lower standard of disclosure than Nigeria.'b'Congress, with the president\xe2\x80\x99s encouragement, should insist that the United States practice at home the transparency it preaches abroad. It should enact a requirement that all companies extracting oil, gas and other minerals from federal lands publicly report all of their production on those lands and all royalties and other payments made to the federal government from that production.'b'Only then can the American public have confidence that the taxes owed  by those who have benefited from the use of our public lands are being properly accounted for and fully collected.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cU.S. Toll in Iraq Is 27 for Deadly Weekend\xe2\x80\x9d'b'(front page, Jan. 22):'b'There were 27 more unwelcome knocks at the door in the United States this past weekend, following more than 3,000 others since this war began.'b'Each one revealed to a loving family the devastating death of an American soldier, and to the nation a painful yet significant opportunity to stop, reassess what\xe2\x80\x99s gone wrong in Iraq and do whatever possible to prevent a bad situation from becoming much, much worse.'b'President Bush, can you hear the knocking?

The utility certainly failed spectacularly as it left 174,000 people sweltering in the dark for as long as nine days. But the report ignored a critical part of the problem: the commission itself, which has been incompetently monitoring the energy monopoly.'b'The commission\xe2\x80\x99s draft report correctly blames Con Ed for a performance that was \xe2\x80\x9cunacceptable and a gross disservice\xe2\x80\x9d to its customers. The utility underestimated the problem and made bad decisions that prolonged the blackout. It compounded its shortcomings when it issued a 600-page report last fall that failed to acknowledge its own errors. For its poor performance, Con Ed should pay a hefty penalty, which should be charged to its shareholders, not its customers.'b'The bigger picture, though, is that Con Ed could not have been so mismanaged if the Public Service Commission had been doing its job. The commission is supposed to oversee the state\xe2\x80\x99s utilities, but it somehow remained blissfully blas\xc3\xa9 about the problems in Queens, despite ample warnings. An earlier blackout in Washington Heights in Manhattan prompted Eliot Spitzer, then the state\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general, to identify lurking trouble in the Queens network, where some components dated to the middle 1900s. Service quality reports from Con Ed should also have caused alarm.'b'The commission\xe2\x80\x99s failure is, sadly, not surprising. The just-departed governor, George Pataki, treated this important body as a collection of plum six-figure sinecures, and he stacked it with cronies ill suited to the job, including, most recently, a former public relations executive, Cheryl Buley, whose husband has been a major Republican donor. Mr. Pataki may also have been trying to slant the commission in favor of the energy industry, which, according to Common Cause, gave him $316,000 in campaign contributions from 1999 to 2006.'b'The Public Service Commission is badly in need of reform.

A more trenchant analysis of Iraq-style adventures appears in the histories of Thucydides, written 2,400 years ago.'b'Great Athenian diplomats of the day, like Nicias, warned against military involvement in Sicily, calling it \xe2\x80\x9ca war that does not concern us,\xe2\x80\x9d according to Thucydides. But smooth-talking neocons of the day, like the brilliant Alcibiades, said in effect that the Sicilians would welcome the Athenians with flowers. He promised that they would be treated not as occupiers but as liberators.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have many barbarians ... join us,\xe2\x80\x9d Alcibiades declared, and he argued that the enemy would be easily defeated \xe2\x80\x9crabble.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNever were the Peloponnesians more hopeless against us,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the crowds.'b'So the Athenians rallied around the flag and dispatched a huge force. But as Thucydides notes, they had suffered a grievous intelligence failure: they did not get the support they had counted on, and the enemy was far larger and more organized than they had anticipated. The war went badly, and eventually Athens was forced to confront two options: withdraw or escalate.'b'The Athenians, deciding that defeat was not an option, went with the \xe2\x80\x9csurge.\xe2\x80\x9d They dispatched an additional 70-odd ships and 5,000 troops.'b'The result was a catastrophic defeat. Thousands of Athenians were killed far from home, and others were sold into slavery.

Ahab has a reasonable goal, capturing a whale, yet he allows this quest to overwhelm him and erode his sense of perspective and balance. Ignoring warnings, refusing to admit error, Ahab abandons all rules and limits in his quest.'b'Ahab finally throws his pipe overboard; he will enjoy no pleasures until he gets that whale. The fanaticism becomes self-destructive, eventually destroying Ahab and his ship.'b'To me at least, Melville captures the trajectory of the Bush years. It begins with a president who started out after 9/11 with immense support at home and abroad and a genuine mandate to fight terrorism. But then Mr. Bush became obsessed by his responsibility to prevent another terror attack.'b'This was an eminently worthy goal, but Mr. Bush abandoned traditional rules and boundaries \xe2\x80\x94 like bans on torture and indefinite detentions \xe2\x80\x94 and eventually blundered into Iraq. And in a way that Melville could have foretold, the compulsive search for security ended up creating insecurity.'b'Melville\xe2\x80\x99s lesson is that even a heroic quest can be destructive when we abandon all sense of limits. And at a time when we hear the siren calls of moral clarity, the classics almost invariably emphasize the importance of moral nuance, an appreciation for complexity, the need for humility.'b'So, students, study those classics.

And yet, just over a month ago, this newspaper reported that China had prepared strict new criteria for foreign adoption applications because the country claimed it lacked \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d babies to meet the \xe2\x80\x9cspike\xe2\x80\x9d in demand.'b'China has always limited foreign adoptions, and it does not publish reliable statistics on the number of children in its orphanages. So how is one to know whether the decrease in adoptions reflects a lack of supply or a lack of demand?'b'In the week following the report on the new guidelines, more than one bewildered person said to me, \xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought there were lots of babies in orphanages in China!\xe2\x80\x9d My response was to helplessly reply, \xe2\x80\x9cSo did I.\xe2\x80\x9d My understanding of this was based not on conjecture, but on having been to China twice to adopt, having seen orphanages with my own eyes, and on research and other eyewitness accounts. Many hundreds and perhaps thousands of orphanages operate in China, most of them full of girls.'b'According to a February 2005 report in The Weekend Standard, a Chinese business newspaper, demographers in China found a ratio of 117 boys per 100 girls under the age of 5 in the 2000 census. Thanks to China\xe2\x80\x99s one-child policy, put into effect in 1979 in order to curb population growth, and a strong cultural preference for male children, this gender gap could result in as many as 60 million \xe2\x80\x9cmissing\xe2\x80\x9d girls from the population by the end of the decade, enough to alarm even Chinese officials.'b'And what happened to these girls? According to the International Planned Parenthood Federation (a term that takes on a whole new meaning when referring to China), there are about seven million abortions in China per year, 70 percent of which are estimated to be of females. That adds up to around five million per year, or 50 million by the end of the decade; so where are the other 10 million girls? If even 10 percent end up in orphanages... well, you do the math.'b'A few months ago, in a conversation with my friend Patrick Mason, executive director of the International Adoption Center at INOVA Fairfax Hospital in Virginia, I confessed a growing fear: that China, the country from which my two daughters were adopted, would sooner or later shut down its international adoption program. Dr. Mason immediately dismissed my concern, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThe number of orphans is just too great.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And yet, I continued to wonder whether, as China increasingly asserts itself on the world stage and prepares to host the 2008 Summer Olympics, allowing Westerners to adopt thousands of infants each year would fit the image it wanted to project. I suspect not, and China\xe2\x80\x99s new restrictions lead me to believe that national pride is more important than getting these children into loving homes.'b'The issue of abandoned and institutionalized children remains a taboo subject in China, a problem the government does not even acknowledge exists. The impulse to hide it seems to stem partly from embarrassment and partly from fear of revealing the grave human rights abuses the one-child policy has produced; surely, watching a parade of well-off foreigners cart off thousands of babies would make the Chinese authorities understandably uncomfortable.'b'But the answer is not to stop the foreigners from adopting; it is to put an end to their reasons for doing so. My fondest hope, and the hope of thousands of parents who have adopted from China, is for all the orphanages there to close because there are no more abandoned children to put in them. This will be accomplished only when China decides that there is no economic or political justification for the magnitude of suffering that has resulted from the one-child policy. The government must openly acknowledge the problem, in part by publishing verifiable information about the status of its orphaned children, and take real steps to correct it. To do so would go a long way toward building the international trust and respect China seems to want so badly.'b'China has announced the lifting of restrictions for foreign journalists in preparation for the 2008 Olympics. Perhaps this will allow reporters to look for answers to some basic questions: how many children are there in institutions in China? If there is nothing to hide, why do visitors need approval to visit orphanages? Why are only certain orphanages allowed to participate in the international adoption program, and what is going on in the ones that are not?'b'The Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, to which China and 69 other countries are signatories, goes a long way toward ensuring against child abduction and trafficking; but it does not include provisions that would require member countries to report such information as the number of children housed in institutions or the criteria used for selecting \xe2\x80\x9csuitable\xe2\x80\x9d children for adoption.'b'The treaty states that \xe2\x80\x9cfor the full and harmonious development of his or her personality,\xe2\x80\x9d each child should have the opportunity to grow up in a \xe2\x80\x9cfamily environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed, it requires that each signatory take \xe2\x80\x9cas a matter of priority, appropriate measures to enable the child to remain in the care of his or her family of origin.\xe2\x80\x9d One could argue that China\xe2\x80\x99s one-child policy directly violates the treaty by ensuring that many children will not remain in the care of the family but be relinquished to the care of the state.'b'Under the new Chinese adoption guidelines, the international adoption celebrity Angelina Jolie could not adopt from China (she\xe2\x80\x99s not married, and alas, she and Brad have more than two divorces between them, which is a no-no); nor could the actress Meg Ryan (again, not married). Another person who is not eligible is yours truly. My husband is over 50, so I would have to trade him in, marry again, wait the required five years (another new rule) before beginning the adoption process, and by that time I would be sneaking up on 50 myself.'b'It is comforting to know that Madonna is still eligible, at least until she turns 50, gets fat (the new regulations call for a body mass index of less than 40), gets divorced or goes broke (anyone with a net worth of under $80,000 is excluded).'b'The Chinese have asserted that the demand for adoptions far exceeds the number of babies it deems \xe2\x80\x9cavailable,\xe2\x80\x9d based on criteria that have never been made public. We can only wonder how many babies will be left behind by Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s new policies \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps spending their lives in institutions because of these arbitrary and artificial limits.'b'Who knew that 12 angry Americans could be so easy to come by \xe2\x80\x94 and a jury so difficult to assemble? \xe2\x80\x9cIt took us all day to get six jurors qualified,\xe2\x80\x9d Judge Reggie M. Walton lamented last Thursday, after a contentious afternoon of voir dire in the Scooter Libby trial. Judge Walton had hoped to have seated his panel by then; selection took twice as long as expected. Opening arguments are scheduled for today, not the sort of trailer you would normally run before a State of the Union address.'b'To some minds, a jury has not been the only thing missing from United States of America v. I. Lewis Libby. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the most important sense, this is a case without a crime,\xe2\x80\x9d The Wall Street Journal reminded us over the weekend. An artful leap followed: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mr. Libby is charged with perjury and obstruction of justice, which are serious offenses.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It is true that what began as a search for a leak ended \xe2\x80\x94 after much collateral damage \xe2\x80\x94 with an indictment for a lie. At this juncture it can be difficult to grasp what, precisely, is on trial. Some of us seem viscerally to wish something else were. While the original investigation stemmed from the charge that a public official had provided accurate information to the press, potential jurors appear more eager to charge a public official with having provided false information to a country. It was, after all, Mr. Libby who drafted the 2003 masterpiece that Colin Powell presented to the United Nations, the one about Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s fabled chemical and biological weapons.'b'Juror 0420, an economist, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but say she thought the Iraq war \xe2\x80\x9ca tremendous mistake, a horrendous mistake, and a betrayal.\xe2\x80\x9d She could not promise to be objective about Dick Cheney, who is slated to testify.'b'Juror 0244 reported \xe2\x80\x9cstrong negative feelings about this current administration and its conduct of the war.\xe2\x80\x9d He was gone in seconds.'b'Juror 1140 admitted: \xe2\x80\x9cI believe the vice president would have had the defendant leak.\xe2\x80\x9d Had she any preconceived notions? \xe2\x80\x9cGuilty.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Juror 1298 felt that she could muster the maturity to be open-minded about Mr. Libby. But when pressed by Judge Walton on whether a witness from the administration would carry \xe2\x80\x9ca strike against them,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cProbably.\xe2\x80\x9d Home she went.'b'Juror 1980 made herself crystal clear: \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot believe any statement from the Bush administration.\xe2\x80\x9d Bye-bye.'b'These exchanges produced a little rowdiness over in the press room, where stopwatches were set to see how long a potential juror could last. Remember that door-to-door campaign the president has promised for Baghdad? Those good-will ambassadors might be better deployed in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital.'b'On the stand will be the vagaries of human memory. Hence the carefully crafted questions submitted by Libby\xe2\x80\x99s team for prospective jurors: Can you honestly misremember? Is the memory like a tape recorder, or does it make mistakes? Can you falsely believe someone told you something when it was someone else, at a prior date? Can you hold to your memories even after they are found to be inaccurate?'b'The defense will contend that Mr. Libby\xe2\x80\x99s recollections were honest, even if incorrect. \xe2\x80\x9cConfused, forgot or misremembered\xe2\x80\x9d are not crimes. Deliberate lying is; to be convicted, Mr. Libby must be shown to have willfully misled.'b'He claims to have been preoccupied with  vital security issues and buried under intelligence information; he paid little heed to the matter of a C.I.A. officer\xe2\x80\x99s employment. Technically this is called the \xe2\x80\x9cHoney, I was too busy preparing the family tax return to think clearly when you asked about the lap dancers\xe2\x80\x9d defense.'b'Surely it\xe2\x80\x99s a legitimate one, if perhaps a little tough to swallow after six years of distorted intelligence and Enron-grade responsibility. Also, is it just me, or does that argument sound disconcertingly familiar? Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it Mr. Libby\xe2\x80\x99s ex-boss who \xe2\x80\x94 when asked why he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t served in Vietnam \xe2\x80\x94 replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI had other priorities in the \xe2\x80\x9960s than military service\xe2\x80\x9d?'b'Generally, a memory can prove a dangerous thing to have under this administration. Even I can remember W.M.D., Mohamed Atta, African uranium, shock and awe, mission accomplished, and a heckuva job \xe2\x80\x94 and I\xe2\x80\x99m lousy when it comes to plot. The prodigious Mr. Libby, on the other hand, remembers all 79 \xe2\x80\x9cStar Trek\xe2\x80\x9d episodes. And their titles, too.'b'The new Democratic leadership in Congress has a chance to finally do what the Republican Congress and the Bush administration failed to do after Sept. 11: to protect the nation\xe2\x80\x99s chemical plants from an attack. Lawmakers should stop the Homeland Security Department from adopting new regulations that would block state and local governments from doing more to protect their residents and should  pass a federal law with teeth.'b'An attack on a single plant could release deadly chemicals that could put hundreds of thousands of people at risk of death or serious injury. But since Sept. 11, the chemical industry \xe2\x80\x94 a major campaign contributor \xe2\x80\x94 has managed to ward off any significant new federal rules that might require it to spend money to increase security.'b'Now it is going a step further by trying to get the federal government to \xe2\x80\x9cpre-empt,\xe2\x80\x9d or invalidate, state and local efforts to impose safety standards. Supporters of pre-emption always claim that they just want a uniform standard. But in situations like this one \xe2\x80\x94 where the federal law is absurdly weak \xe2\x80\x94 it is obvious that the real agenda is to block serious safety measures at every level of government.'b'Congress wisely refused to include a pre-emption provision in legislation it adopted last year. Now, however, the Homeland Security Department has proposed regulations that would give itself the authority to pre-empt state and local laws. If the proposed regulations were adopted, they could wipe away the serious chemical plant security law that New Jersey has passed, and prevent other states and cities from requiring the chemical industry to do more to protect their residents.'b'It is up to Congress to act. It should block these deeply flawed regulations and move quickly to pass a comprehensive law that imposes tough requirements on chemical plants to harden their facilities.'b'Last year Congress passed a bad rider, backed by the industry, that gives the chemical industry far too much leeway to decide on its own how its plants are vulnerable and how to protect them. The new law should contain specific requirements for plant safety. It should also require companies to switch to safer chemicals when the cost is not prohibitive, a key safety measure that the industry has resisted. And it should clearly state that federal chemical-plant laws do not pre-empt state and local laws. Congress should finally put the public\xe2\x80\x99s safety ahead of the chemical industry\xe2\x80\x99s bottom line.'b'To the Editor:'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Other Losing War,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' by Orlando Patterson (column, Jan. 13), implies that President Richard M.

They confirmed last year\xe2\x80\x99s discovery of the nicotine increase by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and went on to identify how the tobacco companies designed their cigarettes to accomplish this.'b'These manipulations were discovered because Massachusetts requires manufacturers to use a more realistic test to measure how much nicotine is deliverable to typical smokers and requires companies to report design features of their cigarettes. When Harvard researchers reanalyzed the data they found that the nicotine yield per cigarette rose by an average of 11 percent between 1998 and 2005, a conclusion contested by the industry.'b'Harvard researchers concluded that the companies managed this by using tobacco containing a higher concentration of nicotine and perhaps also by slowing the rate at which cigarettes burned \xe2\x80\x94 thus increasing the number of puffs per cigarette. The companies presumably hoped that additional nicotine would hook more new customers and keep old ones from breaking the habit.'b'Their continued bad behavior makes it imperative for Congress to grant the Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco products, including the power to reduce nicotine levels and demand extensive data from the companies. The Senate overwhelmingly approved such legislation in 2004, only to have House Republicans block it. With new Democratic majorities in both houses, it is time to rein in this rogue industry.'b'To learn why a resurgent Taliban is fighting American and NATO troops to a military draw in Afghanistan, you have to go to the frontier region on both sides of the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.'b'Our colleague, Carlotta Gall, did just that last month and what she learned led to a physical assault on her by Pakistani intelligence officials and five hours in custody for her photographer, Akhtar Soomro. The Pakistani agents broke into her hotel room and copied her notes and computer files. They then tracked down and questioned everyone she had interviewed in Quetta, a border city.'b'We now know why. Ms. Gall\xe2\x80\x99s reporting has determined that Quetta is an important rear base for the Taliban, and that Pakistani authorities are encouraging and perhaps sponsoring the cross-border insurgency. That is a role that Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, denies. But residents of the border area, opposition figures and Western diplomats point to specific cases of Pakistani involvement. Americans need to know more about this collusion and to demand better answers from General Musharraf.'b'There are many reasons that things are now going badly for the American-backed Afghan government. America shortchanged Afghanistan\xe2\x80\x99s security in its rush to invade Iraq. European allies have inexcusably failed to provide NATO with enough soldiers to carry out the expanded Afghan security mission it took on last year and have imposed hobbling restrictions on the activities of those they did send. The government of the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, is rife with corruption, and the regional warlord allies it depends on to control outlying areas are even more thieving as well as shockingly brutal.'b'These problems all need to be addressed. But the positive results will be limited as long as Afghanistan\xe2\x80\x99s much more populous and powerful neighbor, Pakistan, provides rear support and sanctuary for the Taliban insurgency.'b'It is simply impossible to believe that this support takes place without the approval of the Pakistani military, the country\xe2\x80\x99s dominant institution for a half-century.'b'Pakistan is now the third-largest recipient of American foreign aid. Yet more than five years after 9/11, the Bush administration has still not been able to secure Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s active and consistent support against the Taliban. The very least Washington should be demanding of President Musharraf is that he enforce an immediate halt on Pakistani military support for the Taliban insurgents who are crossing the border and killing American troops.'b'Two excessively lenient court decisions have allowed the manufacturers of brand-name drugs to resume the underhanded practice of paying generic competitors to keep their drugs off the market. It is a costly legal loophole that needs to be plugged by Congressional legislation.'b'The problem arises when a generic manufacturer tries to take its drug to market before the patent on a brand-name drug has expired by arguing that its product does not infringe upon the patent or that the patent is invalid. Huge sums of money are at stake, especially with blockbuster drugs whose annual sales can exceed a billion dollars.'b'Rather than risk it all, a brand-name manufacturer may choose to pay its generic competitor substantial compensation to drop its challenge and delay marketing its drug. Both companies make out handsomely. The big losers are consumers and the public and private insurers that must continue to pay monopoly prices for the brand-name drugs.'b'The Federal Trade Commission, which has been waging a valiant fight, succeeded for several years in eliminating such settlements. But two appeals court decisions in 2005 held that they are a legitimate way to resolve patent disputes. And sure enough, the F.T.C. reported last week that \xe2\x80\x94 after a five-year hiatus \xe2\x80\x94 brand-name companies made 3 such do-not-compete settlements in fiscal year 2005 and 14 more last year.'b'The pharmaceutical industry contends that the settlements are a reasonable way to resolve disputes and that they often result in bringing generic drugs to market before a patent has expired, albeit not as soon as the generic company wanted. The industry argues that regulators and the courts should judge such settlements on a case-by-case basis.'b'Our own hunch is that the better approach for Congress to take as it moves toward corrective legislation would be a \xe2\x80\x9cbright line\xe2\x80\x9d prohibition against making any payments to delay introduction of a generic drug. That would set a clear standard and enhance the likelihood that consumers would get a chance to benefit from real competition in the pharmaceutical market.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cThe Mayor and His Tax Cuts\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 18):'b'The tax cuts proposed by Mayor Michael R.

How could it be that Danish cartoons of Muhammad led to mass violent protests, while unspeakable violence by Muslims against Muslims in Iraq every day evokes about as much reaction in the Arab-Muslim world as the weather report? Where is the Muslim Martin Luther King? Where is the \xe2\x80\x9cMillion Muslim March\xe2\x80\x9d under the banner: \xe2\x80\x9cNo Shiites, No Sunnis: We are all children of the Prophet Muhammad.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I can logically understand the lack of protest when Muslims kill Americans in Iraq.

But I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand how the mass slaughter of 70 Baghdad college students last week by Sunni suicide bombers or the blowing up of a Shiite mosque on the first day of Ramadan in 2005 evoke so little response. Every day it\xe2\x80\x99s 100 more.'b'I raise this question because the only hope left for Iraq \xe2\x80\x94 if there is any \xe2\x80\x94 is not in a U.S. counterinsurgency strategy. That may be necessary, but without a Muslim counternihilism strategy that delegitimizes the mass murder of Muslims by Muslims, there is no hope for decent politics there. It takes a village, and right now the Muslim village is mute. It has no moral voice when it comes to its own.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Koran describes the Prophet Muhammad as a Prophet of Mercy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Husain Haqqani, the Pakistani-born director of Boston University\xe2\x80\x99s Center for International Relations. \xe2\x80\x9cMuslims begin all their acts, including worship, with the words: \xe2\x80\x98In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful.\xe2\x80\x99 The Koran also says, \xe2\x80\x98To you, your faith, and to me, mine.\xe2\x80\x99 But unfortunately, these mercy-focused, peacemaking ideas are lost [today] in the overall discourse in the Muslim world about reviving lost glory and setting right the injustice of Western domination. ...'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor a Muslim Martin Luther King to emerge, Muslim discourse would have to shift away from the focus on power and glory and include taking responsibility as a community for our own situation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In fairness, for a Martin Luther King to emerge requires some free space, Saad Eddin Ibrahim, the courageous Egyptian democracy campaigner, remarked to me. But right now many liberals in the Arab world are in one way or another under house arrest by their regimes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile Islamists in Egypt have access to thousands of mosques and can meet with their followers five times a day,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Ibrahim said, liberal members of his own institute \xe2\x80\x9ccan barely move in Cairo, let alone organize a march.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Arab regimes want America to believe that there are only two choices: Islamists and the regimes, so it will side with the regimes.'b'This is one reason Mr. Ibrahim hopes the Islamists will take up the democratic agenda. They could carry it to the masses. One of the most popular Islamist leaders in the Arab world today, he notes, is Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s Sheik Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon. Up to now, though, the leaders of Hezbollah and Hamas seem to prefer being of pawns of Syria and Iran than agents of democratic change and Muslim reconciliation.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot at stake. If Iraq is ultimately unraveled by Muslim suicide-nihilism, it certainly will be a blot on our history \xe2\x80\x94 we opened this Pandora\xe2\x80\x99s box. But it will be a plague on the future of the whole Arab world.'b'If Arab Muslims can summon the will to protest only against the insults of \xe2\x80\x9cthe foreigner\xe2\x80\x9d but never the injuries inflicted by their own on their own, how can they ever generate a modern society or democracy \xe2\x80\x94 which is all about respecting and protecting minority voices and unorthodox views? And if Sunnis and Shiites can never form a social contract to rule themselves \xe2\x80\x94 and will always require an iron-fisted dictator \xe2\x80\x94 decent government will forever elude them.'b'The brutally honest Syrian-born poet Ali Ahmad Said, known as Adonis, gave an interview from Paris on March 11, 2006, with Dubai TV, and warned of what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake (translation by Memri):'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Arab individual is no less smart, no less a genius, than anyone else in the world.

Though both the Syrian and Israeli governments have denied any involvement in the talks, past experience shows that such disavowals are often the first indication of truth behind the rumors.'b'Certainly, there is nothing new about the details of the purported plan, which involves a staged Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, occupied since 1967, and the full normalization of relations between Damascus and Jerusalem. Nor is there a precedent in the willingness of Israeli and Arab leaders to enter into direct discussions without the participation or knowledge of the United States.'b'What is new is the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s apparent opposition to a Syrian-Israeli accord and the possibility that Israel, by seeking peace with one of its Arab neighbors, risks precipitating a crisis with the United States.'b'On more than one occasion, Israeli and Arab leaders have engaged in clandestine talks without informing the White House. In 1977, the envoys of Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and President Anwar Sadat of Egypt quietly met and laid the groundwork for Sadat\xe2\x80\x99s historic visit to Jerusalem and for the advent of the Egyptian-Israeli peace process. Only later, when negotiations snagged, did the parties turn to the United States and request presidential mediation.'b'In 1993, Israeli and Palestinian interlocutors, convening in Oslo, worked out the details of a peace arrangement and requested President Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s imprimatur on the accord only days before its signing. Jordan and Israel also asked Mr. Clinton to sponsor their peace treaty, initialed the following year, after they had independently agreed on its terms.'b'And in 2005, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel unilaterally ordered the evacuation of the Gaza Strip, a move widely welcomed as a stepping stone toward peace but from which the Bush administration, committed to the multilateral process stipulated by the \xe2\x80\x9croad map,\xe2\x80\x9d kept its distance. Syria and Israel have also exchanged peace proposals in the past, sometimes under American auspices, as in the 1991 conference in Madrid.'b'Yet even when the two sides negotiated bilaterally, as during the secret exchanges between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hafez al-Assad of Syria in the late 1990s, Washington approved of the contacts. American leaders agreed that the Syrian-Israeli track offered a promising alternative to the perennially stalled Israeli-Palestinian talks, and that achieving peace between the Syrian and Israeli enemies would open the door to regional reconciliation.'b'All that was before Sept. 11, however, and Syria\xe2\x80\x99s inclusion, alongside Iran and North Korea, in President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9caxis of evil.\xe2\x80\x9d Once regarded as a possible partner in a Middle East peace process, the Baathist regime of Bashar al-Assad was suddenly viewed as a source of Middle East instability, a state sponsor of terrorist groups and an implacable foe of the United States.'b'Hostility toward Damascus intensified after the incursion into Iraq, during which administration officials accused the Syrians of abetting the insurgency and concealing unconventional weapons in Iraq. More recently, the United States has accused Mr. Assad of plotting to undermine Lebanon\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to achieve independence from Syria, of assassinating anti-Syrian Lebanese and of acting as an Iranian agent in the Western Arab world.'b'The last thing Washington wants is a Syrian-Israeli treaty that would transform Mr. Assad from pariah to peacemaker and lend him greater latitude in promoting terrorism and quashing Lebanon\xe2\x80\x99s freedom. Some Israeli officials, by contrast, see substantive benefits in ending their nation\xe2\x80\x99s 60-year conflict with Syria. An accord would invariably provide for the cessation of Syrian aid to Hamas and Hezbollah, which endanger Israel\xe2\x80\x99s northern and southern sectors.'b'More crucial still, by detaching Syria from Iran\xe2\x80\x99s orbit, Israel will be able to address the Iranian nuclear threat \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps by military means \xe2\x80\x94 without fear of retribution from Syrian ground forces and missiles. Forfeiting the Golan Heights, for these Israelis, seems to be a sufferable price to pay to avoid conventional and ballistic attacks across most of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s borders.'b'The potentially disparate positions of Israel and the United States on the question of peace with Syria could trigger a significant crisis between the two countries \xe2\x80\x94 the first of Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s expressly pro-Israel presidency. And yet, facing opposition from a peace-minded Democratic Congress and from members of his own party who have advocated a more robust American role in Middle East mediation, Mr. Bush would have difficulty in withholding approval from a comprehensive Syrian-Israeli agreement.'b'Mr. Bush may not have to make that decision for some time, if ever. For all his talk of good will, Mr. Assad has made no Sadat-like gestures to Israel, and many Israelis agree with Mr. Bush that Syria should not be rewarded for its assistance to terrorism and its denial of Lebanese liberty.'b'But if trust is established on both sides and the conditions are conducive to peace, a settlement between Syria and Israel may yet be attained \xe2\x80\x94 and a clash between Israel and Washington ignited.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cSecond Drop in Cancer Deaths Could Point to a Trend, Researchers Say\xe2\x80\x9d (news article, Jan. 18):'b'News that cancer deaths have dropped for the second year is certain to be met with great optimism.'b'Early detection, improved treatments and actions taken to prevent getting cancer in the first place have clearly had a significant effect.

Pasachoff'b'Williamstown, Mass., Jan. 23, 2007'b'The White House spin ahead of George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s seventh State of the Union address was that the president would make a bipartisan call to revive his domestic agenda with \xe2\x80\x9cbold and innovative concepts.\xe2\x80\x9d The problem with that was obvious last night \xe2\x80\x94 in six years, Mr. Bush has shown no interest in bipartisanship, and his domestic agenda was set years ago, with huge tax cuts for wealthy Americans and crippling debt for the country.'b'Combined with the mounting cost of the war in Iraq, that makes boldness and innovation impossible unless Mr. Bush truly changes course. And he gave no hint of that last night. Instead, he offered up a tepid menu of ideas that would change little: a health insurance notion that would make only a tiny dent in a huge problem. More promises about cutting oil consumption with barely a word about global warming. And the same lip service about immigration reform on which he has failed to deliver.'b'At times, Mr. Bush sounded almost as if he\xe2\x80\x99d gotten the message of the 2006 elections. \xe2\x80\x9cOur citizens don\xe2\x80\x99t much care which side of the aisle we sit on \xe2\x80\x94  as long as we are willing to cross that aisle when there is work to be done,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'But we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that from Mr. Bush before. In early 2001, he promised to bring Americans together and instead embarked on his irresponsible tax cuts, a divisive right-wing social agenda and a neo-conservative foreign policy that tore up international treaties and alienated even America\xe2\x80\x99s closest allies. In the wake of 9/11, Mr. Bush had a second chance to rally the nation \xe2\x80\x94 and the world \xe2\x80\x94 only to squander it on a pointless, catastrophic war in Iraq. Mr. Bush promised bipartisanship after his re-election in 2004, and again after Hurricane Katrina. Always, he failed to deliver. He did not even mention New Orleans last night.'b'When Republicans controlled Congress and the White House, Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s only real interest was in making their majority permanent; consultation meant telling the Democrats what he had decided.'b'Neither broken promises nor failed policies changed Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s mind. So the nation has been saddled with tax cuts that have turned a budget surplus into a big deficit, education reform that has been badly managed and underfinanced, far-right judges with scant qualifications, the dismantling of regulations in order to benefit corporations at the expense of workers, and a triumph of ideology over science in policy making on the environment and medical research. All along, Americans\xe2\x80\x99 civil liberties and the constitutional balance have been trampled by a president determined to assert ever more power.'b'Now that the Democrats have taken Congress, Mr. Bush is acting as if he\xe2\x80\x99d had the door to compromise open all along and the Democrats had refused to walk through it.'b'Last night, Mr. Bush also acted as if he were really doing something to help the 47 million people in this country who don\xe2\x80\x99t have health insurance. What he offered, by the White House\xe2\x80\x99s own estimate, would take a few million off that scandalously high number and shift the burden to the states. Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s plan would put a new tax on Americans who were lucky enough to still have good health-care coverage through their employers. Some large portion of those are middle class and represented by the labor unions that Mr. Bush and the Republicans are dedicated to destroying.'b'Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s comments on Iraq added nothing to his failed policies. He did, at last, propose a permanent increase in the size of the Army and Marines that would repair some of the damage he has done to those forces. But that would take years, and it would do nothing to halt Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s spiral. Mr. Bush failed to explain how he would pay for a larger force, which would almost certainly require cutting budget-busting weapons programs. That would mean going up against the arms industry and its lobbyists \xe2\x80\x94 something Mr. Bush has never been willing to do.'b'Mr. Bush almost certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t intend it, but his speech did reinforce one vital political fact \xe2\x80\x94 that it\xe2\x80\x99s not just up to him anymore. There was a big change last night: the audience. Instead of solid Republican majorities marching in lock step with the White House, Congress is controlled by Democrats. It will be their task to give leadership to a nation that desperately wants change and expects its leaders to work together to deliver it. The Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 challenge will be to form real coalitions with willing Republicans.

System\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 20), you try to personalize the politics of the United Nations by indicating that what went wrong with the Oil for Food Program can be traced to one man, former Under Secretary General Benon Sevan.'b'You suggest that he was appointed to sensitive posts because he was a \xe2\x80\x9cproduct of a system in which who you know and where you come from count far more than merit or vision.\xe2\x80\x9d You also say he had a \xe2\x80\x9cdecidedly mixed performance.\xe2\x80\x9d I strongly disagree.'b'Mr. Sevan was appointed to highly sensitive and demanding posts \xe2\x80\x94 carrying out responsibilities that had formerly been performed by two or three assistant or under secretaries general. A check of the official records of the Security Council and the statements of, among others, American representatives to the United Nations shows that Mr. Sevan and his colleagues were commended for \xe2\x80\x9coutstanding work\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional \xe2\x80\x9cprofessionalism.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Sevan and his colleagues implemented the $64 billion Oil for Food Program in full compliance with Security Council mandates, and should not be held responsible for fundamental design problems and failures by member states, including the United States.'b'Mr. Sevan and his colleagues alerted the Security Council as soon as information on kickbacks or surcharges being paid became known, but the Security Council for various political reasons chose not to act. In the meantime, Mr. Sevan and his colleagues brought food and medicine to a devastated people and repaired vital infrastructure.  Eric L. Lewis'b'Washington, Jan. 21, 2007'b''b'The writer is Mr. Sevan\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer.'b''b'An Op-Ed article yesterday, about Israeli-Syrian relations, misidentified the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s label for Syria in 2002. Syria was described as a \xe2\x80\x9crogue state\xe2\x80\x9d; it was not part of the original \xe2\x80\x9caxis of evil.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Washington'b'HERE we are in another flu season, and this time there is plenty of vaccine to go around. The federal government helped increase  the supply by subsidizing factories that make pandemic flu vaccine and by recommending that a total of 218 million Americans get flu shots \xe2\x80\x94 the sick, the elderly, the late middle-aged and children under 5.'b'But now state and county officials expect to throw away millions of doses. This situation reflects our blas\xc3\xa9 attitude toward vaccination. Most of us consider influenza more a nuisance than a danger, except in old people. Of the 36,000 Americans who die of flu each year, most are over 65. And we assume that the elderly take their doctors\xe2\x80\x99 advice to get vaccinated.'b'In fact, the immune systems of the old and infirm don\xe2\x80\x99t respond efficiently to the flu vaccine. A better way to protect the elderly from flu, studies have shown, is to vaccinate their nurses and caretakers, their children and grandchildren.'b'The logic behind giving shots to those who are not as vulnerable (children generally experience flu as a mild disease) is part of a concept called herd immunity. We protect the weaker lambs by bolstering the fold\xe2\x80\x99s communal defenses.'b'Unfortunately, the idea of herd immunity has lost respect. In the past decade, the number of parents who refuse vaccinations of any kind for their children has more than doubled.'b'But our dismissive attitude toward flu shots amounts to a  poor public health strategy. It not only makes the weakest more vulnerable, it also destabilizes the demand for vaccine in general, prompting vaccine makers to limit production \xe2\x80\x94 and that could lead to a critical shortage in the event of a flu pandemic.'b'Vaccination has inspired a degree of public loathing in America ever since 1721, when Cotton Mather introduced variolation, a primitive form of vaccination against smallpox, in Boston. It involved scratching live smallpox virus into a person\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and Bostonians found it alarming.'b'Over the next 200 years, vaccines improved, but public skepticism persisted. During the smallpox epidemics of the early 20th century, Americans rightly worried that unsanitary smallpox vaccinations could infect their children with tetanus and other bacterial diseases. People protested vaccination orders, sometimes violently. In one episode in Greenwood, Del., in 1926, a gang led by a former army lieutenant engaged in street fights that lasted several days.'b'But  World War II changed people\xe2\x80\x99s attitudes toward vaccines. Medics inoculated military recruits with vaccines against diseases like typhoid, yellow fever, tetanus and typhus. Some of the vaccines were pretty near experimental, yet our men survived, whipped the Axis powers and came home with a positive attitude toward public health.'b'By 1947, when a dozen people in Manhattan were infected by smallpox, six million New Yorkers lined up to have the vaccine scratched into the skin of their arms and legs upon the urging of Israel Weinstein, the city health commissioner.'b'The smallpox vaccine turned out to be far more lethal than the disease outbreak itself, which had claimed only two lives. The vaccine killed at least eight and in as many as 100 other people it caused side effects including severe rashes and brain damage. Yet no one publicly complained about this risk.'b'In the spring of 1955, Jonas Salk\xe2\x80\x99s polio vaccine was licensed. And although some early bad batches of it killed or paralyzed 174 people, a relieved nation recognized its greater benefit. Salk floated across the public stage like a white-jacketed saint.'b'With the advent of vaccines against measles, rubella and mumps, the 1960s became the golden age of vaccination. But gradually, people grew complacent about the good vaccines could do; the more vaccines eliminated disease, the less important they seemed.'b'Public apathy turned to distrust in 1998, when a new vaccine against rotavirus, which causes gastrointestinal illness in infants, showed signs of causing a bowel obstruction in very rare cases. The next year, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories'b' 'b'withdrew the vaccine, RotaShield,  from the market.'b'Around the same time, pediatricians raised concerns about the use of a preservative, thimerosal,   in vaccines for children. Thimerosal contains only minuscule amounts of mercury, but as a precaution, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked vaccine makers to remove the preservative from pediatric vaccines.'b'By and large this new safety consciousness was a good thing, but caution also has its costs. The withdrawal of the RotaShield vaccine, which caused bowel obstruction in only about 1 in 20,000 children, meant that thousands of American infants who would otherwise have been vaccinated suffered severely dehydrating diarrhea. And in developing countries, where rotavirus kills hundreds of thousands of babies each year, the vaccine was never introduced.'b'The removal of thimerosal set off angry recriminations against vaccines in general. Thousands of parents of autistic children, searching for a way to explain their children\xe2\x80\x99s illness, settled on thimerosal-containing vaccines and began suing the drug industry and the government. Although these suits seem unlikely to succeed \xe2\x80\x94 no clear evidence of a link between thimerosal and autism has been found \xe2\x80\x94 they have already cost the industry hundreds of millions of dollars in court costs, and they have helped undercut public confidence in vaccination.'b'Parents are now especially reluctant to inoculate children against flu, because many flu vaccines contain thimerosal. But the tiny amount of thimerosal in the vaccines is not a health threat. There is always a small risk of unforeseen side effects, but it pales next to the harm done by influenza every year \xe2\x80\x94 and the harm it could do in the future if we have an inadequate supply of vaccine.'b'We don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether the deadly avian flu virus, which has claimed a small number of victims in Asia and Africa, will evolve in a way that allows it to sweep across the globe. But the experts are certain that it is only a matter of time before a flu pandemic strikes. Keeping the vaccine pipeline running and building immunity against all types of flu will  help us prepare. Even in apparently humdrum flu years like this one, it behooves us to join the herd and be vaccinated.'b'The United States is paying a heavy price for the mandatory sentencing fad that swept the country 30 years ago. After a tenfold increase in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s prison population \xe2\x80\x94 and a corrections price tag that exceeds $60 billion a year \xe2\x80\x94 the states have often been forced to choose between building new prisons or new schools. Worse still, the country has created a growing felon caste, now more than 16 million strong, of felons and ex-felons, who are often driven back to prison by policies that make it impossible for them to find jobs, housing or education.'b'Congress could begin to address this problem by passing the Second Chance Act, which would offer support services for people who are leaving prison. But it would take more than one new law to undo 30 years of damage:'b'\xc2\xb6Researchers have shown that inmates who earn college degrees tend to find jobs and stay out of jail once released. Congress needs to revoke laws that bar inmates from receiving Pell grants and that bar some students with drug convictions from getting other support. Following Washington\xe2\x80\x99s lead, the states have destroyed prison education programs that had long since proved their worth.'b'\xc2\xb6People who leave prison without jobs or places to live are unlikely to stay out of jail. Congress should repeal the lifetime ban on providing temporary welfare benefits to people with felony drug convictions. The federal government should strengthen tax credit and bonding programs that encourage employers to hire people with criminal records. States need to stop barring ex-offenders from jobs because of unrelated crimes \xe2\x80\x94 or arrests in the distant past that never led to convictions.'b'\xc2\xb6Congress should deny a request from the F.B.I. to begin including juvenile arrests that never led to convictions (and offenses like drunkenness or vagrancy) in the millions of rap sheets sent to employers. That would transform single indiscretions into lifetime stigmas.'b'\xc2\xb6Curbing recidivism will also require doing a lot more to provide help and medication for the one out of every six inmates who suffer mental illness.'b'The only real way to reduce the inmate population \xe2\x80\x94 and the felon class \xe2\x80\x94 is to ensure that imprisonment is a method of last resort. That means abandoning the mandatory sentencing laws that have filled prisons to bursting with nonviolent offenders who are doomed to remain trapped at the very margins of society.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cAntique Dealer Sues to Bar Homeless From Sidewalk\xe2\x80\x9d (news article, Jan. 18): The merchants of Madison Avenue would do better to band together and work with New York City and nonprofit providers in coordinated action to help the chronically homeless make the transition off the streets and into shelters and permanent homes.'b'While suing may draw temporary attention to the matter, it will hardly provide permanent relief for residents, business owners or the homeless, who need patience, treatment and a roof over their heads, not time in front of a judge. Richard Motta'b'President and C.E.O., Volunteers'b'of America-Greater New York'b'New York, Jan. 22, 2007'b'Thanks to an unusual and probably fleeting set of events, Somalia has a chance to return to the community of law-abiding and legitimate states. For a country that dissolved years ago into chronic clan warfare and became a way station for international terrorists, that would be an enormous gain \xe2\x80\x94 and an enormous gain for the rest of the world.'b'To make the most of this opportunity, Washington needs to move quickly, along with Arab and African leaders, to try to broker a political compromise between responsible leaders of the Islamic Courts Union, which was evicted from power last month by the Ethiopians, and the internationally endorsed transitional government installed in its place.'b'International peacekeepers will also be needed to replace the Ethiopian force, which is already starting to head home. Ethiopia, Somalia\xe2\x80\x99s longtime regional rival, needs to complete that withdrawal quickly to avoid a violent nationalist backlash.'b'If the transitional government is to survive, it will have to strike a deal with moderate Islamists. The person it needs to talk with is Sheik Sharif Ahmed, who is No. 2 in the movement and by most accounts a reasonable man. He is currently in Kenya after apparently getting an American guarantee that he would not be deported back to Somalia.'b'The United Nations, which helped create the transitional government, should take charge of organizing a peacekeeping force. The Arab League (Somalia is a member) and the African Union (with headquarters in Ethiopia) need to persuade all sides to come and stay at the table. Unfortunately, none of these organizations are known for operating quickly. The Bush administration needs to press them all to seize this moment. This sudden chance to make peace is not likely to last for long.'b'President Bush showed what he does well at the beginning of the State of the Union ceremony when he graciously acknowledged and introduced Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House of Representatives. He seemed both generous and sincere, and it was the right touch for a genuinely historic moment.'b'At the end of his speech he introduced four Americans of whom the nation can be proud, including Wesley Autrey, a New Yorker who made like a Hollywood stunt man to save the life of a stricken passenger who had fallen onto the tracks in front of an oncoming subway train.'b'The rest of the evening was a study in governmental dysfunction. The audience kept mindlessly applauding \xe2\x80\x94 up and down, like marionettes \xe2\x80\x94 when in fact there was nothing to applaud. The state of the union is wretched, which is why the president\xe2\x80\x99s approval ratings are the worst since Nixon and Carter.'b'If Mr. Bush is bothered by his fall from political grace, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t showing on Tuesday night. He seemed as relaxed as ever, smiling, signing autographs, glad-handing.'b'I wanted to hear him talk about the suffering of the soldiers he has put in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way, and the plight of the residents of New Orleans. I wanted to hear him express a little in the way of sorrow for the many thousands who have died unnecessarily on his watch. I wanted to see him slip the surly bonds of narcissism and at least acknowledge the human wreckage that is the sum and substance of his sustained folly.'b'But this is a president who runs when empathy calls. While others are monitoring the casualty lists, he\xe2\x80\x99s off to the gym. At least Lyndon Johnson had the decency to agonize over the losses he unleashed in Vietnam.'b'The State of the Union speech was boilerplate at a time when much of the country, with good reason, is boiling mad. The United States, the most powerful nation in the history of the world, seems paralyzed. It can\xe2\x80\x99t extricate itself from the war in Iraq, can\xe2\x80\x99t rebuild the lost city of New Orleans, can\xe2\x80\x99t provide health care for all of its citizens, can\xe2\x80\x99t come up with a sane energy policy in the era of global warming, can\xe2\x80\x99t even develop a thriving public school system.'b'If it\xe2\x80\x99s true, as President Bush told his audience, that \xe2\x80\x9cmuch is asked of us,\xe2\x80\x9d it\xe2\x80\x99s equally true that very little has been delivered.'b'The Democrats, delighted by the wounded Bush presidency, believe this is their time. Like an ostentation of peacocks, an extraordinary crowd of excited candidates is gathering in hopes of succeeding Mr. Bush.'b'But such a timid crowd!'b'Ask a potential Democratic president what he or she would do about the war, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll get a doctoral dissertation about the importance of diplomacy, the possibility of a phased withdrawal (but not too quick), the need for Iraqis to help themselves and figure out a way to divvy up the oil, and so on and so forth.'b'A straight answer? Surely you jest. The Democrats remind me of the boxer in the Bonnie Raitt lyric who was \xe2\x80\x9cafraid to throw a punch that might land.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a hole in the American system where the leadership used to be. The country that led the miraculous rebuilding effort in the aftermath of World War II can\xe2\x80\x99t even build an adequate system of levees on its own Gulf Coast.'b'The most effective answer to this leadership vacuum would be a new era of political activism by ordinary citizens. The biggest, most far-reaching changes of the past century \xe2\x80\x94 the labor movement, the civil rights movement, the women\xe2\x80\x99s movement \xe2\x80\x94 were not primarily the result of elective politics, but rather the hard work of committed citizen-activists fed up with the status quo.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s time for thoughtful citizens to turn off their TVs and step into the public arena. Protest. Attend meetings. Circulate petitions. Run for office. I suspect the public right now is way ahead of the politicians when it comes to ideas about creating a more peaceful, more equitable, more intelligent society.'b'The candidates for the most part are listening to their handlers and gurus and fat-cat contributors, which is the antithesis of democracy. It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy for ordinary men and women to be heard above that self-serving din, but it can be done.'b'Voters should listen to Dwight Eisenhower, who said in 1954:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPolitics ought to be the part-time profession of every citizen who would protect the rights and privileges of free people and who would preserve what is good and fruitful in our national heritage.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cA Middle Ground for Stem Cells,\xe2\x80\x9d by Yuval Levin (Op-Ed, Jan. 19):'b'Mr. Levin, a former executive director of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Council on Bioethics, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mention a critical fact: a great many embryos that could supply stem cells for research are left over from efforts at assisted reproduction.'b'These embryos will be destroyed in any case.

As a Newsweek correspondent, Christian Caryl, wrote recently from Baghdad, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s clear is that we\xe2\x80\x99re far closer to the beginning of this cycle of violence than to its end.\xe2\x80\x9d As John Burns of The Times said on  \xe2\x80\x9cCharlie Rose\xe2\x80\x9d last night, \xe2\x80\x9cFriends of mine who are Iraqis \xe2\x80\x94 Shiite, Sunni, Kurd \xe2\x80\x94 all foresee a civil war on a scale with bloodshed that would absolutely dwarf what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing now.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Iraq already has the warlord structures that caused mass murder in Rwanda, Bosnia, Sierra Leone and elsewhere. Violent, stupid men who would be the dregs of society under normal conditions rise amid the trauma, chaos and stress and become revered leaders.'b'They command squads of young men who leave the moral universe and have no future in a peacetime world. They kill for fun, faith and profit \xe2\x80\x94 because they find it more rewarding to massacre and loot than to farm or labor. They are manipulated by political leaders with a savage zero-sum mind-set, who know they must kill or be killed, and who are instituting strategic ethnic cleansing campaigns to expand their turf.'b'Worse, Iraq already has the psychological conditions that have undergirded the great bloodbaths of recent years. Iraqi minds, according to the most sensitive reporting, have already been rewired by the experiences of trauma and extreme stress.'b'Some people become hyperaggressive and turn into perfect killers. Others endure a phased mental shutdown that looks like severe depression. They lose their memory and become passive and fatalistic. They become perfect victims.'b'Amid the turmoil, the complexity of life falls away, and things are reduced to stark polarities: Sunni-Shiite or Shiite-Sunni, human-subhuman. Once this mental descent has begun, it is possible to kill without compunction.'b'In Rwanda, for example, the journalist Jean Hatzfeld interviewed a Hutu man who had killed his Tutsi neighbor. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the fatal instant,\xe2\x80\x9d the man recalled, \xe2\x80\x9cI did not see in him what he had been before. ... His features were indeed similar to those of the person I knew, but nothing firmly reminded me that I had lived beside him for a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The weakness of the Bush surge plan is that it relies on the Maliki government to somehow be above this vortex. But there are no impartial institutions in Iraq, ready to foster reconciliation. As ABC\xe2\x80\x99s Jonathan Karl notes in The Weekly Standard, the Shiite finance ministries now close banks that may finance Sunni investments. The Saadrist health ministries dismiss Sunni doctors. The sectarian vortex is not fomented by extremists who are appendages to society. The vortex is through and through.'b'The Democratic approach, as articulated by Senator Jim Webb \xe2\x80\x94 simply get out of Iraq \xe2\x80\x9cin short order\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 is a howl of pain that takes no note of the long-term political and humanitarian consequences. Does the party that still talks piously about ending bloodshed in Darfur really want to walk away from a genocide the U.S. is partly responsible for? Are U.S. troops going to be pulled back to secure bases to watch passively while rivers of Iraqi blood lap at their gates? How many decades will Americans be fighting to quell the cycle of regional violence set loose by a transnational Sunni-Shiite explosion?'b'I for one have become disillusioned with dreams of transforming Iraqi society from the top down. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not too late to steer the situation in a less bad direction. Increased American forces can do good \xe2\x80\x94 they are still, as David Ignatius says, the biggest militia on the block \xe2\x80\x94 provided they are directed toward realistic goals.'b'There is one option that does approach Iraqi reality from the bottom up. That option recognizes that Iraq is broken and that its people are fleeing their homes to survive. It calls for a \xe2\x80\x9csoft partition\xe2\x80\x9d of Iraq in order to bring political institutions into accord with the social facts \xe2\x80\x94 a central government to handle oil revenues and manage the currency, etc., but a country divided into separate sectarian areas to reduce contact and conflict. When the various groups in Bosnia finally separated, it became possible to negotiate a cold (if miserable) peace.'b'Soft partition has been advocated in different ways by Joe Biden and Les Gelb, by Michael O\xe2\x80\x99Hanlon and Edward Joseph, by Pauline Baker at the Fund for Peace, and in a more extreme version, by Peter Galbraith.'b'On Sunday, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give further publicity to their recommendations.'b'For six years, off and on, President Bush has been talking about the need for alternative fuels and conservation to make the country less beholden to unreliable sources of foreign oil. Yet all he has to show for it is a growing dependence on foreign oil, a growing climate problem and an increasingly cynical public. Mr. Bush talked the same game on Tuesday night, offering several impressively specific goals. But whether these new pledges turn out to be as empty as the old ones depends on his capacity for follow-through, and history is not encouraging.'b'Mr. Bush was true to form on one subject. The White House had promised nothing on global warming, and he delivered nothing. He mentioned \xe2\x80\x9cglobal climate change\xe2\x80\x9d but showed no sense of urgency on the issue. Nor was there any sign that he had even heard the ever-louder entreaties from Congress \xe2\x80\x94 and from many of his friends in the business community \xe2\x80\x94 that he support a national program of mandatory reductions in greenhouse gases.'b'At one point, he did suggest that his proposals for alternative fuels and more efficient automobiles could also help reduce greenhouse gases. But these gains would be marginal \xe2\x80\x94 passenger vehicles account for only one-fifth of these gases. And even these gains will greatly depend  on what alternative fuels are chosen.'b'Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiasms mainly involved energy independence. He called for replacing 35 billion gallons of gasoline with renewable or alternative fuels by 2017, and for modest but steady improvements in the efficiency of cars and light trucks, a category that includes S.U.V.\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'But he offered no specifics on where these 35 billion gallons in alternative fuels are going to come from. Corn ethanol, a favorite of farm state politicians, cannot be expected to provide more than 15 billion gallons without driving up food prices. Cellulosic ethanol, made from grasses and woody material, shows great promise. But there is no commercial refinery in operation today, and there is not expected to be one for several years. Hydrogen, a longtime Bush favorite, is even further down the road.'b'That leaves gasoline derived from coal, a method now being championed by governors and senators from coal-producing states. The technology is well established. But refining and then burning a gallon of gasoline derived from coal would send nearly twice as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as a conventional gallon of gasoline and would thus be a disaster for global warming. Trying to sequester the carbon dioxide underground during the refining process would be hugely expensive.'b'Which raises the next question about the Bush plan: Where\xe2\x80\x99s the money coming from? Despite growing interest among venture capitalists in environmentally friendly technologies, it seems unrealistic to depend on the private sector alone. Washington must help. But federal research and development spending on energy has been in free fall for more than 20 years. And even after Mr. Bush made a big deal about cellulosic ethanol in last year\xe2\x80\x99s address, he came up with only about $30 million in new money to help move the technology forward.'b'Once again, we have heard this president make big promises about energy independence. Once again, we fear that very little will change. It would be nice, for once, to be surprised.'b'The federal investigation into Congressional corruption is approaching a crucial deadline and potential dead end. Feb. 15 is the last day on the job for United States Attorney Carol Lam of San Diego, the inquiry\xe2\x80\x99s dedicated prosecutor, who is being purged by the Bush administration.'b'Her investigation led to the imprisonment of former Representative Randy Cunningham, the California Republican who took millions of dollars in bribes in exchange for delivering lucrative government contracts. But just as Ms. Lam was digging into other possible wrongdoing, the White House decided to force her from office without explanation.'b'Ms. Lam has been investigating the dealings of Brent Wilkes, a private contractor and deep-pocketed political contributor who was designated co-conspirator No. 1 in the Cunningham case. Mr. Wilkes developed other cozy relationships. Among other avenues, the inquiry has been looking into rich government contracts secured by corporations and lobbyists with ties to Representative Jerry Lewis \xe2\x80\x94 the former appropriations chairman \xe2\x80\x94 and his staff. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Mr. Wilkes could be indicted before Ms. Lam leaves office. The question now is whether her successor, as yet unnamed, will pursue the inquiry with the same dedication or will quietly smother it.'b'The outlook isn\xe2\x80\x99t promising. The administration is defenestrating at least six other U.S. attorneys. Yet Attorney General Alberto Gonzales is refusing to provide Congress with details on these unmerited dismissals. He insists that there\xe2\x80\x99s no attempt to quash fresh Republican scandals and says only the \xe2\x80\x9cvery best\xe2\x80\x9d will be named as replacements.'b'We are skeptical, especially since the White House\xe2\x80\x99s reported choice to replace Little Rock\xe2\x80\x99s federal attorney is a Republican operative close to Karl Rove. Congress must demand a clear explanation from Mr. Gonzales and the White House on why these prosecutors are being ousted. It must search out every shady aspect of this clearly politically motivated purge \xe2\x80\x94 with a particular eye on Feb. 15.'b'To the Editor:'b'Benjamin Hufbauer is right on the issues he raises in \xe2\x80\x9cArchives of Spin\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Jan. 20), but in my view he does not go far enough.'b'Part of the problem is that for the National Archives, a tiny federal agency, planning a president\xe2\x80\x99s library is about the only access to power it has in Washington.'b'So archive officials are hardly the ones to tell a president that it would make far more sense in terms of access, cost and processing to leave his papers at a newly created archives unit: the Center for the Study of the Presidency.'b'It does not serve anyone well, except, as Mr. Hufbauer suggests, those who want to impede historical scrutiny, to carve out White House records from the rest of an administration and haul them off to remote locations. As for researchers whose topics cut across more than one administration, the cost of crisscrossing the country can be substantial.'b'Franklin D. Roosevelt established a system to make sure presidential papers are preserved as a public trust. But it is no longer necessary to scatter them around the country to achieve this.'b'If presidents choose to build and operate private, nongovernmental museums to themselves in their hometowns, let them.'b'Verne W.

Roosevelt Presidential Library.'b''b'Mark Foley fled his seat in the House of Representatives last September when his sexual approaches to teenage pages finally reached the news media after years of a shameful cover-up in the halls of Congress. Now it turns out that the F.B.I. was just as phlegmatic about the scandal as Mr. Foley\xe2\x80\x99s Republican colleagues. An inspector general\xe2\x80\x99s report excoriates F.B.I. agents for brushing aside \xe2\x80\x9ctroubling\xe2\x80\x9d evidence of the lawmaker\xe2\x80\x99s flirtatious message-writing, and then falsely blaming their inaction on the watchdog group that tried to alert the government in the first place.'b'The report underlines the calculated indifference at the heart of the scandal. In their final hours in power, the Republicans who controlled the ethics committee issued a report that whitewashed the fact that key members of the Republican leadership and their staff members were aware of Mr. Foley\xe2\x80\x99s long predatory history. The F.B.I. inspector general\xe2\x80\x99s report showed the same indifference among law enforcement officials charged with investigating Mr. Foley\xe2\x80\x99s actions. The report describes one F.B.I. supervisor who said he had read Mr. Foley\xe2\x80\x99s e-mail notes and thought, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a freak,\xe2\x80\x9d but who had then sent the evidence on a fruitless bureaucratic roundabout.'b'The lug-headed consensus was that there had been no real crime, when \xe2\x80\x94 as the inspector general pointed out \xe2\x80\x94 agents should have been urgently alerting the page program\xe2\x80\x99s supervisors.'b'When the scandal finally became public, the F.B.I. falsely claimed that a watchdog group \xe2\x80\x94 Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics \xe2\x80\x94 had been uncooperative and withheld vital information. In truth, it had been entirely forthcoming in passing on full details from a former page who had complained about Mr. Foley\xe2\x80\x99s lewd predilections.'b'The new Congress voted to overhaul protections by mandating that an oversight board of surrogates be enlarged to include a former page and a page\xe2\x80\x99s parent. It will have an even balance of House members to end the majority control that helped bury the Foley scandal. The F.B.I. had better take stock, too, and treat Congress with less wariness.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cEditor Who Spoke for Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s Ethnic Armenians Is Slain\xe2\x80\x9d (news article, Jan. 20):'b'Hrant Dink, whom I met in Yerevan, Armenia, in 2005, was a fearless fighter for truth and human dignity.

Such treatment, applied to a profoundly intellectually disabled girl known only as Ashley, has led to criticism of Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s parents, of the doctors who carried out the treatment, and of the ethics committee at Seattle Children\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital, which approved it.'b'Ashley is 9, but her mental age has never progressed beyond that of a 3-month-old. She cannot walk, talk, hold a toy or change her position in bed. Her parents are not sure she recognizes them. She is expected to have a normal lifespan, but her mental condition will never improve.'b'In a blog, Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s parents explain that her treatment is not for their convenience but to improve her quality of life. If she remains small and light, they will be able to continue to move her around frequently and take her along when they go out with their other two children. The hysterectomy will spare her the discomfort of menstrual cramps, and the surgery to prevent the development of breasts, which tend to be large in her family, will make her more comfortable whether lying down or strapped across the chest in her wheelchair.'b'All this is plausible, even if it is also true that the line between improving Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s life and making it easier for her parents to handle her scarcely exists, because anything that makes it possible for Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s parents to involve her in family life is in her interest.'b'The objections to Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s treatment take three forms familiar to anyone working in bioethics. First, some say Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s treatment is \xe2\x80\x9cunnatural\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a complaint that usually means little more than \xe2\x80\x9cYuck!\xe2\x80\x9d One could equally well object that all medical treatment is unnatural, for it enables us to live longer, and in better health, than we naturally would. During most of human existence, children like Ashley were abandoned to become prey to wolves and jackals. Abandonment may be a \xe2\x80\x9cnatural\xe2\x80\x9d fate for a severely disabled baby, but it is no better for that reason.'b'Second, some see acceptance of Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s treatment as the first step down a slippery slope leading to widespread medical modification of children for the convenience of their parents. But the ethics committee that approved Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s treatment was convinced that the procedures were in her best interest. Those of us who have not heard the evidence presented to the committee are in a weak position to contest its judgment.'b'In any case, the \xe2\x80\x9cbest interest\xe2\x80\x9d principle is the right test to use, and there is no reason that other parents of children with intellectual disabilities as profound as Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s should not have access to similar treatments, if they will also be in the interest of their children. If there is a slippery slope here, the much more widespread use of drugs in \xe2\x80\x9cproblem\xe2\x80\x9d children who are diagnosed as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder poses a far greater risk than attenuating growth in a small number of profoundly disabled children.'b'Finally, there is the issue of treating Ashley with dignity. A Los Angeles Times report on Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s treatment began: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is about Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s dignity. Everybody examining her case seems to agree at least about that.\xe2\x80\x9d Her parents write in their blog that Ashley will have more dignity in a body that is healthier and more suited to her state of development, while their critics see her treatment as a violation of her dignity.'b'But we should reject the premise of this debate. As a parent and grandparent, I find 3-month-old babies adorable, but not dignified. Nor do I believe that getting bigger and older, while remaining at the same mental level, would do anything to change that.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s where things get philosophically interesting. We are always ready to find dignity in human beings, including those whose mental age will never exceed that of an infant, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t attribute dignity to dogs or cats, though they clearly operate at a more advanced mental level than human infants. Just making that comparison provokes outrage in some quarters. But why should dignity always go together with species membership, no matter what the characteristics of the individual may be?'b'What matters in Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s life is that she should not suffer, and that she should be able to enjoy whatever she is capable of enjoying. Beyond that, she is precious not so much for what she is, but because her parents and siblings love her and care about her. Lofty talk about human dignity should not stand in the way of children like her getting the treatment that is best both for them and their families.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cOverhaul of Schools Would Let Teachers Rate Principals\xe2\x80\x9d (news article, Jan. 19):'b'Let me pretend that I am still an active high school principal.

Even White House officials acknowledged earlier this week that they expected the number of uninsured to drop by only three million to five million people as a result of Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s proposals. They expect the states to take on most of the burden.'b'One enlightened element is that the plan would provide equal tax treatment to those who bought their insurance policies on the individual market and those who got coverage through group policies at work, thus ending a longstanding inequity that favors employer-based policies. To level the playing field, the administration proposes to grant everyone who gets qualifying health insurance a standard deduction \xe2\x80\x94 $15,000 for family coverage or $7,500 for single coverage \xe2\x80\x94 off their income subject to taxation. Those with family policies exceeding $15,000 in value would have to pay taxes on the excess amount.'b'After the proposed starting date in 2009, the administration estimates, about 80 percent of workers with employer-provided policies would pay lower taxes and 20 percent would pay higher taxes, unless they reduced the value of their health coverage to fit within the standard deduction.'b'The new standard deduction would almost certainly entice some people to buy health insurance who had previously elected not to. But a tax deduction is of little value to people so poor that they pay little or no income tax. And unfortunately, it is those people who account for the vast majority of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s uninsured.'b'Instead of trying to fix that fundamental flaw, the administration has decided instead to buck it to the states. The White House has offered few details. But its idea is to allow states to redirect federal money that now helps to finance hospitals that provide charity care and use it instead to subsidize health insurance for the poor.'b'In an ideal world, it would make good sense to insure people in advance rather than wait for them to show up in a high-cost emergency room. But this plan could quickly cripple the safety-net hospitals. Fortunately, no governor would have to accept the offer to redirect funds. The scheme is mostly a reflection of how the administration is unwilling to accept true responsibility for the uninsured.'b'If the administration really wanted to help low-income people, it would have proposed a refundable tax credit that would have the same dollar value for everyone \xe2\x80\x94 instead of a tax deduction, which primarily helps people in high tax brackets. Even those who do not pay taxes would get a check for the dollar value of the credit, providing them at least some money to help pay for health insurance. Congress ought to recognize that credits are the better approach for even such a limited plan.'b'As for the tax increases on those \xe2\x80\x9cgold plated\xe2\x80\x9d health policies, the White House is hoping to discourage people from using high-priced comprehensive health policies that cover everything from routine office visits to costly diagnostic procedures that are not always necessary.'b'The administration\xe2\x80\x99s goal is to instead encourage people to take out policies that might reduce the use of medical services, like policies with high deductibles or co-payments, or managed care plans. But even \xe2\x80\x9ccopper plated\xe2\x80\x9d policies can exceed $15,000 in cost if they are issued in areas where medical prices are high or to groups with high numbers of older or chronically ill workers.'b'The whole approach rests on the premise that comprehensive prepaid health policies are a major factor in driving up costs; the theory is that people will tend to use services if they are covered. There is probably some truth in that.'b'But the main drivers in rising health costs are the costly services, high-priced drugs and hospitalizations for people who are seriously ill with catastrophic diseases or multiple chronic illnesses. Making their health coverage less generous would simply make it harder for them to get the care they need.'b'The greatest risk in the president\xe2\x80\x99s proposal is that it would seem likely to lead many small- and medium-size employers to stop offering health benefits altogether on the theory that their workers could buy affordable insurance on their own. That would leave many more Americans at the mercy of the dysfunctional individual policy market, where administrative costs are high and insurers strive to avoid covering people who are apt to become sick and need costly care.'b'For all its fanfare, Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s plan would be unlikely to reduce the ranks of the uninsured very much. And if things went badly, it could actually increase their numbers. That\xe2\x80\x99s not the answer Americans are waiting for and not what they deserve.'b'To the Editor:'b'Bravo to Tom Moore for \xe2\x80\x9cClassroom Distinctions\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Jan. 19)!'b'Sainthood and martyrdom should not be prerequisites for successful teaching in high-poverty schools. While many teachers qualify on both counts, that is not the sine qua non for making a difference in a child\xe2\x80\x99s life.'b'Effective teachers will tell you they need smaller class sizes and a safe, adequately staffed, supportive environment where they are treated as professionals and asked for input.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s what we fight for every day; and it\xe2\x80\x99s the least we can do to help our teachers help our students.'b'Randi Weingarten 'b'President'b'United Federation of Teachers'b'New York, Jan. 22, 2007'b''b''b''b'IT was only a matter of time before someone was able to spot the test driver deep within me. O.K., test parker: I was asked if I would do a road test of the self-parking device on the new Lexus LS 460 L. Although I like to think that I was being perceived as a laconic man with steel nerves and steady hands, I suspect that the invitation had something to do with my authorship of \xe2\x80\x9cTepper Isn\xe2\x80\x99t Going Out,\xe2\x80\x9d which is considered by most scholars to have been the first parking novel. It might even have had something to do with the fact that in 1964 I was the founding co-editor of Beautiful Spot: A Magazine of Parking, which I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen referred to as a one-issue publication even though we prefer to say that the second issue hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come out yet. (We\xe2\x80\x99ve had some production difficulties.)'b'If I were asked to name my talent \xe2\x80\x94 talent, that is, in the way the Miss America pageant uses the word talent, as in \xe2\x80\x9cMiss West Virginia will now do her talent\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 I would say \xe2\x80\x9cparallel parking.\xe2\x80\x9d For the second issue of Beautiful Spot: A Magazine of Parking, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been preparing an article on how I came up with the term \xe2\x80\x9cslicing the bread\xe2\x80\x9d to describe maneuvering into a spot that leaves only the width of a bread slice between  your bumpers and the bumpers of the cars ahead of and behind you. In a later issue, I intend to discuss \xe2\x80\x9cbreaking the matzo\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 getting into a spot so small that a matzo would crack if you tried  to place it between the relevant bumpers. Just for the record, the last time I broke a matzo was May  1994, on Riverside Drive, between 83rd and 84th; unfortunately, there were no witnesses.'b'So I didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually need what Lexus calls an Advanced Parking Guidance System to help me park. On the other hand, even though I consider myself pretty good at washing pots and pans, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to hand that chore over to an advanced scullery system. So I told the Lexus man to bring the car around to my house. I said that I\xe2\x80\x99d stand on the sidewalk nearby, say \xe2\x80\x9cPark!\xe2\x80\x9d in a commanding tone, and watch the Lexus LS 460 L do its stuff. He told me that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t how the Advanced Parking Guidance System worked. I told him to bring the Lexus LS 460 L around to my house anyway: I had already alerted the neighbors.'b'The first thing the Lexus man did was to ask whether I wanted a massage. I looked at him for a few moments, hoping to ascertain if he was trying to get fresh. Test drivers face that sort of thing all the time. Then he explained that the Executive Seating Package (something similar to what I used to refer to as the back seat) included a shiatsu massage function. I had a massage. Then I got behind the wheel and we set out to find a beautiful spot.'b'Well, not exactly a beautiful spot. A spot that is worthy of that name \xe2\x80\x94 a truly satisfying spot, a spot good enough to spin yarns about in bars where parkers gather \xe2\x80\x94 requires some skill to get into. The Advanced Parking Guidance System works only if the spot is six and a half feet longer than the car \xe2\x80\x94 the sort of spot, in other words, that the average Manhattan parker comes upon about once every 14 or 15 years. The only parker who might need help from a guidance  system to get into such a spot is a parker who is driving himself home from rotator cuff surgery. For Lexus to offer a self-parking system for a spot that size is the equivalent of some high-end kitchen-equipment manufacturer offering a self-carving system that only works on meatloaf.'b'Still, I can report that for the meatloaf parker, the Advanced Parking Guidance System does work, assuming you have the time to fiddle with the screen long enough to make sure that the little yellow flag is where it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be and the box representing the spot is correctly positioned. As you ease up gradually on the brake, the wheel turns on its own to make one reverse swoop into the spot. Watching the wheel turn by itself is a bit like watching a player piano, except in traffic.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut can it find a spot?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked the Lexus man. The Lexus man said the Advanced Parking Guidance System cannot find a spot. That stands to reason. After all, it\xe2\x80\x99s the first self-parking system \xe2\x80\x94 the equivalent of a cellphone so primitive that its only function is to make and receive phone calls.'b'As the competition heats up, improvements are inevitable. I can see Nissan coming out with a screen on its Infinitis that shows the open spaces in a three- or four-block area, with spots near fire plugs or in front of driveways automatically blanked out. Then Mercedes answers with a system capable of finding spots that are what people who deal with New York alternate-side parking regulations call \xe2\x80\x9cgood for tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Then Lexus fights back. The new Lexis LS 560 or 660 is announced with an advertisement that says, \xe2\x80\x9cOur guarantee: You can be the first on your block to break the matzo.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Sorry to repeat myself, but I have the same reaction to this year\xe2\x80\x99s energy proposals in the State of the Union that I had to last year\xe2\x80\x99s. President Bush had the opportunity to launch America on a transformative new path for clean, efficient power. He had a chance for a \xe2\x80\x9cNixon to China\xe2\x80\x9d moment \xe2\x80\x94 as the Texas oilman who leads us into a greener future. Instead, he gave us \xe2\x80\x9cNixon to New Mexico\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 right direction, but not nearly far enough.'b'As I read the president\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, listened to the tepid public reaction and looked at his latest polls, which show Mr. Bush to be wildly unpopular, it seemed to me that the American people basically fired George Bush in the last election. We\xe2\x80\x99re now just watching him clean out his desk. Both his energy proposals and his recent Iraq surge were about the best he could muster, given his pink slip.'b'The problem is that he is going to be cleaning out his desk for another two years, and Americans deserve better. I would love to see Democrats put that something better on Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s desk \xe2\x80\x94 regarding both energy and Iraq.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe stakes on Iraq and on climate change are way too large for us all to be just couch potatoes waiting for the messiah to come in 2009,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fred Krupp, president of Environmental Defense. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is not an option. Yes, it would be entertaining, but we need leadership on these issues, and we need it now.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'On energy \xe2\x80\x94 no, the president\xe2\x80\x99s proposals were not just beanbag. His call to reform CAFE mileage standards for U.S. cars \xe2\x80\x9cshifts the debate from whether to compel U.S. automakers to build more fuel-efficient vehicles to how much they should do so,\xe2\x80\x9d notes a strategy consultant, Peter Schwartz. And his call for a nearly fivefold mandatory increase in the production of ethanol and other alternative fuels for cars and trucks also changes the debate from whether to how much, and which fuels.'b'But the devil will be in the details. Will liquefied coal be one of those alternatives \xe2\x80\x94 which could add to global warming \xe2\x80\x94 or only non-fossil-fuel alternatives? On mileage standards, U.S. automakers will lobby the White House very hard for the smallest possible change. Will they get their way? If so, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t much here.'b'The really bold, transformative \xe2\x80\x94 and popular \xe2\x80\x94 initiative Mr. Bush should have offered would either be a national cap-and-trade system for controlling CO2 emissions by utilities, manufacturers and autos, or a carbon tax. Both would create economic incentives for us to get rid of appliances, buildings and cars that emit a lot of CO2 and to invent and purchase those that don\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'But there is no reason that the Democrats could not right now put a cap-and-trade bill on Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s desk themselves by spring, Mr. Krupp said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I think Bush would sign it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It is not enough for Democrats to just hold hearings on climate change. They need to use their new power to change the climate. Not only would the public be with them, but so would big business. A coalition of America\xe2\x80\x99s best companies \xe2\x80\x94 like General Electric, DuPont, Duke Energy, Alcoa, Caterpillar \xe2\x80\x94 and environmentalists just issued a \xe2\x80\x9ccall to action\xe2\x80\x9d for a national cap-and-trade program to limit greenhouse gas emissions.'b'On Iraq: talking to some of our senior military lately, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been struck by how concerned they are about the new Bush buildup against Iran. Before we have even won one war in Iraq, the Bush team seems to be courting another with Iran. I am all for brandishing the stick with Iran, but it should be for the purpose of gaining leverage for a diplomatic dialogue with Iran and Syria about Iraq.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen your house is burning, you don\xe2\x80\x99t go looking to start a fire in the next house,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vali Nasr, author of the \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shia Revival.\xe2\x80\x9d Right now, he adds, everything should be subordinated to trying to salvage Iraq.'b'Let the troop surge be accompanied and reinforced by what the Baker-Hamilton commission proposed: a regional conference that puts Syria, Iran, Jordan and Saudi Arabia around a table with Iraqis to try to stabilize the place. And that requires that America brandish carrots and sticks with all the parties. If a real regional conference doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work, then Democrats who want to just set a date to withdraw will have an even stronger case because we will truly have tried everything. But let\xe2\x80\x99s try everything: a surge of diplomacy, not just troops.'b'Let the Democrats put 'b'that'b' on the president\xe2\x80\x99s desk. Just as the business community would support a real climate initiative, I think the U.S. military would support a real diplomatic conference. Bush gave America\xe2\x80\x99s voters the reasons to fire him. Democrats need to give voters the reasons to hire them \xe2\x80\x94 for the long haul.'b'To the Editor:'b'Perhaps one of the additional lessons that might be culled from \xe2\x80\x9cAt Princeton, a Parody Raises Questions of Bias\xe2\x80\x9d (news article, Jan. 23), about a broken-English parody in the student daily of an Asian-American student who had filed a civil rights complaint against Princeton,  is the importance of fostering not only academic intelligence, but social intelligence as well.'b'Social intelligence is perhaps what our nation needs now more than ever.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope that the academic institutions that  produce some of our country\xe2\x80\x99s future leaders will pay more attention to attracting and developing social intelligence abilities within the student body, so that these types of incidents can be avoided in the campus environment and later in the world at large. Nina Esaki'b'East Greenbush, N.Y., Jan. 23, 2007'b'The militant Irish republican Gerry Adams and the fire-breathing unionist preacher Ian Paisley have long symbolized the irreconcilable extremes of Ulster politics. But over the next few days, they have the chance to lead the province into a new era of democratic self-rule.'b'Mr. Adams\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity comes this Sunday, when he will ask his party, Sinn Fein, to end its long refusal to cooperate with Northern Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s reformed police service. If Sinn Fein accepts his advice, it will be the turn of Mr. Paisley and his Democratic Unionist Party to live up to its end of the bargain and agree to form a power-sharing coalition with Sinn Fein \xe2\x80\x94 as the top parties elected by the Protestant and Roman Catholic communities are supposed to do under the Good Friday peace agreement on Northern Ireland.'b'If both sides come through, elections will be held and a coalition cabinet formed in March. If either falters, there can be no power sharing, and Northern Ireland will remain ruled by appointed British officials for the foreseeable future.'b'The Good Friday agreement of 1998 all but ended years of sectarian bloodshed in Northern Ireland. In 2005, the Irish Republican Army took the further crucial steps of permanently renouncing political violence and destroying its weapons. But the agreement\xe2\x80\x99s full promise has never been met as Sinn Fein and the Unionists have sparred over political power sharing and police reform.'b'The importance of police reform was clearly demonstrated this week with the release of a devastating ombudsman\xe2\x80\x99s report on years of police collaboration with a Protestant paramilitary death squad. Most, but not all, of that collaboration occurred before the present professional police service was created to replace the old Protestant-dominated Royal Ulster Constabulary.'b'Further reforms put in place by the head of the new force make any repetition of such shocking abuses unlikely. But the best safeguard would be oversight of the police by a democratically chosen executive and legislature. That is the courageous and sensible argument Mr. Adams will make to Sinn Fein this weekend. If his view prevails, Mr. Paisley\xe2\x80\x99s time to be courageous and sensible will follow.'b'American politics is ugly these days, and many people wish things were different. For example, Barack Obama recently lamented the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cpolitics has become so bitter and partisan\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 which it certainly has.'b'But he then went on to say that partisanship is why \xe2\x80\x9cwe can\xe2\x80\x99t tackle the big problems that demand solutions. And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we have to change first.\xe2\x80\x9d Um, no. If history is any guide, what we need are political leaders willing to tackle the big problems despite bitter partisan opposition. If all goes well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll eventually have a new era of bipartisanship \xe2\x80\x94 but that will be the end of the story, not the beginning.'b'Or to put it another way: what we need now is another F.D.R., not another Dwight Eisenhower.'b'You see, the nastiness of modern American politics isn\xe2\x80\x99t the result of a random outbreak of bad manners. It\xe2\x80\x99s a symptom of deeper factors \xe2\x80\x94 mainly the growing polarization of our economy. And history says that we\xe2\x80\x99ll see a return to bipartisanship only if and when that economic polarization is reversed.'b'After all, American politics has been nasty in the past. Before the New Deal, America was a nation with a vast gap between the rich and everyone else, and this gap was reflected in a sharp political divide. The Republican Party, in effect, represented the interests of the economic elite, and the Democratic Party, in an often confused way, represented the populist alternative.'b'In that divided political system, the Democrats probably came much closer to representing the interests of the typical American. But the G.O.P.\xe2\x80\x99s advantage in money, and the superior organization that money bought, usually allowed it to dominate national politics. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not a member of any organized party,\xe2\x80\x9d Will Rogers said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a Democrat.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Then came the New Deal. I urge Mr. Obama \xe2\x80\x94 and everyone else who thinks that good will alone is enough to change the tone of our politics \xe2\x80\x94 to read the speeches of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the quintessential example of a president who tackled big problems that demanded solutions.'b'For the fact is that F.D.R. faced fierce opposition as he created the institutions \xe2\x80\x94 Social Security, unemployment insurance, more progressive taxation and beyond \xe2\x80\x94 that helped alleviate inequality. And he didn\xe2\x80\x99t shy away from confrontation.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe had to struggle,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared in 1936, \xe2\x80\x9cwith the old enemies of peace \xe2\x80\x94 business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering. ... Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for me \xe2\x80\x94 and I welcome their hatred.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It was only after F.D.R. had created a more equal society, and the old class warriors of the G.O.P. were replaced by \xe2\x80\x9cmodern Republicans\xe2\x80\x9d who accepted the New Deal, that bipartisanship began to prevail.'b'The history of the last few decades has basically been the story of the New Deal in reverse. Income inequality has returned to levels not seen since the pre-New Deal era, and so have political divisions in Congress as the Republicans have moved right, once again becoming the party of the economic elite. The signature domestic policy initiatives of the Bush administration have been attempts to undo F.D.R.\xe2\x80\x99s legacy, from slashing taxes on the rich to privatizing Social Security. And a bitter partisan gap has opened up between the G.O.P. and Democrats, who have tried to defend that legacy.'b'What about the smear campaigns, like Karl Rove\xe2\x80\x99s 2005 declaration that after 9/11 liberals wanted to \xe2\x80\x9coffer therapy and understanding for our attackers\xe2\x80\x9d? Well, they\xe2\x80\x99re reminiscent of the vicious anti-Catholic propaganda used to defeat Al Smith in 1928: smear tactics are what a well-organized, well-financed party with a fundamentally unpopular domestic agenda uses to change the subject.'b'So am I calling for partisanship for its own sake? Certainly not. By all means pass legislation, if you can, with plenty of votes from the other party: the Social Security Act of 1935 received 77 Republican votes in the House, about the same as the number of Republicans who recently voted for a minimum wage increase.'b'But politicians who try to push forward the elements of a new New Deal, especially universal health care, are sure to face the hatred of a large bloc on the right \xe2\x80\x94 and they should welcome that hatred, not fear it.'b'One of the stranger and so far unexplained items in President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s energy program is his proposal to double the capacity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, to 1.5 billion barrels, over the next 20 years. The proposal carries a $65 billion price tag \xe2\x80\x94 one of several reasons Congress should question Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman closely when he comes looking for the money.'b'The reserve\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is to provide an emergency supply of oil in the event of, say, a terrorist attack somewhere along the global oil supply chain or a natural disaster that sharply limits imports for a short time. The United States is highly vulnerable to such interruptions. It has only 3 percent of global oil reserves but accounts for 25 percent of consumption \xe2\x80\x94 more than 20 million barrels a day, about 60 percent of it imported. The reserve now holds 55 days worth of net oil imports. After the increase, there would be an estimated 97 days of protection.'b'A larger reserve would seem to make sense in the post-9/11 world, and last year\xe2\x80\x99s energy bill did in fact authorize an expansion to one billion barrels. But is there nothing better to do with the money? Might it not be more usefully deployed developing alternative fuels or more efficient vehicles, thus reducing the nation\xe2\x80\x99s dependence on oil and its vulnerability to future shocks?'b'The $2.7 billion the administration proposes to spend on this project each year for the next 20 years is three times the amount that Congress authorized last year for the Energy Department\xe2\x80\x99s entire research and development program for alternative energy sources. It may be necessary to increase backup supplies. But the administration would be a lot more persuasive if it displayed a deeper commitment to programs that would provide lasting security by reducing Americans\xe2\x80\x99 consumption of oil, rather than just squirreling it away.'b'We often wonder whether there is a limit to the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s obsession with secrecy, its assault on the rule of law, its disdain for the powers of Congress, its willingness to con the public and its refusal to heed expert advice or recognize facts on the ground. Events of the past week suggest the answer is no.'b'In his State of the Union speech, Mr. Bush stuck to his ill-conceived plans for Iraq, but at least admitted the situation was dire. He said he wanted to work with Congress and announced a bipartisan council on national security.'b'That lasted a day. By Wednesday evening, Vice President Dick Cheney was on CNN contradicting most of what Mr. Bush had said. We were left asking, once again, Who exactly is running this White House?'b'While Mr. Bush has been a bit more forthright lately about how badly things have gone in Iraq, Mr. Cheney spoke of \xe2\x80\x9cenormous successes\xe2\x80\x9d there and refused to pay even curled-lip service to consulting Congress. Whatever votes Congress takes on Iraq, Mr. Cheney said, \xe2\x80\x9cit won\xe2\x80\x99t stop us.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Whenever the vice president does this sort of thing, and it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty often, Americans are faced  with an unpleasant choice: Are  Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney  running a bait-and-switch operation, or does the vice president simply feel  free to cut the ground out from under Mr. Bush?'b'All of that was distressing enough. But in Friday\xe2\x80\x99s Times, Adam Liptak gave an account of the way the administration \xe2\x80\x94 after grandly announcing that it was finally going to  obey the law on wiretapping \xe2\x80\x94 is trying to quash lawsuits over Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s outlaw eavesdropping operations by imposing outrageous secrecy and control over the courts.'b'Justice Department lawyers are withholding evidence from plaintiffs and even restricting the access of judges to documents in cases involving Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s decision to authorize the warrantless interception of e-mail and phone calls. In one suit, Justice Department lawyers tried to  seize  computers from the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 lawyers to remove a document central to their case against the government.'b'In response to these and other serious concerns, the Justice Department offered only the most twisted excuses, which a federal judge rightly compared to \xe2\x80\x9cAlice in Wonderland.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When government lawyers tried to take back a document that has   circulated around the world, the  judge asked a Justice  Department lawyer,  \xe2\x80\x9cWho is it secret from?\xe2\x80\x9d  The answer: \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone who has not seen it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'These are not isolated events. The government has made the same Orwellian claims of secrecy in a lawsuit over the president\xe2\x80\x99s decision to create secret C.I.A. prisons for terrorism suspects. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales routinely stonewalls legitimate Congressional requests for documents and information on a wide range of issues. He negotiated a secret agreement to give supposed judicial oversight to Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s wiretapping program, with a court that does not permit anyone into its hearings to argue against the government.'b'Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney claim that they are protecting the powers of the presidency. At least that\xe2\x80\x99s the bait they use to explain their trampling on civil liberties and the constitutional balance of power. But by abusing the government\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate right to claim secrecy in court hearings, they will make it harder for other presidents to do that when it is  actually justified. And with that switch, they have done grievous harm to the credibility of the Oval Office and the country.'b'WASHINGTON'b'Dick Durbin went to the floor of the Senate on Thursday night to denounce the vice president as \xe2\x80\x9cdelusional.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It was shocking, and Senator Durbin should be ashamed of himself.'b'Delusional is far too mild a word to describe Dick Cheney.

From media organizations to Hollywood celebrities and lawmakers on both sides, everyone backs our troops.'b'It is W. and Vice who learned no lessons from Vietnam, probably because they worked so hard to avoid going. They rush into a war halfway around the world for no reason and with no foresight about the culture or the inevitable insurgency, and then assert that any criticism of their fumbling management of Iraq and Afghanistan is tantamount to criticizing the troops. Quel demagoguery.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBottom line,\xe2\x80\x9d Vice told Wolf, \xe2\x80\x9cis that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had enormous successes, and we will continue to have enormous successes.\xe2\x80\x9d The biggest threat, he said, is that Americans may not \xe2\x80\x9chave the stomach for the fight.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He should stop casting aspersions on the American stomach.

He certainly is not mine. I am not in the Army.'b'I first cringed at the misuse in 1973, during the \xe2\x80\x9cSaturday Night Massacre\xe2\x80\x9d (as it was called). President Richard Nixon, angered at the Watergate inquiry being conducted by the special prosecutor Archibald Cox,  dispatched his chief of staff, Al Haig, to arrange for Mr. Cox\xe2\x80\x99s firing. Mr. Haig told the attorney general, Elliot Richardson, to dismiss Mr. Cox. Mr. Richardson refused, and resigned. Then Mr. Haig told the second in line at the Justice Department, William Ruckelshaus, to fire Cox. Mr. Ruckelshaus refused, and accepted his dismissal. The third in line, Robert Bork, finally did the deed.'b'What struck me was what Mr. Haig told Mr. Ruckelshaus, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know what it means when an order comes down from the commander in chief and a member of his team cannot execute it.\xe2\x80\x9d This was as great a constitutional faux pas as Mr. Haig\xe2\x80\x99s later claim, when President Reagan was wounded, that \xe2\x80\x9cConstitutionally ... I\xe2\x80\x99m in control.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'President Nixon was not Mr. Ruckelshaus\xe2\x80\x99s commander in chief. The president is not the commander in chief of civilians. He is not even commander in chief of National Guard troops unless and until they are federalized. The Constitution is clear on this: \xe2\x80\x9cThe president shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several states, when called into the actual service of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When Abraham Lincoln took actions based on military considerations, he gave himself the proper title, \xe2\x80\x9ccommander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d That title is rarely \xe2\x80\x94 more like never \xe2\x80\x94 heard today. It is just \xe2\x80\x9ccommander in chief,\xe2\x80\x9d or even \xe2\x80\x9ccommander in chief of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d This reflects the increasing militarization of our politics. The citizenry at large is now thought of as under military discipline. In wartime, it is true, people submit to the national leadership more than in peacetime. The executive branch takes actions in secret, unaccountable to the electorate, to hide its moves from the enemy and protect national secrets. Constitutional shortcuts are taken \xe2\x80\x9cfor the duration.\xe2\x80\x9d But those impositions are removed when normal life returns.'b'But we have not seen normal life in 66 years. The wartime discipline imposed in 1941 has never been lifted, and \xe2\x80\x9cthe duration\xe2\x80\x9d has become the norm. World War II melded into the cold war, with greater secrecy than ever \xe2\x80\x94 more classified information, tougher security clearances. And now the cold war has modulated into the war on terrorism.'b'There has never been an executive branch more fetishistic about secrecy than the Bush-Cheney one. The secrecy has been used to throw a veil over detentions, \xe2\x80\x9crenditions,\xe2\x80\x9d suspension of the Geneva Conventions and of habeas corpus, torture and warrantless wiretaps. We hear again the refrain so common in the other wars \xe2\x80\x94 'b'If you knew what we know, you would see how justified all our actions are'b'.'b'But we can never know what they know. We do not have sufficient clearance.'b'When Adm. William Crowe, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, criticized the gulf war under the first President Bush, Secretary of State James Baker said that the admiral was not qualified to speak on the matter since he no longer had the clearance to read classified reports. If he is not qualified, then no ordinary citizen is. We must simply trust our lords and obey the commander in chief.'b'The glorification of the president as a war leader is registered in numerous and substantial executive aggrandizements; but it is symbolized in other ways that, while small in themselves, dispose the citizenry to accept those aggrandizements. We are reminded, for instance, of the expanded commander in chief status every time a modern president gets off the White House helicopter and returns the salute of marines.'b'That is an innovation that was begun by Ronald Reagan. Dwight Eisenhower, a real general, knew that the salute is for the uniform, and as president he was not wearing one. An exchange of salutes was out of order. (George Bush came as close as he could to wearing a uniform while president when he landed on the telegenic aircraft carrier in an Air Force flight jacket).'b'We used to take pride in civilian leadership of the military under the Constitution, a principle that George Washington embraced when he avoided military symbols at Mount Vernon. We are not led \xe2\x80\x94 or were not in the past \xe2\x80\x94 by caudillos.'b'Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan\xe2\x80\x99s prescient last book, \xe2\x80\x9cSecrecy,\xe2\x80\x9d traced the ever-faster-growing secrecy of our government and said that it strikes at the very essence of democracy \xe2\x80\x94 accountability of representatives to the people. How can the people hold their representatives to account if they are denied knowledge of what they are doing? Wartime and war analogies are embraced because these justify the secrecy. The representative is accountable to citizens. Soldiers are accountable to their officer. The dynamics are different, and to blend them is to undermine the basic principles of our Constitution.'b'To the Editor:'b'In \xe2\x80\x9cBreaking the Clinch\xe2\x80\x9d (column, Jan. 25), David Brooks recognizes what most commentators still do not: that the source of civil disorder in Iraq is not religion, politics or ethnicity.

To inject some quality control into a process that could have been all political horse-trading, legislative leaders and Gov. Eliot Spitzer set up an excellent vetting process. Three former comptrollers \xe2\x80\x94 two Democrats and a Republican \xe2\x80\x94 screened candidates and were asked to pick up to five finalists.'b'This week, the former comptrollers narrowed a field of 18 to three finalists: Howard Weitzman, comptroller of Nassau County; Martha Stark, tax commissioner for New York City; and William Mulrow, a businessman and friend of Mr. Spitzer\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'The Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s job now is to choose one of these three.

It is far too important a post to be given out based on friendship or group loyalty.'b'Of the three recommendations, Mr. Weitzman is clearly the best fit. As Nassau\xe2\x80\x99s comptroller, and a partner in a top-four accounting firm before that, he has the strongest background, and he has shown in his current job that he can be steadfastly independent. Ms. Stark is also impressive, although her credentials are not as close a match. A smart, engaging lawyer who has experience managing a large agency, she sits on boards that help oversee $100 billion in pension funds. Ms. Stark would also add diversity to the top levels of state government.'b'Mr. Mulrow, a businessman who has run for this office before, has a great deal of knowledge about investments and experience as a manager.

We hope that they choose from the fine list of finalists, and that their choice is Mr. Weitzman.'b'Carlisle, Pa.'b'IN international relations, leadership often involves getting allies and friends to do things they have not done but need to do. For example, one challenge facing America is to get more European countries to do heavy lifting in Afghanistan, where British, Canadian, Dutch and American troops are bearing the brunt of battles with Taliban forces. This needs to happen if NATO is to make good on its commitments in Afghanistan, which rightly have wide international support and legitimacy.'b'But the larger issue stemming from that overstrained mission is that NATO is not enough. Like the one strong horse that carries load after load, NATO is getting tired of having to serve as the proxy both for the United Nations and feeble regional organizations. While I am not, of course, authorized to speak in an official capacity, I have some thoughts, based on personal experience, on how to ease NATO\xe2\x80\x99s burden.'b'The sad truth is that there will be ever more failed states requiring long-term multinational intervention. NATO should not be expected to be everywhere. While it has evolved to handle new missions beyond Europe in the 21st century, it is not a bottomless well of troops.'b'NATO leaders should be asking this question: What are the other regions of the world prepared to do to handle the next likely conflagrations, be they in Sudan, Fiji, Congo, Somalia, Bolivia, North Korea or Nepal? We must get much more creative about preserving stability at such fault lines. Too many interventions, like the African Union\xe2\x80\x99s in Darfur, are done in an ad hoc and episodic manner; little wonder they usually fail.'b'What we need are more permanent regional security and defense organizations, supported by major powers. It is in the basic national interest of both the local states and the big nations, never mind any high-minded values. While states may have legitimate concerns about things like sovereignty, the alternative to constructive cooperation is the wildfire of anarchy, which spreads beyond borders and burns far too many.'b'The efforts of powerful Western countries to aid regional organizations\xe2\x80\x99 efforts in humanitarian assistance, peacekeeping and nation-building \xe2\x80\x94 which increased after the United Nations proved, in situations like Somalia during the early 1990s, to be incapable \xe2\x80\x94 have been inconsistent. Many arrogant policymakers continue to argue, in effect, that \xe2\x80\x9csuperpowers don\xe2\x80\x99t do windows.\xe2\x80\x9d Many major powers continue to focus their military programs on conventional warfare. The problem is that conventional wars these days are few, while failed states are many.'b'Rather than rely on regional groups to coalesce on their own, the United States and its allies should work to create a minimum of six additional security and defense organizations patterned on NATO \xe2\x80\x94 one each for North America, South America, Africa, the Asia-Pacific region, South Asia and the Middle East. Headquarters for these organizations might be, respectively, in Colorado Springs, Bras\xc3\xadlia, Johannesburg, Beijing, New Delhi and Amman, Jordan.

They would also have to have diplomatic and economic teams to move in after the fighting and get the government and markets of the affected country restarted.'b'Considering the vast scope of each of these six regions, the individual contributions required from the members would be fairly meager, and the richer and more populous states could be expected to supplement the offerings of their less advantaged neighbors.'b'Each of these new organizations would need at least one big power as a member; this economic and military linchpin would be expected to provide the trained personnel, equipment and money to begin the enterprise. Obviously, the United States would play that role in the North American group; but it and the European and Asian powers might have to take leading roles in some alliances that were geographically distant. This shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a stumbling block: after all, NATO spans the Atlantic.'b'Of course, all of these new alliances would need the blessing of the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, and their efforts would be coordinated through the organization\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Peacekeeping Operations. The secretary general should be expected to welcome the arrangement: it would relieve his organization of its role in centrally planning operations and creating interim forces after conventional combat stops, at which it has floundered repeatedly.'b'Yes, creating these new alliances will mean that many states will have to change their approach to internal security and defense. But in this age of globalization, countries will have to be as flexible and cooperative on security matters as they have been on trade pacts.'b'In the end, two facts will drive many states to sign up for regional security organizations: the current system is largely dysfunctional, and joining would give each member greater international standing.

The dangers fall into two categories: money (too little) and politics (too much). The new Congress will have to manage both vigilantly.'b'An underfinanced census would be an inaccurate census. Easy-to-count suburbanites \xe2\x80\x94 who tilt Republican \xe2\x80\x94 would almost certainly be overrepresented, while urban dwellers \xe2\x80\x94 who lean Democratic \xe2\x80\x94 would get short shrift because of the difficulty in counting mobile and diverse populations. To prevent that, lawmakers must begin by reinstating the roughly $50 million that was cut from the current census budget by the previous Congress.'b'The new Congress must also ensure that the next budget includes adequate funds for projects that made the 2000 census a success. Among them are strong partnerships with state and local governments, as well as with churches and businesses, to promote the census, and a multimillion-dollar down payment on the census advertising budget. Because they will not bear fruit until the census is under way, those projects may seem easy to sacrifice in favor of more immediate demands. But any budget shortfalls cannot be made up later because the necessary lead time will have been squandered.'b'Lawmakers should also hold hearings to air the reasons behind the abrupt resignation last November of the director of the Census Bureau and the equally sudden departure of his deputy director. Both men were highly qualified statisticians and, by all accounts, committed to an unbiased and thorough census. They have acknowledged tensions with the Bush administration, but offered no details.'b'Whatever it finds, the inquiry should send a clear message that the White House must choose new census directors whose professional qualifications and impartiality are above reproach.'b'Almost anybody who has ever done anything big knows that the first step involves clearing the desk. Or maybe the kitchen table. And New York\xe2\x80\x99s lawmakers, with Gov. Eliot Spitzer as the new executive, clearly have some heavy scouring to do. Besides budget reform, which Mr. Spitzer signed into law last week, the next step is a series of changes the governor has labeled a \xe2\x80\x9cdramatic, significant, fundamental step forward\xe2\x80\x9d in ethics reform.'b'Every politician who is near a microphone talks about how  Albany needs to be more ethical. But anyone who has spent any time in New York State\xe2\x80\x99s Capitol knows that many of these same politicians have no real interest in change at all.'b'So, even as Mr. Spitzer and the legislative leaders  \xe2\x80\x94 Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Senate Leader Joseph Bruno  \xe2\x80\x94 promise reform, the real fear is that the reforms will turn out to be about as deep as their television pancake makeup. To take one example, the leaders propose an  independent ethics review board that would combine the   State Ethics Commission, which monitors state government, and the Temporary State Commission on Lobbying, which monitors lobbying.'b'Good-government advocates are understandably wary. Could this be a ploy to get rid of Albany\xe2\x80\x99s least favorite and most independent investigator: David Grandeau, the head of the lobbying commission? Is it yet another grand Albany-style trick or is it in fact a serious effort to air out the Capitol?'b'Moreover, the commission that oversees the legislature \xe2\x80\x94 the weakest of all the commissions \xe2\x80\x94 is barely changed. It will be enlarged and given a few new powers, but that\xe2\x80\x99s about it.'b'Other proposals on the agenda seem more promising, assuming that they are carried out. A proposed ban on gifts has long been necessary. Another ban, on honorariums, is also long overdue. And putting a foot in the revolving door that allows legislative staff members to retire, then immediately start making big money by lobbying old colleagues, would be a real improvement \xe2\x80\x94 although this reform would not start until the end of 2008.'b'We hope there is even more to come. Mr. Spitzer is pushing forward with campaign finance reform in ways that would lower contribution limits, close loopholes and establish some sort of public financing. The torrents of money pouring into the hotly contested special election in Nassau County from both parties remind us that New York\xe2\x80\x99s present system of campaign financing is a statewide embarrassment that needs fixing quickly.'b'Mr. Spitzer also proposes a nonpartisan redistricting commission.

As these freelancers fill column after column at a lower cost than full-time reporters, readers have a right to expect that editors ensure the integrity of that journalism.'b'But embarrassing gaps continue to beset The Times\xe2\x80\x99s online ethics questionnaire, introduced last April to ascertain whether freelancers meet the paper\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental ethical standards before they get assignments. Recently, articles by two freelancers suffered from clear conflicts of interest, first spotted by readers who wrote to me.'b'Brief, upbeat reports written by a frequent Times freelancer about two cellphones made by Samsung appeared Nov. 23 and 30. Then, on Dec. 7, an editors\xe2\x80\x99 note acknowledged that the author had made an October visit to Samsung\xe2\x80\x99s South Korean offices at the company\xe2\x80\x99s expense.'b'An Oct. 15 article on the use of environmentally sensitive building methods and materials featured an Oregon home that was the first in the Western United States to receive a special certification for \xe2\x80\x9cgreen\xe2\x80\x9d houses. An editors\xe2\x80\x99 note on Oct. 29 disclosed that the freelance author was employed part time as an editor and writer by a nonprofit organization that promotes a sustainable economy, and that had received financial contributions from the owner of the home.'b'If Times editors had been aware of the conflicts, both editors\xe2\x80\x99 notes concluded, the two freelancers would not have been given the assignments. But why, I began to ask senior editors after the second note appeared, had the new online ethics questionnaire failed to detect these conflicts?'b'As I continued to pursue these questions, the problem was acknowledged in a Jan. 16 memo to the staff from Craig R. Whitney and William E. Schmidt, both assistant managing editors. \xe2\x80\x9cRecently, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen several cases of freelancers\xe2\x80\x99 apparent unfamiliarity with provisions of the Ethical Journalism policy ... despite the vetting system we put in place last spring to try to ensure that they would be aware of the policy,\xe2\x80\x9d they wrote.'b'In a push in the right direction, the memo requires editors to ask freelancers if they are \xe2\x80\x9cfamiliar with our ethics rules\xe2\x80\x9d the next time each is given an assignment \xe2\x80\x94 and to \xe2\x80\x9cmake it clear that continuing to contribute to The Times depends on observing those rules.\xe2\x80\x9d If a freelancer \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately disregards\xe2\x80\x9d the paper\xe2\x80\x99s Ethical Journalism guidelines, \xe2\x80\x9cwe stop giving assignments to that person,\xe2\x80\x9d the two editors warned.'b'So how did the freelancer conflicts on these stories escape detection before publication?'b'The freelancer who took the Samsung junket, John Biggs, had responded to the online ethics questionnaire for outside contributors in May, shortly after it became a requirement. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you accepted any free trips, junkets or press trips in the last two years?\xe2\x80\x9d one question asked. His negative response was accurate at that time, according to Mr. Whitney, who is also the paper\xe2\x80\x99s standards editor.'b'After taking the October junket, primarily to write for 'b'CrunchGear.com'b', a blog about electronic gear, Mr. Biggs told me, he \xe2\x80\x9csimply forgot\xe2\x80\x9d about updating his ethics questionnaire response so Times editors would be aware of his conflict of interest and not assign him any Samsung stories. His editor doesn\xe2\x80\x99t share his vague recollection that he mentioned Samsung\xe2\x80\x99s role in his trip. In any case, comments he posted on CrunchGear on Oct. 17, the day he arrived in Seoul, make it clear to me that he understood the unethical aspect of junkets. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m here with Samsung,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, \xe2\x80\x9csuckling on the sweet teat of junket whoredom.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Unfortunately, The Times\xe2\x80\x99s online ethics questionnaire system requires updating of freelancer responses only every two years. Mr. Biggs, who in recent months has been writing brief articles almost every week for the business section, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t asked to update his responses before writing the two stories about Samsung products in November.'b'The writer of the article lauding the Oregon builder\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgreen\xe2\x80\x9d house, Colleen Kaleda, had also responded to the ethics questionnaire in May. Asked to list her current employers, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether full time or part time,\xe2\x80\x9d she omitted the Sightline Institute, where she did editing and writing and was then listed as the \xe2\x80\x9cassociate editor\xe2\x80\x9d of Tidepool, its online news service. Ms. Kaleda told me that she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t listed Sightline as a part-time employer because of \xe2\x80\x9cthe small amount of work involved.\xe2\x80\x9d She has told Times editors that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t aware when she quoted him in the article that the home\xe2\x80\x99s owner had donated to Sightline.'b'A Times editor reviewed Ms. Kaleda\xe2\x80\x99s May responses when he assigned her the article for the real estate section in late summer. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that correctly listing her work for Sightline would have raised enough questions to bring to light the nonprofit\xe2\x80\x99s focus on a sustainable economy and the donations from the owner of the featured home. But Ms. Kaleda\xe2\x80\x99s listing of her volunteer work for the Oregon League of Conservation Voters should have also triggered questions from her editor, and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'Before issuing the new warning about deliberately disregarding the paper\xe2\x80\x99s ethics rules, Mr. Whitney had ruled that there should be minimal restrictions on the two freelancers. Mr. Biggs, he determined, is not eligible for any assignments about Samsung products, and Ms. Kaleda is not to be assigned articles about environmental issues.'b'Most freelancers, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note, follow the paper\xe2\x80\x99s guidelines and deliver valuable articles to readers of The Times. And full-time news staffers don\xe2\x80\x99t always adhere to the paper\xe2\x80\x99s ethical standards. As some outside contributors were quick to remind me when I first called for stronger editing and ethical oversight for them, Jayson Blair was not a freelancer. But the number of freelancers in the paper\xe2\x80\x99s database \xe2\x80\x94 more than 5,000 \xe2\x80\x94 and the specter of conflicts raised by their work outside The Times create issues that demand comprehensive and diligent oversight.'b'The tales of these two freelancers convinced me that readers deserve to have more attention paid to the ethics of outside contributors than the latest memo provides. A key need: an editing staff sufficient to allow extra time to question freelancers and edit their stories. But there are at least two inexpensive changes to the existing online vetting system that could give editors more updated information and increase the pressure on outside contributors to read its ethical rules.'b'Each assignment should require that the  freelancer has responded to the online ethics questionnaire within the previous 30 days; the two-year interval is useless. And there should be an additional \xe2\x80\x9cquestion\xe2\x80\x9d that confirms the reading, or rereading, that day of the 686 words of the complete freelancer ethics rules already posted online underneath the questionnaire; that would make pleading ignorance difficult.'b'These changes wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent all problems. But they would provide additional protection for the paper\xe2\x80\x99s credibility that is sorely needed.'b''b'Drawing a Line'b''b'Times editors have carefully made clear their disapproval of the expression of a personal opinion about Iraq on national television by the paper\xe2\x80\x99s chief military correspondent, Michael Gordon.'b'The rumored military buildup in Iraq was a hot topic on the Jan. 8 \xe2\x80\x9cCharlie Rose\xe2\x80\x9d show, and the host asked Mr. Gordon if he believed \xe2\x80\x9cvictory is within our grasp.\xe2\x80\x9d The transcript of Mr. Gordon\xe2\x80\x99s response, which he stressed was \xe2\x80\x9cpurely personal,\xe2\x80\x9d includes these comments:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo I think, you know, as a purely personal view, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth it [sic] one last effort for sure to try to get this right, because my personal view is we\xe2\x80\x99ve never really tried to win.

Schools Chancellor Joel Klein has promised to rectify those problems. But the new reform, which sweeps away the 10 regions altogether, runs the risk of making the situation worse.'b'This page has long supported turning principals into school managers and holding them accountable for how staffs and students perform. But the young, inexperienced principals who have flooded the New York schools require guidance and support. Sweeping away the remains of the regional system might make it harder for them to get the help they need.'b'Urban school systems have a long and shameful history of dumping the least-qualified teachers into underfinanced schools that serve the poorest children. Mr. Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s proposal would drive more money to the neediest schools, but there are serious questions about whether it will be sufficient.'b'At the same time, an analysis by a nonpartisan group, the Educational Priorities Panel, takes issue with a related scheme for changing the school personnel budgeting process. Currently, schools are held harmless for teacher salaries. The new system would eventually chalk up teacher salaries against a school\xe2\x80\x99s budget. The panel believes that would penalize schools with the highest-paid, most-experienced teachers, driving principals to hire less-experienced teachers. The new formula would also be subject to tampering by politicians.'b'The Bloomberg plan expresses some noble ideals.

Athens, which also claims to have ushered in the \xe2\x80\x9cmodern age of the black-eyed pea euphoria\xe2\x80\x9d (whatever that means),  can trace its claim to the hamburger only as far back as 1904.'b'Those facts may be well known, but as the city dusts itself off from the implosion last Saturday  of the monolithic New Haven Coliseum, built in 1972 as the capstone to the city\xe2\x80\x99s nationally recognized urban renewal program, it is worth remembering the Lassen family\xe2\x80\x99s role in preserving an earlier era in the city\xe2\x80\x99s history.'b'In the 1950s and 60s, redevelopers bulldozed hundreds of acres of tenements, small stores and city neighborhoods in the name of slum clearance. Louis\xe2\x80\x99 Lunch stood in the way of a proposed high rise, but Mr. Lassen\xe2\x80\x99s grandson Ken Lassen Sr. (who at 89 still samples the beef raw most mornings to ensure its quality) refused to make way for the wrecking ball. After years of wrangling and, rumor has it, the quiet intervention of some high-ranking federal officials, Ken convinced the city to relocate the Louis\xe2\x80\x99 Lunch building to its current home.'b'The trouble was, the structure shared its fourth wall with a 19th-century tannery building that, like so much of the rest of downtown, was scheduled for demolition. In its new location, the lunchroom would need to be partially rebuilt.'b'Ken was prepared. He had watched the residents and store owners of downtown New Haven get evicted, their buildings taken by the city through eminent domain. After the bulldozers came, he wandered through the streets, collecting from the rubble one brick from each demolished business \xe2\x80\x94 one brick, he\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, for every tear that was shed.'b'He rebuilt Louis\xe2\x80\x99 Lunch from the remains of a past that the city planners thought was obsolete. Old-timers in New Haven still come to Louis\xe2\x80\x99 Lunch so that Ken can point out a brick from their building. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a memorial, exactly, but the pieces of old memories reconstructed into something new.'b'Today, we recognize urban renewal as a sad period in our city\xe2\x80\x99s history. We can respect, even envy, the bold optimism that earned New Haven the nickname the Model City, but we reject the Modernist supposition that new buildings alone would fix all urban problems. The city planners\xe2\x80\x99 top-down view, divorced from what all those places meant to people, was no way to see what needed to be fixed or what did not need fixing in the first place. We mourn what was lost.'b'It is right for the mayor to stand up for Louis\xe2\x80\x99 Lunch and the Lassens now, because the city owes them one. Ken knew, long before City Hall seemed to, that cities are made by men and women, every day, their significance built out of the memories that give the bricks of the city their meaning.'b'When interviewed recently about the dispute over the home of the hamburger, Jeff Lassen, Ken\xe2\x80\x99s son, said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t about business, it was about family and history \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cand we know we\xe2\x80\x99re right.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Let us not stop defending our city\xe2\x80\x99s history. Let us not stop boasting of Eli Whitney and his cotton gin, of A. C. Gilbert and his Erector Set, or of how Buffalo Bill Cody carried a Winchester rifle, built with pride in New Haven. Let us not even stop boasting about how New Haven native Charles Goodyear invented the rubber tire, even though it was by accident.'b'And for the love of everything good, let us not stop boasting about those landmarks that need no memorials, because they are still alive and with us. Let us celebrate Frank Pepe\xe2\x80\x99s pizzeria, which still turns out the thin-crust pizza it perfected more than 80 years ago. Let us celebrate also Yale University, founded by New Haven residents in 1701. Let us rejoice about ground beef, cooked in century-old vertical ovens, served between two slices of toast with tomato and onion and served here, first. And let us rejoice in the city we have made and sustained for ourselves and one another.'b'In other words, we appreciate Ms. Brown\xe2\x80\x99s sentiment, but Athens needs to find its own thing.'b'This past Wednesday, a task force appointed by the Department of Environmental Protection met for the first time to draw up a plan for reducing drowning deaths in state parks. This is a serious problem in this state: in the last eight years, 21 people have drowned while swimming in Connecticut state parks. A strategy for dealing with it should be put in place by Memorial Day.'b'The department\xe2\x80\x99s newly reappointed commissioner, Gina McCarthy, said she expected the committee to develop a plan that would, among other things, encourage people to learn how to swim. That seems basic enough. Yet the task force needs to do much more.'b'Many of those who died came to Connecticut parks from out of state, notably New York City, which means that a prevention campaign aimed at Connecticut residents alone will not fix the problem. A more specific plan aimed at specific parks, based on an examination of where the drownings happened and what factors led to the deaths, would seem to make the most sense.'b'For example, eight deaths occurred at one state park: Squantz Pond in New Fairfield. They occurred because people swam outside the designated swimming area, which John Hodge, the New Fairfield first selectman, says is too small and fills up fast on a hot summer day. Most victims were from out of state and out of town. Mr. Hodge believes that if the Department of Environmental Protection hires more lifeguards and arranges for a boat patrol, Squantz Pond will be far safer, regardless of the abilities of people who take a dip.'b'A public relations campaign cannot by itself prevent drowning deaths.

At the end of this academic year, Rutgers will drop its men\xe2\x80\x99s varsity tennis team and five other varsity teams: men\xe2\x80\x99s swimming and diving, lightweight and heavyweight crew and men\xe2\x80\x99s and women\xe2\x80\x99s fencing. The cuts at Rutgers are symptomatic of a larger problem that many Olympic sports are having at colleges across the country.'b'According to the university, the cuts are a result of state initiatives to reduce the budget for higher education. Robert Mulcahy, Rutgers\xe2\x80\x99s athletic director insists that \xe2\x80\x9cevery possible alternative was evaluated.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet Mr. Mulcahy said that the football budget would increase by about $1 million \xe2\x80\x94 more than the combined cost of the six teams to be cut.'b'The cuts don\xe2\x80\x99t make sense. The annual budget for the Rutgers tennis program, including scholarships, is only four-tenths of 1 percent of the university\xe2\x80\x99s $36 million annual athletic budget. The football and basketball teams account for nearly half that budget. The per-athlete expenditure on the Rutgers football and basketball teams is about $128,500, or $18 million for 140 athletes. The expenditure for the teams that will be cut is about $5,600 per athlete, or $850,000 for 150 athletes. And the football and basketball teams don\xe2\x80\x99t bring in nearly enough television and other revenue to cover their costs; in the aggregate, they lose millions every year.'b'In response to the cuts, the State Assembly Higher Education Committee held a hearing.  Patrick Diegnan, the committee chairman,  concluded that the elimination of the six teams was \xe2\x80\x9cillogical\xe2\x80\x9d and would not produce significant cost savings. Yet, neither Richard McCormick, Rutgers\xe2\x80\x99s president, nor its board has reversed Mr. Mulcahy\xe2\x80\x99s decision.'b'Cuts like these aren\xe2\x80\x99t being made just at Rutgers. The Intercollegiate Tennis Association estimates that as of Dec. 1, 553 men\xe2\x80\x99s and women\xe2\x80\x99s varsity tennis programs have been dropped. Sports like wrestling, track, swimming, diving, crew and fencing have been similarly eroded. Some colleges rationalize their decisions by noting that their varsity programs have become club sports. But club sports do not offer  the same rigor, training, experience and competition that varsity teams do.'b'This is a problem because in some sports, the athletes who come from these university programs constitute the bulk of the athletes on the United States Olympic teams. These programs are vital to America\xe2\x80\x99s success in the Olympic Games not only because they identify talent, but also because they provide essential coaching development and athletic training.'b'While sports like tennis, swimming and crew may not provide either the big business for the N.C.A.A. in terms of television revenue or the alumni support campaigns for colleges and universities that football and basketball do, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean we should cut them. Diversity in collegiate athletics is important. It affords  valuable educational experience for students and enriches the quality of campus life.'b'There is a solution. For the 2006-2007 season, 64 out of the 119 Division 1-A teams playing in bowl games will receive bowl payments of $300,000 to $17 million. Total conference payments will exceed $100 million. Conferences should set aside a percentage of their bounties to finance and restore sports that don\xe2\x80\x99t bring in as much money.'b'Additional cost controls could also be put in place. Men\xe2\x80\x99s football teams in Division I-A schools have about 115 players, and 85 of them are on full scholarships. Even factoring in player injury, this is excessive. Professional football teams have active rosters in midseason that are less than half this size. If Division I-A football scholarships were reduced to, say, 75, the savings could help finance other sports, particularly those that feed into Olympic teams. Moreover, football rosters could be capped at no more than 90 to generate further savings.'b'Across-the-board measures to curb excessive expenditures, like limits on the size of coaching staffs, bowl game travel expenses, pregame home team hotel stays and outside catering, could also help. No particular football team would be singled out, the quality of college football wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t suffer, rivalries would still flourish, viewer ratings would remain strong and the pressures produced by Title IX gender-equity requirements could be alleviated.'b'With football\xe2\x80\x99s success, Rutgers will receive a substantial financial boost from increased ticket sales, television appearances and a bowl payment. George Zoffinger, a member of the Rutgers board and head of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which oversees the Meadowlands sports complex, has suggested using some of that windfall to restore the sports that were cut. This is a step in the right direction, but officials at Rutgers have yet to endorse the idea.'b'Without intervention, this gradual marginalization of collegiate Olympic sports programs will eventually lead to the programs\xe2\x80\x99 demise. The N.C.A.A. and colleges and universities must embrace the inherent value of having a wide variety of varsity teams on campuses. Unless and until they make this a priority, many colleges and universities will continue to devote their resources to costly football and basketball programs at the expense of other teams.'b'Meanwhile, all eyes should be on Rutgers.'b'To the Editor:'b'In \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a Pound of Prevention Really Worth?\xe2\x80\x9d (Economix column, Jan. 24), David Leonhardt says \xe2\x80\x9cthe economic gains from preventive care are sometimes exaggerated.\xe2\x80\x9d Perhaps so, but the reason he cites \xe2\x80\x94 that the cheapest patients are the ones who die quickly without much medical care \xe2\x80\x94 is economically myopic.'b'It is myopic because it neglects economic gains outside the health care system. In fact, society suffers a great economic loss when one of its productive members dies prematurely. These economic losses are recognized by our legal system in cases of wrongful death where damages are tied to lost future earnings.'b'Consider an example on a more tragic scale: the AIDS epidemic in Africa has not been economically devastating because of the high cost of treatment. Rather, most of the economic consequences stem from the loss of millions of productive members of society.'b'Joseph A. Ritter'b'Minneapolis, Jan. 24, 2007'b''b'The writer is associate professor at the Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs, University of 'b''b'Minnesota.'b''b''b''b'Washington'b'IN early January, parents were shocked to read about findings by Consumer Reports that 10 of 12 infant car seats had failed \xe2\x80\x94 most \xe2\x80\x9cdisastrously\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 in simulated 38 miles per hour side-impact crash tests. Many parents were infuriated. These seats can be expensive, and parents rely on them to protect their most precious cargo.'b'Consumer Reports, which accepts neither advertising nor industry or government financing, is read by consumers with reverence. Manufacturers and retailers track its conclusions knowing they can affect sales. But this time, the magazine committed a whopper of a mistake that jeopardizes its well-earned credibility. Within two weeks after publishing its results, it rightly announced it was withdrawing its report because of problems with the tests. Because of what is widely assumed to be an engineering miscalculation, the tests were conducted to replicate a 70 m.p.h. car crash \xe2\x80\x94 nearly double what the magazine had claimed.'b'How the testing mistake was made is instructive not only for Consumer Reports but for everyone who cares about public safety.'b'As it often does, Consumer Reports was attempting to fill a void in the government\xe2\x80\x99s work. In 2000, Congress instructed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to issue within two years a new standard to improve the safety of child restraints. One requirement was to minimize head injuries from side-impact collisions.'b'In May 2002, the safety administration announced it needed more research and testing information before it could design a test for the new standard. While some research is being conducted, the agency has not taken any further steps on side-impact protection for infants and children. As a result, there is no government-approved side-impact crash test for infant car seats as there is for frontal-crash testing.'b'So Consumer Reports had to decide how to conduct its test. The magazine tried to replicate on a test sled the safety administration\xe2\x80\x99s car-to-car side-impact test, which is conducted at 38 m.p.h. However, a car crashing at this speed transmits a force to the stationary car of about 20 m.p.h. because, unlike the sled, both vehicles move after they hit.'b'Because Consumer Reports does not conduct crash tests, save for low-speed bumper-impact tests, it has limited expertise in designing such tests. The magazine publishes government and insurance industry-financed crash test information and contracts with outside labs for child restraint testing. Its communications with its outside lab, Calspan, concerning this side-impact vehicle test at 38 m.p.h., were apparently unclear. The lab conducted the sled test at 38 m.p.h. instead of 20 m.p.h, thus doubling the crash forces of the government standard.'b'None of this is to excuse the magazine. It should have considered the alarming testing results a warning sign. Rather than rushing the results to print, the organization should have consulted outside engineers, including one of its own board members, who is an auto safety engineer. And while it apologized last week, and announced the creation of a panel to study the error, it should have explained what went wrong.'b'But none of this should excuse the highway safety administration, either. For five years, it has not completed the work mandated by Congress \xe2\x80\x94 though it took less than 10 days to evaluate Consumer Reports\xe2\x80\x99 testing and find the error. Further, the safety administration must address deficiencies in its consumer information testing program, which is woefully inadequate, out-of-date and underfinanced.'b'Several key areas come to mind: it still does not test to evaluate survivability in rollovers; it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t measure the effects of size differential when a passenger car collides with, say, a light truck; it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t test vehicle structure in frontal, off-center crashes; it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t test fuel tank vulnerability in rear-end collisions; finally, it fails to test how badly pedestrians are injured when hit by vehicles. Most of these consumer information tests are performed, or are being developed, in Europe, Australia and Japan.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s more, the tests that are done are simply too weak. Cars are not tested at high enough speeds; sport utility vehicles are tested against insubstantial barriers. Take all this together, and consumers are ill served.'b'Last year, Congress finally added more money for crash testing and required that test results be posted on the vehicle price sticker in the dealer showroom, but the safety administration should have done this on its own.'b'Consumer Reports will get past this mistake. Those of us who value its legacy expect a full public explanation of how its testing went wrong and how it will ensure that similar mistakes are avoided in the future. At the same time, the safety administration should devote its resources and energies not just to pointing out the grave mistakes of others, but to fulfilling its own mandate.'b'Boston'b'ACCORDING to a report released last week by the Harvard School of Public Health, cigarette companies have been steadily increasing the nicotine yield of their cigarettes \xe2\x80\x94 the report describes an average total increase of 11 percent from 1998 to 2005.'b'Anti-smoking groups have seized on the report as evidence that the Food and Drug Administration must begin regulating tobacco products.'b'A steady and significant increase in nicotine in cigarettes over the past eight years or so certainly seems worrisome.  It sounds as though companies like Philip Morris, which makes Marlboros,  are  secretly and deceptively increasing the nicotine in their cigarettes and, apparently, lying about it (since they deny the assertions of the report), all in an effort to increase the addictive potential of their cigarettes and harm the public\xe2\x80\x99s health.'b'There are, however, a number of  problems here.'b'First, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t dispute the report\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that overall nicotine yields in cigarettes have increased, this does not appear to be the case for Marlboro, the leading cigarette brand that commands over 40 percent of the market.'b'Using the data on nicotine yields of Marlboro cigarettes provided by Philip Morris to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health for  1997 through 2006, I conducted my own analysis of the trends in Marlboro nicotine yields.'b'The average nicotine yield of 16 Marlboro brands consistently reported for the entire time period was 1.81 milligrams in 1997; in 2006,  it was also 1.81 milligrams. Thus, the average nicotine yield of these cigarettes in 2006 was exactly the same as in 1997, nine years earlier.'b'Second,  an increase in nicotine yields does not necessarily mean an increase in the harm to smokers. It is well documented that smokers compensate for  changes in nicotine levels   to get a relatively constant nicotine dose.'b'This is why \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d cigarettes are not safer products. The nicotine levels in each cigarette may be lower, but smokers simply smoke more of them, negating the potential benefits of reduced nicotine levels. Indeed, smoking many \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d cigarettes is every bit as dangerous, if not more so, because of the increased exposure to other pollutants in cigarettes, than smoking fewer \xe2\x80\x9cregular\xe2\x80\x9d cigarettes.'b'Similarly, if nicotine yields increase, smokers might be expected to compensate by smoking slightly less. This could actually have a marginally positive health benefit if it reduces overall cigarette consumption.'b'Third, tobacco companies are not necessarily doing anything wrong if they are, in fact, increasing nicotine yields. The paradox of \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d cigarettes demonstrates that reducing nicotine yields is actually the last thing we would want \xe2\x80\x94 it would, again,  result only in people smoking more, and thus  increasing tar delivery and the resulting carcinogenic health effects.'b'The nicotine in cigarettes is indeed a public health problem. But anti-smoking groups have drawn the wrong conclusion from the Harvard report: the problem isn\xe2\x80\x99t whether or not nicotine levels are increasing; it\xe2\x80\x99s that this deadly, addictive product is available in the first place.'b'For the past two years, public health groups \xe2\x80\x94 led by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids \xe2\x80\x94 have lobbied for passage of legislation that would grant the F.D.A. the authority to regulate tobacco products; shockingly, this bill, which Senator Edward Kennedy is preparing to re-introduce in the next few weeks, would expressly preclude the F.D.A. from simply removing nicotine from cigarettes.'b'It remains unclear why public health groups would support such a provision, though presumably it\xe2\x80\x99s their attempt to appease Philip Morris, whose support is deemed necessary to get the proposed legislation through Congress.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not enough to regulate the varying degrees of nicotine in cigarettes. Ultimately, there\xe2\x80\x99s only one way to deal with the addictive effects of nicotine, especially on children: grant the F.D.A. the authority to get nicotine out of cigarettes altogether. Anti-smoking groups shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t settle for anything less.'b'In the State of the Union speech, President Bush said that the budget deficit had been cut in half from 2004 to 2006. Not quite. The deficit declined, but not by half, from $412 billion to $248 billion. If you measure it as a percentage of the economy, Mr. Bush was off by an amount equal to about $15 billion.'b'Then, Mr. Bush greatly compounded his otherwise modest exaggeration by taking credit for the reduction, when the deficit really fell despite his policies, not because of them. The distinction is crucial, to understand both the current mess \xe2\x80\x94 in which debt is mounting just as huge obligations are coming due for Medicare and Social Security \xe2\x80\x94 and how best to get out of it.'b'The drop in the deficit over the past few years was due largely to the cyclical recovery from the earlier recession, and to a boost in revenue when temporary business tax cuts expired after 2004.'b'Mr. Bush, meanwhile, has pursued a single-minded strategy of spending more while slashing taxes. That is the opposite of deficit reduction; it has made the budget hole deeper than it would have been. Still, Mr. Bush wants you to believe that tax cuts caused the economic recovery, and thus the budget improvement. If you follow that logic, the key to continued improvement would be continued tax cuts, and that is just what Mr. Bush called for last week. He conjured a bright future in which the deficit disappears after he leaves office, without anyone ever having to raise taxes.'b'That was the speech, and then there is reality, which came knocking within days when the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released its annual 10-year budget outlook. The outlook is for a cumulative deficit of $2.9 trillion to $3.4 trillion \xe2\x80\x94 about $300 billion a year \xe2\x80\x94 if, as Mr. Bush wishes, the tax cuts are extended beyond their scheduled expiration in 2010 and tax relief continues for Americans wrongly afflicted by the alternative minimum tax. In arriving at its estimate, the budget agency also assumed that costs for the war in Iraq would start going down next year, an assumption that, if proved wrong, would result in even higher deficits.'b'In the absence of overt tax increases, that leaves Mr. Bush only three ways to erase the deficit. He would have to make pie-in-the-sky assumptions of revenue growth, which would be dicey in any event, but folly at a time when the economy is slowing. He would have to renege on his pledge to protect taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax, a huge backdoor tax increase. Or he would have to persuade lawmakers to make cuts in spending even more draconian than those already dodged by the previous Republican-controlled Congress.'b'Fortunately, such cuts are necessary only if one accepts Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s premise that taxes must never rise under any circumstances. That is clearly a false premise. Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s tax cuts should largely be allowed to expire. Facing that truth is not a fiscal challenge, it\xe2\x80\x99s a political one.'b'Mr. Bush will not meet it.

Incredibly, that job may go to Sudan\xe2\x80\x99s blood-drenched president, Omar al-Bashir, architect of the genocide in Darfur.'b'The outcome is still uncertain, with Sudan campaigning furiously for the job, but it\xe2\x80\x99s mind-boggling that African countries would even consider selecting as their leader a man who has systematically dispatched militias that pick out babies on the basis of tribe and skin color and throw them into bonfires.'b'At a time when Africa is enjoying solid economic growth and improved leadership, this self-inflicted wound would sully Africa\xe2\x80\x99s image and make it far more difficult for African Union peacekeepers to save lives in Darfur.'b'Mr. Bashir hasn\xe2\x80\x99t confined himself to killing his own people, but has also sent his janjaweed militias to invade Chad and the Central African Republic. The janjaweed have beaten mothers with their own babies, until the infants are dead, and lately they have diversified into gouging out people\xe2\x80\x99s eyes with bayonets. For anyone who wants the best for Africa, it is repulsive to think of President Bashir  as the duly elected spokesman for the continent.'b'One reason Mr. Bashir has continued to engage in such behavior is that the world doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seriously object. Almost all North African countries are backing his bid to chair the African Union. China, which supplies nearly all the AK-47s that are used to kill children in Darfur, has underwritten the genocide. Lately, it has encouraged Sudan to be more responsible, but President Hu Jintao is visiting Sudan shortly \xe2\x80\x94 let\xe2\x80\x99s see whether he publicly expresses concern about Chinese-supported atrocities in Africa that far exceed the Rape of Nanjing.'b'Sudan promised a cease-fire, but instead it has been attacking aid workers. As Newsweek reported, at least four female aid workers have been beaten and sexually abused recently \xe2\x80\x94 raped in the case of two French women.'b'In addition, an aid worker in Sudan tells me that on Jan. 22 the police raided a party in the city of Nyala and arrested 22 employees of aid groups. Several were beaten and one woman was sexually abused but managed to fend off an attempted rape.'b'Broader security is also collapsing. On a road near Bulbul that used to be safe, gunmen stopped a public bus in the middle of the day and brutally beat the men and gang-raped the women for hours. In the face of all this, aid workers are jittery and some are pulling out.'b'Yet Europe is oblivious (the Davos conference here has great sessions on Africa but nothing on Darfur). President Bush has been better than most world leaders, but still pathetic: he mustered half a sentence in his State of the Union address. Perhaps this is because Mr. Bush regards the situation as tragic but hopeless, but in fact there is plenty he could do.'b'He could speak out forcefully about Darfur. He could bring victims to the White House for a photo op. He could help the U.N. send a force to protect Chad and the Central African Republic \xe2\x80\x94 while continuing to push for U.N. peacekeepers in Darfur itself. He could visit Darfur or Chad and invite European or Chinese officials to join him. He could invite African leaders to Washington for a summit meeting that would include discussion of Darfur. He could impose a no-fly zone. He could develop targeted sanctions against Sudanese leaders. He could begin forensic accounting to find assets of those leaders in Western countries. He could call on NATO and the Pentagon to prepare contingency plans in case the janjaweed start massacring the hundreds of thousands of Darfuris in camps.'b'And this weekend he could telephone a few African presidents to tell them what a catastrophe it would be if Africa chose Mr. Bashir as its leader.'b'Serious negotiations between the government and Darfur\xe2\x80\x99s rebels are crucial for a lasting peace deal in Darfur, and new discussions are expected soon (that may be why President Hu dares visit Khartoum). But Mudawi Ibrahim Adam, a Sudanese human rights leader, says the new talks will fail unless the Darfur rebels have a chance to consult first. And when they try to meet, the Sudanese government bombs them.'b'There are countless other practical ideas  for Darfur, and I\xe2\x80\x99d like to hear yours.

He was asked to help Muslim women and children flee from an area near Srebrenica, where 7,000 Muslims had already been slaughtered by Serb forces.'b'It was a controversial mission. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees refused to participate, believing the evacuation would just complete the ethnic cleansing. But the high commissioner didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the crowds of Muslim women shrieking in terror as Serb jeeps rolled by. Joseph did. It might seem high-minded to preach ethnic reconciliation from afar, Joseph now says, but in a civil war, when you can\xe2\x80\x99t protect people, it\xe2\x80\x99s immoral to leave them to be killed.'b'Gradually, leaders on all sides of the Bosnian fight came to see it was in their interest to separate their peoples. And once the ethnic groups were given sanctuary, it became possible to negotiate a peace that was imperfect, but which was better than the reverberating splashes of blood.'b'Today, many of the people active in Bosnia believe they have a model that could help stabilize Iraq. They acknowledge the many differences between the two places, but Iraq, they note, is a disintegrating nation. Ethnic cleansing is dividing Baghdad, millions are moving, thousands are dying and the future looks horrific.'b'The best answer, then, is soft partition: create a central government with a few key powers; reinforce strong regional governments; separate the sectarian groups as much as possible.'b'In practice, that means, first, modifying the Iraqi Constitution.'b'As Joe Biden points out, the Constitution already goes a long way toward decentralizing power. It gives the provinces the power to have their own security services, to send ambassadors to foreign countries, to join together to form regions. Decentralization is not an American imposition, it\xe2\x80\x99s an Iraqi idea.'b'But, he adds, so far the Constitution doesn\xe2\x80\x99t yet have legislation that would do things like equitably share oil and gas revenue. The Sunnis will never be content with a strip of sand unless they\xe2\x80\x99re constitutionally guaranteed 20 percent of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s wealth.'b'The second step is getting implicit consent from all sects that separation and federalism are in their interest. The Shiites would have to accept that there never will be a stable Iraq if the Sunnis are reduced to helot status. The Kurds would have to accept that peace and stability are worth territorial compromise in Kirkuk. The Sunnis would have to accept that they\xe2\x80\x99re never going to run Iraq again, and having a strong Sunni region is better than living under a Shiite jackboot.'b'As Les Gelb says, unless the thirst for vengeance has driven the leaders in Iraq beyond the realm of reason, it should be possible to persuade them to see where their best interests lie.'b'The third step in a soft partition would be the relocation of peoples. This would mean using U.S. or Iraqi troops to shepherd people who want to flee toward areas where they feel safe. It would mean providing humanitarian assistance so they can get back on their feet.'b'As Edward Joseph and Michael O\xe2\x80\x99Hanlon note, in this kind of operation, timing is everything. Move people in a certain neighborhood too early, and militias could perceive a vacuum and accelerate the violence. Move too late and you could be moving corpses.'b'The fourth step is getting Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors to buy into the arrangement. Presumably neither Iran nor Saudi Arabia really relishes complete chaos in Iraq and a proxy war with each other after the U.S. withdraws. The Turks would have to be reassured that this plan means no independent Kurdistan will ever come into being.'b'The most serious objection to soft partition is that the Sunni and Shiite populations are too intermingled in Baghdad and elsewhere to really separate. This objection, sadly, becomes less of a problem every day. But it would still be necessary to maintain peacekeepers in the mixed neighborhoods, be open to creative sovereignty structures, and hope that the detoxification of the situation nationally might reduce violence where diverse groups touch.'b'In short, logic, circumstances and politics are leading inexorably toward soft partition. The Bush administration has been slow to recognize its virtues because it is too dependent on the Green Zone Iraqis. The Iraqis talk about national unity but their behavior suggests they want decentralization. Sooner or later, everybody will settle on this sensible policy, having exhausted all the alternatives.'b'Last week\xe2\x80\x99s Photo-Op carried an incorrect date.

When the Republican incumbent, Michael Balboni, quit to join the Spitzer administration as chief of homeland security, the race to succeed him became  instantly nasty and  hugely expensive.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s because  so much is at stake beyond just a single seat in northwest Nassau County \xe2\x80\x94 control of the Senate, for instance, where the Republican majority has been nearing the vanishing point, as well as  the reform agenda of Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who broke with a tradition of gubernatorial nonaggression in such races to appear in an ad hailing the Democratic candidate, Craig Johnson, as an ally in his crusade to fix Albany.'b'Mr. Johnson, who was elected to the Nassau Legislature in 2000 after the death of the incumbent \xe2\x80\x94 his mother, Barbara \xe2\x80\x94 is challenging Maureen O\xe2\x80\x99Connell, who became the Nassau County clerk a little over a year ago and now wants to return to Albany, where she had served as an assemblywoman since 1998. With very little time to campaign \xe2\x80\x94 the special election is on Feb. 6 \xe2\x80\x94 both sides are running at a frantic pace.'b'Their ads are studies in negativity, with Mr. Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s campaign  accusing Ms. O\xe2\x80\x99Connell of being an anti-choice extremist on reproductive issues, and Ms. O\xe2\x80\x99Connell running a preposterous spot showing a woman tied to railroad tracks about to be mowed down by a train. The train represents taxes, taxes, taxes,   specifically the 19-percent increase that County Executive Thomas Suozzi pushed through the Legislature in his first term as part of his utterly sensible \xe2\x80\x94 and successful \xe2\x80\x94 effort to rescue Nassau\xe2\x80\x99s finances from decades of Republican misrule.'b'Of the charges being hurled back and forth over the airwaves, we find Mr. Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s the more persuasive. Ms. O\xe2\x80\x99Connell does have a troubling record on choice, having taken stands in Albany \xe2\x80\x94  like voting against an emergency  contraception bill when it was in committee \xe2\x80\x94 that infringed on women\xe2\x80\x99s reproductive rights.'b'Ms. O\xe2\x80\x99Connell\xe2\x80\x99s claims that Mr. Johnson is a taxing madman are, by contrast, unfounded. The Suozzi tax plan he voted for was a prudent and responsible response to a fiscal mess.  He has also assembled a credible record on other issues, including open space preservation.'b'This race is, though, about something larger \xe2\x80\x94 which is the reason the eyes of the whole state are on it. Governor Spitzer will need the cooperation of the Republican-dominated State Senate if he is going to make progress on the ambitious reform agenda he has laid out. Mr. Johnson has vowed to be his ally in the coming  battles, while Ms. O\xe2\x80\x99Connell is likely to give reinforcement to the Albany status quo.'b'For voters who have hopes that Mr. Spitzer will succeed in fixing Albany, as we do, Mr. Johnson is the obvious choice.

Gov. Eliot Spitzer was elected on a platform of change and with ambitious promises to bring jobs and growth upstate. A plan that would ease chronic delays and congestion at Newark, LaGuardia and Kennedy airports while stimulating economic growth in the Hudson Valley is a natural fit for the Spitzer agenda.'b'The idea of expanding Stewart Airport has been talked about for years, but went nowhere in the Pataki administration. New Yorkers are lucky that the opportunity lingered long enough to be seized last week by the Port Authority, which plans to acquire the airport lease from the British company that put it up for sale last year.'b'Stewart International is a fancy   name for what is now a sleepy hub 60 miles north of New York City. But the site, a former Air Force base, is bigger than Newark International. It is near two interstate highways, the New York State Thruway and I-84, and the Metro-North railroad. While Stewart handles only a few hundred thousand passengers a year, the Port Authority expects that it could serve more than three million a year in about five years. Most of these would be travelers living north and west of New York City, which would mean huge relief for the people and planes now using the three big-city airports, which have reached the bursting point and cannot expand any more.'b'Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s vast promise carries many perils. In nearby Newburgh, the economic activity spurred by the airport can be seen in a profusion of big-box stores and strip malls. Growth is clearly better than stagnation, but the Hudson Valley region needs to manage its growth wisely, with particular attention to how an expanded airport might strain the transportation grid and encourage the deadly spread of sprawl.'b'Governor Spitzer wisely couples the words \xe2\x80\x9csmart growth\xe2\x80\x9d with his calls for spurring economic development. These principles \xe2\x80\x94 which envision sensible, human-scale development not fatally wedded to the automobile \xe2\x80\x94 must apply to the changes envisioned in New Windsor.'b'As Ned Sullivan of the environmental group Scenic Hudson has warned in these pages, the unmatched beauty and peacefulness of the Hudson River valley are more than a precious aesthetic resource. They are the region\xe2\x80\x99s economic mainstay. As long as it is done carefully, Stewart International Airport should be able to expand to its potential as a vital regional transportation hub, linked to the metropolitan grid by improved rail service and existing in harmony with its neighbors.'b'Just about everyone in the New Jersey Legislature knows that a major reason for high property taxes in the state is the existence of so many municipalities (566), school districts (616) and hundreds of other governmental units in a state relatively small in area.'b'But few members of that Legislature want to do very much to abolish any of them.'b'Yes, we are aware that the state Senate last week approved a bill creating a commission to recommend the merger, or at least the consolidation of services, of some of these governments. But the measure passed only after its teeth were removed. Earlier proposals would have given the commission some power to compel mergers, to offer towns financial incentives for merging and to impose penalties for refusing to do so. But these were dropped in favor of a provision requiring any proposed merger to be approved by the affected towns\xe2\x80\x99 voters. Residents are likely to be unenthusiastic about abolishing their own towns.'b'More than most states, New Jersey has a strong home rule tradition in which legislators and other political officials are reluctant to intrude on the authority of local governments to run their affairs. Considering the state\xe2\x80\x99s soaring property taxes, New Jersey residents are paying too high a price to preserve this outmoded tradition.'b'New York\xe2\x80\x99s campaign finance system has been a model for cities seeking ways to insulate politicians from special interest money while shoring up public confidence in the political system. But this enviable system is hardly free of loopholes, and gaming it has become commonplace. With Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the City Council and the Campaign Finance Board having expressed a desire to strengthen the program, this seems an especially auspicious time for reform.'b'The heavy lifting will have to take place in the Council. Last year, Speaker Christine Quinn persuaded the  51-member body to take a promising first step by restricting contributions from lobbyists. Further reforms are certain to inspire resistance among lawmakers who are always looking for more ways to raise cash. But the truth is that real reform could inspire more New Yorkers to contribute and to participate in the political process.'b'What has made the city\xe2\x80\x99s program special is its system of matching funds, which has helped candidates who are not political insiders to run. Council candidates, for instance, receive $4 in public money for each private contribution up to $250, or up to $1,000 per qualified donor, and a total $82,500 per candidate. The program is considerably more generous for citywide office seekers.'b'The system has not been helped by candidates who opt out, like Mr. Bloomberg, whose self-financed campaigns cost an estimated $150 million. Other candidates resent the system\xe2\x80\x99s requirements on fundraising, spending and public debates.'b'Encouraging candidate participation should be a priority. For its part, the Campaign Finance Board should listen closely to suggestions from the candidates themselves, who would like to see simplified record keeping and quicker audits so that every qualified dollar is matched in a timely way.'b'In exchange, though, the Council must finally correct one of the system\xe2\x80\x99s great weaknesses \xe2\x80\x94 its failure to govern the \xe2\x80\x9cpay to play\xe2\x80\x9d money that flows from individuals and businesses with city contracts. What\xe2\x80\x99s needed to stop this flow, besides sheer political will, is a dependable database and an enforcement mechanism. The Council must quickly mandate a database that includes not just vendors but also real estate interests. And cash from limited liability corporations and partnerships should be prohibited if ways cannot be found to regulate it.'b'The Council could learn from Connecticut and New Jersey, which wisely took the onus off campaigns by requiring contractors to divulge any campaign contributions. New Yorkers are also depending on their representatives to stop incumbents in noncompetitive races from collecting matching public money, and to put better controls on how campaigns spend taxpayer dollars.'b'The majority of Council members have benefited from public financing. Historically, the lawmaking body has supported the Campaign Finance Board. Now it needs to reinforce its commitment with these important reforms.'b'Bethesda, Md.'b'THE other day I saw a headline indicating that Illinois was about to get out of the lottery business. At first I was cheered; it seemed that Illinois and I had something in common. Having made my living for the past decade exploiting lottery winners \xe2\x80\x94 and recently having repented my ways \xe2\x80\x94 I hoped the state had simply grown tired of profiting from its citizens\xe2\x80\x99 weaknesses.'b'But as I read the article, it turned out that Illinois isn\xe2\x80\x99t acting on moral principle, but in fact succumbing to the lure of easy money that has brought so many lottery winners to ruin.'b'The state\xe2\x80\x99s plan is to turn over the running of the lottery for the next 75 years to private investors in exchange for a huge sum up front \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps $10 billion. Indiana is considering following suit. The states seem to think they can do more with the money if they get a big balance all at once, albeit less money than the lottery would earn them over time. I understand that line of thinking.'b'In essence, Illinois wants what virtually every lottery winner wants: the money up front. Although now some lottery winners can take a large lump sum right away (of course, much less than the supposed value of the winning ticket), for years they were paid their jackpots in annuities over 20 or 25 years. There\xe2\x80\x99s a major difference between getting a million dollars right away and getting 20 annual checks for $100,000 or so. Yes, both amounts are considered fair, but the lump sum is much preferable: you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait to buy your mansion, or (more prudently) you can invest it, earn interest on it, and be protected against inflation.'b'I worked for a company that searched out winners who didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the option to receive their winnings in a lump sum or had chosen not to, and who then had spent themselves into short-term debt and needed money before the next annual payment. We were happy to buy their future payments in exchange for quick cash, at a handsome profit to ourselves.'b'Believe me, these financially lost winners were the rule, not the exception. There are databases overflowing with the identities of winner after winner who won seemingly huge amounts of money only to find themselves destitute (and sometimes dead).'b'At the core, all these people acted as if they had received the money up front rather than over time. You may scoff, but do you think you could win the lottery and wait patiently for 20 years while your ship comes in? Good luck.'b'And now the Illinois officials are acting just like any spendthrift winner who\xe2\x80\x99s being paid over time.  Like many of my former clients, Illinois is selling its future in order to fortify its present. But an individual who burns through his lump sum in a few years will bear the consequences of his actions. That\xe2\x80\x99s not the case for Illinois: the officials who would enjoy the $10 billion windfall will be out of office decades before the 75 years is up. And instead of giving up annuities of ever shrinking value, as a lump sum winner does, Illinois is giving up an ever growing stream of revenue \xe2\x80\x94 the state\xe2\x80\x99s lottery revenue increased 15 percent from 2003 to 2005.'b'State officials seem to think they can make smart decisions with the $10 billion. But I worry that these politicians are making a decision that will allow them to spend freely and leave nothing behind for the next folks. And because (in theory at least) a goodly portion of lottery revenues usually goes to the schools, we should all be concerned about states looking for the quick payoff.'b'Trust me: I spent many years doing nothing but singing the praises of the lump sum option. I could sell it because I truly believed that the lump sum was the correct choice for any and all lottery winners, and I still do. But a $10 billion lump sum to officials who will be out of office decades before the deal runs its course raises all sorts of questions about unforeseen consequences.'b'I got out of the lottery industry because it and I had had enough of each other. It\xe2\x80\x99s a legitimate business, but it is an unseemly one \xe2\x80\x94 no one who spends any real time in it comes out smelling like a rose, myself included. So the state of Illinois isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only party here that should take warning: the private equity funds that are sniffing around the deal should also think twice \xe2\x80\x94 nobody is immune to lottery fever.'b'The proposed New Jersey to Manhattan commuter rail tunnel, widely regarded as vital to the economy of both New York and New Jersey, is moving into a critical period that could decide whether or not it actually gets built.'b'Largely because of the efforts of New Jersey Transit director George Warrington, who has announced his intention to step down at the end of March, the massive project has blossomed beyond being merely a dream of transportation planners and New Jersey cheerleaders. Officials in New York now support it and want to start construction in 2009.'b'And just this month, a key federal agency approved a draft of the tunnel\xe2\x80\x99s environmental impact statement, an essential step for getting federal funds.'b'But there are major hurdles to surmount during the next two years. The deficit-plagued federal government will have to come up with up to half of the $7.2 billion estimated cost. And even though the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has pledged $2 billion, New Jersey, which has its own budget problems, may have to come up with more than the $500-million it has promised. And even that may not be enough.'b'Since Mr. Warrington will not be around to keep the pressure on, there\xe2\x80\x99s a risk that some of this necessary funding may dry up or that other smaller, less important pet projects of various politicians may drain off money. It is imperative that New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine, a strong supporter of the tunnel, name a successor with the same expertise and sense of commitment that Mr. Warrington has displayed.'b'The need for the tunnel is enormous. Currently, a 96-year-old Amtrak-owned tunnel with two tracks is the only rail link under the Hudson River. Serving both Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains, the link carries 45,000 passengers each peak period when 24 trains an hour are squeezed through the tunnel. If there is a breakdown, rail transportation between New Jersey and Manhattan stops. The new tunnel, which would end under 34th Street on Manhattan\xe2\x80\x99s West Side, would provide essential backup and double the number of trains that could enter and exit Manhattan from New Jersey.'b'Besides improved service for commuters from west of the Hudson, the new tunnel is essential for New York City\xe2\x80\x99s economy, which is expected to become increasingly dependent on workers from New Jersey, Rockland and Orange counties in New York, and even Pennsylvania, as the years go by.'b'It is this argument that Mr. Warrington used to get Gov. Eliot Spitzer, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Sen. Hillary Clinton, Sen. Charles Schumer and other key New York city and state officials behind the project.'b'And it is this argument, together with the importance of a healthy New York-New Jersey metropolitan area to the economy of the entire nation, that Mr. Warrington\xe2\x80\x99s successor will have to make in Washington to get the needed federal money.'b'For the tunnel to become a reality, New Jersey Transit will need one of the most able and persuasive mass transit directors in the country.'b'Boston'b'LAST month, Betsy Gotbaum, New York City\xe2\x80\x99s public advocate,  issued a report noting  that Caesarean section rates at some of the major hospitals  in the city were nearly 40 percent, about 10 percentage points higher than the national average. The rates are probably even greater, given that the data \xe2\x80\x94 the most recent available \xe2\x80\x94 was from 2004 and the surgery\xe2\x80\x99s popularity has only grown since then.'b'What gives? Have New York women been more susceptible to the Britney Spearsification of childbirth? That is: book an operating room reservation for delivery and then get a tummy tuck. Childbirth activists believe that the too-posh-to-push phenomenon, while tiny, may be part of the problem, especially in trend-conscious New York. But they say doctors are more to blame because they fear malpractice claims and want to control birth and their schedules as much as anyone, so they encourage women to have Caesareans that may not be necessary.'b'Obstetricians claim the rates are so high because professional women are becoming  pregnant later in life, often with technological help, which makes labor and delivery riskier.'b'However, these truths don\xe2\x80\x99t hold with all women. While New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia had the highest Caesarean rate, at 39.6 percent, the hospital  with the lowest, at 18.3 percent, was  North Central Bronx Hospital, according to Ms. Gotbaum.'b'Which brings us to another angle to consider.'b'In 1908, Franklin Newell, a doctor affiliated with Harvard Medical School, said that moneyed urban women suffered more when having a baby, and he wanted to prevent them from having \xe2\x80\x9cnervous breakdowns\xe2\x80\x9d by offering Caesareans. This was a radical concept at the time. Caesareans were truly dangerous then. Antibiotics had not yet been invented. Anesthesia was in its infancy. But Newell still thought the surgery would be best for the mother.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me that this overdevelopment of the nervous organization is responsible for the increased morbidity of pregnancy in the overcivilized class,\xe2\x80\x9d Newell said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe advocacy of an elective Caesarean section for patients who have no pelvic obstruction will undoubtedly come as a shock to many members of the profession.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Indeed it was. At the time, Caesarean rates were about 1 percent. (The World Health Organization today states that Caesarean rates in industrialized nations should be between 10 percent  and 15 percent, beyond which, the risks and costs of the operation outweigh the benefits to mother and baby.)'b'But back to Newell. I believe he was on to something. New York women, stereotypically some of the most empowered and health conscious in the country, should not have any trouble giving birth, even if they are 38 years old and pregnant for the first time. Strength, both mental and physical, is all it usually takes to give birth (along with a lot of encouragement).'b'Yet if \xe2\x80\x9covercivilized\xe2\x80\x9d is synonymous with \xe2\x80\x9ceducated,\xe2\x80\x9d which could equal \xe2\x80\x9chaving too much information,\xe2\x80\x9d which could make anyone neurotic, then it could also be said that city women are overcivilized. Thinking too much about everything that could go wrong during birth, instead of focusing on how it is a natural physiological process, is a recipe for surgery.'b'All a New York obstetrician has to do is introduce the concept of danger or inconvenience, and the expectant mother gets the vapors. Even some midwives, the guardians of natural birth, have admitted to me that they can tell by looking at a pregnant woman\xe2\x80\x99s r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 whether she will be more prone to a Caesarean. Uptight? Check. M.B.A.? Check. Drives a Volvo? Check. If the city\xe2\x80\x99s Caesarean trend keeps up, they can just skip to one simple question: From the Upper East Side? Check.'b'Although it is difficult to determine which belief came first, that upper-class women could not or would not handle childbirth or that doctors thought such delicate flowers could not or would not tolerate it, both, sadly, seem to be increasingly true today.'b'Although New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia serves a diverse population, it also has many high-risk and affluent patients, as well as private-practice doctors who may be financially motivated to perform the surgery. (Nationwide, uncomplicated Caesareans cost almost two times as much as  uncomplicated vaginal deliveries in the hospital.)'b'By contrast, North Central Bronx, a public hospital  that serves a diverse population and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the financial incentive to perform Caesareans, has the lowest procedure rate.'b'Or perhaps, doctors there aren\xe2\x80\x99t inquiring about mothers\xe2\x80\x99 r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9s.'b'To the Editor:'b'In \xe2\x80\x9cWhy Are There So Many Single Americans?\xe2\x80\x9d (Week in Review, Jan. 21), you report on a variety of expert explanations as to why college-educated men and women marry in greater numbers than their non-college-educated counterparts.

Klein 'b'The Bronx 'b''b'The writer is deputy minority leader, New York State Senate.'b''b''b''b'THE news earlier this month about how a New York court treated the dissolution of a gay relationship demonstrates how far gays have come in the struggle for marriage equality and how far we have yet to go. The court held that a separation agreement between two men was binding even though they were not married.'b'This is an advance over earlier cases in which such agreements were sometimes deemed unenforceable. At the same time, it falls far short of marriage.'b'The case sounds like a contracts question on the New York Bar Exam. Steven Green and David Gonzalez moved in together in 2001. Over the course of their relationship, Mr. Green, whom the court describes as \xe2\x80\x9ca person of considerable assets and income,\xe2\x80\x9d showered Mr. Gonzalez with gifts, including cars and a ski house.'b'In 2005, the couple, whose primary residence was in Westchester County, traveled to Massachusetts, which permits resident same-sex couples to marry, and took part in a marriage ceremony on Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day. But months later, they decided to end their relationship.'b'In September 2005, the two men signed a written separation agreement under which Mr. Green paid Mr. Gonzalez $780,000 and Mr. Gonzalez transferred the title of the ski house to Mr. Green. More than a year later, when Mr. Gonzalez filed for divorce, Mr. Green sought to rescind the contract. He argued that because there was no marriage, the contract was invalid. Question: Can Mr. Green get his money back?'b'In responding with a thundering \xe2\x80\x9cno,\xe2\x80\x9d the court answered exactly right. It first observed that the marriage issue was a red herring. Massachusetts only permits resident same-sex couples to marry. As nonresidents, Mr. Green and Mr. Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s marriage ceremony did not entitle them to recognition in Massachusetts, much less New York.'b'Mr. Green argued that under contract law, it was enough that he and Mr. Gonzalez 'b'believed'b' they were married. (Under the doctrine of \xe2\x80\x9cmutual mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d a contract can be deemed invalid if both parties are laboring under a misapprehension that goes to its heart.) The court rejected this contention as well. It observed that Mr. Green and Mr. Gonzalez never held themselves out to be married in filing taxes or buying property, and that, by Mr. Green\xe2\x80\x99s own admission, they had gotten married only \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it seemed like a nice thing to have, since couples in the gay community are seeking such status.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The real issue, the court said, was whether separation agreements between unmarried, cohabiting individuals are binding. Under New York law, such contracts are enforceable so long as \xe2\x80\x9cillicit sexual relations were not part of the consideration of the contract.\xe2\x80\x9d In other words, contracts will not be invalidated just because the parties are cohabiting, so long as they do not violate the prohibition on prostitution.'b'It may seem obvious that a separation agreement is not what used to be called a \xe2\x80\x9cmeretricious contract.\xe2\x80\x9d But other courts in other times have deemed contracts between two people who have been sexually involved with each other with suspicion, particularly if the people are of the same sex. In dispensing with the \xe2\x80\x9cmeretricious contract\xe2\x80\x9d exception in a footnote, the court properly refused to dignify arguments made under it. It concluded that the contract was enforceable.'b'I am confident that most courts around the country will get this question right. My only concern about such decisions is their potential to serve as substitutes for same-sex marriage, rather than as stations toward it. Too many people reacted to the New York decision by reaffirming that gays could get all the significant benefits of marriage through contract. This is false.'b'Gays cannot enter into a contract for benefits bestowed on married couples by third parties. Such benefits include those that the government provides, like immigration rights, custody rights, tax benefits and the various spousal privileges available in litigation. They also include benefits provided by private institutions, like access to a partner\xe2\x80\x99s hospital room or coverage under his health plan. And a gay couple, of course, cannot enter a contract with each other for the simple dignity of having the state recognize a commitment between them as a marriage. This seems to be the only count on which Mr. Green was right: marriage is indeed \xe2\x80\x9ca nice thing to have.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The fiction that gays can get the rights of marriage through contract is pernicious because it permits inertia on the part of those who have incentives to remain inert. As with any civil rights struggle, those in power will be tempted to rest on their laurels. Prior to election, Gov. Eliot Spitzer was an open and ardent supporter of same-sex marriage. His Jan. 3 State of the State address, however, made no reference to the issue, other than the oblique phrase that the civil rights movement in the state \xe2\x80\x9cstill has chapters to be written.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But the final chapter in this struggle must be marriage. And it must be written soon.'b'HILLARY CLINTON has an answer to those who suspect that her 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in to win\xe2\x80\x9d'b' Webcast last weekend was forced by 'b'Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Webcast'b' of just four days earlier. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to do it before the president\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'she explained to Brian Williams on NBC'b', \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I wanted to draw the contrast between what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the last six years, and the kind of leadership and experience that I would bring to the office.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have set the bar any lower.

(Winner: Pelosi.)'b'As we\xe2\x80\x99ve been much reminded, the most recent presidents to face Congress in such low estate were 'b'Harry Truman in 1952 and Richard Nixon in 1974'b', both in the last ebbs of their administrations, both mired in unpopular wars that their successors would soon end, and both eager to change the subject just as Mr. Bush did. In his 'b'\xe2\x80\x9952 State of the Union address'b', Truman vowed \xe2\x80\x9cto bring the cost of modern medical care within the reach of all the people\xe2\x80\x9d while 'b'Nixon, 22 years later, promised'b' \xe2\x80\x9ca new system that makes high-quality health care available to every American.\xe2\x80\x9d Not to be outdone, Mr. Bush 'b'offered a dead-on-arrival proposal'b' that \xe2\x80\x9call our citizens have affordable and available health care.\xe2\x80\x9d The empty promise of a free intravenous lunch, it seems, is the last refuge of desperate war presidents.'b'Few Americans know more than Senator Clinton about health care, as it happens, and if 27 Americans hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been 'b'killed in Iraq last weekend'b', voters might be in the mood to listen to her about it. But polls continue to show Iraq dwarfing every other issue as the nation\xe2\x80\x99s No. 1 concern. The Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 pre-eminent presidential candidate can\xe2\x80\x99t escape the war any more than the president can. And so she was blindsided Tuesday night, just as Mr. Bush was, by an unexpected gate crasher, the rookie senator from Virginia, Jim Webb. Though he\xe2\x80\x99s not a candidate for national office, Mr. Webb\xe2\x80\x99s nine-minute Democratic response not only upstaged the president but also, in an unintended political drive-by shooting, gave Mrs. Clinton a more pointed State of the Union \xe2\x80\x9ccontrast\xe2\x80\x9d than she had bargained for.'b'To the political consultants favored by both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Bush, Mr. Webb is an amateur. More than a few Washington insiders initially wrote him off in last year\xe2\x80\x99s race to unseat a star presidential prospect, the incumbent Senator George Allen. Mr. Webb is standoffish. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care whom he offends, including in his own base. He gives the impression \xe2\x80\x94 as he did Tuesday night \xe2\x80\x94 that he just might punch out his opponent. When he had his 'b'famously testy exchange'b' with Mr. Bush over the war at a White House reception after his victory, Beltway pooh-bahs labeled him a boor, much as they had that other interloper who refused to censor himself before the president last year, 'b'Stephen Colbert'b'.'b'But this country is at a grave crossroads. It craves leadership. When Mr. Webb spoke on Tuesday, he stepped into that vacuum and, for a few minutes anyway, filled it. It\xe2\x80\x99s not merely his military credentials as a Vietnam veteran and a former Navy secretary for Ronald Reagan that gave him authority, or the fact that his son, also a marine, is serving in Iraq. It was the simplicity and honesty of 'b'Mr. Webb\xe2\x80\x99s message'b'. Like Senator Obama, he was a talented professional writer before entering politics, so he could discard whatever risk-averse speech his party handed him and 'b'write his own'b'. His exquisitely calibrated threat of Democratic pushback should Mr. Bush fail to change course on the war \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cIf he does not, we will be showing him the way\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 continued to charge the air even as Mrs. Clinton made the post-speech rounds on the networks.'b'Mrs. Clinton cannot rewrite her own history on Iraq to match Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s early opposition to the war, or Mr. Webb\xe2\x80\x99s. She was not prescient enough to see, as Mr. Webb 'b'wrote in The Washington Post back in September 2002'b', that \xe2\x80\x9cunilateral wars designed to bring about regime change and a long-term occupation should be undertaken only when a nation\xe2\x80\x99s existence is clearly at stake.\xe2\x80\x9d But she\xe2\x80\x99s hardly alone in this failing, and the point now is not that she mimic John Edwards with a 'b'prostrate apology'b' for her vote to authorize the war. ('b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t get do-overs in life or in politics,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' she has said.) What matters to the country is what happens next. What matters is the leadership that will take us out of the fiasco.'b'Mr. Webb made his own proposals for ending the war, some of them anticipating those of the Iraq Study Group, while running against a popular incumbent in a reddish state. Mrs. Clinton, running for re-election in a safe seat in blue New York, settled for 'b'ratcheting up her old complaints'b' about the war\xe2\x80\x99s execution and for endorsing other senators\xe2\x80\x99 calls for vaguely defined \xe2\x80\x9cphased redeployments.\xe2\x80\x9d Even now, after the Nov. 7 results confirmed that two-thirds of voters nationwide want out, she struggles to parse formulations about Iraq.'b'This is how she explains her vote to authorize the war: \xe2\x80\x9cI would never have expected any president, if we knew then what we know now, to come to ask for a vote. There would not have been a vote, and I certainly would not have voted for it.\xe2\x80\x9d John Kerry could not have said it worse himself. No wonder last weekend\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSaturday Night Live\xe2\x80\x9d gave us a \xe2\x80\x9cHillary\xe2\x80\x9d who said, \xe2\x80\x9cKnowing what we know now, that you could vote against the war and still be elected president, I would never have pretended to support it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Compounding this problem for Mrs. Clinton is that the theatrics of her fledgling campaign are already echoing the content: they are so overscripted and focus-group bland that they underline rather than combat the perennial criticism that she is a cautious triangulator too willing to trim convictions for political gain. Last week she conducted three online Web chats that she billed as opportunities for voters to see her 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cin an unfiltered way.\xe2\x80\x9d'b' Surely she was kidding. Everything was filtered, from the 'b'phony living-room set'b' to the appearance of a \xe2\x80\x9ccampaign blogger\xe2\x80\x9d who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t blogging to the softball questions and canned responses.

One of those \xe2\x80\x9cAsk President Bush\xe2\x80\x9d sessions yielded the memorable question, 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMr. President, as a child, how can I help you get votes?\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'After six years of \xe2\x80\x9cAsk President Bush,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMission Accomplished\xe2\x80\x9d and stage sets plastered with \xe2\x80\x9cPlan for Victory,\xe2\x80\x9d Americans hunger for a presidency with some authenticity.

(Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s bare-bones Webcast and Web site shrewdly play Google to Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s AOL.) Besides, the belief that an image can be tightly controlled in the viral media era is pure fantasy. Just ask the former Virginia senator, Mr. Allen, whose past prowess as a disciplined, image-conscious politician proved worthless once the Webb campaign posted on YouTube a 'b'grainy but authentic video'b' capturing him in an embarrassing off-script public moment.'b'The image that Mrs. Clinton wants to sell is summed up by her 'b'frequent invocation of the word middle'b', as in \xe2\x80\x9cI grew up in a middle-class family in the middle of America.\xe2\x80\x9d She\xe2\x80\x99s not left or right, you see, but exactly in the center where everyone feels safe. But as the fierce war critic Chuck Hagel, the Republican senator from Nebraska, argues in a 'b'must-read interview at gq.com'b', the war is \xe2\x80\x9cstarting to redefine the political landscape\xe2\x80\x9d and scramble the old party labels. Like Mrs. Clinton, the middle-American Mr. Hagel voted to authorize the Iraq war, but that has not impeded his leadership in questioning it ever since.'b'The issue raised by the tragedy of Iraq is not who\xe2\x80\x99s on the left or the right, but who is in front and who is behind. Mrs. Clinton has always been a follower of public opinion on the war, not a leader. Now events are outrunning her. Support for the war both in the polls and among Republicans in Congress is plummeting faster than she can recalibrate her rhetoric; 'b'unreliable Iraqi troops'b' are already proving no-shows in the new Iraqi-American \xe2\x80\x9cjoint patrols\xe2\x80\x9d of Baghdad; the Congressional showdown over fresh appropriations for Iraq is just weeks away.'b'This, in other words, is a moment of crisis in our history and there will be no do-overs. Should Mrs. Clinton actually seek unfiltered exposure to voters, she will learn that they are anxiously waiting to see just who in Washington is brave enough to act.'b'The news reports that President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s representatives seem to be closing in on a deal to put a half-billion-dollar presidential library and policy institute at Southern Methodist University in Dallas has inspired the predictable lame jokes and references to \xe2\x80\x9cThe Pet Goat.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But the project raises issues that are no laughing matter, touching on the writing of history, the university\xe2\x80\x99s scholarly mission, governmental integrity and the rule of law.'b'S.M.U.\xe2\x80\x99s negotiations regarding Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s library are bound to have a large public impact, which is why I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping that the university\xe2\x80\x99s president, R. Gerald Turner, and members of his board of trustees (presuming Laura Bush, the best-known trustee, has removed herself from the deliberations) can be persuaded to withhold a final go-ahead unless two basic conditions are met.'b'First, the university should insist that Mr. Bush rescind Executive Order 13233, his 2001 directive that reverses \xe2\x80\x94 illegally in the view of many leading historians, journalists and legal thinkers \xe2\x80\x94 the strong presumption of a public right of access to presidential papers embedded in the 1978 Presidential Records Act.'b'Under this early exertion of presidential power, both sitting presidents and former presidents (and even their heirs) can indefinitely postpone public release of sensitive material past the law\xe2\x80\x99s usual 12-year waiting period by simply denying a request for access. No explanation is required, and there is no provision for appealing the denial to a trained professional archivist.'b'Instead, the executive order requires the person requesting the material to begin a costly and time-consuming lawsuit challenging the stonewalling. It\xe2\x80\x99s a formula for keeping embarrassing facts secret in perpetuity and for thwarting a full and accurate accounting of a president\xe2\x80\x99s time in office, which, presumably, was among S.M.U.\xe2\x80\x99s prime goals in seeking to be home to the new presidential edifice, along with enhancing the university\xe2\x80\x99s visibility, prestige and available financial resources.'b'Mr. Turner told concerned faculty members that the new library would house \xe2\x80\x9ca treasure trove of documents and artifacts that describe one of the most intense and controversial periods in our history.\xe2\x80\x9d For a university interested in promoting historical research and open inquiry, especially one located in the president\xe2\x80\x99s home state, it\xe2\x80\x99s undoubtedly a mighty tempting prize. But that is all the more reason Mr. Turner and the trustees owe a duty to act decisively to protect the university\xe2\x80\x99s reputation, the public\xe2\x80\x99s right to know and history itself from Executive Order 13233, and Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s ignominious penchant for excessive secrecy.'b'Second, there is the pesky issue of fund-raising. Following the corruptive path blazed by White House predecessors, Mr. Bush and members of his library committee apparently plan to spend the administration\xe2\x80\x99s remaining days trying to coax huge contributions to the budding library complex from friends and well-heeled special interests. Under present law, the identity of presidential library donors, and the amounts they contribute, need not be disclosed. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, supports legislation to change that, but its timing and fate remain unclear. Meanwhile, S.M.U. officials have an opportunity to advance government integrity, and avoid entangling the university in potentially compromising secret fund-raising, by insisting on disclosure.'b'Dozens of theologians and S.M.U. faculty members have objected to locating Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s library and institute at the university, saying among other things that his awful record on civil liberties, the war in Iraq and the abuse of prisoners should preclude any university affiliation. They have it wrong. But so do those who would minimize the university\xe2\x80\x99s duty for making sure the highest standards of scholarship, openness and ethics govern the entire enterprise.'b'Connecticut does not need the neon flash of the Las Vegas Strip to make money from gambling. Consider: Nevada, with its scores of casinos, took in tax revenue of about $1 billion last year. But Connecticut\xe2\x80\x99s State Treasury took in $718 million from the lottery and just two Indian casinos.'b'There was once a time when Connecticut had a healthy caution about the negative impact of legal gambling. That is one reason that the General Assembly passed a law in 1991 requiring a statewide gambling study every five years. But just two studies were completed. Reports on the impact of gambling, which were supposed to be done regularly, have been delayed for years by a state government reluctant to examine this issue too closely.'b'The last gambling study was completed in 1996, when Foxwoods Resort Casino had been open less than five years and the Mohegan Sun Casino had just opened its doors, in October of that year. The research asserted that the number of problem gamblers in the state was anywhere from 33,000 to 76,000.'b'Both casinos have expanded significantly since. Furthermore, in 1998, the National Gambling Impact Study Commission found that pathological gambling doubles within 50 miles of a casino. So the state is overdue for a report that asks tough questions about the social cost of gambling. A relevant investigation will not stop at the impact of the casinos, of course. State lottery games, which have existed since 1972, have proliferated in recent years.'b'This year the state is finally prepared to pay for a study on the impact of gambling on Connecticut. But the $350,000 it plans to spend falls far short of the amount needed. It\xe2\x80\x99s even less than the $500,000 the state initially earmarked in 2001, before former Gov. John Rowland took money for the research out of the budget. Connecticut needs to do more than go through the motions. A price tag closer to $1 million is needed to do an adequate survey of the prevalence of problem gambling and a cost-benefit analysis of gambling.'b'Other gambling studies have shown it is much easier to measure the short-term impacts of gambling \xe2\x80\x94 like the number of jobs, tax revenue and increases in tourism \xe2\x80\x94 than the long-term impacts that Connecticut needs to measure. Gambling addiction takes years to develop, but a minority of people who cannot seem to stop gambling without intervention are at higher risk for bankruptcy, depression and committing crimes like embezzlement, and even have a greater risk of committing suicide.'b'If the state is going to take in nearly $2 million a day from gambling, the least it should do is spend a few hours of revenue in seeking the unvarnished truth about its impact.'b'New Paltz, N.Y.'b'IN his State of the State address this month, Gov. Eliot Spitzer\xe2\x80\x99s support for the consolidation of New York\xe2\x80\x99s multiple layers of local government \xe2\x80\x94 those more than 4,200 taxing jurisdictions that cost taxpayers millions each year in duplicative services \xe2\x80\x94 received relatively little notice. And yet one could argue that no reform goal is more important than the redesign of layered governing arrangements.'b'The current situation is truly bizarre. Consider two examples. We have four types of general-purpose governments performing similar functions. Every New Yorker living outside New York City supports two of these; about a sixth of us, those who live in villages as I do, pay taxes to three. There are 699 school districts of varied sizes whose boundaries often cut across these general-purpose governments, complicating tax administration and driving costs sky high.'b'The state established counties and towns to provide essential local services in rural New York. Cities and villages were chartered in response to local petition or action, in places where population concentration required more and different services. As New York\xe2\x80\x99s population grew and pushed out from heavily settled places in the last century, it was easiest for the state to meet the needs of former city dwellers by allowing towns and counties to increase their powers. Now all general-purpose governments are able to do more or less the same things.'b'New York is ranked among the highest in the nation in terms of state and local property taxes per capita. Clearly, reducing local costs through structural changes is essential to easing the tax burden. Less clear, but just as important, changing the way local government works is essential to achieving accountability. This is because the prevailing complexity makes it nearly impossible for most residents to understand which of their overlapping local governments does what.'b'There are reasons, both good and bad, why New York\xe2\x80\x99s local government arrangements are so resistant to change. Suburban and rural peoples\xe2\x80\x99 sense of community is bound up with their local governments. Localities in New York make the rules on land use. Most families\xe2\x80\x99 largest investment is in their home; changes may seem to put this investment at risk. In many rural areas, local government offers the best available jobs; structural changes could mean fewer of them. Sustaining school district boundaries in many suburban areas also reinforces a separation among races and social classes that, regrettably, some still favor. Our state is committed, at least in concept, to \xe2\x80\x9chome rule.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s why the New York constitution makes local government consolidation much harder here than in many other states.'b'I have no doubt that Mr. Spitzer is genuinely committed to local government reform. But it is hard to see why he is proposing a commission to deal with this, especially if it is made up of the usual suspects, as most such groups are. Relying upon those with a very big stake in the status quo is no route toward necessary changes.'b'Instead, the governor should gather ideas, subject them to careful research within his office, act on the executive side where he can, and make sure that needed bills are introduced into and pushed through the Legislature, while building the necessary political support to achieve change.'b'Perhaps he could set up a boundary commission to rationalize noncontiguous local government borders. Or how about a requirement that localities that fall below a certain population size periodically vote affirmatively to remain in existence? A constitutional change to make it easier to consolidate local governments or transfer functions between and among them would also help.'b'One very big idea is suggested by research recently completed by the state comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s office. In the report \xe2\x80\x9cOutdated Municipal Structures,\xe2\x80\x9d the comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s office justifies eliminating the archaic classification of local governments into cities, towns and villages. It suggests classifying these entities according to size and function \xe2\x80\x94 in other words, there would be larger urban centers, smaller urban centers, suburbs and rural governments. Once this is done, New York could recodify local government law based upon this new classification scheme, and then base all the state\xe2\x80\x99s local government assistance on these new categories, with built-in incentives and disincentives to encourage a reduction in their number.'b'There is no shortage of other good ideas. Even a few small steps could go a long way toward making local government more efficient, more democratic \xe2\x80\x94 and less expensive.'b'For a while, it seemed as if the emotional issue of how to place the names of the dead at the 9/11 memorial had finally been resolved. And for nearly everyone, including most of the 9/11 families, it has, thanks to a compromise engineered last month by Mayor Michael Bloomberg. But a small group of victims\xe2\x80\x99 families has regrettably decided to mount a public campaign against the compromise.'b'They are trying to discourage contributions to the memorial until the victims\xe2\x80\x99 names appear exactly the way they want them, listing the age, corporate affiliation and floor on which each person  worked. We fear that this effort will only add to the distress of other families who have been waiting for years for what is, after all, a public memorial.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine a group of people who have been listened to more intently than this group of family members. Their views have helped to shape or reshape nearly every aspect of the redevelopment of ground zero \xe2\x80\x94 and especially the memorial. They had George Pataki\xe2\x80\x99s ear when he was governor,  and they succeeded in shaping the debate about ground zero in ways that were sometimes polarizing. Out of respect for their loss, everyone has listened to them and tried to address their concerns.'b'But ground zero cannot be turned into a private memorial. If Cantor Fitzgerald, for example, feels it is important to create its own separate memorial to its terrible loss on that day, it should certainly do so. But the public memorial must be more expansive than that. There is a stark beauty and essential simplicity to the proposed listing of names as it now stands. It honors the nature of public memory, as well as the role the 9/11 museum will play in telling a fuller history of that day.'b'As painful as the private loss of this small group of mourners is, it must be accommodated as part of the larger public loss.'b'For those hoping for real action on global warming and energy policy, the State of the Union address was a downer. There had been hints and hopes that the speech would be a Nixon-goes-to-China moment, with President Bush turning conservationist. But it ended up being more of a Nixon-bombs-Cambodia moment.'b'Too bad: the rumors were tantalizing. Al Hubbard, the chairman of the National Economic Council, predicted \xe2\x80\x9cheadlines above the fold that will knock your socks off in terms of our commitment to energy independence.\xe2\x80\x9d British officials told the newspaper The Observer that Mr. Bush would \xe2\x80\x9cmake a historic shift in his position on global warming.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'None of it happened. Mr. Bush acknowledged that climate change is a problem, but you missed it if you sneezed. He said something vague about fuel economy, but the White House fact sheet on energy makes it clear that there was even less there than met the ear.'b'The only real substance was Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s call for a huge increase in the supply of \xe2\x80\x9calternative fuels.\xe2\x80\x9d Mainly that means using ethanol  to replace gasoline. Unfortunately, that\xe2\x80\x99s a really bad idea.'b'There is a place for ethanol in the world\xe2\x80\x99s energy future  \xe2\x80\x94  but that place is in the tropics. Brazil has managed to replace a lot of its gasoline consumption with ethanol. But Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s ethanol comes from sugar cane.'b'In the United States, ethanol comes overwhelmingly from corn, a much less suitable raw material. In fact, corn is such a poor source of ethanol that researchers at the University of Minnesota estimate that converting the entire U.S. corn crop  \xe2\x80\x94  the sum of all our ears  \xe2\x80\x94  into ethanol would replace only 12 percent of our gasoline consumption.'b'Still, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t every little bit help? Well, this little bit would come at a very high price compared with the obvious alternative  \xe2\x80\x94  conservation. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that reducing gasoline consumption 10 percent through an increase in fuel economy standards would cost producers and consumers about $3.6 billion a year. Achieving the same result by expanding ethanol production would cost taxpayers at least $10 billion a year, based on the subsidies ethanol already receives  \xe2\x80\x94  and probably much more, because expanding production would require higher subsidies.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s more, ethanol production has hidden costs. Even the Department of Energy, which is relatively optimistic, says that the net energy savings from replacing a gallon of gasoline with ethanol are only the equivalent of about a quarter of a gallon, because of the energy used to grow corn, transport it, run ethanol plants, and so on. And these energy inputs come almost entirely from fossil fuels, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear whether promoting ethanol does anything to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.'b'So why is ethanol, not conservation, the centerpiece of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s energy policy? Actually, it\xe2\x80\x99s not entirely Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s fault.'b'To be sure, at this point Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s people seem less concerned with devising good policy than with finding something, anything, for the president to talk about that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t end with the letter \xe2\x80\x9cq.\xe2\x80\x9d And the malign influence of Dick \xe2\x80\x9cSign of Personal Virtue\xe2\x80\x9d Cheney, who no  doubt still sneers at  conservation,  continues to hang over everything.'b'But even after the Bushies are gone, bad energy policy ideas will have powerful constituencies, while good ideas won\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'Subsidizing ethanol benefits two well-organized groups: corn growers and ethanol producers (especially the corporate giant Archer Daniels Midland). As a result, it\xe2\x80\x99s bad policy with bipartisan support. For example, earlier this month legislation calling for a huge increase in ethanol use was introduced by five senators, of whom four, including presidential aspirants Barack Obama and Joseph Biden, were Democrats. In a recent town meeting in Iowa, Hillary Clinton managed to mention ethanol twice, according to The Politico.'b'Meanwhile, conservation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything like the same natural political mojo. Where\xe2\x80\x99s the organized, powerful constituency for tougher fuel economy standards, a higher gasoline tax, or a cap-and-trade system on carbon dioxide emissions?'b'Can anything be done to promote good energy policy? Public education is a necessary first step, which is why Al Gore deserves all the praise he\xe2\x80\x99s getting. It would also help to have a president who got scientific advice from scientists, not oil company executives and novelists.'b'But there\xe2\x80\x99s still a huge gap between what obviously should be done and what seems politically possible. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to close that gap.'b'President Bush doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to care that Congress wants a bigger role in guiding the Iraq war. Talking about his plan to send in 20,000 additional  troops, he said on \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes\xe2\x80\x9d that he knows Congress can vote against it, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99ve made my decision and we\xe2\x80\x99re going forward.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It is hardly the first time this president has insisted that  he is \xe2\x80\x9cthe decider,\xe2\x80\x9d or even the first time he\xe2\x80\x99s used the Constitution to justify it, as Vice President Dick Cheney did when he told Fox News: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Constitution is very clear that the president is, in fact, under Article 2, the commander in chief.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But Mr. Cheney  told only half the story. Congress has war powers, too, and with 70 percent  of Americans now opposed to President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s handling of the war, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll, it is becoming more assertive about them. Congress is poised to pass a resolution denouncing the troop increase. Down the line, Congress may well consider mandatory caps on the number of troops in Iraq, or setting a date for withdrawal.'b'If it does, we may be headed toward a constitutional clash, with the administration trying to read powers into the Constitution \xe2\x80\x94 as it has with its \xe2\x80\x9cenemy combatant\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine and presidential \xe2\x80\x9csigning statements\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 that the Founders did not put there. The Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s drafters were intent on balancing power so no one branch could drift toward despotism. The system of checks and balances that runs through the document divides the war power between the president and Congress.'b'The Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s provision that the president is the commander in chief clearly puts him at the top of the military chain of command. Congress would be overstepping if, for example, it passed a law requiring generals in the field to report directly to the speaker of the House.'b'But the Constitution also gives Congress an array of war powers, including the power to \xe2\x80\x9cdeclare war,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9craise and support armies\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmake rules concerning captures on land and water.\xe2\x80\x9d By \xe2\x80\x9cdeclare war,\xe2\x80\x9d the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s framers did not mean merely firing off a starting gun. In the 18th century, war declarations were often limited in scope \xe2\x80\x94   European powers might fight a naval battle in the Americas, for example, but not  battle on their own continent. In giving Congress the power to declare war, the Constitution gives it authority to make decisions about a war\xe2\x80\x99s scope and duration.'b'The Founders, including James Madison, who is often called \xe2\x80\x9cthe father of the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d fully expected Congress to use these powers to rein in the commander in chief. \xe2\x80\x9cThe constitution supposes, what the History of all Governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of power most interested in war, and most prone to it,\xe2\x80\x9d Madison cautioned. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has accordingly with studied care, vested the question of war in the Legislature.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the early days of the republic, the Supreme Court made clear that Congress could limit the president\xe2\x80\x99s war powers \xe2\x80\x94 notably in the Flying Fish case. In 1799, during the \xe2\x80\x9cQuasi War,\xe2\x80\x9d the undeclared sea war between the United States and France, Congress authorized President John Adams to clamp down on trade between the two nations by stopping ships headed to French ports. But Adams went further, ordering commanders to stop ships that were sailing to or from a French port.'b'When the Flying Fish was seized while sailing from a French port \xe2\x80\x94 something Congress had not authorized \xe2\x80\x94 the ship\xe2\x80\x99s owner sued. The Supreme Court decided in his favor, ruling that the president had no right to issue the order he did. John Marshall, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s greatest chief justice, declared that even in a time of hostilities, a president\xe2\x80\x99s decision to act militarily beyond what Congress had authorized was \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The court has repeatedly reinforced this principle. In 1952, in the steel seizure case, it ruled that President  Harry Truman could not seize steel mills to avert a strike \xe2\x80\x94 even though steel was needed for the Korean War \xe2\x80\x94 because Congress had set out a different way of handling the labor unrest. More recently, in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, it held that President Bush must follow Congressional guidelines when he sets up military tribunals for detainees.'b'Past Congresses have enacted just the sort of restrictions the Bush administration is trying to foreclose today. During the Vietnam War, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1974 capped the number of American military personnel in South Vietnam at 4,000 within six months. The Lebanon Emergency Assistance Act of 1983 required the president to get Congress\xe2\x80\x99s approval for any substantial increase in the number or role of armed forces in Lebanon.'b'There is little question that Congress could use its power of the purse to end a war. But cutting off financing is a drastic step, and one that members of Congress are understandably reluctant to take, because it can look like a refusal to support the troops. The Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s text, Supreme Court cases and history show, however, that Congress can instead pass laws that set the terms of military engagement. Whether it would be wise for Congress to adopt such limits is debatable; whether it has the authority to do so should not be.'b'The Bush administration insists that if Congress tries to manage the Iraq war, it will leave the commander in chief with too little authority. But the greater danger is the one Madison recognized at the nation\xe2\x80\x99s founding \xe2\x80\x94 that all the power will be left with the person \xe2\x80\x9cmost interested in war, and most prone to it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cThe Mystery of the Chinese Baby Shortage,\xe2\x80\x9d by Beth Nonte Russell (Op-Ed, Jan. 23):'b'When I visited Wanxian, China, in the fall of 2005, I talked to local Chinese and visited an orphanage. One couple I spoke with had been relocated from the banks of the Yangtze River with their village and were happy and thriving with the relocation. They approved of the one-child policy, and with a son in college were now financially able to adopt a little girl.'b'In other parts of China, I discovered that families were financially better off than they were when I visited seven years earlier, and they also supported the one-child policy and were adopting the little girls.'b'Local Chinese have been embarrassed by the adoption of children by  other countries, and take pride in stemming that activity and keeping little girls in China, where they strongly feel they belong.'b'Carole Hite Welch'b'Hershey, Pa., Jan. 23, 2007'b'\xc2\x95'b'To the Editor:'b'In \xe2\x80\x9cThe Mystery of the Chinese Baby Shortage,\xe2\x80\x9d Beth Nonte Russell asserts that the one-child policy is inhumane, and if revoked, all the suffering and abandonment would cease,  resulting in the end of China\xe2\x80\x99s international adoption program.'b'I am the coordinator of a China adoption program. Unfortunately, what Ms. Russell does not seem to consider is that China is a country with 1.3 billion people, and without population control, this booming economy would be overwhelmed by the need for jobs and food already difficult for some to procure within an even larger population.'b'While it is irrefutable that the one-child policy has resulted in thousands of abandoned children, many of them have found loving, supportive homes. Without the policy, these very same children would likely face starvation and lives of little potential.

The suggestion to scrap the policy, however, does not seem to address the root of the problem: the cultural preference for male children.'b'I find it na\xc3\xafve to assume that eliminating the one-child policy will significantly reduce the incidence of female infanticide short of major cultural changes, and even if it does, there will be that many more unwanted female infants born who will likely not receive the same degree of nurturing and attention as their male counterparts.'b'I offer no suggestions as to how to transform a society\xe2\x80\x99s cultural beliefs regarding the \xe2\x80\x9cvalue\xe2\x80\x9d of female children, but short of such a transformation, any revision to the one-child policy will be purely cosmetic.'b'Brandon Wilkening'b'Bloomington, Ind., Jan. 24, 2007'b'Modern DNA testing is steadily uncovering a dark history of justice denied. More than 190 DNA exonerations in 18 years show ever more alarming patterns of citizens, wrongly convicted, suffering in prison. Consider the eight felons finally exonerated through DNA challenges in New York State in just the last 13 months. Or the 12 people who had to fight long and hard to prove their innocence in Dallas County, Tex., alone in the past five years.

Calls to create commissions in New York and Texas are bogged down in statehouse politics, even as a half-dozen other states are poised to create their own monitors.'b'The most recent exonerations show how much such commissions are needed. In Dallas, a prisoner was finally proved innocent  after laboring for 18 years to win the right to DNA testing and disprove a rape conviction based solely on faulty testimony of a witness. (North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s innocence commission, led by the state\xe2\x80\x99s chief justice, has already called for police investigators to vet witnesses more carefully.) In New York, a man who spent 15 years in prison on a murder conviction not only proved his innocence, but also  tracked the actual murderer through DNA with the help of the Innocence Project at the Benjamin Cardozo School of Law.'b'No one knows the depth of injustice hinted at by DNA exonerations. But it is clear that they demand organized oversight and serious reforms of the criminal justice system.'b'In the old days, presidential races were one-year events. John F. Kennedy announced his candidacy on Jan. 2, 1960, and was elected that November. Earlier this month, would-be candidates who were still deciding whether to run in 2008 were being accused of reckless delay. Presidential campaign pundits were saying that if Senator Hillary Clinton had waited another minute to announce,  Senator Barack Obama would have locked up every New Hampshire county committee member and hedge fund billionaire.'b'This really is an election on hyperspeed.'b'Part of this is due to the peculiarities of the race. President Bush is so unpopular that a power vacuum is opening up in Washington and, for the first time in many election cycles, both parties\xe2\x80\x99 nominations are wide open. The Internet is also fueling the overdrive, with \xe2\x80\x9cnetroots primaries,\xe2\x80\x9d in which the voting has already begun.'b'The biggest factors, though, are money and an ever-compressed schedule. California, Illinois, Florida and New Jersey are all maneuvering to move up their primaries to next February. That has candidates rushing to lock up the big donors \xe2\x80\x94 and bypassing the public finance system. Senator Clinton has already made clear that she will be opting out for both the primary and the general election. Senator John McCain, a major supporter of campaign finance reform who is no longer sponsoring a big reform bill that  once bore his name, seems likely to do the same, with many candidates to follow. The problem with the 23-month campaign is not just the fatigue it will inspire, but the effect on democracy. Bundlers \xe2\x80\x94 master fund-raisers who package individual contributions into big ones \xe2\x80\x94 will have even more power. There is no way to stop candidates from hurling their hats into the ring so early. But there are things that can, and should, be done.'b'The national parties should stop the states\xe2\x80\x99 mad race to have first-in-the-nation primaries. They should adopt a schedule that reformers have been proposing for years: regional primaries that rotate, so that voters in every state eventually have a turn to be among the first to vote. Congress should fix the broken public financing system, which has not been significantly updated since it was adopted in 1974. Spending limits need to be raised, to keep pace with ever-rising costs. More money needs to be put in the fund, and there should be more flexibility to help candidates who accept public financing compete against big-money candidates who opt out.'b'If Hillary vs. Obama vs. Rudy vs. McCain is already starting to feel old, remember that there are more than 600  days to go. We will never return to the time when presidential campaigns unfolded handshake by handshake in New Hampshire \xe2\x80\x94 and we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x94 but Congress and the national parties can set a more thoughtful 21st-century pace.'b'Washington'b'It was a few minutes after 11 a.m. when the scattered crowd began moving slowly toward the stage at the end of the Mall. The sky was a beautiful sunlit blue and the Capitol building, huge and white and majestic, offered the protesters an emotional backdrop that seemed almost close enough to touch.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so big,\xe2\x80\x9d said a woman from Milwaukee, who was there with her husband and two children. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s lovely.

But you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t walk among them for more than a few minutes on Saturday without realizing that they love their country as much as anyone ever has. They love it enough to try to save it.'b'By 11:15 I thought there was a chance that the march against the war would be a bust. There just weren\xe2\x80\x99t that many people moving toward the stage to join the rally that preceded the march. But the crowd kept building, slowly, steadily. It was a good-natured crowd. Everyone was bad-mouthing the Bush administration and the war, but everybody seemed to be smiling.'b'There were gray-haired women with digital cameras and young girls with braces. There were guys trying to look cool in knit caps and shades and balding baby boomers trading stories about Vietnam. And many ordinary families.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Hillary?\xe2\x80\x9d someone asked.'b'That evoked laughter in the crowd. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s in Iowa running for president,\xe2\x80\x9d someone said.'b'When a woman asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s her position on the war?\xe2\x80\x9d a man standing next to her cracked, \xe2\x80\x9cShe was for it before she was against it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'More laughter.'b'The crowd kept building. There were people being pushed in wheelchairs and babies in strollers. There were elderly men and women, walking very slowly in some cases and holding hands.'b'The goal of the crowd was to get the attention of Congress and persuade it to move vigorously to reverse the Bush war policies. But the thought that kept returning as I watched the earnestly smiling faces, so many of them no longer young, was the way these protesters had somehow managed to keep the faith. They still believed, after all the years and all the lies, that they could make a difference. They still believed their government would listen to them and respond.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have to believe in this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Donna Norton of Petaluma, Calif. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a daughter in the reserves and a son-in-law on active duty. I feel very, very strongly about this.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Betty and Peter Vinten-Johansen of East Lansing, Mich., said they felt obliged to march, believing that they could bolster the resolve of opponents of the war in Congress. Glancing toward the Capitol, Mr. Vinten-Johansen said, \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe we can strengthen their backbone a little bit.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Even the celebrities who have been at this sort of thing for decades have managed to escape the debilitating embrace of cynicism. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you be cynical?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Tim Robbins, just before he mounted the stage to address the crowd, which by that time had grown to more than 100,000.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is inspiring,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the real voice of the American people, and when you hear that collective voice protesting freely it reminds you of the greatness of our country. It gives you hope.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When Jane Fonda said, \xe2\x80\x9cSilence is no longer an option,\xe2\x80\x9d she was doing more than expressing the outrage of the crowd over the carnage in Iraq and the president\xe2\x80\x99s decision to escalate American involvement. She was implicitly re-asserting her belief in the effectiveness of citizen action.'b'Ms. Fonda is approaching 70 now and was at the march with her two grandchildren. It was very touching to watch her explain how she had declined to participate in antiwar marches for 34 years because she was afraid her notoriety would harm rather than help the effort.'b'The public is way out in front of the politicians on this issue. But the importance of Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s march does not lie primarily in whether it hastens a turnaround of U.S. policy on the war. The fact that so many Americans were willing to travel from every region of the country to march against the war was a reaffirmation of the public\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to our peaceful democratic processes.'b'It is in that unique and unflagging commitment, not in our terrifying military power, that the continued promise and greatness of America are to be found.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cThe President\xe2\x80\x99s Risky Health Plan\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 26):'b'Forty-seven million uninsured Americans is not only a crisis, it is also a scandal.'b'A crisis calls for a response that is equal to the seriousness of the problem, not a half-baked proposal like the one announced by President Bush on Tuesday.'b'Even if his tax-cut plan were enacted and the number of uninsured was reduced by three million to five million, the potential estimated by White House officials, we would still have a crisis.'b'Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s plan would be tantamount to treating cancer with a Band-Aid.

Yes, New York had a lot of crime, but somehow it also still had neighborhoods, and a core that had never been completely abandoned to the car. Lately, though, as far as pedestrian issues go, New York is acting more like the rest of America, and the rest of America is acting more like the once-inspiring New York.'b'As a New Yorker who has spent two years researching roads and transportation across the United States, I am saddened to see our city falling behind places like downtown Albuquerque, where one-way streets have become more pedestrian-friendly two-way streets, and car lanes are replaced by bike lanes, with bike racks everywhere.'b'Then there is Grand Rapids, Mich., which has a walkable downtown with purposely limited parking and is home to a new bus plaza that is part of a mass transit renaissance in Michigan. The state is investing in high-speed trains, and it is even talking about a mass transit system for the nation\xe2\x80\x99s auto-capital, Detroit, where a new pedestrian plaza anchors downtown. In Indianapolis, an urban walking and biking trail will soon link inner-city neighborhoods \xe2\x80\x94 something New York certainly hasn\xe2\x80\x99t tried.'b'We have lost our golden pedestrian touch in New York mostly because we still think about traffic as though it were 1950, and we needed Robert Moses to plow a few giant freeways through town to get the cars moving again. But the fact is that more roads equal more traffic.'b'London now charges drivers a fee to enter the core business area, but here such initiatives are branded as anti-car, and thus anti-personal freedom: a congestion fee, critics say, is a tax on the middle-class car commuter. But as matters now stand, the pedestrian is taxed every day: by delays and emissions, by asthma rates that are (in the Bronx) as much as four times the national average. Though we think of it as a luxury, the car taxes us, and with it we tax others.'b'And yet, here in New York, we even have the debate over bicycle traffic backwards. We focus on drivers\xe2\x80\x99 complaints about the bicycle commuter who races through red lights, rather than on the concerns of the mother biking her child around organic-food delivery trucks that idle in bike-only lanes. In December, the police say, a bicyclist was killed on the Hudson River Greenway by a drunken driver speeding along a bike lane that was completely separated from the road. Asked what was being done to improve safety in light of the biker\xe2\x80\x99s death, Mayor Michael Bloomberg suggested that bikers \xe2\x80\x9cpay attention.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEven if they\xe2\x80\x99re in the right, they are the lightweights,\xe2\x80\x9d he told a reporter.'b'Contrast this response with that of Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago after a 4-year-old pedestrian was killed in a hit and run. Mayor Daley immediately set up a pedestrian awareness program, suggested that police sting operations arrest speeding drivers and proposed to add 500 miles of bike lanes, so that there would be one within a half-mile of every resident.'b'One reason New York is losing its New York edge may be that the city\xe2\x80\x99s revival is partly based on a strange reversal: the city is the new suburb. Families have returned to the New York that was abandoned years ago for lawns and better public schools. They\xe2\x80\x99ve brought with them a love of cars. A new study by Bruce Schaller, a local transportation consultant, shows that half the drivers in Manhattan are from the city \xe2\x80\x94 and that more city residents than suburbanites drive to work every day.'b'New Yorkers always find good reasons to drive. Public transportation is dirty, time-consuming, a hassle, unsafe. Walking takes too long. The children will be late for school. But choosing the car is no longer safe \xe2\x80\x94 for your children who already don\xe2\x80\x99t get enough exercise, for anyone\xe2\x80\x99s lungs or for the future of New York as a livable place. There are even such things as secondhand driving effects: studies show that people who live on high-traffic streets tend to stay inside.'b'The simple and elegant cure for the loss of New York\xe2\x80\x99s inner pedestrian is to open up car-clogged streets and public spaces. Another of Mr. Schaller\xe2\x80\x99s surveys, sponsored by the citizens\xe2\x80\x99 group Transportation Alternatives, showed that 89 percent of people questioned on Prince Street in SoHo got there by subway, bus, foot or bicycle, and that the majority would gladly give up parking for more pedestrian space.'b'With a million more New Yorkers scheduled to arrive by 2030, true sustainability requires the city \xe2\x80\x94 or at least its residents \xe2\x80\x94 to make a bold move. Some neighborhoods are already working on it. The Ninth Avenue Renaissance Project, sponsored by a coalition of residents and businesses, has held community workshops on converting Ninth Avenue from Lincoln Tunnel access ramp to boulevard.'b'The now chic Meatpacking District plans to bring back a space that, since  the area was a Native American village, has been a natural gathering place for people without combustion engines: wider sidewalks, public seating and a piazza in the restaurant-surrounded open field of paving stones  could be more like Campo dei Fiori in Rome and less a spot for crazed U-turns. In Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the city\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Transportation has replaced parking spaces near a subway station with rows of bike racks.'b'But these are tiny steps. Boston\xe2\x80\x99s mayor has endorsed converting Hanover Street in the city\xe2\x80\x99s North End into a car-free pedestrian mall. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we do the same in part or even all of SoHo? In Los Angeles, some traffic lights are programmed to change for approaching buses (a signal in the bus alerts the light). Why can\xe2\x80\x99t the same happen on 14th Street?'b'And if Boulder, Baltimore, Sacramento, San Diego, Denver, Houston, Dallas, Portland, Ore., and Bergen County in New Jersey can build light rails, then why can\xe2\x80\x99t New York finally put one on 42nd Street? Times Square could be the Crossroads of People instead of the Crossroads of Car Congestion.'b'These are relatively cheap changes \xe2\x80\x94 in some cases, they require just a couple of sawhorses. And New York\xe2\x80\x99s walkability is crucial to its character, no small part of which is its relative freedom from America\xe2\x80\x99s plague of strip malls. The great shame of the 22-acre Atlantic Yards mega-development in Brooklyn is that it seems like something out of Atlanta in the 1990s.'b'Not today\xe2\x80\x99s Atlanta.

'b''b''b''b'To the Editor:'b'In Maureen Dowd\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Jan. 17 column'b', I feel that the statement that Henry A. Kissinger \xe2\x80\x9cis working on an official biography of himself with Mr. Horne\xe2\x80\x9d is liable to misinterpretation.'b'To avoid any ambiguity, I would like to set the record right.'b'What has actually been accepted between Dr. Kissinger, my publishers, Simon and Schuster, and me concerning the book that I have been commissioned to write about Dr. Kissinger in the year 1973 is as follows:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDr. Kissinger has agreed to give Alistair Horne complete access and cooperation for his book, but has no editorial control over it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That is the full extent of his involvement.'b'Alistair Horne'b'\nTurville, England, Jan. 29, 2007'b''b'Washington'b'OF all the crises facing the new United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, the fraying nuclear nonproliferation system is arguably the most consequential. Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, has warned of 30 \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual new weapons states\xe2\x80\x9d on the horizon. Obviously, the more countries that possess the bomb, the higher the risk of a nuclear accident, the theft of a weapon, sales of technology and hardware, and a serious miscalculation leading to nuclear war.'b'So where should Mr. Ban start? With North Korea having declared after its test last October that it now possesses a nuclear deterrent, the understandable temptation will be to focus on Iran. This would be a mistake. North Korea is still some way off from having a reliable nuclear weapon, and to accept its having this capacity as a fait accompli would not only play into its game plan but also convince Iran and other countries that the international community lacks the will to prevent them from developing the bomb. A new approach is required.'b'The logical place to look is to examine the lessons of \xe2\x80\x9cnuclear reversal\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 that is, what has made states in the past give up the nuclear option. At first glance, the historical record doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look encouraging: South Africa is the only country that has developed nuclear weapons and then destroyed them. Yet other nations have abandoned advanced research programs \xe2\x80\x94 including Australia, Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, Sweden and Taiwan \xe2\x80\x94 or, like Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, given up the nuclear arsenals they inherited from the Soviet Union. One big reason for these countries\xe2\x80\x99 decisions, not surprisingly, was the efforts of major powers to reassure them about their long-term security, so that nuclear weapons offered no appreciable benefit.'b'How would this approach be applied to North Korea? The answer is not unilateral assurances from the United States. American officials have vowed many times that they harbor no hostile intent; repeating that mantra will not make it any more credible to Pyongyang. Similar guarantees from all five of the permanent members of the Security Council, however, could be more persuasive. Enter Mr. Ban.'b'The diplomatic vehicle for such security assurances would be a United Nations-sponsored initiative to formally end the Korean War and dismantle the present armistice arrangements. As part of a peace treaty, the principal signatories \xe2\x80\x94 the United States, China and the two Koreas \xe2\x80\x94 would commit themselves to establishing normal diplomatic relations, recognizing the territorial integrity of both Koreas and, most important, ensuring a nuclear-free peninsula.'b'To sweeten the deal, the Security Council\xe2\x80\x99s permanent five would extend security guarantees, similar to those given Ukraine, to both Koreas. These would remain in effect as long as each side fulfilled its nonproliferation commitment. If one or the other reneged, all bets would be off.'b'Complementary agreements involving conventional arms control, economic assistance, access to international financial institutions and humanitarian aid could also be discussed, but not as prerequisites for replacing the Korean armistice with a permanent peace settlement.'b'The United States has already signaled its willingness to sign a peace treaty \xe2\x80\x94 but only after North Korea verifiably dismantled its nuclear weapons. Reversing the order, however, with upfront but still conditional security guarantees, would provide North Korea with immediate incentives to take the first step.'b'For Mr. Ban, such an agreement would be not only a gift to his native Korea but a much-needed boost to his organization\xe2\x80\x99s stature. Above all else, he might just save the nonproliferation system by using the same approach elsewhere, not least with Iran.'b'Once upon a time, asking about someone\xe2\x80\x99s children was like talking about the weather. Then again, once upon a time talking about the weather was also like talking about the weather \xe2\x80\x94 not a portal into the political or the apocalyptic. But that\xe2\x80\x99s another story.

Mr. Webb didn\xe2\x80\x99t really mean to answer, either. Evidently, he meant to slug the president.'b'Last week Wolf Blitzer asked Dick Cheney about his pregnant lesbian daughter.

But what Letitia Baldrige said of the Webb encounter \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cIt was an uncivil reply to an uncivil remark\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 does not apply equally to the vice president. Mr. Cheney has openly promoted an anti-gay agenda. His own base has called his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s pregnancy unconscionable. Family values have been his calling card. And our Prohibitionist vice president can\xe2\x80\x99t summon the courage to address the gin mill in the basement?'b'Mr. Webb was rude on principle; Mr. Cheney rude out of hypocrisy. One man took a stand. The other scurried away.'b'What the vice president\xe2\x80\x99s nonresponse did deliver was a very cogent message: the rules apply to you, but not to us. It\xe2\x80\x99s our privacy, your patriotism; our delusion, your sacrifice; our tax cuts, your kids. After all, as Mr. Cheney so tellingly said of his Republican critics, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the vice president, and they\xe2\x80\x99re not.\xe2\x80\x9d The part for which some of us have no stomach is the sense of entitlement.'b'An annoying thing about children is that they nudge you toward the high road and the long view. They demand pesky things like open-mindedness, self-denial, accountability, leadership and occasionally even integrity \xe2\x80\x94 qualities that appear to have packed up and gone home with Hans Blix. Once upon a time, you might have termed them family values.'b'So as to spare Mr. Cheney any further misadventures in this minefield, I did a little research for him. Several years ago, Ms. Baldrige foresaw his predicament. \xe2\x80\x9cA lesbian\xe2\x80\x99s parents may be the victims of probing, mean questions from their friends,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cHopefully, they will answer unequivocally that they stand by their child and accept her decision.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As for gay and lesbian couples, they are families, too, in Ms. Baldrige\xe2\x80\x99s book.

Is there not a lesson here, for the president and the Democratic Congress, that is applicable to Iraq?'b'The Beirut face-off is the follow-up to last summer\xe2\x80\x99s war, in which Hezbollah, the Shiite party supported by Syria and Iran, held off the more powerful Israelis long enough to achieve a United Nations cease-fire on favorable terms. Now Hezbollah  challenges the government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, which is supported by the bulk of Lebanon\xe2\x80\x99s Sunni, Christian and Druse population, as well as the United States.'b'Hezbollah seeks to upset the fragile balance to which Lebanon\xe2\x80\x99s sectarian forces agreed in 1989 under Arab League mediation. At that time, the Arab League\xe2\x80\x99s goal was to prevent the chaos in Lebanon from spreading to the wider Arab world. That remains the league\xe2\x80\x99s goal today, both in Lebanon and in Iraq. But it also has another concern: with Tehran\xe2\x80\x99s regional power rising, the Arab League has a deep interest in keeping both countries in the Arab sphere, free of Iranian domination.'b'The United States finds itself increasingly unable to stem the violence in Iraq, and it seems unlikely that a surge of troops will strengthen American influence. American negotiators have not won the confidence of Sunnis or Shiites, the principal combatants, nor even of Kurds, the uneasy bystanders. Mr. Bush may still consider himself a liberator, but among Iraqis there is a widespread feeling that his invasion was just the latest crime of Western imperialism.'b'Curiously, the Iraq Study Group, in acknowledging Iraqi distrust of the United States, suggested a greater diplomatic role for Syria and Iran, the very countries that have an interest in Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s instability. Though better relations with these two countries might be in Washington\xe2\x80\x99s long-term interest, they are surely not going to help matters in Iraq.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s where the Arab League comes in.

They forget that the bulk of the Iraqi Army that defeated Iran in the 1980-88 war was Shiite. This fact alone tells us that Iraqi Shiites, much as they want to be rid of the American occupation, are not ready to become Iranian. The Arab League can work from this premise to restore Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s stability. The United States cannot.'b'The Arab League\xe2\x80\x99s Baghdad offices are recognized by the Shiite government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, has strongly supported Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s involvement with the Arab League. Amr Moussa, the Arab League\xe2\x80\x99s secretary general, has had an open door not just to Iraqi officials but also to Moktada al-Sadr, the radical Shiite leader, and to Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the country\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful cleric, who has never received an American official. The Iraqi foreign minister, a Kurd, has participated regularly in Arab League meetings.'b'To be sure, the Arab League cannot offer miracles.

But with an invitation from the American president, it could immediately get to work at mediating the conflict.'b'If the objective is political stability and national reconciliation in Iraq, neither President Bush nor the Democratic Congress has a more promising option.'b'Canada set an important example of decency when it offered a formal apology and compensation worth millions of dollars to a Syrian-born Canadian citizen who was a victim of President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s use of open-ended detention, summary deportation and even torture in the name of fighting terrorism.'b'Last week\xe2\x80\x99s announcement by Prime Minister Stephen Harper came  more than four  years after the nightmare began for the Canadian, Maher Arar, a 36-year-old software engineer. On his way back from a family vacation, he was detained by U.S. officials at Kennedy Airport on the basis of unsubstantiated information from the Canadian police. After being held in solitary confinement in a Brooklyn detention center and interrogated without proper access to legal counsel, he was sent to Syria, where he was imprisoned for nearly a year and tortured.'b'It was all part of a legally and morally unsupportable practice known as extraordinary rendition, the deportation of terrorism suspects to countries where the regimes are known to use torture and to disdain basic human rights protections.'b'Four months ago, a Canadian government panel concluded that Mr. Arar had never had a terrorism connection, and that Americans had misled Canada about their plans for him. The Bush administration stonewalled the inquiry. It has responded to a new Canadian request to remove Mr. Arar from a United States security watch list by rudely telling Canada, its democratic northern neighbor and strategic ally, to mind its own business.'b'Not only has the Bush administration refused to apologize to Mr. Arar, but Justice Department lawyers are also brandishing a dubious claim of state secrets and fighting a lawsuit brought by Mr. Arar in this country. Bush administration officials insist that they have \xe2\x80\x9cnew intelligence\xe2\x80\x9d that justifies keeping Mr. Arar on the watch list. That intelligence has not been disclosed, but Canadian officials who have reviewed the information are unpersuaded.'b'Questioned about the Arar case at a recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales provided no specifics that would explain Mr. Arar\xe2\x80\x99s continued presence on the watch list, or why he had been deported to Syria in the first place.

After an injury like that, most racehorses would have been put down minutes later. But every race is a complex equation \xe2\x80\x94 a balance of economics, athleticism, equine grace and conscience. Conscience often comes in last, but not in this case. Barbaro\xe2\x80\x99s owners gave that horse exactly what he had given them, which is everything.

Rather than requiring companies to meet an average fuel-efficiency standard, balancing gas savers against gas guzzlers, he would assign targets model by model, based on factors like size and weight.'b'As for what those new targets might be, Mr. Bush would leave it to his secretary of transportation to decide. And he asked the country to take it on faith that this new measurement system, combined with technological advances, would lead to annual mileage improvements of 4 percent a year.'b'Our fear is that this program will take far too long to get going, if it gets going at all. Like Congress, the Transportation Department has been notoriously solicitous of the automobile industry.'b'But there\xe2\x80\x99s a way Congress can get moving. Senator Barack Obama plans to reintroduce a bill that would set a 4 percent annual increase in efficiency as a target, just what Mr. Bush says he wants. The bill would also give both the Transportation Department and the manufacturers considerable flexibility. But the department could not deviate from the target unless it could demonstrate that the costs outweighed the benefits.'b'Even that is too much wiggle room for lawmakers like Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Edward Markey. While allowing for administrative flexibility, they would require a firm fleetwide standard of 35 m.p.g. with no escape hatches. But given the long Congressional stalemate, the Obama bill could be an important first step. It commands some bipartisan support, and unlike Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s approach, it promises real as opposed to hypothetical results.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOf Gay Sheep, Modern Science and Bad Publicity\xe2\x80\x9d'b' (front page, Jan. 25):'b'Dr. Chuck Roselli\xe2\x80\x99s research on homosexual rams is not a homophobic experiment but solid, groundbreaking science.'b'Dr. Roselli has taken advantage of a natural variation in the behavior of rams to find out how brains modulate sexual behavior and mate choice.'b'His experiment provides insight into how mate preference of any sort is formed, homosexual as well as heterosexual.'b'The idea that Dr. Roselli\xe2\x80\x99s research is aimed at preventing homosexuality or increasing discrimination against homosexuals is baffling.

They were right.  Norman Charles'b'New York, Jan. 30, 2007'b'On Election Day last fall in Maryland, fliers were handed out in black neighborhoods with the heading \xe2\x80\x9cDemocratic Sample Ballot\xe2\x80\x9d and photos of black Democratic leaders \xe2\x80\x94 and boxes checked off beside the names of the Republican candidates for senator and governor. They were a blatant attempt to fool black voters into thinking the Republican candidates were endorsed by black Democrats. In Orange County, Calif., 14,000 Latino voters got letters in Spanish saying it was a crime for immigrants to vote in a federal election. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that immigrants who are citizens have the right to vote.'b'Dirty tricks like these turn up every election season, in large part because they are so rarely punished. But two Democratic senators, Barack Obama of Illinois and Charles Schumer of New York, are introducing a bill today that would make deceiving or intimidating voters a federal crime with substantial penalties.'b'The bill aims at some of the most commonly used deceptive political tactics. It makes it a crime to knowingly tell voters the wrong day for an election. There have been numerous reports of organized efforts to use telephones, leaflets or posters to tell voters, especially in minority areas, not to vote on Election Day because voting has been postponed.'b'The bill would also criminalize making false claims to voters about who has endorsed a candidate, or wrongly telling people \xe2\x80\x94 like immigrants who are registered voters in Orange County \xe2\x80\x94 that they cannot vote.'b'Along with defining these crimes and providing penalties of up to five years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment, the bill would require the Justice Department to counteract deceptive election information that has been put out, and to report to Congress after each election on what deceptive practices occurred and what the Justice Department did about them.'b'The bill would also allow individuals to go to court to stop deceptive practices while they are happening. That is important, given how uninterested the current Justice Department has proved to be in cracking down on election-season dirty tricks.'b'The bill is careful to avoid infringing on First Amendment rights, and that is the right course. But in steering clear of regulating speech, it is not clear how effective the measure would be in addressing one of the worst dirty tricks of last fall\xe2\x80\x99s election: a particular kind of deceptive \xe2\x80\x9crobocall\xe2\x80\x9d that was used against Democratic Congressional candidates. These calls, paid for by the Republicans, sounded as if they had come from the Democrat; when a recipient hung up, the call was repeated over and over. The intent was clearly to annoy the recipients so they would not vote for the Democrat.'b'While there are already laws that can be used against this sort of deceptive telephone harassment, a more specific bill aimed directly at these calls is needed. But the bill being introduced today is an important step toward making elections more honest and fair. There is no reason it should not be passed by Congress unanimously.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s a little foreign policy test. I am going to describe two countries \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cCountry A\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCountry B\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and you tell me which one is America\xe2\x80\x99s ally and which one is not.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s start: Country A actively helped the U.S. defeat the Taliban in Afghanistan and replace it with a pro-U.S. elected alliance of moderate Muslims. Country A regularly holds sort-of-free elections. Country A\xe2\x80\x99s women vote, hold office, are the majority of its university students and are fully integrated into the work force.'b'On 9/11, residents of Country A were among the very few in the Muslim world to hold spontaneous pro-U.S. demonstrations. Country A\xe2\x80\x99s radical president recently held a conference about why the Holocaust never happened \xe2\x80\x94 to try to gain popularity. A month later, Country A held nationwide elections for local councils, and that same president saw his candidates get wiped out by voters who preferred more moderate conservatives. Country A has a strategic interest in the success of the pro-U.S., Shiite-led, elected Iraqi government. Although it\xe2\x80\x99s a Muslim country right next to Iraq, Country A has never sent any suicide bombers to Iraq, and has long protected its Christians and Jews. Country A has more bloggers per capita than any country in the Muslim Middle East.'b'The brand of Islam practiced by Country A respects women, is open to reinterpretation in light of modernity and rejects Al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s nihilism.'b'Now Country B: Country B gave us 15 of the 19 hijackers on 9/11. Country B does not allow its women to drive, vote or run for office. It is illegal in Country B to build a church, synagogue or Hindu temple. Country B helped finance the Taliban.'b'Country B\xe2\x80\x99s private charities help sustain Al Qaeda. Young men from Country B\xe2\x80\x99s mosques have been regularly recruited to carry out suicide bombings in Iraq. Mosques and charities in Country B raise funds to support the insurgency in Iraq. Country B does not want the elected, Shiite-led government in Iraq to succeed. While Country B\xe2\x80\x99s leaders are pro-U.S., polls show many of its people are hostile to America \xe2\x80\x94 some of them celebrated on 9/11. The brand of Islam supported by Country B and exported by it to mosques around the world is the most hostile to modernity and other faiths.'b'Question: Which country is America\xe2\x80\x99s natural ally: A or B?'b'Country A is, of course. Country A is Iran. Country B is Saudi Arabia.'b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. I know that Iran has also engaged in terrorism against the U.S. and that the Saudis have supported America at key times in some areas. The point I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to make, though, is that the hostility between Iran and the U.S. since the overthrow of the shah in 1979 is not organic. By dint of culture, history and geography, we actually have a lot of interests in common with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s people. And I am not the only one to notice that.'b'Because the U.S. has destroyed Iran\xe2\x80\x99s two biggest enemies \xe2\x80\x94 the Taliban and Saddam \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cthere is now a debate in Iran as to whether we should continue to act so harshly against the Americans,\xe2\x80\x9d Mohammad Hossein Adeli, Iran\xe2\x80\x99s former ambassador to London, told me at Davos. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is now more readiness for dialogue with the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'More important, when people say, \xe2\x80\x9cThe most important thing America could do today to stabilize the Middle East is solve the Israel-Palestine conflict,\xe2\x80\x9d they are wrong. It\xe2\x80\x99s second. The most important thing would be to resolve the Iran-U.S. conflict.'b'That would change the whole Middle East and open up the way to solving the Israel-Palestine conflict, because Iran is the key backer of Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah and Syria. Iran\xe2\x80\x99s active help could also be critical for stabilizing Iraq.'b'This is why I oppose war with Iran. I favor negotiations. Isolating Iran like Castro\xe2\x80\x99s Cuba has produced only the same result as in Cuba: strengthening Iran\xe2\x80\x99s Castros. But for talks with Iran to bear fruit, we have to negotiate with Iran 'b'with leverage'b'.'b'How do we get leverage? Make it clear that Iran can\xe2\x80\x99t push us out of the gulf militarily; bring down the price of oil, which is key to the cockiness of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s hard-line leadership; squeeze the hard-liners financially. But all this has to be accompanied with a clear declaration that the U.S. is not seeking regime change in Iran, but a change of behavior, that the U.S. wants to immediately restore its embassy in Tehran and that the first thing it will do is grant 50,000 student visas for young Iranians to study at U.S. universities.'b'Just do that \xe2\x80\x94 and then sit back and watch the most amazing debate explode inside Iran. You can bet the farm on it.'b'To the Editor:'b'As one who has \xe2\x80\x9csliced the bread\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbroken the matzo\xe2\x80\x9d many times, I applaud Calvin Trillin\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant \xe2\x80\x9cPark, He Said\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Jan. 26), about parallel parking.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve been obsessed with the subject since I first learned to park behind the wheel of a 1979 manual-shift Dodge Aspen station wagon.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99d like to share with Mr. Trillin another uniquely New York maneuver that I\xe2\x80\x99ve termed \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9crocking the baby to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d In this case, once parked, the car\xe2\x80\x99s bumpers are pressed directly against both the vehicle in front and behind, leaving not even enough space to slide a piece of paper between.'b'It requires a gentle push, and a back and forth rocking motion that when executed properly does not leave a scratch on either bumper.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not, however, for the faint of heart and should be exercised only under extreme duress \xe2\x80\x94 say 45 minutes into looking for a free space.'b'Noah Samton'b'New York, Jan. 26, 2007'b'\xc2\x95'b'To the Editor:'b'If, as Calvin Trillin suspects, Lexus\xe2\x80\x99s Advanced Parking Guidance System spawns a generation of self-parking one-upmanship among competing manufacturers, let\xe2\x80\x99s just hope that it never gets to the point where an antagonistic vehicle activates its own auto defense system and mimics the driver\xe2\x80\x99s baser nature by resorting to violence to secure that all-too-rare spot.

Had the president been an ordinary  citizen \xe2\x80\x94 someone charged with bank robbery or income tax evasion \xe2\x80\x94 the wheels of justice would have immediately begun to turn. The F.B.I. would have conducted  an investigation, a United States attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office would have impaneled a grand jury and charges would have been brought.'b'But under the Bush Justice Department, no F.B.I. agents were ever dispatched to padlock White House files or knock on doors and no federal prosecutors ever opened a case.'b'The ruling was the result of a suit, in which I am one of the plaintiffs, brought against the National Security Agency by the American Civil Liberties Union. It was a response to revelations by this newspaper  in December 2005 that the agency had been monitoring the phone calls and e-mail  messages of Americans for more than four years without first obtaining warrants from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, as required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.'b'In the past, even presidents were not above the law. When the F.B.I. turned up evidence during Watergate that Richard Nixon had obstructed justice by trying to cover up his involvement, a special prosecutor was named and a House committee recommended that the president be impeached.'b'And when an independent counsel found evidence that President Bill Clinton had committed perjury in the Monica Lewinsky case, the  impeachment machinery again cranked into gear, with the spectacle of a Senate trial (which ended in acquittal).'b'Laws are broken, the federal government investigates, and the individuals involved \xe2\x80\x94 even if they\xe2\x80\x99re presidents \xe2\x80\x94 are tried and, if found guilty, punished. That is the way it is supposed to work under our system of government. But not this time.'b'Last  Aug. 17,   Judge Anna Diggs Taylor of the United States District Court in Detroit issued her ruling in the A.C.L.U. case. The president, she wrote, had \xe2\x80\x9cundisputedly violated\xe2\x80\x9d not only the First and Fourth Amendments of the Constitution, but also statutory law, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Enacted by a bipartisan Congress in 1978, the FISA statute was a response to revelations that the National Security Agency had conducted warrantless eavesdropping on Americans. To deter future administrations from similar actions, the law  made  a violation a felony punishable by a $10,000 fine and five years in prison.'b'Yet despite this ruling, the Bush Justice Department never opened  an F.B.I. investigation, no special prosecutor was named,  and there was no talk of impeachment in the Republican-controlled Congress.'b'Justice Department lawyers argued last June that warrants were not required for what they called the administration\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cterrorist  surveillance program\xe2\x80\x9d  because of the president\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinherent powers\xe2\x80\x9d to order eavesdropping and because of the Congressional authorization to use military force against those responsible for 9/11. But Judge Taylor rejected both arguments, ruling that even presidents must obey  statutory law and the Constitution.'b'On Jan.  17,  Attorney General Alberto Gonzales unexpectedly declared that President Bush had ended the program, deciding to again seek warrants in all cases. Exactly what kind of warrants \xe2\x80\x94 individual, as is required by the law, or broad-based, which would probably still be illegal \xe2\x80\x94 is as yet unknown.'b'The action may have been designed to forestall a potentially adverse ruling by the federal appeals court in Cincinnati, which had scheduled oral arguments on the case for today. At that hearing, the administration is now expected to argue that the case is moot and should be thrown out \xe2\x80\x94 while reserving the right to restart the program at any time.'b'But that\xe2\x80\x99s a bit like a bank robber coming into court and arguing that, although he has been sticking up banks for the past half-decade, he has agreed to a temporary halt and therefore he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be prosecuted. Independent of the A.C.L.U.  case, a criminal investigation by the F.B.I. and a special prosecutor should begin immediately. The question that must finally be answered is whether the president is guilty of committing a felony by continuously reauthorizing the warrantless eavesdropping program for the past five years. And if so, what action must be taken?'b'The issue is not original. Among the charges approved by the House Judiciary Committee  when it recommended  its articles  of impeachment against President Nixon was \xe2\x80\x9cillegal wiretaps.\xe2\x80\x9d President Nixon, the bill charged, \xe2\x80\x9ccaused wiretaps to be placed on the telephones of 17 persons without having obtained a court order authorizing the tap, as required by federal law; in violation of Sections 241, 371 and 2510-11 of the Criminal Code.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Under his program, President Bush could probably be charged with wiretapping not 17 but thousands of  people  without having obtained a court order authorizing the taps  as required by federal law, in violation of FISA.'b'It is not only the federal court but also many in Congress  who believe that a violation of law has taken place. In a hearing on Jan.  18, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Patrick Leahy of Vermont,  said,  \xe2\x80\x9cFor years, this administration has engaged in warrantless wiretapping of Americans contrary to the law.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'His  view was shared by the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, who said of Mr. Bush,  \xe2\x80\x9cFor five years he has been operating an illegal program.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And Senator Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican who is  the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, noted that much of the public was opposed to the program and that it both hurt the country at home and damaged its image abroad. \xe2\x80\x9cThe heavy criticism which the president took on the program,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI think was very harmful in the political process and for the reputation of the country.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To allow a president to break the law and commit a felony for more than five years without even a formal independent investigation would be the ultimate subversion of the Constitution and the rule of law.

And yet it sells well because it is the only kind of poem available for more than half the year, and people insist on reading poetry, even out of season. That is the winter tomato. In redness and roundness it says \xe2\x80\x9ctomato,\xe2\x80\x9d in every way except the one that matters: flavor.'b'Earlier this month, the federal Agriculture Department put an exception into its rules to let a tomato called the UglyRipe be shipped out of state. Those rules say a tomato must be at least 2 9/32 inches and no more than 2 25/32 inches in diameter. The UglyRipe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t meet those specs \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s ribbed at the top and not uniform in shape. It is also reputed to taste very much like a tomato.'b'Perhaps the real virtue of the UglyRipe\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cugliness,\xe2\x80\x9d which is nothing compared with the deformed beauty of true heirloom tomatoes, is that it helps us see how strange the uniformity of regular winter tomatoes really is. For a backyard grower, taste is everything. But in commercial production, taste is an abstraction. It is what\xe2\x80\x99s left after all the other criteria for a good commercial tomato have been met: disease resistance, regular shape, consistent ripening, the ability to withstand picking and packing and shipping, a long shelf life. Taste is too subjective, according to the Florida Tomato Committee, to judge tomatoes by.'b'The UglyRipe may be a better tomato. After all, its growers have selected for better taste, not perfect shape. But one thing that would certainly make the UglyRipe a better tomato is a different way of growing it. Santa Sweets produces organic UglyRipes, but they are few and hard to find. It now grows its conventional tomatoes without using agricultural chemicals that carry reproductive risks \xe2\x80\x94 but it still uses methyl bromide, a powerful, ozone-depleting pesticide, to fumigate the soil in which conventional UglyRipes grow.'b'Under the terms of the Montreal Protocol, the use of methyl bromide was supposed to be phased out completely by January 2005. But for the past few years, the Bush administration has claimed an exemption for \xe2\x80\x9ccritical uses,\xe2\x80\x9d one of which is growing winter tomatoes in Florida. We used to consider it a luxury to eat fruits and vegetables out of season. But what we eat out of season has been machined to withstand the rigors of the supply chain and produced in ways that only our ignorance can sustain. The truth is that there is no luxury \xe2\x80\x94 nor critical use \xe2\x80\x94 in it. Even an ugly, better-tasting winter tomato isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth the price.

First listed in 1974, when their numbers had dwindled to the low hundreds, the wolf population there now numbers about 4,000, thanks almost entirely to the act\xe2\x80\x99s prohibitions on hunting and trapping. State and tribal governments will now be responsible for keeping their numbers at healthy levels.'b'This good news, however, was immediately spoiled by the department\xe2\x80\x99s proposed delisting of the gray wolves (also known as timber wolves) that roam the northern Rocky Mountains. Virtually eliminated from their range in the 1920\xe2\x80\x99s, these wolves have also staged a remarkable comeback.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s disturbing about this proposal is that two of the states that will assume responsibility for managing the wolves have shown little interest in protecting them. At a recent rally, Idaho\xe2\x80\x99s governor, C. L. Otter, called Butch, said he would authorize the destruction of more than 80 percent of the state\xe2\x80\x99s 650 wolves, leaving the bare minimum required to keep them from being returned to the endangered list. Not to be outdone, Wyoming said it would allow 16 of its 23 wolf packs to be killed on sight. Montana, by contrast, will bar any hunting until officials see how well the wolves are doing, and even then hunting will be strictly monitored.'b'This eagerness to resume the slaughter is based on claims that the wolves are devastating livestock populations and game animals like elk. These claims have little basis in fact and should be rigorously examined during the public comment period ahead. Even then, the wolves should not be de-listed until Idaho and Wyoming adopt adequate regulatory mechanisms for protecting wolf populations that present no threat to humans, are valuable to the ecosystem and have taken years to rebuild.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cCan Polyester Save the World?\xe2\x80\x9d (Thursday Styles, Jan. 25):'b'Here in Portland, Ore., savvy local fashion designers have another way to reduce the amount of carbon in their fashions.'b'Portland designers often find clothing at garage sales and resale shops and refashion these articles into new, ingenious creations.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen neckties become beautiful belts and arm cuffs; men\xe2\x80\x99s suits cut and resewn into unique skirts; and handbags and gloves made out of old sweaters.'b'In the past few years, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been adding these refashioned pieces to my own wardrobe, proving that one can dress stylishly and be eco-friendly all at the same time.'b'Leslie Carlson'b'Portland, Ore., Jan. 25, 2007'b'\xc2\x95'b'To the Editor:'b'As  one of your more slovenly readers, I am amazed to hear that there are people who iron their cotton T-shirts.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard about such people.

Civilians killed last year: 34,000. Driven from their homes within Iraq: 1.8 million. Fled to other countries: an additional 2 million, and growing. The number of Iraqis who have found refuge in the United States is easier to pin down. This country has admitted a grand total of 466 Iraqi refugees since 2003.'b'However President Bush tries to manage the endgame of his dismal war, America has an obligation to the Iraqis whose lives it has upended. It owes a particular debt to those who have faced incredible dangers working with American forces as interpreters, guides and contractors. These allies \xe2\x80\x94 and their families \xe2\x80\x94 have become a haunted and hunted group, branded as traitors and targeted for kidnapping and assassination by insurgents and militias.'b'By any measure, the Bush administration is failing them. The current price tag for the war is $8 billion a month, yet the State Department plans to spend only $20 million in the coming fiscal year to help shelter Iraqi refugees overseas and to resettle them here. A special visa program to resettle Iraqi and Afghan military translators has been capped at 50 people a year and has a six-year waiting list.'b'Of all the Vietnam-era mistakes the country has been repeating lately, indifference to refugees is especially unforgivable. The administration can start addressing the problem by devoting a far greater number of refugee slots \xe2\x80\x94 currently 70,000 a year \xe2\x80\x94 to people from Iraq and Afghanistan. It can streamline entry procedures, which should be a manageable task for those who have already been vetted to work with the United States military.'b'It should move quickly to organize a conference with Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors to discuss ways to cope better with the human suffering and the potentially destabilizing effects of the rising human tide. And it should answer an urgent appeal for funds by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which is seeking $60 million over the next 12 months to shelter and protect displaced Iraqis.'b'Does it really need to be said yet again that in these perilous times the way to win trustworthy allies is to be one?'b'Late last year, we tried a bit of an experiment called "Your Turn to Tell the Story."
