With 30-foot pits below stage and 60-foot-high catwalks above stage, they must be acutely aware of their surroundings at all times. They must build and lift large complex pieces of heavy scenery, and when a show ends, tear down the scenery in one night (after having already worked 14 hours).'b'With regard to the \xe2\x80\x9cstars\xe2\x80\x9d who make less, they can certainly try out being a stagehand.

The stagehands are responsible for irreplaceable and priceless instruments, at venues such as Carnegie Hall with antiquated facilities and a cumbersome multilevel backstage.

Never mind those nightly fund-raisers.'b'If you look at the numbers, it may seem that lobbying is in decline, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t; it\xe2\x80\x99s just taking different forms. What was once straightforward lobbying has become, in effect, a full service PR-advertising-social media operation, very little of which is covered by federal regulation.'b'In a field buffeted by the economic meltdown of 2008, the current legislative standstill on Capitol Hill, the emergence of high-tech competitors and the passage of the 'b'Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007'b'  (which subjects registered lobbyists to a stringent regulatory regime including the threat of criminal sanctions and prison time), this shift in the influence industry poses a broader question. Are the days of the glad-handing lobbyist, carrying an envelope of PAC checks and the proposed wording of a client\xe2\x80\x99s legislative amendment, numbered?'b'Carter Eskew, a founding partner of 'b'the Glover Park Group'b', which lobbies and provides a host of other services to clients, raised this question in a conversation with me.'b'Looking to future sources of new revenue, Eskew has concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98relationship lobbying\xe2\x80\x99 is dead, or at least not where the growth will be.\xe2\x80\x9d The traditional lobbyist, he argues, is no longer the \xc3\xa9minence grise of days past but instead has been reduced to serving as a conduit for campaign contributions from corporate and trade association PACs to candidates.'b'The action has shifted to what is known in the business as strategic advice: how to convince and mobilize voters and opinion elites in support of a client\xe2\x80\x99s agenda. According to Eskew, \xe2\x80\x9cMany years ago, members of Congress figured out what they really needed to worry about were their own constituent groups and their own voters.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'So what does this new strategic adviser actually do? He or she can plan out a legislative campaign or a drive to affect the implementation of regulation, determine which officials and agencies must be dealt with, and propose potential coalition partners.'b'Interestingly, all this can be done without making direct contact with elected officials, congressional aides or top-ranked department and agency appointees and employees. This arms-length approach permits strategic advisers to avoid lobbying registration and reporting requirements.'b'Ed Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee and a key adviser to George W.

During that period, the firm\xe2\x80\x99s revenues 'b'more than doubled'b', from $7.6 million to $18 million.'b'Gillespie left the firm in 2007, initially to become 'b'counselor to President Bush'b'.

At the end of 2010, House Republicans, under pressure from the Tea Party, 'b'adopted rules prohibiting earmarks'b' \xe2\x80\x94 special provisions for individual members creating such local projects as roads, bridges, dams and federal buildings. Earmarks had been the bread and butter of firms that specialized in winning federal project grants for their clients.'b'For example, the lobbying firm Cassidy and Associates has paid 'b'a heavy price'b' for the earmark ban (see 'b'Figure 3'b'). Fees paid to Cassidy fell from $22.3 million in 2009 to $15.5 million in 2012.'b'Negative trends in reported fees mask some less visible but highly lucrative developments.'b'The legislative battles preceding the 2010 enactment of the Dodd-Frank finance industry reforms and the Affordable Care Act were the last two major moneymakers for publicly registered lobbyists.'b'Since then, however, there has been a 'b'huge amount'b' of 'b'unreported spending'b' on Washington lawyers, sometimes referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cshadow lobbyists,\xe2\x80\x9d who do not need to register or disclose fees, but who are attempting to influence the writing of regulations governing Dodd-Frank by such agencies as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.'b'In a 'b'November report'b' for the Sunlight Foundation, 'b'Tim LaPira'b', a political scientist at James Madison University, estimated that for every registered lobbyist there is at least one \xe2\x80\x9cshadow lobbyist\xe2\x80\x9d who is \xe2\x80\x9cgetting paid to influence public policy\xe2\x80\x9d without making any public disclosure of fees or clients. LaPira found a ratio of 52.3 to 47.7 of shadow lobbyists to registered lobbyists.'b'LaPira makes the working assumption that the shadow lobbyist collects the same amount in fees as the publicly registered lobbyist \xe2\x80\x93 an annual average of $270,000 per person. Using LaPira\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, 'b'total spending'b' to influence legislative and regulatory outcomes in 2012 doubled from $3.1 billion to $6.7 billion.'b'Falling entirely outside the scope of regulation is what\xe2\x80\x99s known as 'b'grass-roots/AstroTurf'b' lobbying: mobilizing stockholders, suppliers, trade association members and members of any sympathetic constituency to write letters, call their Congressmen and send emails. This tactic has been around for decades, but every year it become more technically sophisticated.'b'For example, last March, Kate Ackley of Roll Call 'b'reported'b' that 'b'the DCI Group'b'  \xe2\x80\x94 which \xe2\x80\x9chelps corporations navigate their most challenging political, legislative and regulatory problems anywhere in the world\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 scheduled \xe2\x80\x9chundreds of Hill meetings and generated more than 31,500 constituent calls to congressional offices\xe2\x80\x9d on behalf of the Retail Industry Leaders Association, along with orchestrating \xe2\x80\x9c1,606 individualized contacts in target [Capitol Hill] offices from small business owners,\xe2\x80\x9d according to a \xe2\x80\x9ccase study\xe2\x80\x9d DCI used to persuade prospective clients hire the firm.'b'The DCI campaign helped win passage of legislation restricting the fees credit card companies could charge merchants.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t come anywhere near the threshold for lobbying,\xe2\x80\x9d DCI Group spokesman Craig Stevens told Roll Call. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are very diligent to honor the letter and spirit of all the rules and regulations that Congress has set forth.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ed Rogers, who worked on the presidential campaigns of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, is currently a registered lobbyist and chairman of 'b'the BGR Group'b' (formerly Barbour Griffith &amp; Rogers). BGR, in addition to straightforward lobbying, has a web-based practice and a public relations arm. Rogers noted in an interview that the Internet is changing the nature of lobbying. Now \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s essential to manage the Google hole, what\xe2\x80\x99s Google got about you, you have to inject content, enhance the good and dilute the bad.\xe2\x80\x9d The same assertive approach, Rogers argues, applies to YouTube videos and Wikipedia entries.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNever let a negative go unanswered, if there is something bad on the web, you need to match it with something good. Stuff on the web has a much longer half-life than it used to be with newspapers, you have to tend to it,\xe2\x80\x9d Rogers told me.'b'In 'b'a description'b' of the services it provides, Eskew\xe2\x80\x99s Glover Park Group shows how far beyond traditional lobbying the influence business has gone:'b'In this respect, the merging of lobbying into a much more encompassing collection of strategies and approaches is illustrated by the conglomeration of lobbying and other influence specialties under one corporate roof. The premier example of this can be found at 'b'WPP'b', a worldwide advertising, marketing and public affairs company, with 350 subsidiaries.'b'The list of WPP\xe2\x80\x99s Washington firms keeps getting longer and includes Blue State Digital, Benenson Strategy Group, Burson-Marsteller, Direct Impact, Hill+Knowlton Strategies, Dewey Square Group, Penn Schoen Berland, PBN Hill+Knowlton Strategies, Prime Policy Group, QGA Public Affairs, Palisades Media Ventures, the Glover Park Group and Wexler &amp; Walker Public Policy Associates.'b'When lobbying is merged into a behemoth of this scope, it is no longer lobbying as your parents understood the concept. It is now an integral part of a much broader system of corporate leverage and control, a system that has left the federal regulation of this new breed of influence strategists far behind.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'In a Car-Culture Clash, It\xe2\x80\x99s the Los Angeles Police vs. Pedestrians'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Dec. 26):'b'The urban activist Jane Jacobs liked to point out that what happens on a lively street is a delicate dance among its various users, and in dance, balance is crucial.

When right-wing critics \xe2\x80\x9cexpose\xe2\x80\x9d the fact that President Obama endorsed a single-payer system before 2004, they\xe2\x80\x99re actually telling the truth.'b'What we now call Obamacare was conceived at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, and birthed in Massachusetts by Mitt Romney, then the governor. The president took Romneycare, a program designed to keep the private insurance industry intact, and just improved some of its provisions.

Young Victorians grasped for maturity as well, embarrassed by the distance between their lives and society\xe2\x80\x99s expectations.'b'These Americans were born into an earthquake. During the 1800s America\xe2\x80\x99s population exploded from 5 million to 75 million. By 1900 nearly as many people lived in New York City as had lived in the entire country during the Revolution. The nation went from a rural backwater to an industrial behemoth \xe2\x80\x94 producing more than Britain, Germany and France combined \xe2\x80\x94 but every decade the economy crashed. America saw the kind of wild change we see today in China, and in a new society with little to stabilize it.'b'For rootless 20-somethings, each national shock felt intimate, rattling their love lives and careers. Many young adults could not accept that their personal struggles were just ripples of a large-scale social dislocation. So each New Year\xe2\x80\x99s, they blamed themselves. In a Jan. 1, 1859, entry in her journal, 19-year-old Mollie Dorsey, stuck on a Nebraska homestead in the middle of a recession, castigated herself for not being \xe2\x80\x9cany better than I was one year ago.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Romance worried them above all. Today some fret about the changing institution of marriage, but we are used to such adjustments; 19th-century Americans were blindsided when the average age of marriage rose precipitously, to 26 \xe2\x80\x94 a level America didn\xe2\x80\x99t return to until 1990. In a world where life expectancy hovered below age 50, delaying marriage until 26 was revolutionary.'b'Cities brimmed with bachelors and unmarried ladies in their mid-20s, once a rare sight. In their New Year\xe2\x80\x99s reflections, men and women noted that their parents had had children by their age. One typical Union Army soldier wrote home wondering, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I will be married before I am thirty?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This social change brought personal turmoil, especially for young women. Marriage meant love and family, but in a society that discouraged ladies from working, young women were dependent on their husbands. Remaining single meant economic and legal instability, and the perception of childishness. When the mother of one diarist, Emily Gillespie, scolded the Midwestern farm girl by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are twenty years old and not married yet,\xe2\x80\x9d it hardly mattered that Emily was in line with her generation.'b'While some looked for love, others looked for jobs. Before the modern era, young people found work within family networks, laboring at home or on a farm, pausing for \xe2\x80\x9celevenses\xe2\x80\x9d (a late-morning whiskey break) or an afternoon nap. The industrial economy changed that.'b'The good news was that there were more jobs; the bad news was that they were isolating and temporary. Work now meant small factories or lumber camps or railroad crews of strangers. They were monitored like machines, with pressure to increase productivity replacing the slower pace of preindustrial labor.'b'For young people this meant chronic instability. A young man might brag about his new job one week and find himself begging for money from his father the next. Frustrated youths worried that their jobs did not reflect their age or ability: One brilliant young speaker complained about working in a cramped Philadelphia boot factory, nailing soles when he should have been climbing a soapbox.'b'While 19th-century young adults faced many of the anxieties that trouble 23-year-olds today, they found novel solutions. The first was to move. Young men and women were notoriously transient, heading out on \xe2\x80\x9cwander years\xe2\x80\x9d when life at home seemed stalled. In one Wisconsin county, 90 percent of those present in 1870 were gone by 1880. Most set out with no plan, few connections and a small carpetbag of personal possessions.'b'Another solution was to find like-minded young adults, to share, as one later put it in his memoir, their \xe2\x80\x9cbaffling discouragements and buoyant hopes.\xe2\x80\x9d Nineteenth-century young people were compulsive joiners. Political movements, literary societies, religious organizations, dancing clubs and even gangs proliferated. The men and women who joined cared about the stated cause, but also craved the community these groups created. They realized that while instability was inevitable, isolation was voluntary.'b'Today\xe2\x80\x99s young adults are constantly rebuked for not following the life cycle popular in 1960. But a quick look at earlier eras shows just how unusual mid-20th-century young people were. A society in which people married out of high school and held the same job for 50 years is the historical outlier. Some of that era\xe2\x80\x99s achievements were enviable, but they were not the norm.'b'The anxieties that 19th-century young people poured into their New Year\xe2\x80\x99s diary entries are more common. Americans considered young adulthood the most dangerous part of life, and struggled to find a path to maturity. Those who did best tended to accept change, not to berate themselves for breaking with tradition. Young adults might do the same today. Stop worrying about how they appear from the skewed perspective of the mid-20th century and find a new home, a new stability and a new community in the new year.'b'War, famine, pestilence and death \xe2\x80\x94 the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse \xe2\x80\x94 have been well represented in years ending in \xe2\x80\x9c4,\xe2\x80\x9d but probably not disproportionately so. A look at memorable moments in the last seven of these just might lead to optimism for the one that\xe2\x80\x99s upon us. Or not.'b''b'1944'b' Those of us who don\xe2\x80\x99t remember this year are lucky; a soldier cited in Rick Atkinson\xe2\x80\x99s brilliantly horrifying saga of the last two years of the war in Europe, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Guns at Last Light,\xe2\x80\x9d quotes King Lear: \xe2\x80\x9cThe worst is not, So long as we can say, \xe2\x80\x98This is the worst.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0The end of the war was in sight; getting there was the trick, and millions were killed in the interval. Things have not been this bad since.'b''b'1954'b' If there was a golden era of United States foreign policy, it ended here, as Eisenhower warned against involvement in Vietnam while 'b'espousing the domino theory'b'. Good: Joe McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s power began to ebb. Not good: The words \xe2\x80\x9cunder God\xe2\x80\x9d were added to the Pledge of Allegiance.'b''b'1964'b' The last year of the baby boom was mind-blowing. In the 28 months beginning that January, Bob Dylan made five of the best albums of the era \xe2\x80\x94 and there were the Beatles.'b'Nelson Mandela was sentenced to life in prison, and Lyndon Johnson single-handedly sent everyone into a tizzy by signing the Civil Rights Act, sending more \xe2\x80\x9cadvisers\xe2\x80\x9d to Vietnam, talking about bombing North Vietnam and 'b'proposing the Great Society'b'. Huh? The first anti-Vietnam War demonstrations and draft-card burnings took place. Pot smoking officially began. (Not really, but sorta.)'b'The civil-rights workers Schwerner, Goodman and Chaney 'b'were found dead'b'; just writing that gives me chills.'b''b'1974'b' The mid-70s were glum. We can gloat about Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s resignation, though don\xe2\x80\x99t forget he founded the Environmental Protection Agency. Gerald Ford gave his predecessor a better deal than he gave draft evaders. He also determined that we needed to 'b'Whip Inflation Now'b', as oil 'b'passed $10 a barrel'b'. Everyone made jokes about him, with reason.'b'Patty Hearst was kidnapped. Ted Bundy disappeared many people. Augusto Pinochet declared himself \xe2\x80\x9csupreme chief\xe2\x80\x9d of Chile and disappeared many more.'b'The high point may have been 'b'the Ramones\xe2\x80\x99 debut at CBGB'b'.\xc2\xa0'b''b'1984'b' Big Brother was not (yet) our biggest problem, but this was not a good year. President Reagan, presumably not yet stricken by Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s, remarked over an open mike that the bombing of Russia would begin \xe2\x80\x9cin five minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d Geraldine Ferraro became a vice-presidential candidate, and lost. Margaret Thatcher 'b'went to war with miners'b', and won. Indira Gandhi was assassinated and a Union Carbide leak in Bhopal 'b'killed untold thousands'b'.'b'The virus that causes AIDS 'b'was discovered'b'. People started smoking crack. And Marvin Gaye was shot and killed by his father.'b''b'1994'b' Whoa: Not only did Nelson Mandela not spend his life in jail, but he became president. The Brady Law 'b'went into effect'b', and Bill Clinton signed the assault weapons ban. (It expired in 2004.) O. J. Simpson 'b'spurred a national obsession'b'. Four bombers were convicted of the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center.'b'Reagan 'b'was implicated'b' in the Iran-contra cover-up, but it seemed more important to torture the Clintons over a 'b'bad real estate investment'b'. (Still, Paula Jones wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 fault, was she?) Clinton fired Joycelyn Elders for discussing masturbation.'b'The 'b'first credit default swap'b' was created. Nearly 'b'everyone in Rwanda'b' became either a killer or a victim, or so it seemed.

(By 2013, 'b'even Utah'b' is on the right side of this issue.) W. also promised to improve education and access to health care; we all know how that worked out.

The alternative could be a visit by the Four Horsemen.'b'LONDON \xe2\x80\x94 A year ends, another begins, time for reminiscences and resolutions, regret and hope, best-of and worst-of lists, confessions and crystal-ball gazing \xe2\x80\x94 most of it pretty excruciating. It will take a nanosecond longer to scroll back to one\xe2\x80\x99s year of birth. So it goes.'b'I am not going to gripe about brilliant Twitter. I have nothing new to say about Miley Cyrus. But I am going to make one prediction for 2014. It is that, for all John Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s efforts, this will be another year in which peace is not reached in the Middle East. (And if I am wrong, I vow Sisyphean penance in eternity.)'b'Plenty of bad things have happened between Israelis and Palestinians of late. There has been a steady uptick in violence. Israel\xe2\x80\x99s freeing of 26 long-serving Palestinian prisoners was naturally greeted with joy in Ramallah, and by a wave of Israeli government tweets condemning the celebration of terrorists. Along with the release came word that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s government will likely announce plans for 1,400 new housing units in the West Bank, just as Kerry arrives for his 10th peace-seeking visit. This has infuriated Palestinians. So, too, has an Israeli ministerial committee vote advancing legislation to annex settlements in the Jordan Valley. Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said the vote \xe2\x80\x9cfinishes all that is called the peace process.\xe2\x80\x9d Such contemptuous characterization of a negotiation from a leading protagonist is ill-advised and bodes ill.'b'Then there is the rebounding Israel-is-a-Jewish-state bugbear: Netanyahu wants Palestinians to recognize his nation as such. He has recently called it \xe2\x80\x9cthe real key to peace.\xe2\x80\x9d His argument is that this is the touchstone by which to judge whether Palestinians will accept \xe2\x80\x9cthe Jewish state in any border\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 whether, in other words, the Palestinian leadership would accept territorial compromise or is still set on reversal of 1948 and mass return to Haifa.'b'Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, says no; this \xe2\x80\x9cnyet\xe2\x80\x9d will endure. For Palestinians, such a form of recognition would amount to explicit acquiescence to second-class citizenship for the 1.6 million Arabs in Israel; undermine the rights of millions of Palestinian refugees; upend a national narrative of mass expulsion from land that was theirs; and demand of them something not demanded from Egypt or Jordan in peace agreements, nor of the Palestine Liberation Organization when, in 1993, Yasir Arafat wrote to Yitzhak Rabin that it recognizes the right of Israel \xe2\x80\x9cto exist\xc2\xa0in peace and security.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This issue is a waste of time, a complicating diversion when none is needed. As Shlomo Avineri, a leading Israeli political scientist, put it to me, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a tactical issue raised by Netanyahu in order to make negotiations more difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Of course, any two-state peace agreement will have to be final and irreversible; it must ensure there are no further Palestinian claims on a secure Israel. It may well require some form of words saying the two states are the homelands of their respective peoples, a formula used by the Geneva Initiative. But that is for another day.'b'If Israel looks like a Jewish state and acts like a Jewish state, that is good enough for me \xe2\x80\x94 as long as it gets out of the corrosive business of occupation. Zionism, the one I identify with, forged a Jewish homeland in the name of restored Jewish pride in a democratic state of laws, not in the name of finicky insistence on a certain form of recognition, nor in the name of messianic religious Greater Israel nationalism.'b'When I spoke to him in Tel Aviv a few months ago, Yair Lapid, a top government minister, said: \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that we demand from Palestinians a declaration that they recognize Israel as a Jewish state, I just think this is rubbish. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need that. The whole point of Israel was we came here saying we don\xe2\x80\x99t need anyone else to recognize us anymore because we can recognize ourselves. We are liberated.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s right. It\xe2\x80\x99s also true that Palestinian leaders, with zero democratic accountability, and through facile incitement, are not preparing their people for territorial compromise at or close to the 1967 lines. Then again, nothing in Israel\xe2\x80\x99s actions facilitates that. And on we go to more failure, more victories of narrative over normalcy.'b'A last word: This column is dedicated to Mike O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, fearless journalist, great Bosnia hand for The New York Times, vivid chronicler of the Israel-Palestine conflict over several years for NPR, and most recently representative of the Committee to Protect Journalists in Mexico, where saving press freedom is a daily struggle. Mike was an acute observer of the kind of human folly, fatuousness and self-interest that perpetuate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It brought him to tears. Yet he always found a way to laugh. 'b'Mike died suddenly'b'\xc2\xa0on Sunday, age 67, in Mexico City. If nothing else, I hope Kerry and the rest prove me wrong for him.'b'Sometimes the New Year comes in feeling merely newish, a matter of changing months and not much else. But sometimes the New Year brings with it a powerful sense of regeneration, as if, like certain insects, you were entering a new stage of complete metamorphosis.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know which kind of New Year is coming until it comes. Changing digits \xe2\x80\x94 from 2013 to 2014 \xe2\x80\x94 may be all the change you feel you need. Yet there are only so many New Years in any one life, and it never hurts to be ready for the eventful year, which, as Thoreau once wrote, will drown out all our muskrats. (Or, as the muskrats might say, the year which will drown out all our Thoreaus.)'b'There are no hymns to the New Year, and the only music most of us associate with this holiday is that dirge of the departing year, \xe2\x80\x9cAuld Lang Syne.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There is no traditional ceremony either \xe2\x80\x94 everyone seems to celebrate the day in a different manner. And perhaps this is a holiday that defies both tradition and ceremony. Does it make sense, after all, to welcome the New Year in the Same Old Way? There is not much ritual in turning to a new page in the calendar. All the ritual lies within us, in the aspiration to live up to our highest hopes.'b'The dead of winter is not a natural season for rebirth. Yet all of nature, dormant now under the cover of cold and snow, is preparing for a re-emergence that always seems spectacular when it eventually comes. Meanwhile, we persist, as much like ourselves on Jan. 1 as we were on Dec. 31. The newness we hope for is something that is ours to construct day by day.'b'By all accounts, the standout entry in Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Tournament of Roses Parade'b' in Pasadena, Calif., will surely be 'b'the marriage of two men'b', Danny Leclair and Aubrey Loots, beaming amid the array of lavishly flowered floats to be viewed on national television and beyond.'b'This is a first \xe2\x80\x94 a newly married same-sex couple highlighting the grand parade. They\xe2\x80\x99ll do so like punctuation marks on the surprisingly rapid rise of same-sex marriage in America. In little more than a year, the number of states allowing same-sex marriage has tripled to 18, following a Federal District Court ruling in Utah.'b'Opponents of the single-gender nuptial display in the hallowed parade have dished heavy umbrage in petitions and blogs, calling it \xe2\x80\x9cunbiblical\xe2\x80\x9d and urging a boycott by onlookers. But the tournament executives have said they are pleased that love will triumph on a day when the tournament theme is \xe2\x80\x9cDreams Come True.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The vows are scheduled to take place aboard a float sponsored by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation to celebrate victories in the old year \xe2\x80\x94 that is, 2013 \xe2\x80\x94 including the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s upholding the repeal of California\xe2\x80\x99s Proposition 8 and striking down a basic part of the Defense of Marriage Act.'b'In 1890, as California was evolving as the cutting-edge state of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s future, little could local promoters foresee what the future might bring as they invented the Tournament of Roses to lure winter-hardened tourists to Pasadena\xe2\x80\x99s balmy climate. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s hold a festival to tell the world about our paradise,\xe2\x80\x9d they avowed. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t long before a football game was added to the fun.'b'And now, Danny and Aubrey saying I do. The new couple\xe2\x80\x99s float is titled, \xe2\x80\x9cLiving the Dream: Love Is the Best Protection.\xe2\x80\x9d It is hard to disagree as the new year parades forward.'b'The corporation that controls Sprint, the third-biggest cellphone company in the country after Verizon and AT&amp;T, is 'b'reportedly'b' planning to make an offer to buy the smaller rival T-Mobile in a move that would reduce competition in an important industry that already has too little of it.'b'Most Americans have a choice of just four national cellphone companies \xe2\x80\x94 Verizon, AT&amp;T, Sprint and T-Mobile \xe2\x80\x94 compared with six in 2003. The Federal Communications Commission recently described the industry as \xe2\x80\x9chighly concentrated\xe2\x80\x9d based on an index used by regulators to measure how competitive a market is. In 2011, the Department of Justice used a similar analysis to 'b'effectively block'b' AT&amp;T from acquiring T-Mobile.'b'Sprint, recently bought by the Japanese company SoftBank, appears to believe that regulators might look favorably on a proposal to purchase T-Mobile because the combined company would 'b'still be smaller'b' than AT&amp;T and Verizon in revenue and customers. Sprint would probably argue that the combined company would become a more effective competitor to the two larger companies.'b'Because T-Mobile uses a different wireless technology than Sprint, SoftBank could face significant technological hurdles in trying to integrate the two. But that\xe2\x80\x99s a separate issue; the main issue is whether consumers would benefit from the acquisition, and the evidence suggests they would not.'b'As an independent company, for instance, T-Mobile has recently cut prices aggressively and simplified its cellphone plans. Its phone plans are often much 'b'cheaper than'b' comparable packages offered by other cellphone companies. It no longer forces customers into 'b'two-year contracts'b'; its subscribers can switch to another wireless firm whenever they like. And it 'b'slashed the high international roaming charges'b' it levies on calls customers make when they are traveling abroad and eliminated roaming charges for text messages and Internet service.'b'As you would expect in a competitive environment, other companies like AT&amp;T 'b'have been forced'b' to respond to T-Mobile\xe2\x80\x99s price cuts and policy changes with similar moves. It is hard to imagine that any cellphone company would have been as aggressive as T-Mobile if the administration had allowed AT&amp;T to buy the company. The logic that the government used to step in still holds today, and antitrust regulators should look closely at any proposal that would reduce competition in the wireless business.'b'President Obama has done the predictable thing by 'b'sending more weapons to Iraq to counter an alarming rise in violence'b'. But arms alone will not solve a problem that has its roots in the political alienation of Sunnis and other minorities and the undermining of democratic processes, especially by Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki.'b'The bloodshed has reached catastrophic proportions. More than 8,000 Iraqis died in 2013, including 952 members of the Iraqi security forces. Over all, it is the highest death toll since 2008 and shatters a trend that in 2012 prompted a top administration official to assert that \xe2\x80\x9cIraq today is less violent\xe2\x80\x9d than \xe2\x80\x9cat any time in recent history.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The deadly surge is attributed to Al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s regional affiliate, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a Sunni group that is a potent force in northern and western Iraq. Its predecessor, Al Qaeda in Iraq, waged the insurgency that brought the country near civil war in 2006 and 2007 before suffering big defeats from Iraqi Sunni tribal groups and American forces. Since the United States withdrew at the end of 2011, the group has gained strength against Iraqi security forces that are incapable of fully protecting civilians, and it has taken in foreign fighters from neighboring Syria and the region. American officials say that Islamic State is deliberately trying to tear the country apart.'b'Mr. Maliki sought help from Mr. Obama at the White House in November, a turnabout after he failed to reach a deal to keep a small number of American troops in the country after 2011 for training and intelligence gathering.'b'Some 75 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles, to be fired at militant camps with the C.I.A. providing targeting assistance, were delivered to Iraq last week and 10 reconnaissance drones are expected to follow in March. The Obama administration also plans to provide 48 other reconnaissance drones and the first of an order of F-16 fighter jets. It is pushing a reluctant Congress to lease and eventually sell Apache helicopter gunships to Iraq.'b'The United States has a strategic interest in Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s stability, which is undoubtedly at risk, making increased counterterrorism cooperation and intelligence-sharing essential. But even the most lethal weapons will not have much positive effect if Mr. Maliki and other Iraqi leaders bicker rather than unite the country around shared goals through credible democratic processes. Mr. Maliki has been central to the disorder, wielding power in favor of his Shiite majority brethren at the expense of the minority Sunnis, stoking sectarian conflict and enabling a climate in which militants could gain traction.'b'American officials say Mr. Maliki and other Iraqi officials finally understand the dangers of the growing extremism and the fact that a security-only approach will not bring stability. They say that Iraqi security forces have lately been more successful against the militants and that Mr. Maliki and his government have shown more willingness to work cooperatively with Sunnis, resolve oil disputes with the Kurds and put in place a new agreement aimed at promoting civil and social peace. Given his authoritarian duplicity, it is hard to be optimistic. On Tuesday, more than 40 Sunni lawmakers submitted their resignations from Parliament and Sunni ministers threatened to withdraw from the Cabinet after Mr. Maliki\xe2\x80\x99s security forces dismantled a camp used by Sunnis protesting second-class treatment by the Shiite-led government.'b'As it doles out weapons, intelligence and advice, the Obama administration needs to press Mr. Maliki and other Iraqi leaders to do those things, to ensure that the election in April is free and fair and to commit finally to adopting laws that will address Sunni grievances. It also needs to be prepared to halt or withhold deliveries of weapons if they are misused or if Mr. Maliki continues to put his own interests over his country\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'LONDON \xe2\x80\x94  It may seem bizarre that two far-right, nationalist politicians \xe2\x80\x94 Marine Le Pen of France and Geert Wilders of the Netherlands \xe2\x80\x94 have reached across borders to form a Pan-European group dedicated to weakening the European Union. Their aim is a transnational political alliance that would compete in the May elections for the European Parliament; once in power, they would cooperate to try to rein in the power of Brussels.'b'Are these politicians, who share an opposition to immigration and a skepticism about the free flow of labor and capital across the Continent, simply hypocritical opportunists, as many Europeans of the left believe? Perhaps.'b'But in fact, since the early 20th century, Europe\xe2\x80\x99s far-right nationalists have often united in search of an \xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x9d to oppose, exclude, resist, restrict or oppress \xe2\x80\x94 historically, minorities like Jews, homosexuals, the disabled, Roma, Marxists and, more recently, Arabs, Africans and Asians. What emerged after World War I was a philosophy that could be called Euro-fascist. The most extreme proponents, of course, were the Nazis: Notwithstanding their doctrine of racial supremacy, even they formed alliances with Mussolini\xe2\x80\x99s Italy and the militarists of Japan and found keen fascist collaborators in nations they invaded.'b'This vision did not die with the end of World War II. Transnational links among right-wing parties, based on common fears of minorities and immigrants, endured. The right-wingers, while speaking different languages, borrowed ideals, strategies, slogans and theorists from one another. The National Front in France, founded in 1972 by Ms. Le Pen\xe2\x80\x99s father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, imitated the symbol and political tactics of the original neo-Fascist party, the Italian Social Movement, which was formed in 1946 by admirers of Mussolini and, in 1979, coordinated with like-minded French and Spanish parties to compete (with little success) in the first popular elections for the European Parliament.'b'So when observers marvel about the \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d nationalist parties of Europe, they are capturing only part of the truth.

The European Union\xe2\x80\x99s byzantine governance makes it seem unaccountable. Its leaders \xe2\x80\x94 notably Jos\xc3\xa9 Manuel Barroso of Portugal, the president of the European Commission, the union\xe2\x80\x99s executive body; Herman van Rompuy of Belgium, the president of the European Council, which comprises the 28 heads of government; and Catherine Ashton, the union\xe2\x80\x99s top diplomat \xe2\x80\x94 are little known outside of elite circles.'b'Soaring youth unemployment, stringent fiscal policies, German-led monetary clout and the presence of Muslim immigrants have created a perfect target for the likes of Mr. Wilders and Ms. Le Pen, who blame outside forces like the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Union for their nations\xe2\x80\x99 woes. Conveniently, they overlook structural problems like the costs of social welfare and pension programs, declining birthrates, aging populations, stagnant labor productivity and intensifying competition from the economies of Asia and Latin America.'b'Surveys show that the anti-European Union forces may win more than 90 of the 751 seats to be contested in the May elections for the European Parliament. That might be enough to form an official parliamentary group \xe2\x80\x94 and to make them eligible, like the transnational alliances of socialists and center-right Christian democrats, for European Union financing and full political recognition. Even as a tiny, noisy voice within the European Parliament, this alliance could create a lot of trouble. Just think of the successes that Tea Party Republicans have had in impeding decision making in the United States.'b'The perception that bureaucrats in Brussels, bankers in Frankfurt and European lawmakers in Strasbourg, France, are haughty and indifferent has made it possible for demagogues to pose as populists who are alone in understanding \xe2\x80\x9cthe people.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For example, in November, Lorenzo Fontana, an Italian member of the European Parliament from the right-wing Northern League, boasted \xe2\x80\x94 ahead of a gathering with leaders of the National Front and similarly oriented Swedish, Austrian and Flemish parties \xe2\x80\x94 that they spoke in the name of a \xe2\x80\x9cshared ideal of Europe, a Europe of people.\xe2\x80\x9d The League\xe2\x80\x99s newspaper, La Padania, on Nov. 14, put it this way: \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be up to the voters, but this time the troops, willing but disorganized, have the opportunity to unite in a single \xe2\x80\x98army\xe2\x80\x99 behind an able leader.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'How would these right-wingers reshape Europe? They say they would give power back to nations by dismantling the technocratic decision-making power amassed in Brussels and returning powers back to individual member states. They would pause, if not quite reverse, six decades of growing integration.'b'Tragically, in the face of this assault, calls for European solidarity are few. This is a sign of how far Europe has come from the dream that helped lift it from the ashes of war. It is a sign of the fading of the vision \xe2\x80\x94 common markets, democratic institutions and societal integration \xe2\x80\x94 promoted by the postwar founders of European integration: thinkers and statesmen like Konrad Adenauer, Winston Churchill, Jean Monnet, Robert Schuman and Altiero Spinelli.'b'The European Union must reclaim its reputation as a champion of the people. Its leaders should abandon their embrace of technocratic solutions, their support for the banking sector and their stoic austerity. Unless they deliver more jobs, and more of a sense that citizens are in charge, the far right will only keep growing.'b''b'\n'b'Andrea Mammone 'b' is a lecturer in modern European history at Royal Holloway, the University of London.

Its rapid rise since its founding in 2012 suggests that many Indian voters are tiring of establishment politicians, especially members of the Indian National Congress Party, which has governed the country and Delhi longer than any other party but has lost favor in recent years because it has mismanaged the economy.'b'Common Man \xe2\x80\x94 its official Hindi name is Aam Aadmi Party \xe2\x80\x94 is led by Arvind Kejriwal, a former tax commissioner who helped lead a popular movement in 2011 that campaigned for the creation of a powerful federal anti-corruption agency. When lawmakers refused, Mr. Kejriwal and his supporters formed their party.'b'The recent election in Delhi, which has nearly 17 million people, was Common Man\xe2\x80\x99s first foray into elective politics. Its commanding victory \xe2\x80\x94 it won 30 percent of the vote in a largely three-way race against the incumbent Congress and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party \xe2\x80\x94 stunned political analysts. If it is able to maintain that momentum in next year\xe2\x80\x99s national election, Common Man could soon play an important role in Parliament as well.'b'Common Man must now show that it can govern. Mr. Kejriwal\xe2\x80\x99s first challenge will be managing a coalition government. Because Common Man did not win an outright majority of the seats in the Delhi Assembly, it will need support from lawmakers Mr. Kejriwal has criticized as corrupt and feckless. The party will also struggle to fulfill big promises like cutting electricity prices in half and providing free, clean drinking water to every Delhi household. Mr. Kejriwal, an engineer by training, will also be judged on how well he deals with major problems like Delhi\xe2\x80\x99 air pollution and violence against women.'b'It is impossible to know whether or how successful Common Man will be. But that it has come this far in such short order suggests a readiness among many Indians for change \xe2\x80\x94 and a willingness to use the democratic system to get it.'b'BEIRUT, Lebanon \xe2\x80\x94  The public health disaster in Syria has been a long time coming. In three years of violent conflict, 125,000 have been killed and millions displaced. The recent outbreak of polio has focused the world\xe2\x80\x99s attention, and the international response is welcome. Yet this crisis was both predictable and preventable.'b'The collapse of the health system and a lack of basic sanitation in opposition-held areas have created prime conditions for outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Syria eradicated polio 14 years ago; the fact that it has returned represents more than a breakdown of health care during civil war. It is symptomatic of how the international community, in its response to the crisis, has neglected public health.'b'Immunization coverage in what are now mainly opposition areas was already below accepted standards in 2011, but the situation has deteriorated. Data on routine immunization from the World Health Organization reveal that over the past two years a large proportion of the Syrian population has gone without vaccination.'b'Across Syria, coverage went down to 60 percent in 2012, and was as low as 50 percent in the embattled eastern city of Deir al-Zour, a front line between government and rebel forces. The latest W.H.O. figures from 2013 show that the level is now down to 36 percent in largely rebel-held Deir al-Zour Province, although it has remained at 100 percent in government-controlled areas such as the western stronghold of Tartus.'b'Given these conditions, it was no surprise to medical practitioners that a polio outbreak occurred. The question is why the international community did not prepare better for this eventuality. A disturbing part of the answer is that the United Nations itself has aggravated the situation.'b'Like other United Nations agencies, the World Health Organization works directly with the Syrian government. The W.H.O.\xe2\x80\x99s Syria office is in the Ministry of Health building in Damascus; many of its staff members are former ministry employees. A recent Reuters report on how the Assad government uses red tape and threats to prevent the provision of aid in opposition areas has raised doubts about the ability of the W.H.O. to act with impartiality.'b'The W.H.O., working with the Syrian government, excluded Deir al-Zour from a polio vaccination drive that began in December 2012. According to the W.H.O., the province \xe2\x80\x9cwas not included in the campaign as the majority of its residents have relocated to other areas in the country.\xe2\x80\x9d Ten months later, this was the province where polio re-emerged.'b'There is no evidence that most of the province\xe2\x80\x99s one million residents had, in fact, migrated. The United Nations World Food Program continued to distribute food there throughout 2012 and 2013 (with occasional interruptions because of worsening security conditions). In December 2012, the agency reached 69,000 people in Deir al-Zour.'b'Last month, an investigation by the German weekly newsmagazine Der Spiegel charged the W.H.O. with obstructing the testing of polio samples from the Deir al-Zour region. These samples had been presented by an agency working under the aegis of the Syrian National Coalition. It took nearly a month to get the test results \xe2\x80\x94 positive for poliomyelitis \xe2\x80\x94 and then only from an independent provider in Turkey. By that time, thousands of displaced people had moved within Syria or fled as refugees to neighboring countries, most likely spreading the disease.'b'The latest draft of a W.H.O. situation report for Syria reveals that it took three months for the W.H.O. and the Syrian Health Ministry to confirm a polio case detected in Aleppo in July 2013. It was then some weeks before a nationwide vaccination campaign began.'b'The consequences of these delays and failures now reach well beyond Syria\xe2\x80\x99s borders. Lebanon and Jordan, where a large proportion of Syrian refugees have fled, are particularly at risk. Their public health systems are already overloaded and underfunded. Unicef figures for immunization from the Lebanese Health Ministry indicate that only 77 percent of the population had been routinely covered for polio in recent years, placing thousands of Lebanese children at risk. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the Unicef figures are correct, then this would be far too low to keep an introduced infection at bay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Professor Martin Eichner, a disease expert at the University of T\xc3\xbcbingen, Germany. \xe2\x80\x9cWith 4,000 Syrian refugees a day leaving the country, and the majority entering Lebanon, the virus is already in Lebanon or they will get it sometime soon.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There is also no discernible plan for delivering vaccination coverage to the hundreds of tented settlements that house as many as 200,000 Syrian refugees across Lebanon.'b'The emergency is not limited to polio. While Syria\xe2\x80\x99s polio outbreak has been making headlines, other communicable diseases like hepatitis A, the parasitic infection leishmaniasis, typhoid and measles have all been rising. Chronic and noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and cancer have also been silently killing Syrians by the tens of thousands. We know from previous crises that up to 80 percent of excess deaths are attributable to wider health conditions during and after a conflict.'b'The situation is extremely challenging, but humanitarian agencies in the region should be independent and transparent. There are very real challenges for United Nations staff members working in Syria, but the World Health Organization must respond to the claims that it refused to test the Deir al-Zour polio samples, explain why it took three months to confirm a suspected case in July 2013 and give a better account of why the area was excluded from its vaccination drive.'b'Anything short of this disclosure risks causing more preventable deaths, not just in Syria but across the entire region.'b''b'\n'b'Adam P.

Both developments will improve Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security. But Israel\xe2\x80\x99s top officials are not yet convinced.'b'Most notably, the linkage eludes Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He has condemned the Iran deal signed in Geneva, and his anger about that agreement had a negative impact on his latest discussions with Secretary of State John Kerry about the Palestinian talks, according to Israeli press reports.'b'Mr. Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s insistence in identifying Iran as a threat and calling for tougher sanctions has had some positive effects. Over time, it eventually helped push Iran back to negotiations, and in a weaker position. And the prime minister was right when he encouraged suspicion regarding the new Iranian leadership; until proven otherwise, Iran still presents itself to the region as a dangerous combination of religious radicalism, ambitions for regional dominance and aspirations for a strategic arsenal.'b'But Mr. Netanyahu is dead wrong in not understanding that the road to dealing with Tehran goes through Ramallah, and that time is running out not only for halting Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear weapons program but also for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Moreover, he fails to comprehend that maintaining the status quo on the Palestinian question poses a major obstacle to progress on the Iranian issue.'b'He needs to recognize that the Middle East is changing rapidly, and that the changes offer new opportunities.'b'Today\xe2\x80\x99s Middle East is a complex mosaic of clashes: between and within civilizations, between pragmatism and radicalism, between Sunni Islam and Shiite Islam. Furthermore, the power relationship between leadership and the Arab street has changed dramatically: Leaders are weaker, and it is the street that now dictates many political decisions.'b'Sunni countries in the Middle East and the Gulf are worried about Iran and the Shiite quest for dominance, about terror and political radicalism, and about the introduction of nuclear weapons by any country or movement seeking regional hegemony. Those widely shared fears create an opportunity to form a quiet regional coalition led by Saudi Arabia and Turkey and implicitly coordinated with the United States. Such a pragmatic partnership could confront Iran, block the Iran-Syria-Hezbollah axis, shape the future of Syria and restore America\xe2\x80\x99s influence in the region. The Gulf countries and Jordan could also be part of such a coalition. Egypt, now consumed by its internal problems, would likely join, or at least not oppose it.'b'But such a broad partnership is unlikely without tangible progress on the Israeli-Palestinian track. Even though the Palestinian issue seems marginal in comparison with the other struggles in the Middle East, it is still considered by Arabs as the key grievance against the West, and the main reason for instability in the Middle East. Progress in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, or the lack of it, is widely viewed in the street as a measure of American power.'b'Right now, the talks are deadlocked. We urgently need to find another way to show tangible progress on the Israeli-Palestinian track through other means, while paving the way for a two-state solution in the future.'b'Therefore, parallel to the negotiations, Israel should be taking independent steps to create the outlines of a two-state reality on the ground. It should declare that it has no sovereignty claims over areas east of the security fence it built in the West Bank. It should enact a voluntary evacuation and compensation law for the settlers who live in these areas. The future of those settlers who decide to stay will be determined when a final status agreement is signed. An in order to avoid repeating the failure of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s 2005 withdrawal from Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces would maintain control in the areas being voluntarily evacuated, until the agreement is reached.'b'This approach would require Mr. Netanyahu to reshuffle his coalition, and if he does so, his own party would likely split. I believe he is capable of taking these steps, and he should. Doing so would help build a regional coalition to thwart Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear weapons and hegemonic ambitions, and he would ensure Israel\xe2\x80\x99s future as a secure democratic home for the Jewish people.'b'President Obama understands the connection between the Palestinian and Iranian issues. That\xe2\x80\x99s why he announced in his United Nations speech in September that \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s diplomatic efforts will focus on two particular issues: Iran\xe2\x80\x99s pursuit of nuclear weapons and the Arab-Israeli conflict.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Each of those issues presents an existential threat to Israel. If Mr. Netanyahu keeps refusing to recognize that linking the two is the only way to deal with both, Israelis should vote him out of office in favor of somebody who sees the Middle East, and Israel\xe2\x80\x99s opportunities, for what they are.'b''b'\n'b'Ami Ayalon'b' is a former director of the Israeli Security Agency (Shin Bet) and a co-founder of the Israeli nonpartisan organization Blue White Future.'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'In \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Members of Jewish Student Group Test Permissible Discussion on Israel'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (news article, Dec. 30), you state: \xe2\x80\x9cHillel, whose core mission is to keep the next generation of Jews in the fold, says that under its auspices one thing is not open to debate: Those who reject or repudiate Israel have no place.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'First, Hillel\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccore mission,\xe2\x80\x9d clearly expressed on our website, is to build an enduring \xe2\x80\x9ccommitment to Jewish life, learning and Israel.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Second, all Jewish students have a place at Hillel.

Mr. Sinclair calls his method \xe2\x80\x9cpharmacological extinction.\xe2\x80\x9d When people drink while taking naltrexone, the drug blocks the rewards produced by drinking and the cravings diminish. In published research, Mr. Sinclair has claimed a 'b'78 percent success rate'b' in reducing drinking. A drug similar to naltrexone, nalmefene, was recently approved in Europe to help heavy drinkers moderate their habits.'b'In reporting my book on women and drinking, I found that many women were successful in changing their drinking habits by using Moderation Management, a free nonprofit support group for nondependent problem drinkers who want to control their consumption. Using the techniques of cognitive behavioral therapy, M.M. encourages members to take \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal responsibility for choosing and maintaining their own path, whether 'b'moderation'b' or abstinence.\xe2\x80\x9d It instructs drinkers to abstain for 30 days, reintroduce alcohol while evaluating the effects of drinking, and then stick within limits (for women, that\xe2\x80\x99s nine drinks a week, no more than three on any day).'b'This approach isn\xe2\x80\x99t for severely dependent drinkers, for whom abstinence might be best. But it\xe2\x80\x99s been empirically shown to work for those on the more moderate end of the spectrum who outnumber dependent drinkers by about four to one \xe2\x80\x94 including the majority of women who drink too much. While the ratio of men to women in A.A. is roughly 2:1, that figure is reversed among users of an evidence-based Internet application at 'b'moderatedrinking.com'b'. The website helps drinkers set limits, self-monitor while they\xe2\x80\x99re drinking, get feedback on their progress and identify and manage triggers to overdrinking. Reid K. Hester, director of research at Behavior Therapy Associates, which designed the program, says heavy drinkers are more likely to be honest about their consumption when they know they won\xe2\x80\x99t be reproached.'b'Few master these skills overnight, Mr. Hester says, but most learn healthier habits within six months. And mistakes can be lessons, not failures.'b'We don\xe2\x80\x99t treat cancer, depression or asthma with the same tools we used in 1935. We need to get away from the one-size-fits-all approach to drinking problems.'b'PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti \xe2\x80\x94 She was a 13-year-old girl who said she was beaten daily by strangers who forced her to work unpaid in their home, and she wanted to escape.'b'Marilaine was one of 200,000 or more Haitian children 'b'called restaveks'b', typically serving as unpaid maids in strangers\xe2\x80\x99 homes, working for room and board. It is a vast system of child trafficking that is often characterized as a modern form of slavery. I followed Marilaine for a week in Haiti as she tried to flee, find her parents and start life over \xe2\x80\x94 and this is her story.'b'Marilaine grew up in a remote village where no family planning or public schooling is available, one of 12 children to impoverished parents who later separated. As Marilaine tells the story, one day when she was 10 years old, she walked to her father\xe2\x80\x99s house to ask him to help pay her school fees. Instead, he dispatched her here to the capital to work as a restavek, a Creole term used to describe child laborers, without even telling her mother.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy father didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to spend money on my school fees,\xe2\x80\x9d Marilaine explained.'b'As is common for restaveks, Marilaine slept on the floor and woke up at 5 each morning to clean the house, fetch water and wash dishes. She says she was beaten daily with electrical cords.'b'Marilaine was allowed no contact with her family. Once, she says, she tried to run away but was caught and beaten. At school, she often cried, and she had scars on her arms and legs from beatings.'b'Yet the restavek system isn\xe2\x80\x99t always slavery. Sometimes the child gets more food and education than would have been the case in her own family (two-thirds of restaveks are girls). Marilaine says that she was fed properly and that she was also allowed to attend a free afternoon school.'b'Many Haitian restaveks are treated much worse. One 12-year-old restavek I interviewed said that she rises at 4 each morning to get everything ready for \xe2\x80\x9cthe princesses,\xe2\x80\x9d as she calls the teenage girls in the house. Everyone in the house beats her, she says, and they refuse to let her see her mother for fear that she might run away.'b'An aid group called the 'b'Restavek Freedom Foundation'b' helped Marilaine escape her home and find refuge in a safe house for restaveks. The mood was festive in the beautiful home as the dozen girls living there cheered Marilaine\xe2\x80\x99s arrival and hugged her.'b'Marilaine picked up a book, telling me that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to touch books at her old house. She tried on new clothes. She slept in a bed.'b'But the family that Marilaine had been working for was furious. I visited the woman of the house, and she insisted that she had never beaten the girl and that Marilaine had in effect been kidnapped from her.'b'The leader of the neighborhood association, Junior Pataud, offered a conflicting defense. \xe2\x80\x9cIn Haitian culture, it\xe2\x80\x99s normal to beat a child,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s not the same as mistreatment.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The next day, the neighbors gathered angrily outside the school Marilaine had attended, blaming it for the girl\xe2\x80\x99s escape and threatening to set fire to it unless Marilaine was returned. After hours of tense negotiations, the police averted a riot.'b'A few days later, I drove for several hours with the police and the Restavek Freedom Foundation to Marilaine\xe2\x80\x99s village. When Marilaine stepped out of the car, family members and neighbors were stunned. They had assumed that she had died years ago.'b'Yet the reunion was a letdown. Marilaine\xe2\x80\x99s mom didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem at all thrilled to see her daughter again, and Marilaine quickly made it clear that she wanted to return to the safe house in the capital so that she could attend a good school. The police told Marilaine that she would have to stay in the village with her family, and she burst into tears.'b'The authorities will probably eventually let Marilaine return to the Restavek Freedom Foundation safe house, but the episode was a reminder that helping people is a complex, uphill task \xe2\x80\x94 and that the underlying problem behind human trafficking is poverty.'b'One way to fight such human trafficking would be to provide free and accessible birth control, so that women like Marilaine\xe2\x80\x99s mother don\xe2\x80\x99t end up with 12 children that they struggle to feed.'b'Another would be to provide free public education, so that parents don\xe2\x80\x99t feel that the only way to get schooling for their children is to send them off as restaveks.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake in fighting global poverty isn\xe2\x80\x99t just poor people\xe2\x80\x99s incomes. It\xe2\x80\x99s also dignity and freedom \xe2\x80\x94 and the right of a girl to grow up in something better than quasi slavery.'b'My New Year\xe2\x80\x99s wish: May Marilaine in 2014 finally find freedom and an education.'b'Aided by a vast flow of corporate and right-wing money, Republicans have spent years persuading the public that the deficit is the nation\xe2\x80\x99s biggest financial problem and that austerity is the answer to it. Their success in making that argument \xe2\x80\x94 keeping taxes and government investment low \xe2\x80\x94 has helped increase American income inequality to crisis proportions: 95 percent of the income gains since 2009 have gone to the top 1 percent. The majority of the country has stagnated or lost ground, leaving the economy sluggish.'b'Democrats have largely been passive or defensive as all the wage increases flowed upward, but they have vowed to take a more aggressive stand this year. Last week, they announced 'b'a nationwide campaign in 2014 for a higher minimum wage'b', showing how it would help the economy and reduce inequality, while highlighting the cost of the adamant Republican opposition to the idea. They also plan to press for wage-increase referendums in states with crucial Congressional races this November.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s smart politics. 'b'More than three-quarters of Americans'b' support a wage higher than the current $7.25 an hour, and Republicans will be hard-pressed to explain why they oppose it. The issue might bring people to the polls who would otherwise be indifferent to midterm Congressional elections.'b'But more important, it\xe2\x80\x99s good economics, and it would benefit tens of millions of people. Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour by 2016, as 'b'the current Democratic bill'b' would do, would directly or indirectly increase the take-home pay of 27.8 million workers, 'b'according to the Economic Policy Institute'b', adding $35 billion in greater wages through 2016. The resulting increase in gross domestic product would create 85,000 new jobs.'b'The minimum wage would still not go high enough, fast enough. If it had kept pace with inflation, 'b'it would now be $10.77 an hour.'b' But at least the Democratic bill, sponsored by Representative George Miller of California and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, would, for the first time, automatically index the wage to inflation each year after 2016.'b'Republicans have reflexively opposed any mandate that would force their business supporters to reward workers for the increased productivity. 'b'Some want to abolish the minimum wage'b' altogether. In March, every Republican in the House 'b'voted against a measure'b' to raise the minimum wage. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you raise the price of employment, guess what happens? You get less of it,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'said Speaker John Boehner'b' in February, espousing a party-line theory that most economists agree 'b'has been discredited'b'.'b'This campaign, if Democrats fully pursue it, could help demonstrate to voters how intransigent Republicans have been on the most fundamental and popular elements of a strong recovery. Most do not even acknowledge that the country has an inequality problem, and they have systematically worked to deny those at the bottom and in the middle from access to food stamps, health insurance and unemployment benefits. It\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that the only thing Republicans want to discuss are the stumbles of health care reform. An aggressive stand on inequality issues could knock them out of that loop.'b'As important as a minimum-wage increase would be, Democrats shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop there. It would be heartening to see the party give the same support to other aspects of Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s inequality agenda, including universal preschool, career and technical education, infrastructure investment and stronger collective-bargaining laws. But working toward a decent paycheck is a good place to start.'b'Seven months ago, the world began to learn 'b'the vast scope of the National Security Agency\xe2\x80\x99s reach into the lives of hundreds of millions of people'b' in the United States and around the globe, as it collects information about their phone calls, their email messages, their friends and contacts, how they spend their days and where they spend their nights. The public learned in great detail how the agency has exceeded its mandate and abused its authority, prompting outrage at kitchen tables and at the desks of Congress, which may finally begin to limit these practices.'b'The revelations have already prompted two federal judges to accuse the N.S.A. of violating the Constitution (although a third, unfortunately, 'b'found the dragnet surveillance to be legal'b'). A panel appointed by President Obama 'b'issued a powerful indictment'b' of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s invasions of privacy and called for a major overhaul of its operations.'b'All of this is entirely because of information provided to journalists by Edward Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who stole a trove of highly classified documents after he became disillusioned with the agency\xe2\x80\x99s voraciousness. Mr. Snowden is now living in Russia, on the run from American charges of espionage and theft, and he faces the prospect of spending the rest of his life looking over his shoulder.'b'Considering the enormous value of the information he has revealed, and the abuses he has exposed, Mr. Snowden deserves better than a life of permanent exile, fear and flight. He may have committed a crime to do so, but he has done his country a great service. It is time for the United States to offer Mr. Snowden a plea bargain or some form of clemency that would allow him to return home, face at least substantially reduced punishment in light of his role as a whistle-blower, and have the hope of a life advocating for greater privacy and far stronger oversight of the runaway intelligence community.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2'b'Mr. Snowden is currently charged 'b'in a criminal complaint'b' with two violations of the Espionage Act involving unauthorized communication of classified information, and a charge of theft of government property. Those three charges 'b'carry prison sentences of 10 years each'b', and when the case is presented to a grand jury for indictment, the government is virtually certain to add more charges, probably adding up to a life sentence that Mr. Snowden is understandably trying to avoid.'b''b'The president said in August'b' that Mr. Snowden should come home to face those charges in court and suggested that if Mr. Snowden had wanted to avoid criminal charges he could have simply told his superiors about the abuses, acting, in other words, as a whistle-blower.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf the concern was that somehow this was the only way to get this information out to the public, I signed an executive order well before Mr. Snowden leaked this information that provided whistle-blower protection to the intelligence community for the first time,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama said at a news conference. \xe2\x80\x9cSo there were other avenues available for somebody whose conscience was stirred and thought that they needed to question government actions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In fact, 'b'that executive order'b' did not apply to contractors, only to intelligence employees, rendering its protections useless to Mr. Snowden. More important, 'b'Mr. Snowden told The Washington Post earlier this month'b' that he did report his misgivings to two superiors at the agency, showing them the volume of data collected by the N.S.A., and that they took no action. (The N.S.A. says there is no evidence of this.) That\xe2\x80\x99s almost certainly because the agency and its leaders don\xe2\x80\x99t consider these collection programs to be an abuse and would never have acted on Mr. Snowden\xe2\x80\x99s concerns.'b'In retrospect, Mr. Snowden was clearly justified in believing that the only way to blow the whistle on this kind of intelligence-gathering was to expose it to the public and let the resulting furor do the work his superiors would not. Beyond the mass collection of phone and Internet data, consider just a few of the violations he revealed or the legal actions he provoked:'b'\xe2\x96\xa0 The N.S.A. broke federal privacy laws, or exceeded its authority, 'b'thousands of times per year'b', according to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s own internal auditor.'b'\xe2\x96\xa0 The agency 'b'broke into the communications links'b' of major data centers around the world, allowing it to spy on hundreds of millions of user accounts and infuriating the Internet companies that own the centers. Many of those companies are now scrambling to install systems that the N.S.A. cannot yet penetrate.'b'\xe2\x96\xa0 The N.S.A. systematically 'b'undermined the basic encryption systems of the Internet'b', making it impossible to know if sensitive banking or medical data is truly private, damaging businesses that depended on this trust.'b'\xe2\x96\xa0 His leaks revealed that James Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence,'b' lied to Congress 'b'when testifying in March that the N.S.A. was not collecting data on millions of Americans. (There has been no discussion of punishment for that lie.)'b'\xe2\x96\xa0 The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court 'b'rebuked the N.S.A.'b' for repeatedly providing misleading information about its surveillance practices, according to a ruling made public because of the Snowden documents. One of the practices violated the Constitution, according to the chief judge of the court.'b'\xe2\x96\xa0 A federal district judge 'b'ruled earlier this month'b' that the phone-records-collection program probably violates the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution. He called the program \xe2\x80\x9calmost Orwellian\xe2\x80\x9d and said there was no evidence that it stopped any imminent act of terror.'b'The shrill brigade of his critics say Mr. Snowden has done profound damage to intelligence operations of the United States, but none has presented the slightest proof that his disclosures really hurt the nation\xe2\x80\x99s security. Many of the mass-collection programs Mr. Snowden exposed would work just as well if they were reduced in scope and brought under strict outside oversight, as the presidential panel recommended.'b'When someone reveals that government officials have routinely and deliberately broken the law, that person should not face life in prison at the hands of the same government. That\xe2\x80\x99s why Rick Ledgett, who leads the N.S.A.\xe2\x80\x99s task force on the Snowden leaks, 'b'recently told CBS News'b' that he would consider amnesty if Mr. Snowden would stop any additional leaks. And it\xe2\x80\x99s why President Obama should tell his aides to begin finding a way to end Mr. Snowden\xe2\x80\x99s vilification and give him an incentive to return home.'b'LILONGWE, Malawi \xe2\x80\x94 Who is responsible when the trunks of government officials\xe2\x80\x99 cars are stuffed with bank notes while public hospitals are short on life-saving supplies?'b'In Malawi, a landlocked southern African state where more than half the population lives on a dollar a day, blame has fallen on the reformer: President Joyce Banda. Malawi is reeling from a $50 million corruption scandal that has seen Ms. Banda\xe2\x80\x99s budget director shot in the face (he survived) and her justice minister charged with attempted murder (he\xe2\x80\x99s out on bail).'b'Cashgate, as the affair is called, is dwarfed in size by the corruption of earlier administrations: Government investigators believe $500 million in donor money was lost to graft during the eight-year reign of Ms. Banda\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor. But the scam stands out for its brazenness and its violence.'b'It also stands out for the president\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to jail her own officials for their alleged involvement: Sixty-eight people have been arrested since the looting was discovered in September, Ms. Banda said in an interview with a group of foreign journalists, myself among them, at her official residence on Dec. 13.'b'The president is eager to convince Malawians that she is uniquely placed to battle her country\xe2\x80\x99s ills. But more than a year and a half into her tenure it looks like the system she talks of reforming may be her downfall.'b'Ms. Banda became president in April 2012 after the incumbent, Bingu wa Mutharika, died of a heart attack. In the eyes of Western governments, she was a dream successor: focused on health and development, untainted by corruption.'b'The daughter of a musician in the Malawi police band, Ms. Banda started a private girls\xe2\x80\x99 school and a charitable foundation before entering government as minister for gender and community services in 2004 and then serving as foreign minister. Mr. Mutharika used to rage against \xe2\x80\x9cimperialists\xe2\x80\x9d and persecute gays, and Malawi\xe2\x80\x99s G.D.P. dropped by nearly 15 percent during his second term. But Ms. Banda, who was elected vice president in 2009, talked of bringing down maternal mortality and improving education. She was embraced by President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.'b'Then came Cashgate. A coterie of officials, senior bureaucrats and businessmen allegedly stole from the public treasury using a computerized system that allowed them to erase all record of the theft. Unlike past corruption, which typically involved over-invoicing and kickbacks, this was direct theft from government accounts. Soon Malawi\xe2\x80\x99s treasury felt a chill: Donor states started withholding aid, which makes up 40 percent of the country\xe2\x80\x99s budget.'b'Nothing seizes attention like a senior official with a bullet wound. But in Malawi political graft is just one facet of a broken administration: Corruption is both a product and a driver of poor governance; the looser the system, the easier it is to steal from it. According to two people familiar with the backdrop to Cashgate, Malawi\xe2\x80\x99s Finance Ministry had not attempted to balance the national checkbook for more than two years before the scandal was uncovered.'b'Penalties for corruption have traditionally been low, while the pressure on bureaucrats to profit illicitly has been intense. In a 2002 paper, the anthropologist Gerhard Anders described a stifling culture of corruption: \xe2\x80\x9cMany civil servants I have talked to emphasized the choking atmosphere of distrust, social control and strength of the unofficial code of conduct in the government\xe2\x80\x99s offices.\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Banda alluded to this in 'b'a November interview with The Daily Telegraph'b': \xe2\x80\x9cFor every one I have arrested,\xe2\x80\x9d she said of government crooks, \xe2\x80\x9cI have lost a whole village of votes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the public health sector, despite years of looting, Malawi only recently began work on a modern inventory-control system. In February the health minister admitted that Malawi\xe2\x80\x99s central medical stores held only 5 percent of the drugs they were supposed to stock.'b'Grace Chiudzu, chief of obstetrics at Kamuzu Central Hospital in the capital, recited a list of shortages to me during a visit last month. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m missing gloves; I\xe2\x80\x99m missing amoxicillin; I\xe2\x80\x99m missing augmentin; I\xe2\x80\x99m missing pethedine,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the system.\xe2\x80\x9d The week before, she had watched a young woman die for want of a blood transfusion following complications from childbirth.'b'For this, Dr. Chiudzu blamed not corruption but an overcentralized state: The hospital is barred from buying supplies itself, yet the Health Ministry, which holds all the procurement power, is unable to meet needs.'b'Ms. Banda appeared to agree that poor governance was as lethal as corruption. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not about Cashgate,\xe2\x80\x9d she said during our December interview, referring to the underfunded health sector. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about us, as a nation, getting our priorities right.\xe2\x80\x9d (Opposition leaders say that a recent government purchase of seven military patrol boats for Lake Malawi is one misplaced priority.)'b'A general election is scheduled for May. Ms. Banda\xe2\x80\x99s prospects are undermined by high inflation, a currency devaluation that has halved the value of Malawians\xe2\x80\x99 paychecks, and the stores of cash the biggest opposition party has at its disposal. And, of course, Cash-gate occurred on Ms. Banda\xe2\x80\x99s watch: Arrests and prosecutions notwithstanding, the scandal belongs to her.'b'Ms. Banda appears to be steeling herself for a noble defeat. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the ills of these 50 years that have drawn Malawians backward must be stopped,\xe2\x80\x9d she told my colleagues and me. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever comes my way, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b' 'b'Dan Morrison 'b' is a journalist and the author of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Black Nile.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'TOKYO \xe2\x80\x94 Last month the Diet passed the 'b'so-called Special Secrets Protection Bill'b'. The law does not define what a \xe2\x80\x9cspecial secret\xe2\x80\x9d is, but whoever leaks one may be imprisoned for up to 10 years. A journalist who merely tries to obtain information the government views as sensitive could be sentenced to five years in jail.'b'The law, which was proposed by the cabinet of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe only in August, has been widely criticized in Japan and abroad, sparking large protests in Tokyo.'b'Many of its opponents have noted that it recalls the infamous Peace Preservation Act of 1925, which the imperial government used to suppress dissent through World War II. The comparison is apt in more than one way. The Peace Preservation Act was passed when Japan was still reeling from the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, which had left Tokyo in ruins. Today, the country is still reeling from the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku, and the ensuing nuclear disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.'b'Immediately after the secrets law was passed, people observed on Twitter and other social media that the Abe administration\xe2\x80\x99s move was a version of what Naomi Klein calls the \xe2\x80\x9cshock doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d: the practice among politicians and corporations of exploiting the fear and disorientation that follow natural disasters and other major \xe2\x80\x9cshocks\xe2\x80\x9d to push through controversial policies \xe2\x80\x94 giving a second, supposedly therapeutic shock to the system.'b'This, too, seems like a fairly accurate appraisal. At the same time, the secrecy bill is far from the only \xe2\x80\x9cshocking\xe2\x80\x9d news item to have surfaced in Japan since the triple disasters of 2011.'b'Ever since then the Japanese government has provided the media with a steady diet of major, almost all-consuming issues, and the media have obligingly lurched from one to the next. From May to August 2011, news coverage focused on the efforts of members of Prime Minister Naoto Kan\xe2\x80\x99s party to force him out of office after he ordered the shutdown of a nuclear power plant in Hamaoka. The rest of the year was dominated by news of the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps Air Station at Futenma, on Okinawa.'b'During the first half of 2012 the big issue was Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda\xe2\x80\x99s push to pass an unexpected increase in the sales tax. By August 2012, it was tensions between Japan and South Korea after President Lee Myung-bak\xe2\x80\x99s visit to islands that both countries claim as their own. The following month, relations with China soured, when the Japanese government announced its intention to purchase contested islands. And it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped: Just the other day, Mr. Abe created another crisis by 'b'visiting Yasukuni Shrine'b', becoming the first sitting prime minister to do so since 2006.'b'The adoption of the special secrets bill, in other words, is merely one in a series of supposedly pressing issues that have dominated national discourse in Japan. I say \xe2\x80\x9csupposedly pressing\xe2\x80\x9d because there was, in fact, no compelling reason for the government or the media to give these issues such prominence when they did. The sales tax could have been raised later. The territorial dispute with China could have been kept under wraps. No urgent matter of national security made it necessary to railroad the special secrets law through Parliament.'b'Meanwhile, the one problem that can\xe2\x80\x99t wait is being pushed into the background. Nearly three years have passed since the earthquake-tsunami-nuclear accident, and almost 280,000 evacuees from the contaminated areas of Fukushima \xe2\x80\x94 about 60 percent of the original number \xe2\x80\x94 are still living in temporary housing. Little progress has been made toward decommissioning units 1 through 4 at the Fukushima Daiichi plant; they continue to produce 400 tons of contaminated water every day, some of which is flowing into the sea.'b'The government\xe2\x80\x99s first priority should be to clean up the nuclear contamination and present Japanese voters with a long-term energy strategy and new economic vision. Anyone can see that these are the truly pressing issues \xe2\x80\x94 anyone, that is, who isn\xe2\x80\x99t looking away.'b'In this sense, describing what has been happening in Japan since 2011 as a version of Ms. Klein\xe2\x80\x99s shock doctrine is only half right. The Japanese government \xe2\x80\x94 first the Democratic Party of Japan, now the Liberal Democratic Party \xe2\x80\x94 may have been exploiting people\xe2\x80\x99s fears and disorientation to push through unpopular policies, but the media and society as a whole have been collaborating with it, even if unconsciously.'b'The French call this \xe2\x80\x9cla fuite en avant,\xe2\x80\x9d or the forward flight. Fleeing forward is what you are doing when you plunge from one issue to the next, constantly creating new emergencies in order to avoid confronting a more serious and intractable problem. It is what Japan is doing when it averts its eyes from the possibility that, as some have speculated, it may take 20 years and 200 trillion yen to recover fully from the damage of 2011.'b'Or maybe the recovery will take more time and more money. No one really knows, because the Japanese government has yet to release official estimates.

But they share the conviction that the European Union must go.'b'Which would be a shame. The European Union may grind out far too many regulations, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t responsible for the current economic slump. And it has brought good things to its member countries. The \xe2\x80\x9cfour freedoms\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 free movement of goods, capital, services and people \xe2\x80\x94 help member economies, as Britain would soon find out if it left.'b'Without a common agriculture policy, Europe would be swamped by cheap imports, and farmers would go out of business. From competition to food safety, the environment, safety at work, the length of court proceedings and conditions in prisons, it is the European Union that sets the standards. Even soccer\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League would be a shade less exciting without the 1995 Bosman ruling, which allowed footballers, just like any other European worker, to move freely across the union.'b'Europe\xe2\x80\x99s voters take all this for granted. Instead, they blame the union for budget restrictions and austerity measures. Europe may be slowly sorting out its banking mess, but the European Union still gets the blame for youth unemployment.

Not necessarily. If a political storm is on its way, that is good news: Europe needs a good fright to find its courage. The European Union functions by transforming fear into energy. When things go quiet, Europeans tend to sit back and bellyache.'b'Over the last century, there have been four major, salutary scares, each of which has pushed Europe closer together.'b'The first followed World War II. Fearing another war might be possible, the former enemies linked together their coal and steel production, in 1951, and then their economies, with the 1957 Treaty of Rome.'b'A second scare followed the oil crisis and the economic slump of the 1970s. Brussels started to construct a single market, which was initiated in 1992 and has worked well ever since.'b'The third scare came with the fall of Communism from 1989 to 1991. Having no idea about what to do with all those new democracies on its eastern borders, the European Union panicked, as usual. Then it took a flier and significantly enlarged its membership.'b'The fourth scare followed the financial crisis of 2008-9. Many in London and the United States predicted the collapse of the euro, which didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen. New rules for national budgets avoided a major crisis. Today, banking and fiscal unification are on the way.'b'Now another Europe-bracing scare looms. Those Euroskeptic parties are likely to do well in European parliamentary elections in May, which will serve to concentrate minds. Do we care about Europe? Then let\xe2\x80\x99s say so, loud and clear.'b'The so-called Erasmus generation \xe2\x80\x94 the millions of young men and women who spent their 20s sharing offices, labs, lecture halls, apartments and beds across the European Union \xe2\x80\x94 is coming of age.

'b''b'There is a last-minute rush by three advanced economies in East Asia to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement that could be concluded this spring. Japan barely made the deadline to become a negotiating member last summer, while Taiwan and South Korea have announced interest in joining once a trade pact is established.'b'The trade talks began in 2010, and there are now 12 members: the United States, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile, New Zealand, Australia, Brunei, Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia and Japan. They account for 40 percent of the world economy.'b'The interests of Japan, Taiwan and South Korea are not about reducing barriers to trade, which are already low. And South Korea, for one, will soon enjoy bilateral free trade agreements with all the economies in the Trans-Pacific Partnership except Japan and Mexico.'b'The partnership is of interest because it is more than a trade deal. Members will be asked to review and restructure the way their domestic economies function, with new rules covering intellectual property rights, regulatory coherence, environmental standards, labor practices and state-owned enterprises. It turns out, for instance, that Japan is eager to restructure the economically inefficient yet politically powerful agricultural sector, and hopes the new rules will help it do so. South Korea wants to use partnership to liberalize its economy, now dominated by 30 family-owned conglomerates, including Samsung and Hyundai, that generate 80 percent of its domestic product. Moreover, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea are mature societies, with older, traditional economic structure. The hope is that foreign pressure can accelerate the difficult task of restructuring and challenging vested interests.'b'For many of the same reasons, it would make sense for China to join the partnership. China recently announced that it would adopt more market mechanisms in an effort to reduce the economic distortions, inefficiencies and corruption of its economy dominated by monopolistic state-owned enterprises. And the partnership itself would make more sense with Chinese membership.'b'But there are pitfalls. Japan, Taiwan and South Korea want to ease rigid labor practices to make their economies more dynamic. There lies the danger of introducing income inequalities in what are now solidly middle-class societies.'b'Organic wine producers in the Burgundy region of France are facing prosecution for refusing to use pesticides. This move is perplexing given the Ministry of Agriculture\xe2\x80\x99s support for the organic wine industry and growing public alarm over pesticides in French wine.'b'The share of organically produced French wines rose from 2.6 percent in 2007 to 8.2 percent by the end of 2012. Despite this progress, France is still the third-highest user of pesticides in the world after the United States and Japan, and the highest user in Europe, applying 110,000 metric tons of pesticides per year.'b'A study in February that found pesticide residues in 90 percent of the French wines tested created an uproar. Pesticide residues were even found in organic wines, indicating contamination from neighboring vineyards or other sources. French vines are susceptible to a contagious bacterial disease, flavescence dor\xc3\xa9e, transmitted by a leafhopper. Treatment with pesticides is required by French law in several winegrowing regions, including Burgundy.'b'One organic producer in Burgundy has now been charged with breaking the law for refusing to use Pyrevert, a pyrethrin pesticide. He says there is no evidence that his vines are infected, and argues that Pyrevert, a neurotoxin, is nonspecific to leafhoppers and kills beneficial insects as well. He faces six months of prison time and a fine of 30,000 euros, or about $41,000. Another organic grower was fined 1 euro after he agreed to use pesticides.'b'France has pledged, under the 2007 Grenelle law on the environment, to reduce its pesticide consumption by 50 percent by 2018. To help meet this goal, St\xc3\xa9phane Le Foll, the minister of agriculture, announced on Nov. 13 a new sustainable agriculture bill that is scheduled to be submitted to the French Assembly in January for debate. Considering organic producers who refuse pre-emptive use of pesticides as criminals will not help France\xe2\x80\x99s transition to sustainable agricultural practices. The law requiring such use in Burgundy is not only bad policy, it is terrible publicity for French wine. The law should be changed, and the French Assembly should pass the new bill on sustainable agriculture this month.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'It was a pleasure to read your editorial suggesting that Edward J.

Decades of credible research show that women who get mammograms regularly have a 30 to 45 percent lower risk of dying from breast cancer.'b'Since mammography screening became widespread in the early 1990s, the breast cancer death rate in the United States, previously unchanged for 50 years, has dropped more than 30 percent. A recent study showed that more than 70 percent of the women who died from breast cancer at major Harvard teaching hospitals were among the 20 percent of women who were not being regularly screened. This evidence (along with much more) refutes the theory that treatment is the major reason for reduction in breast cancer deaths, and corroborates that screening results in saved lives.'b'Every medical organization experienced in breast cancer (including the American Cancer Society, American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American College of Radiology, Society of Breast Imaging and National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers) recommends annual mammograms for women ages 40 and older.'b'BARBARA MONSEES'b'\nMURRAY REBNER'b'\nSt. Louis, Jan. 1, 2014'b''b''b''b' 'b''b''b'Dr. Monsees is chairwoman of the Breast Imaging Commission of the American College of Radiology.

And so I had two mastectomies in time.'b'What did I learn from this? Complete trust in anything or anyone\xe2\x80\x94 since, of course, physicians were involved both times \xe2\x80\x94 is folly.

Most of these alarms can be resolved by a second test. The \xe2\x80\x9chigh risk\xe2\x80\x9d women can then be followed more closely, and some of them do develop breast cancer.

That means that if I don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything mean about the company, its representatives won\xe2\x80\x99t say anything unkind about me.'b'You might say, what\xe2\x80\x99s the big deal?

This means that it would probably be hard for a company to prove disparagement in the courts.'b'So if nondisparagement agreements are downright ordinary and at the same time difficult to enforce, why not sign and take the severance?'b'Because as quaint as this may seem, giving up the right to speak and write freely, even if that means speaking or writing negatively, strikes me as the unholiest of deals for a writer and an editor to accept.

We are currently analyzing N.F.L. concussion data from the 2012 and 2013 regular seasons to see if this effect obtains among professionals.\xc2\xa0'b'There are also biomechanics in nature worth exploring for today\xe2\x80\x99s athletes.'b'Bighorn sheep ritually ram their heads into each other and woodpeckers slam their heads against trees thousands of times a day with neither species\xe2\x80\x99 sustaining concussions or even much of a headache, as far as we know.

Our analysis suggests that both woodpeckers\xe2\x80\x99 and bighorns\xe2\x80\x99 brains are naturally protected with mechanisms that slow the return of blood from the head to the body \xe2\x80\x94 increasing blood volume that fills their brains\xe2\x80\x99 vascular tree, creating the Bubble Wrap effect.'b'We have observed that the woodpecker uses muscles to do this, while the sheep has hollow pneumatic horn cores attached to its respiratory system that allow it to re-breathe its air and thus increase carbon dioxide in its bloodstream, expanding its intracranial vascular tree and enhancing the Bubble Wrap effect.'b'Every week the lights come on over fields of competition around the world, brightening the lives of players and their fans. Unfortunately, every week the lights dim for too many athletes who suffer the effects of concussions despite rule changes and newer helmets. What\xe2\x80\x99s troubling for sports enthusiasts is that parents and politicians may be making the decision to limit or remove the opportunity for young people to participate in contact sports. Although we cannot play every game in Denver, the winning strategies for defeating the concussion crisis may come from research focused on recreating the safe biomechanics already in use in the animal kingdom.'b'Hurricane Sandy made a direct hit on New Jersey just over a year ago, killing 34 people and devastating much of the state\xe2\x80\x99s Atlantic coast. Now, communities that want to build sand dunes to provide protection when (not if) another storm hits are being thwarted by landowners who have refused to allow the dunes to be built on their property. Areas with dunes fared better in the storm than those without them.'b'As of last week, the state needed 2,889 property owners along the coast to agree to easements for the dunes. About one-fourth, more than 700, were holding out, many of them concerned about losing their views.'b'Because their resistance is likely to make conditions less safe for everyone, the state and some local communities are threatening to seize parts of their property \xe2\x80\x94 essentially part of their front yards \xe2\x80\x94 by eminent domain and build the dunes anyway; public safety is a legitimate reason to exercise eminent domain. It is unfair for a few to jeopardize the lives and property of so many others.'b'Gov. Chris Christie, once skeptical about using eminent domain to commandeer private property, changed his mind in this case, a spokesman explained last week. And once he made that decision, he put the full force of his office behind it. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are building these dunes, O.K.?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Christie said at a meeting of homeowners last spring. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are building these dunes whether you consent or not.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There might have been more diplomatic ways to put it, but the governor was right. In September, he signed an executive order requiring the attorney general to \xe2\x80\x9cimmediately coordinate legal action\xe2\x80\x9d to acquire the necessary easements. It\xe2\x80\x99s past time for the holdouts to do their part to protect lives and property, including their own.'b'The new year brings a positive change in the membership practices of the Boy Scouts of America. In May, delegates attending the Boy Scouts\xe2\x80\x99 national convention voted to allow openly gay boys to participate in the group\xe2\x80\x99s activities. That overdue step toward inclusion went into effect on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, a welcome \xe2\x80\x94 though incomplete \xe2\x80\x94 turn for an organization that until quite recently rejected any change in its discriminatory ways.'b'The Boy Scouts\xe2\x80\x99 reluctance to embrace gay equality has been painful to watch. The organization has hurt many youngsters and its own reputation as it has remained caught between fears of losing donors repelled by bigotry and of losing partnerships with conservative churches that sponsor a large percentage of local Cub Scout and Boy Scout groups. But while the new membership policy caused some churches to end their sponsorship, no mass exodus has materialized. Mormon and Roman Catholic churches are continuing to participate.'b'Unfortunately, the organization still refuses to fully renounce discrimination, and will continue to prohibit gay and lesbian adults from serving as troop leaders. This will perpetuate the idea that gays are inferior and that being gay is inconsistent with the Boy Scout values of strong moral character and leadership. It also means that gay youngsters who excel as scouts will be denied the chance to serve as pack or troop leaders when they turn 18.'b'We have hope that Robert Gates, a former Eagle Scout and former defense secretary slated to begin a two-year term as president of the national organization in May, will agree that the ban on gay troop leaders is unacceptable and see that it is quickly ended. During his time at the Pentagon, Mr. Gates 'b'supported'b' President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s call to end the unjust \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d policy that barred gay men and women from serving openly in the military, a record he should build upon by eradicating similar discrimination in scouting.'b'The Justice Department is expected to file a brief on Friday in opposition to Justice Sonia Sotomayor\xe2\x80\x99s perplexing 'b'decision to issue a temporary injunction'b' against requiring an order of Colorado nuns to fill out paperwork required by the health care reform law\xe2\x80\x99s contraception mandate.'b'A careful review of the matter should persuade Justice Sotomayor and her Supreme Court colleagues, who may also become involved now, that the alleged threat to religious liberty is nonexistent and the stay should be lifted while litigation proceeds in the lower courts.'b'In November, the Supreme Court agreed to hear two challenges to the birth control mandate brought by secular, profit-making companies seeking to elevate the religious views of company owners over societal interests and the well-being of employees.'b'The Colorado nuns\xe2\x80\x99 group, the Little Sisters of the Poor, is a religiously affiliated organization that is exempt from the health law\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that employer insurance plans cover contraception without a co-pay. The audacious complaint in this case is against the requirement that such groups sign a short form certifying that they have religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive services, a copy of which would go to their third-party insurance administrator. The nuns say that minor requirement infringes on religious exercise in violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.'b'Under that law, the federal government may not \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially burden a person\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of religion\xe2\x80\x9d unless the government demonstrates that the burden is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling interest. The certification requirement, an accommodation fashioned by the Obama administration to bolster the protection of religious exercise without depriving women of an important benefit, does not rise to a substantial burden. A federal trial court denied a preliminary injunction on that basis and a federal court of appeals declined to issue an injunction pending appeal, though decisions in some similar cases have come out differently.'b'Adding a level of absurdity to the controversy, Little Sisters of the Poor\xe2\x80\x99s insurance plan qualifies as a self-insured \xe2\x80\x9cchurch plan\xe2\x80\x9d under an insurance statute known as Erisa. The Justice Department has conceded that it has no authority to compel a third-party administrator of such a plan to provide contraceptive coverage. In this case, contraceptives would not be made available even indirectly to the nuns\xe2\x80\x99 employees.'b'Like the cases of the private employers, the suit by the nuns\xe2\x80\x99 group boils down to an unjustified attempt by an employer to impose its religious views on workers.'b'Mayor Bill de Blasio took 'b'charge of New York City on Wednesday'b' with a forceful 'b'Inaugural Address'b' and pledged to begin the head-on attack on \xe2\x80\x9cthe inequality crisis\xe2\x80\x9d as he had promised. He repeated the bullet points from his campaign, but insisted that progressive talking would now give way to progressive governing, without dilution or dithering. \xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t wait,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. de Blasio said again and again. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll do it now.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It was an encouraging moment, as the mayor vowed to make New York a better, fairer place for everyone.'b'Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s words carried an indictment: the city had become unjust and unlivable for too many of the poor and working class. But he tempered this complaint, as he should have, with a New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day call to civic unity and optimism. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will succeed as One City,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Too bad the speakers on stage with him didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the unity part, marring the event with backward-looking speeches both graceless and smug. Worst among them, but hardly alone, was the new public advocate, Letitia James, who used her moment for her own head-on attack: on the 12 years of Mayor Michael Bloomberg. In doing so, she made a prop of a 12-year-old girl named Dasani, who had to hold the Bible and Ms. James\xe2\x80\x99s hand as Ms. James called for a government \xe2\x80\x9cthat cares more about a child going hungry than a new stadium or a new tax credit for a luxury development.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Dasani was profiled in a recent series of articles in 'b'The Times'b' illustrating how bad things get for homeless families in the shelter system. Ms. James turned her into Exhibit A of an Inauguration Day prosecution: the People v. Mayor Bloomberg. So did the pastor whose invocation likened New York to a \xe2\x80\x9cplantation,\xe2\x80\x9d and Harry Belafonte, who strangely laid the problem of America\xe2\x80\x99s crowded prisons at the feet of the former mayor, an utterly bogus claim, while saying Mr. Bloomberg shared responsibility for the nation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply Dickensian justice system.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Bloomberg had his mistakes and failures, but he was not a cartoon Gilded Age villain. He deserved better than pointless and tacky haranguing from speakers eager to parrot Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s campaign theme. It was up to former President Bill Clinton, ad-libbing some gracious thanks to Mr. Bloomberg, and Mr. de Blasio, who did the same, to try to bring the event back to a grown-up level.'b'The low and high points of Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s ceremony well illustrate the challenge for the mayor. There is frustration and a hunger for a new direction in the city. That\xe2\x80\x99s why Mr. de Blasio was elected. But as he promises to take \xe2\x80\x9cdead aim\xe2\x80\x9d against problems as vast and daunting as inequality and injustice, he is boldly raising expectations for sweeping solutions he \xe2\x80\x94 like any mayor \xe2\x80\x94 has limited ability to deliver.'b'Mr. de Blasio, in a superb campaign, showed the keen judgment of a surfer who spots the swell before it becomes a cresting wave. He deserves credit for an ambitious, admirable agenda. Progressive values run deep in this city, and Mr. de Blasio is right that New York at this moment needs to regain touch with its proud history and character.'b'Everyone in the city should be looking forward to his efforts to give a voice to the voiceless, to ease the suffering of the poor, and to increase opportunities for all. The emphasis should be on \xe2\x80\x9clooking forward.\xe2\x80\x9d After, of course, he handles this week\xe2\x80\x99s snowstorm.'b'For a little while in my teenage years, my friends and I smoked marijuana. It was fun. I have some fond memories of us all being silly together. I think those moments of uninhibited frolic deepened our friendships.'b'But then we all sort of moved away from it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember any big group decision that we should give up weed. It just sort of petered out, and, before long, we were scarcely using it.'b'We didn\xe2\x80\x99t give it up for the obvious health reasons: that it is addictive in about one in six teenagers; that smoking and driving is a good way to get yourself killed; that young people who smoke go on to suffer I.Q. loss and perform worse on other cognitive tests.'b'I think we gave it up, first, because we each had had a few embarrassing incidents. Stoned people do stupid things (that\xe2\x80\x99s basically the point). I smoked one day during lunch and then had to give a presentation in English class. I stumbled through it, incapable of putting together simple phrases, feeling like a total loser. It is still one of those embarrassing memories that pop up unbidden at 4 in the morning.'b'We gave it up, second, I think, because one member of our clique became a full-on stoner. He may have been the smartest of us, but something sad happened to him as he sunk deeper into pothead life.'b'Third, most of us developed higher pleasures. Smoking was fun, for a bit, but it was kind of repetitive. Most of us figured out early on that smoking weed doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really make you funnier or more creative (academic studies more or less confirm this). We graduated to more satisfying pleasures. The deeper sources of happiness usually involve a state of going somewhere, becoming better at something, learning more about something, overcoming difficulty and experiencing a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment.'b'One close friend devoted himself to track. Others fell deeply in love and got thrills from the enlargements of the heart. A few developed passions for science or literature.'b'Finally, I think we had a vague sense that smoking weed was not exactly something you were proud of yourself for. It\xe2\x80\x99s not something people admire. We were in the stage, which I guess all of us are still in, of trying to become more integrated, coherent and responsible people. This process usually involves using the powers of reason, temperance and self-control \xe2\x80\x94 not qualities one associates with being high.'b'I think we had a sense, which all people have, or should have, that the actions you take change you inside, making you a little more or a little less coherent. Not smoking, or only smoking sporadically, gave you a better shot at becoming a little more integrated and interesting. Smoking all the time seemed likely to cumulatively fragment a person\xe2\x80\x99s deep center, or at least not do much to enhance it.'b'So, like the vast majority of people who try drugs, we aged out. We left marijuana behind. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any problem with somebody who gets high from time to time, but I guess, on the whole, I think being stoned is not a particularly uplifting form of pleasure and should be discouraged more than encouraged.'b'We now have a couple states \xe2\x80\x94 Colorado and Washington \xe2\x80\x94 that have gone into the business of effectively encouraging drug use. By making weed legal, they are creating a situation in which the price will drop substantially. One RAND study suggests that prices could plummet by up to 90 percent, before taxes and such. As prices drop and legal fears go away, usage is bound to increase. This is simple economics, and it is confirmed by much research. Colorado and Washington, in other words, are producing more users.'b'The people who debate these policy changes usually cite the health risks users would face or the tax revenues the state might realize. Many people these days shy away from talk about the moral status of drug use because that would imply that one sort of life you might choose is better than another sort of life.'b'But, of course, these are the core questions: Laws profoundly mold culture, so what sort of community do we want our laws to nurture? What sort of individuals and behaviors do our governments want to encourage? I\xe2\x80\x99d say that in healthy societies government wants to subtly tip the scale to favor temperate, prudent, self-governing citizenship. In those societies, government subtly encourages the highest pleasures, like enjoying the arts or being in nature, and discourages lesser pleasures, like being stoned.'b'In legalizing weed, citizens of Colorado are, indeed, enhancing individual freedom. But they are also nurturing a moral ecology in which it is a bit harder to be the sort of person most of us want to be.'b'LAS VEGAS \xe2\x80\x94 IT\xe2\x80\x99S the time of year for resolutions. Lose 20 pounds, get to the gym, eat healthier, be more productive, whatever. But in a few months, many people will let these goals fall by the wayside, to be revived next year. I belong to a group who can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to make pledges we don\xe2\x80\x99t keep. I\xe2\x80\x99m an addict.'b'For addicts, discipline isn\xe2\x80\x99t something to strive for each new year; it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary for every moment. Though it might be surprising \xe2\x80\x94 considering all the craziness associated with the Mike Tyson persona \xe2\x80\x94 one of my best qualities is my unerring discipline, which my mentor and first trainer, Cus D\xe2\x80\x99Amato, instilled in me. Cus and I worked hard so I could become the youngest heavyweight champ in history; I sacrificed most of my social life as a teenager and for years pushed my body to extremes every day, just to repeat the brutal regimen the next day.'b'Cus died a year before I won my first belt, in 1986. With him gone, I had less of an incentive to stay disciplined, and I started drinking heavily and taking drugs. I finally retired from boxing in 2005. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to insult the sport by coming in out of shape, just fighting for a payday. That\xe2\x80\x99s when I became a full-on raging addict. Since then, I have struggled for sobriety, sometimes successfully, at other times not.'b'Even though I possessed incredible discipline when it came to boxing, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the tools to stop my slide into addiction. When I got a chance to get high \xe2\x80\x94 boom, I\xe2\x80\x99d get high. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call my sponsor, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call my therapist, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call my sober companions.'b'No, in order to kick it, I had to replace the cravings for drugs or alcohol with a craving to be a better person.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned that being sober is more than just avoiding drugs or alcohol. It\xe2\x80\x99s a lifestyle focused on making moral choices and elevating the things that make life worth living to the forefront. Don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong. If I craved drugs or alcohol, I\xe2\x80\x99d still give in. I could never fight those cravings. But when I am focused on doing good and being good, and practice the day-to-day mechanics of a sober, healthy life, I don\xe2\x80\x99t get those urges to do bad things to myself.'b'Of course, I needed a developed conscience to back it up. Over the years, my conscience has saved me from descending into a life of total, selfish hedonistic abuse. Even when I was just an antisocial kid, stealing and jostling in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, my friends and I would question our behavior. At my lowest points, I\xe2\x80\x99d still be somewhat outside myself, thinking of the effect my actions had on other people.'b'Even with your conscience nagging at you, it\xe2\x80\x99s extremely difficult to develop a sober and moral consciousness without a good support system. When I was in the prime of my career, I had a lousy support system. Greedy vultures were all around me, putting their hands in my pockets, using my status for their own self-aggrandizement. There was no way I could win with people like that in my corner. I am now very fortunate to have a wonderful wife and children surrounding me.'b'In 2009, I vowed to get sober after the accidental death of my 4-year-old girl, Exodus. I was determined to live a better life for the sake of my family, but the pain was so bad that I went back on drugs. Recovery is a drawn-out process, and without the continued encouragement of my support system, it would be close to impossible.'b'Strangely, times of success are most dangerous for me. When people tell me, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re great\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cYour comeback is amazing\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a god,\xe2\x80\x9d I could feed right into it and go get high. Hey, if my life is so good, how could smoking a joint be bad? How could a shot of Hennessy or a line of coke be so bad when everything else I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing is great \xe2\x80\x94 especially when there are beautiful, successful people feeding my ego and supplying the drugs? So I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned that when people congratulate me, that\xe2\x80\x99s when I focus on my flaws. That way I don\xe2\x80\x99t allow my narcissism to fly sky-high and allow me to think that I can act out without any consequences.'b'I had been sober for five years when I had a slip and started drinking again last August. I had just finished the manuscript of my book, my one-man show was about to air on HBO, and we had a reality series in the can for Fox Sports. I was not accustomed to all that success in an arena other than boxing.'b'I have such a negative self-image that I just expect bad things to happen to me. And even though I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been using for five years, all that time I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel comfortable in my skin. I was holding secrets from my loved ones, things that I had to get off my chest because I was dying inside. That\xe2\x80\x99s the worst feeling in the world, keeping things to yourself. When I resolved those issues, through therapy and by talking honestly with my family, I felt like a new man. When I relapsed in the past, I would keep getting high until I was in a car accident or got arrested. But this time, after drinking for two or three days, I came back. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t wait for an intervention. I just got right back on the wagon. After years of therapy, I had learned not to beat up on myself. I remembered that relapse is a part of recovery.'b'This is the best I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever felt. I\xe2\x80\x99m on the pathway to humility, fully aware that you can\xe2\x80\x99t rule until you\xe2\x80\x99ve served. I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to a glorious 2014, when all of our best-intentioned resolutions become realities.'b'HOUSTON \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cThe Circle,\xe2\x80\x9d Dave Eggers\xe2\x80\x99s runaway best seller, is a futuristic nightmare that seems to have touched a nerve. The Circle is a social networking firm with an Edenic campus and a totalitarian grip on its employees\xe2\x80\x99 lives; it forces them to socialize online at a dizzying pace, constantly messaging, friending, liking and answering surveys. In this novel, 21st-century capitalism has gone far beyond \xe2\x80\x9cMetropolis\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cModern Times.\xe2\x80\x9d The digital masters turn even personal lives into hard labor, and so all hours are suddenly working hours. Private space disappears as people make themselves \xe2\x80\x9ctransparent,\xe2\x80\x9d recording and posting their lives for thousands, even millions, of \xe2\x80\x9cfriends.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In Eggers\xe2\x80\x99s hellish future world, anyone who\xe2\x80\x99s anyone measures her self-worth through the easily quantified markers supplied by social media networks: How many hits, how many thumbs-up, did you get today? Some of us are already living in this world, at least a good part of the time. Facebook, Google, Tumblr, Twitter, Instagram: The digital tsunami is absorbing, distracting and all-consuming \xe2\x80\x94 and increasingly it feels like work.  Staying up to the minute is a grind, not a pleasure.'b'The result of the cool-or-not criteria that social networks urge on us is a flattened, analog version of life. We connect with others by cheering for our favorite things, turning ourselves into simple fans and ignoring the many-leveled, ambivalent selves that we actually are. One of the Circle\xe2\x80\x99s disenchanted employees accuses the company of imposing an eternal adolescent immaturity on everyone: \xe2\x80\x9cI like stickers and unicorns\xe2\x80\x9d expanded to cover the whole human world. But a list of preferences is not a self, even though the Internet tells us to think of things that way.'b'The digital world offers us many advantages, but if we yield to that world too completely we may lose the privacy we need to develop a self. Activities that require time and careful attention, like serious reading, are at risk; we read less and skim more as the Internet occupies more of our lives. And there\xe2\x80\x99s a link between selfhood and reading slowly, rather than scanning for quick information, as the Web encourages us to do. Recent work in sociology and psychology suggests that reading books, a private experience, is an important aspect of coming to know who we are.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s no accident that the click-happy online universe can sap our focus and make it harder for us to read a full-length book with rapt attention. But old-fashioned reading is still essential, because it teaches lessons about human identity that we can\xe2\x80\x99t get anywhere else. Making your way through a long, realist novel means taking a journey with another self; you look into people\xe2\x80\x99s inner lives as you could never do by watching a three-minute iPhone video.'b'The Circle works as a powerful warning to our culture. True, Eggers can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to create convincing characters, but this seems somehow right for his theme. Two things are missing in his novel: the private self and books. The two absences are linked, since books help us discover ourselves. It\xe2\x80\x99s telling that the library at the Circle is a gorgeous but unused relic: Being alone with a book is something antithetical to the plugged-in networking that preoccupies the company\xe2\x80\x99s workers.'b'After all the Internet\xe2\x80\x99s many diversions, people still yearn for the solitary refuge of reading, since a book provides a space for reflection, a private therapy that is hard to find online. Most of us remember from childhood the experience of being head-over-heels in a book, utterly absorbed. We entered into a strange, enchanted world and traveled with an author\xe2\x80\x99s characters; we lived their lives with them. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in the online world that can fulfill the promise that we get in a work of fiction to give us a sustained picture of the self.'b'A few months ago, Scott Simon, a host on National Public Radio, tweeted his mother\xe2\x80\x99s last few days of life to his million-plus Twitter followers. Tenderly, tactfully, he shared his shocked realization that his mother was slipping away, and then gone. But I would bet that few of his followers lingered over the tweets for more than a few minutes; they won\xe2\x80\x99t want to reread them next year. Books offer something different, and more.'b'They give us the time and space we need to pursue a full picture of other people, and by extension ourselves. When we think of Anna Karenina\xe2\x80\x99s death, we remember Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s stunning, compassionate effort to give a complete image of her life over hundreds of pages. She is selfishly misguided, self-thwarting to the point of ruin, yet somehow she still has our sympathy. She interests us from first page to last, and each reader feels compelled to ponder why she has such a hold on us.'b'All of us deserve to be seen fully, in the way that Tolstoy makes us see Anna. When we read about Anna, we see what it might be like to imagine a self. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we reread Tolstoy, and why we read him slowly, drinking in every detail about Anna\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts and her emotions. This is the way to build a self, not through a collection of personal tastes and opinions, the likes and dislikes that the Internet trades in.'b'We don\xe2\x80\x99t yet live in Eggers\xe2\x80\x99s dystopian Circle, nor will we ever. We know ourselves well enough to realize that we need some time away from the hopped-up, glittering online universe; we need solitude and careful thought and, yes, books to be read slowly and returned to often. These days especially we need to sound the alarm about reading, to practice shutting out distraction so we can have the time and space we need for books.'b'Young people are the ones in most danger from the electronic environment, but they are also just what they\xe2\x80\x99ve always been, the most fervent and loyal readers on the planet. On the subway the other day, I overheard a boy of 13 or so say to his friends, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Catcher in the Rye, I\xe2\x80\x99ve read it like 12 times.\xe2\x80\x9d And so had I at 13, a good four decades ago. Despite all the dazzle of the digital realm, all the \xe2\x80\x9cnew thresholds, new anatomies\xe2\x80\x9d (to quote the poet Hart Crane), when it comes to reading, not much has changed.'b''b'\n'b'David Mikics 'b' is the author, most recently, of \xe2\x80\x9cSlow Reading in a Hurried Age.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Regarding \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Moldova, the 51st state?'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Opinion, Dec. 27): I was bewildered by Vladimir Lorchenkov\xe2\x80\x99s claim that Moldovans are politically passive and are mostly trying to leave the country.

Yet one will not be forthcoming, as the ideology and policies that led to the killings still guide the Pakistani military. The rampage she describes was an attempt to crush the Bengali secular reformers who had won Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s first democratic election.

Mr. Mollah was tried for being instrumental in committing rape and massacring unarmed civilian families in their homes with support from the Pakistani Army during night curfews in Dhaka in 1971. He faced numerous other charges of war crimes, but his love and loyalty to Pakistan were not among them. Instead of passing a resolution in their National Assembly to simply condemn the trial, Pakistan would be far ahead in the game if the resolution had included even a hint of regret or apology to Bangladesh, as Ms. Anam has challenged it to do.'b''b'Mahmood Islam, Charleston, W.

She is also spot-on about Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s denialist stance regarding its culpability in the war. The protest resolution passed in the Pakistani National Assembly, following the execution of a proven war criminal like Mr. Mollah, is reprehensible political revisionism that only reinforces the views of many Bangladeshis that Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s political elite remains unrepentant for its myriad atrocities in 1971.'b'But I disagree with Ms. Anam\xe2\x80\x99s casual assertion that \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Mollah\xe2\x80\x99s execution on Dec. 12 had widespread public support.\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99m a strident opponent of the death penalty, even in a case like Mr. Mollah\xe2\x80\x99s.

The website\xe2\x80\x99s initial rollout will long stand as a monument to how badly technology contracting can go wrong. But the remarkable recovery also demonstrates what a determined response to such bungling can achieve.'b'Sadly, food stamp and Medicaid recipients can only look on in envy. Just as disaster-relief agencies keep track of hurricanes, floods and earthquakes, students of anti-poverty programs remember a litany of automation and contracting meltdowns \xe2\x80\x94 some of them prolonged, even epic. Florida, 1992-93. Michigan, 1998-99. Colorado, 1998-2002. Texas, 2006-7. Indiana, 2007-9. The Colorado Benefits Management System is particularly memorable: When first implemented, it reportedly refused food stamps to anyone who did not have a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license from Guam.'b'But finding parallels to the HealthCare.gov meltdown requires no memory at all. Just as HealthCare.gov was filling the headlines, a contractor for the Georgia Department of Human Services was neglecting to send renewal notices to the homes of some 66,000 food stamp recipients and about half that number of Medicaid beneficiaries. On Nov. 1, the state\xe2\x80\x99s computer system \xe2\x80\x94 which goes by the Orwellian acronym Success \xe2\x80\x94 automatically terminated benefits to all those affected for failure to cooperate with reviews they had never been told were underway.'b'In December, a Massachusetts contractor sent thousands of people new electronic food stamp benefit cards and immediately deactivated their old cards \xe2\x80\x94 without waiting to see if the new ones had arrived in the mail. Many had not. In mid-October, a contractor\xe2\x80\x99s glitch made food stamps inaccessible to recipients in 17 states.'b'The White House showed impressive alacrity in fixing 'b'HealthCare.gov'b'. But its response to technology failures affecting low-income people has been far more sluggish. The federal Department of Health and Human Services did eventually direct Georgia to reactivate the Medicaid benefits for those wrongfully terminated. The federal Department of Agriculture (which administers food stamps, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) brushed aside repeated pleas to tell Georgia to reinstate food assistance in time for Thanksgiving.'b'Instead, Georgia told its desperate people to reapply through a website, though it operated only intermittently. Wrongfully terminated households could call to request paper applications \xe2\x80\x94 but the call center answered fewer than 30 percent of the calls it received in September, and the lucky few who did get through had average waiting times of 34 minutes. They could go into a local food stamp office \xe2\x80\x94 but once there, they would only be directed to a terminal to try to get on the website or a phone to try to get through to the call center. Not just Orwell, but Kafka and Dickens come to mind.'b'Nor was this latest failure an isolated episode. In July 2012, a group of Atlanta eligibility workers told the federal Agriculture Department that case managers were \xe2\x80\x9cfalsely documenting\xe2\x80\x9d that they were calling customers and \xe2\x80\x9cgetting no answer\xe2\x80\x9d and using that excuse to justify denial of food-stamp assistance.'b'The Agriculture Department did not investigate these whistle-blowers\xe2\x80\x99 complaints. When my name appeared in an Atlanta news article about the food stamp debacle, a state employee called me to report a backlog of 12,000 applications waiting to be entered into the Success database.'b'All of this reflects a broader double standard for automation and contracting \xe2\x80\x94 and for government administration generally. An Indiana state judge described a familiar pattern in an earlier food stamp and Medicaid automation contracting fiasco: Officials implemented a \xe2\x80\x9csupersized\xe2\x80\x9d contract, an \xe2\x80\x9cuntested theoretical experiment,\xe2\x80\x9d that resulted in irremediable \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal suffering of needy Hoosiers.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A few years ago, a former federal official, frustrated at frequent indifference to low-income Medicaid beneficiaries, joked darkly that the two big government health insurance programs should be called \xe2\x80\x9cMed-I-Care\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMed-I-Don\xe2\x80\x99t-Care.\xe2\x80\x9d (Elderly Medicare users are politically far more important than the poor and disabled customers of Medicaid.)'b'Properly supervised contractors can use technology to improve the delivery of government services. But attention, oversight and willingness to act decisively to remedy fiascoes seem to depend on the wealth and clout of those who are affected. As Obamacare regains its footing, that lesson shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be forgotten.'b'RIO DE JANEIRO \xe2\x80\x94 When I visited China in June, my trip happened to coincide with the discovery that Edward Snowden was hiding out 'b'in Hong Kong'b'. By then, Snowden\xe2\x80\x99s revelations about the voracious data-collection operation by the National Security Agency was front-page news all over the world. Snowden hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet been charged for the leak of tens of thousands of pages of classified N.S.A. documents, but it was clear that 'b'it was coming'b'.

A question very much in the air here is whether Brazil would grant Snowden asylum once 'b'his temporary stay in Russia'b' comes to an end. In recent weeks, Snowden had twice expressed publicly his desire to gain asylum to Brazil, 'b'once in an open letter'b' published in a newspaper in S\xc3\xa3o Paulo \xe2\x80\x94 in which he said he would cooperate with Brazilian authorities investigating the N.S.A. once he was safely inside the country \xe2\x80\x94 and then, somewhat more cautiously, 'b'in a television interview'b'.'b'With 'b'the possible exception of Germany'b', there isn\xe2\x80\x99t another nation as publicly irate over the eavesdropping on its citizens and its government as Brazil.

Then, during a speech to the United Nations, 'b'she excoriated the United States'b', even as President Obama stood in the wings. Along with Germany, Brazil has rekindled a long-stalled effort to create a new structure for Internet governance, one that would be less dependent on American companies and American networks. Virg\xc3\xadlio Fernandes Almeida, a government official who is chairman of the country\xe2\x80\x99s Internet Steering Committee, told me that there is no question that the Snowden revelations helped jump-start the effort.'b'Indeed, two weeks ago, a $4 billion contract for a fighter jet, in which Boeing was said to be the front-runner, 'b'went to a unit of Saab'b' instead. Although Saab was the lowest-cost bidder, \xe2\x80\x9cThe N.S.A. problem ruined it for the Americans,\xe2\x80\x9d a Brazilian government source 'b'told Reuters'b'.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBrazil was one of the most targeted countries,\xe2\x80\x9d said Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who is based here and is closest to Snowden. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was more than even Russia or China.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What is also true is that Greenwald, who has published dozens of stories in The Guardian based on the documents Snowden supplied, did his best to stoke Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s rage. After every print revelation \xe2\x80\x94 'b'O Globo'b', a large Brazilian daily, was his vehicle of choice \xe2\x80\x94 he would appear on a popular show similar to \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes\xe2\x80\x9d to talk up his latest bombshell. \xe2\x80\x9cSnowden became almost a household name after that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maur\xc3\xadcio Santoro, a Rio-based human rights advocate for Amnesty International.'b'And then Greenwald found the document about the surveillance on Dilma\xe2\x80\x99s phone calls, text messages and emails, and all hell broke loose. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a supertechnical document,\xe2\x80\x9d Greenwald told me. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was written for an idiot. It was like, \xe2\x80\x98Great news. We have had great success eavesdropping on Dilma.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'b'Perhaps just as infuriating to the Brazilian elites was the discovery that the N.S.A., along with Britain\xe2\x80\x99s secret spy agency, GCHQ, had apparently 'b'succeeded in penetrating'b' the private computer network of Petrobas, a giant state-owned oil company and a source of national pride.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did they have to do this to us?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Santoro, posing the question many Brazilians still want answered. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course we have our disagreements with the U.S., but we are not enemies. What has also been maddening has been the lack of a clear explanation from the Obama administration,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.'b'Yet for all that, Santoro doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that Brazil will give Snowden asylum. So far, the government has been coy, saying that because Snowden has not applied for asylum through the proper channels, there is nothing to talk about. The way it was explained to me, though, Brazil prefers to use what it likes to call \xe2\x80\x9csoft power\xe2\x80\x9d on the world stage \xe2\x80\x94 global consensus building, that sort of thing. Helping to create an Internet governance system fits nicely in that model. Giving Snowden asylum does not.'b'Meanwhile, the American government shows no signs of softening its stance of trying Snowden for espionage if it gets its hands on him. It\xe2\x80\x99s worth remembering that another important whistle-blower, Daniel Ellsberg, was eventually put on trial for leaking the Pentagon Papers. The case was 'b'thrown out of court'b' largely because of government misconduct, starting with the break-in of the office of Ellsberg\xe2\x80\x99s psychiatrist.'b'At least as it concerns the N.S.A., government misconduct is now official policy. We know that thanks to Snowden. He needs a place to live. Why not you, Brazil?'b'In 2009, the gap between the share of Republicans and Democrats who believed in evolution was just 10 percentage points, 54 percent and 64 percent, respectively.'b'Last year, that gap widened to a whopping 24 points because as the percentage of Democrats who believed in evolution inched up to 67 percent, the percentage of Republicans believing so plummeted to 43 percent. Now, more Republicans believe that \xe2\x80\x9chumans and other living things have existed in their present form since the beginning of time\xe2\x80\x9d than believe in evolution.'b'This sad news comes via a 'b'survey released this week'b' by the Pew Research Center\xe2\x80\x99s Religion &amp; Public Life Project.'b'In fact, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t only sad; it\xe2\x80\x99s embarrassing.'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t personally have a problem with religious faith, even in the extreme, as long as it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t supersede science and it\xe2\x80\x99s not used to impose outdated mores on others.'b'But some people see our extreme religiosity itself as a form of dysfunction.\xc2\xa0 In a 2009 paper in the journal Evolutionary Psychology, Gregory Paul, an independent researcher, put it this way: \xe2\x80\x9cThe level of relative and absolute societal pathology in the United States is often so severe that it is repeatedly an outlier that strongly reinforces the correlation between high levels of poor societal conditions and popular religiosity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But I believe that something else is also at play here, something more cynical. I believe this is a natural result of a long-running ploy by Republican party leaders to play on the most base convictions of conservative voters in order to solidify their support.

According to a 'b'2011 Pew report'b', while white evangelical Protestants make up only 18 percent of the population overall, they \xe2\x80\x9cmake up 43 percent of Republicans who fall into the category of staunch conservatives.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Pew 'b'defines'b' \xe2\x80\x9cstaunch conservatives\xe2\x80\x9d as those who \xe2\x80\x9ctake extremely conservative positions on nearly all issues \xe2\x80\x94 on the size and role of government, on economics, foreign policy, social issues and moral concerns. Most agree with the Tea Party, and even more very strongly disapprove of Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s job performance.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Pew found that most staunch conservatives were regular viewers of Fox News, preferring the network to any other news source.'b'Fox has helped to ingrain the idea that Republicanism and religiosity are embattled and oppressed, fighting for survival against the forces of secular extremists.'b'There was, for instance, the Fox News-fabricated 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWar on Christmas\xe2\x80\x9d'b' and its fight against the \xe2\x80\x9cHappy Holidays Syndrome.\xe2\x80\x9d The face of the network\xe2\x80\x99s defense-of-Christmas crusade has been the \xe2\x80\x9cKilling Jesus\xe2\x80\x9d co-author Bill O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly, who this season declared a victory. In December, 'b'he said on his show'b': \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t a mythical war on Christmas. It\xe2\x80\x99s real, and we just won.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But Fox is not alone. The Christians-on-the-defensive stance was front and center in the 2012 Republican presidential primaries. During a 'b'debate'b' in January of that year, this question from a Virginia man was put to the candidates: \xe2\x80\x9cGiven that you oppose gay marriage, what do you want gay people to do who want to form loving, committed, long-term relationships? What is your solution?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Newt Gingrich responded, in part citing \xe2\x80\x9csecular bigotry\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cThe bigotry question goes both ways, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more anti-Christian bigotry today than there is concern on the other side, and none of it gets covered by the news media.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There was a sustained round of applause for Gingrich\xe2\x80\x99s statement. So of course, the eventual nominee, the self-proclaimed \xe2\x80\x9cseverely conservative\xe2\x80\x9d eater of \xe2\x80\x9ccheesy grits\xe2\x80\x9d Mitt Romney, had to ride Gingrich\xe2\x80\x99s coattails by chiming in, \xe2\x80\x9cAs you can tell, the people in this room feel that Speaker Gingrich is absolutely right, and I do too.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Last year, the Liberty Institute and the Family Research Council released an updated, 189-page version of a 'b'book'b' called \xe2\x80\x9cUndeniable: The Survey of Hostility to Religion in America.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is a tactic to keep the Republican rank-and-file riled up, to divert their attention from areas of common sense and the common good. After all, infidels are deserving of your enmity, not your empathy.'b'Five months into the latest American effort to nudge Israelis and Palestinians toward a peace agreement, the one party clearly committed to a deal is the United States. This week, Secretary of State John Kerry made his 10th trip to the region to get the two sides to stick the timetable he set forth when he started new negotiations last July.'b'His goal, he said at the time, was a comprehensive peace agreement by the end of April that would lead to an independent Palestinian state. Despite more than 20 official talks, there is no evidence of concrete progress, but there are increasing signs that both sides may be positioning themselves to blame the other if negotiations collapse.'b'Signs of failure are everywhere. On Thursday, standing beside Mr. Kerry, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a harsh assessment of his Palestinian counterpart, President Mahmoud Abbas, and, implicitly, the prospect of a Middle East peace agreement. Days earlier, Israel let it be known that it would build more settlements in the West Bank, further poisoning the political atmosphere while shrinking the territorial space for a deal. Hard-liners in Mr. Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s government are pushing a bill that would annex settlements in the Jordan Valley area of the West Bank, where about 6,000 Israeli settlers and 10 times as many Palestinians live.'b'There are questions about the Palestinian commitment as well. Palestinian leaders have said that any new settlement activity could lead them to seek membership in the International Criminal Court and sue Israel there, a move they had promised not to take when peace talks started in the summer. An official close to Mr. Abbas has dismissed Mr. Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s push for a "framework agreement" as biased toward\xc2\xa0'b'Israel'b'.'b'In his remarks on Thursday Mr. Netanyahu claimed that members of the Palestinian security force were involved in a recent attack against Israelis. Mr. Abbas should investigate the claim and, if it is true, bring those responsible to justice. He also needs to crack down on the incitement of hatred against Israel in Palestinian schools, textbooks and government-controlled media.'b'As part of the negotiating process, Mr. Netanyahu agreed to release 104 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails over nine months rather than halt settlement construction. But when Mr. Abbas welcomed the latest group to the West Bank this week, Mr. Netanyahu accused him of embracing terrorists, even though Mr. Abbas never condoned the prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 crimes. If Mr. Netanyahu felt so strongly about the prisoner releases, he should have chosen instead to halt settlement construction.'b'Mr. Kerry is working to intensify the American role by offering ideas to bridge gaps between the two sides. His immediate aim is a framework accord that would define the principles of a comprehensive treaty, addressing borders, security, refugees, Jerusalem, mutual recognition and the end of conflict.'b'The framework must not become yet another interim agreement that leaves Palestinians with empty promises. To succeed, it will need to be embraced and defended by Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas, who must acknowledge that neither society will be secure until both can learn to compromise and live as states, side by side.'b'At first glance, two recent crises to hit the White House \xe2\x80\x94 the revelations about unlawful surveillance and the botched health care rollout \xe2\x80\x94 have nothing in common. But each is a reminder of the increasing extent to which government work has been contracted out to private-sector companies. Currently, Washington spends about $500 billion a year on private-sector contracts, more than twice the amount in 2000.'b'It is hard to argue that Americans are getting their money\xe2\x80\x99s worth.'b'The ostensible purpose of using private contractors is to get jobs done cheaper and better. But that aim is often unmet. 'b'Companies bidding'b' for federal work have a financial incentive to overpromise. The complex procurement process gives big companies 'b'an edge'b' to win large, long-term contracts, even when the needed expertise, especially in technology, can often be found at smaller, more nimble companies. Federal rules intended to reduce conflicts of interest instead leave government officials with little authority to oversee or terminate contracts.'b'The result is delays, overruns and unmet public needs. Technological failures are not the only problem. A 'b'recent Senate report'b' found that federal contractors are among the worst violators of wage-and-safety laws, while a New York Times 'b'investigation'b' found that the government buys clothes from sweatshops in foreign countries.'b'It is legitimate to use contractors when the government does not possess the expertise, especially on specific projects, or for services that are tangential to core government functions. But the current practice of contracting out vast swaths of government work indefinitely \xe2\x80\x94 with little or no attempt to develop the needed technical and managerial expertise within the government or to enforce labor standards \xe2\x80\x94 has created a bloated federal-contractor sector in which the public good is often subservient to profit.'b'Several sensible proposals to reform federal contracting have been put forward, including bipartisan legislation to make a single person at each government agency responsible for technology projects. Some good-government groups have suggested that government analysts systematically evaluate whether contractors provide better value than federal employees and what it would take to develop in-house expertise. Legislators and some labor advocates say President Obama should require government agencies to consider a company\xe2\x80\x99s labor and performance record when awarding contracts.'b'But for all the 'b'research'b' and 'b'recommendations'b', nothing much is happening in Congress or the administration, in part because the status quo is lucrative for powerful corporations and big campaign donors, and is entrenched by the revolving door between government agencies and private-sector contractors. Reform will not be simply a technical exercise. It also will be a political battle, one that no one has taken up in earnest yet.'b'Rebuffed by Congress on stronger gun safety laws, President Obama is wisely using use his executive powers in a more focused attempt to bar mentally ill people from eluding federal watch lists and purchasing firearms. Two sensible changes proposed for the background check system would allow states and mental health providers more discretion than they have now in reporting information about potentially violent people.'b'The first would deal with longstanding complaints from law enforcement authorities about the narrow scope of a rule stipulating that a person cannot be denied the purchase of a firearm unless he or she has been \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted to a mental institution\xe2\x80\x9d in the past. This ignores whole categories of obviously risky citizens.'b'The proposed change would broaden the rule to include involuntary outpatient as well as inpatient commitments. Some of the shooters in cases of mass gun violence were found to have previously come to the attention of authorities but received psychiatric testing or care that fell short of orders of commitment. Including inpatient and outpatient care broadens the grounds for denying weapons.'b'The second proposal deals with privacy strictures in health insurance laws that states say prevent the passing on of relevant information about potentially violent people. After consultation with mental health professionals, the White House said health insurance organizations would be extended \xe2\x80\x9can express permission\xe2\x80\x9d to furnish to federal authorities \xe2\x80\x9cthe limited information necessary to help keep guns out of potentially dangerous hands.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Neither of these changes can fully solve the nation\xe2\x80\x99s gun safety problem, but both offer a promise of relief. Far more is needed, if Congress can ever disenthrall itself from the gun lobby to rein in the carnage.'b'The power to grant clemency is a critical function of the executive branch. It serves as a last, case-by-case resort to remedy an unjustly long sentence, erase a wrongful conviction or show forgiveness where it is merited. But New Yorkers seeking clemency from Gov. Andrew Cuomo, either from within prison or after their release, have found virtually no consolation during the three years of his tenure.'b'That fact was highlighted by Mr. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'decision this week'b' to exercise his clemency power for the first time since taking office in 2011. When he finally took action, he did so with miserly caution, pardoning just 'b'three men'b' for relatively minor crimes committed long ago.'b'Seymour Hunter, 70, spent one day in jail 20 years ago for trying to sell drugs. Gerardo Alvarez was sentenced to three days\xe2\x80\x99 community service after cocaine was found in his car. Rocco Paciello was convicted of statutory rape for dating a 15-year-old girl when he was 22. He served eight days in jail; he and his girlfriend later married and have been together 21 years. Mr. Cuomo said that each of these men \xe2\x80\x9cpaid their debt to society long ago\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9care deserving of a second chance.\xe2\x80\x9d Surely that is true, particularly for Mr. Hunter and Mr. Alvarez, both of whom hope to become United States citizens. But there are still many more prisoners serving unfairly long sentences under the state\xe2\x80\x99s outdated and only partly reformed Rockefeller drug laws, or who have demonstrated that they, too, deserve a second chance. As a former attorney general who fought for the laws\xe2\x80\x99 reform, Mr. Cuomo can do better.'b'Part of the problem is that New York\xe2\x80\x99s clemency process is opaque, unpredictable and unproductive.'b'Some states have developed better processes to handle clemency requests with more regularity and transparency. In California, Gov. Jerry Brown 'b'issued 127 pardons'b' last month, and in Illinois, Gov. Pat Quinn has granted clemency 'b'more than 1,000 times'b' over four-plus years. Mr. Cuomo should show more courage on this issue and take the lead to improve New York\xe2\x80\x99s clemency process.'b'Laupheim, a small town in southern Germany, once boasted a large Jewish community and named a prominent street after one of its Jewish sons: Carl Laemmle, who went on to found Universal Studios. But all of that changed in the 1930s. By 1992, when I started fifth grade, Laemmle\xe2\x80\x99s name had long since been removed from the map, and my mother and I were the only Jews in town.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAllsbach, Lisa,\xe2\x80\x9d the teacher asked at the beginning of our first class. \xe2\x80\x9cProtestant or Catholic?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have to sign you up for either Catholic or Protestant religion classes. So, Lisa?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCatholic.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGood.

And I still didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say \xe2\x80\x94 in part out of an instinctive understanding that I would be marked out; in part because, not being religious, really, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the right answer.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMounk, Yascha. Protestant or Catholic?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m sort of Jewish.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The class laughed. Uproariously.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cStop making things up,\xe2\x80\x9d Johannes Emmerle, a Protestant, shouted as the hilarity ebbed. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody knows that the Jews don\xe2\x80\x99t exist anymore!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Herr Weiss reprimanded Johannes. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk unless I call on you. We must have order. O.K., Yascha. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have a free period when the others take religion. There\xe2\x80\x99s a Turk in another class, I think. You two can keep each other company.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Then he added, as an afterthought: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, Johannes, you are wrong, as a matter of fact. There are a few Jews. Again.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Johannes wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too far off the mark. Of the more than 500,000 Jews who lived in Germany when Hitler took power in 1933, only about 15,000 remained on German territory at war\xe2\x80\x99s end, and many of them planned to emigrate. German Jews, it seemed, would soon be extinct.'b'But that extinction never came to pass. Some Jews who had fled the Third Reich returned to build a new, better society. Others, liberated from the concentration camps but without a home to return to, temporarily settled in camps for \xe2\x80\x9cdisplaced persons.\xe2\x80\x9d Most of them soon made their way to Israel or the United States, but some got stuck for one reason or another, and never left. As West Germany rapidly grew, more Jews came to the country as businessmen, artists or refugees \xe2\x80\x94 especially after the fall of the Soviet Union, when tens of thousands were encouraged to relocate. All told, well over 100,000 Jews now live in the Federal Republic.'b'My family, too, came to West Germany as immigrants. Born in the shtetls of Eastern Europe, my grandparents embraced Communism as teenagers, leaving home to become political activists. They survived the Holocaust by fleeing to the Soviet Union and returned to Poland after the war, keen to put their ideals into practice at long last. But then the regime they had helped to build threw them out amid a large-scale anti-Semitic witch hunt. Out of options, my mother and her father sought refuge in West Germany.'b'Born in 1982 as the citizen of a peaceful, affluent and increasingly cosmopolitan country, I spent a mostly happy childhood in places like Munich, Freiburg and Karlsruhe. I was a fervent supporter of the national soccer team and dreamed of running for the Bundestag. German is, and will remain, the only language I speak without an accent.'b'My family\xe2\x80\x99s Jewish identity has never been strong. I had neither a bris nor a bar mitzvah. When I was young, my mother gave me Christmas presents so that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel left out.'b'Even so, as I grew older, I felt more and more Jewish \xe2\x80\x94 and less and less German. Gradually, I concluded that staying in Germany was not for me.'b'The reaction of my classmates in Laupheim might suggest that ignorance or hatred \xe2\x80\x94 which have subsided since I was a child, but remain real problems \xe2\x80\x94 are why I left. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not quite true. If there was one thing that made me feel I would never truly belong, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hostility: It was benevolence.'b'Starting in the 1960s, Germany began to break a silence of decades about the past. A new generation confronted its forefathers about what they had done during the Third Reich. The country embarked on the slow, painful process of facing up to the enormity of the Holocaust.'b'As Germany\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of its history changed, so did popular attitudes toward Jews. Especially in the country\xe2\x80\x99s hipper neighborhoods, Judaism was suddenly all the rage. Nary a literary reading failed to feature a Yiddish poem. Few were the gallery openings that lacked an ensemble of Aryans playing klezmer. Especially in the 1980s and early 1990s, it seemed as though the whole country had come down with a bout of philo-Semitism.'b'I first realized that I had become a flesh-and-blood object for this demonstrative good will when I moved from provincial Laupheim to cosmopolitan Munich. Suddenly, I found myself treated as a kind of celebrity \xe2\x80\x94 somebody to be admired for being different, but also to be handled with special care.'b'When I went to a party thrown by Franz, a high-school friend, I found him in a heated discussion about Woody Allen with a soft-spoken blonde.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFranz here thinks that Woody is creepy and that his movies are mediocre,\xe2\x80\x9d Marie, the girl, told me.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d Franz said, turning bright red. \xe2\x80\x9cI never said he was creepy or mediocre.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou just said he was creepy because he married Mia Farrow\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. And that he\xe2\x80\x99s not as serious as \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Franz hedged, glancing at me, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it quite like that. Sure, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little weird that he married his girlfriend\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. But, you know, they were both adults and it\xe2\x80\x99s not illegal, so \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you being so strange?\xe2\x80\x9d Marie asked.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not being strange at all. It\xe2\x80\x99s just important to see both sides of the argument. You make it sound as though I had something against Woody Allen. I don\xe2\x80\x99t. He\xe2\x80\x99s a likable guy. As you said, his Jew humor is admirable.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Marie turned to me, with a mocking smile. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must be the reason for Franz\xe2\x80\x99s sudden transformation. What\xe2\x80\x99s the deal? Are you writing something about Woody Allen? Or are you related to him?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cRest assured that I have no particular horse in this race.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Franz mumbled, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, actually, yes, in a way, Yascha is re \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9d Helplessly, he petered out.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d Marie asked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou really are related to Woody Allen?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Franz stared at Marie, Marie stared at me, and I scanned the room for a desperately needed drink.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not at all,\xe2\x80\x9d I finally replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI guess what Franz meant to say is that I\xe2\x80\x99m Jewish.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Marie gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, how exciting. A real Jew!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Franz, meanwhile, set about telling me how great a work \xe2\x80\x9cDeconstructing Harry\xe2\x80\x9d was.'b'At first, I enjoyed the attention. After living in a place where my classmates had known so little about what it meant to be Jewish, it was nice to be treated with kid gloves. But my excitement did not last long. Increasingly, I realized that the mere mention of my heritage erected an invisible wall between my classmates and me. Back in Laupheim, there had at least been a kind of bravery in asserting my heritage. In Munich, I found myself increasingly circumspect about revealing my identity.'b'My experience of philo-Semitism had another effect. Until I moved to Munich, I had never doubted that I was a German. But now I realized that even my most well-intentioned compatriots saw me as a Jew first, and a German second. And so I, too, began to identify as more of a Jew than a German.'b'My feeling of not belonging only intensified as the philo-Semitic moment faded, and a new mood of \xe2\x80\x9cenough is enough\xe2\x80\x9d took hold. In 1998, the novelist Martin Walser argued that Germans had become unhealthily obsessed with the Third Reich, and that the memory of Auschwitz was increasingly being used to harm Germany. The country, he said, should draw a definitive \xe2\x80\x9cfinish line\xe2\x80\x9d underneath the past. Polls found that most Germans agreed.'b'Once again, Germany\xe2\x80\x99s changed understanding of its past manifested itself in ordinary interactions. One Saturday morning, for example, I went to Munich\xe2\x80\x99s Oktoberfest with a group of acquaintances. A jolly brass band in lederhosen was playing. We clinked our mugs in a traditional Bavarian toast.'b'Stephanie, a petite woman in her late 30s, was trying to make a joke. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you fit 200 Jews into a Volkswagen Beetle?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cKnock it off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hans, a big-boned, folksy friend of mine. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I?\xe2\x80\x9d Stephanie shot back. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause you tell me to shut up? Because they tell me to shut up? Come on, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a joke!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI doubt it\xe2\x80\x99ll be funny,\xe2\x80\x9d Hans said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNot funny? Have a sense of humor! Why can\xe2\x80\x99t a joke about the Jews be funny? It\xe2\x80\x99s 2006. The Holocaust happened 60 years ago. We should tell jokes about the Jews again!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLook,\xe2\x80\x9d Hans said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know as well as I do that Germans have a special responsibility to be sensi \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA special responsibility? I\xe2\x80\x99m not even 40! No, no. I won\xe2\x80\x99t stay silent any longer. Here\xe2\x80\x99s how you fit them in. You gas them. You incinerate them. You stuff them in the ashtray. That\xe2\x80\x99s how you do it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Stephanie\xe2\x80\x99s tasteless joke allowed me to put in words what had long made me uncomfortable even about less crass advocates of the \xe2\x80\x9cfinish line.\xe2\x80\x9d Clearly, there was something artificial about the ritualistic displays of historical contrition that had long been central to public life in Germany. But to assert that the time had come to move beyond the past, once and for all, was no less artificial. Normality cannot be decreed by fiat.'b'Both the ignorance I had encountered in Laupheim and the philo-Semitism I experienced in Munich had made me feel like an outsider \xe2\x80\x94 but each also made me more determined to help in the creation of a German-Jewish identity. Now that my very presence was enough to make some people resentful, however, I grew impatient with the endless complications of being a German Jew. I wanted nothing more than to be seen, finally, as an individual. And so, despite everything I loved about Germany, and unlike so many other German Jews, I decided to leave.'b'When I first moved to New York, as a graduate student, I hoped that living here would make it possible for me to choose who I wanted to be. In Germany, I always thought twice before mentioning that my ancestors were Jewish: I knew that, once I\xe2\x80\x99d pronounced that fateful word, I would, in the minds of many, be reduced to it. In New York, a city of more than a million Jews, I found that this hardly changed how others saw me.'b'Being free to construct my own identity has had an unexpected effect: I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to realize that being Jewish is not particularly important to me after all. Sure, I enjoy \xe2\x80\x9cSeinfeld\xe2\x80\x9d and a whitefish bagel. But is that enough to make me \xe2\x80\x9cculturally\xe2\x80\x9d a Jew? I\xe2\x80\x99m not convinced. I can see why many other secular, nonobservant Jews \xe2\x80\x94 who speak Hebrew, or grew up following Jewish ritual \xe2\x80\x94 feel that being Jewish defines them. But defining myself strongly as a Jew when I know so little about religion or ritual would, I believe, cheapen the tradition I would be claiming to invoke.'b'New York has given me the same liberty it has afforded generations of immigrants: the freedom to be true to myself. In an age of identity politics, we assume that this must mean the freedom to proclaim one\xe2\x80\x99s identity. But, for me, it has just as much to do with the liberty to shed an identity to which I\xe2\x80\x99d long been reduced.'b'A true New Yorker, E.B. White suggested, is one who has come to the city \xe2\x80\x9cin quest of something.\xe2\x80\x9d It is because New York is defined as much by its newcomers as by its natives that I hope to spend my life here. My identity is no longer that of a Jew or a German. It is that of a seeker who has found; that of a stranger who has come to be at home; that of, simply and immeasurably, a New Yorker.'b''b'\n'b'Yascha Mounk 'b' is a doctoral candidate in political theory at Harvard and the author of \xe2\x80\x9cStranger in My Own Country: A Jewish Family in Modern Germany.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b''b'In the languid news week after Christmas, hungry media outlets swarmed over a report of piranhas attacking swimmers on a river in Argentina. \xe2\x80\x9cMassive Piranha Attack\xe2\x80\x9d cried The New York Post. \xe2\x80\x9c70 Christmas Day Bathers Are Savaged\xe2\x80\x9d added The Daily Mail, promising \xe2\x80\x9cthe truth about the fish with a bite more powerful than a  T. rex.\xe2\x80\x9d ABC News called it a \xe2\x80\x9cChristmas Day feeding frenzy.\xe2\x80\x9d In fact, the injuries ranged from minor cuts to at least one missing finger part \xe2\x80\x94 not exactly as newsworthy as, say, the 800,000 Americans who require medical treatment for dog bites each year.'b'Piranhas have always been among our favorite subjects for sheer, sputtering nonsense. Theodore Roosevelt, on a 1913 expedition in South America, called piranhas \xe2\x80\x9cthe most ferocious fish in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d More recently, multiple \xe2\x80\x9cPiranha\xe2\x80\x9d movies have ridden this hysteria to the bank.'b'This is an awful lot of hype for piranhas to live up to, and predictably, they disappoint. To test the colorful mythology of the ferocious piranha, I once climbed into a tank of hungry red-bellied piranhas at the Dallas World Aquarium. (They fled to the opposite corner.) In the Peruvian Amazon, I stood waist-deep in the Rio Napo while catching and releasing piranhas on a hook-and-line. (The nibbles were strictly of the usual kind.) In the flooded grasslands of Venezuela, I drove around tossing a chicken carcass into various bodies of water to time how long it took for the flesh-maddened swarms to strip it to feathers. (There was enough chicken left at the end of the day to feed a family of four.)'b'The point of this exercise, recounted in my book \xe2\x80\x9cSwimming With Piranhas at Feeding Time,\xe2\x80\x9d was that piranhas do that swarming, blood-crazed, flesh-ripping thing only in a couple of rare circumstances, both involving a highly concentrated food source: They will swarm around bird rookeries, where the fledglings leaving the nest often tumble straight down into the water. And they\xe2\x80\x99ll do it around docks where fishermen clean their catch and heave the guts into the water.'b'Otherwise, you can swim without fear.'b'I didn\xe2\x80\x99t worry about piranhas, for instance, when the only place to bathe, on a recent trip deep into the backcountry of Suriname, was the river running past our camp.'b'Then one day, sitting in a canoe, I watched the fish biologist on our expedition, Jan H. Mol of the University of Suriname, pull a 12-inch-long black piranha out of the same water where we took our daily baths. As this extremely toothy creature wriggled in his hands, Mr. Mol started talking, in his somewhat ponderous way, about a paper he had published on piranha-bite incidents, complete with color photos of amputated toes.'b'Like me, Mr. Mol believes the piranha threat is wildly exaggerated. He has spent more than 20 years wading in South American rivers and hauling up every imaginable fish without ever being injured by free-swimming piranhas. \xe2\x80\x9cFree-swimming\xe2\x80\x9d is, however, the operative phrase there: If you get careless while trying to untangle one from a net, or you let one flop around the bottom of the boat, things can get painful.'b'As he spoke, Mr. Mol was using the soft pad of his index finger to hold down the piranha\xe2\x80\x99s sharply serrated lower jaw and give me a better view. It was a formidable mouthful. But that index finger rather spoiled the effect of another recent study, in the journal Nature, which found that the black piranha\xe2\x80\x99s bite is more powerful, pound for pound, than that of a great white shark or a killer whale. Yes, yes, that article also mentioned T. rex, but \xe2\x80\x9cpound for pound\xe2\x80\x9d (or as the authors put it, \xe2\x80\x9cremoving the effects of body size\xe2\x80\x9d) turns out to be another of those pesky operative phrases.'b'We chatted briefly about the classic studies by the Brazilian researcher Ivan Sazima, who observed piranhas in the clear-water ponds and creeks of South America\xe2\x80\x99s vast Pantanal wetlands. Mr. Sazima found that these generally timid little fish mainly feed by nipping off fins and scales from passing fish, not by ripping their flesh. Mr. Sazima is also an author of a paper with the lovely title \xe2\x80\x9cScavenging on human corpses as a source for stories about man-eating piranhas.\xe2\x80\x9d It concluded that when human bodies turn up in the water with signs of piranha attack, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost certainly because the piranhas were scavenging on people who were already dead.'b'Even piranha specialists would struggle to come up with a dozen cases over the past half-century in which multiple living human victims were injured. In the two cases Mr. Mol investigated in northwestern Suriname, one in the 1950s and the other in the early 2000s, most of the victims suffered a single relatively minor bite on the feet or legs. He found that in each case, there was a factor that attracted piranhas to the area \xe2\x80\x94 fishermen gutting their catch nearby or holiday visitors spilling food in the river. Mr. Mol theorized that the piranhas bit humans by accident at first, and then, recognizing a newly abundant food source, began to take advantage of it. Other fish specialists I spoke to or emailed the other day argued that those incidents, and the more recent one in Rosario, Argentina, were all cases of defensive biting.'b'Christmas Day was unusually hot in Rosario \xe2\x80\x94 about 100 degrees Fahrenheit \xe2\x80\x94 and people were crowding into the river. It\xe2\x80\x99s also mating season for the three local piranha species. It\xe2\x80\x99s likely, said Prosanta Chakrabarty, a fish biologist at Louisiana State University, that bathers inadvertently wandered into male breeding territories, provoking a brief but hostile response.'b'None of the attacks escalated into a classic piranha swarm. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, as The Daily Mail reported, \xe2\x80\x9clike a scene from a horror film\xe2\x80\x9d with swimmers being \xe2\x80\x9csavaged by shoals of the razor-toothed fish,\xe2\x80\x9d which ripped away \xe2\x80\x9cchunks of their naked and exposed flesh.\xe2\x80\x9d Victims were able to walk back to the beach without being attacked by other piranhas. Other beachgoers were back in the water a half-hour later.'b'So what\xe2\x80\x99s the bottom line on piranhas? \xe2\x80\x9cIf something is potentially dangerous to humans, it will be dangerous in certain conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mol told me, as we sat in the canoe that day in Suriname. But those conditions are extremely rare, and the danger tends to be highly limited.'b'We ate the piranha for dinner that night, and I continued to bathe in the river.'b'But \xe2\x80\x94 this is the thing about human nature \xe2\x80\x94 now and then I also paused to count my toes.'b''b'\n'b'Richard Conniff 'b' is the author of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Species Seekers: Heroes, Fools, and the Mad Pursuit of Life on Earth.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b''b'IT\xe2\x80\x99S that time of year again. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s your waistline you\xe2\x80\x99re worried about, or maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s the smoking habit you just can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to kick. To improve your chances of keeping your New Year\xe2\x80\x99s resolutions, we offer four tips inspired by recent research on behavioral economics and health. We focus on health, but our suggestions should help with other goals, too.'b'First, make a concrete plan. When you do so, you both embed your intentions firmly in memory (which reduces forgetting) and make it harder to postpone good behavior, since doing so requires breaking an explicit commitment to yourself. In an experiment 'b'reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'b', a team of researchers (including one of us) contacted thousands of individuals who needed 'b'flu'b' shots. Those individuals who were prompted to privately write down a plan specifying the date and time they would visit a clinic got shots at a 13 percent higher rate than members of a control group, who were also reminded about clinics but were not prompted to form a plan. This strategy, as the same team 'b'reported in the journal Preventive Medicine'b', also improved turnout for 'b'colonoscopies'b'.'b'Second, put something you value on the line. In 'b'an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association'b', a team of researchers (including one of us) reported that over the course of a 16-week study, individuals who were given the opportunity to set aside money for forfeiture if they failed to lose weight lost 14 pounds more than those in a control group. Similarly, 'b'an experiment in the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics'b' found that smokers hoping to quit were more likely to succeed if offered an opportunity to deposit funds in an account for six months that they would lose if they failed a urine test for 'b'nicotine'b' and cotinine. You can arrange to forfeit money if you don\xe2\x80\x99t achieve your goals at 'b'stickK.com'b', a website founded by behavioral economists. But putting money on the line isn\xe2\x80\x99t your only option: Making an appointment to 'b'exercise'b' with a friend may be effective, too, because you are much less likely to cancel on a friend than on yourself.'b'Third, bundle your temptations. This is one of our favorite strategies for tackling health goals, which we tested in an experiment described in 'b'a forthcoming paper in Management Science'b'. The idea is best illustrated with a scenario: Imagine you want to exercise more but struggle to drag yourself to the gym. Imagine you also have a fondness for trashy novels but feel guilty 'b'wasting'b' your time reading them. The solution is simple: Allow yourself to read those novels only while exercising at the gym. Our research demonstrates that when you leave your copy of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hunger Games\xe2\x80\x9d (or such) at the gym, you exercise 56 percent more often (and 61 percent of people will even pay the gym to hold their book so it is only available when exercising).'b'Fourth, seek social support. You can achieve more by pursuing goals with the help of a mentor. In 'b'a study co-authored by one of us and reported in the Annals of Internal Medicine'b', patients with poorly controlled 'b'diabetes'b' were paired with patients who previously had poorly controlled diabetes but had since achieved mastery over their disease. The improvements in glycemic control achieved by those mentored in this study were larger than those produced by many leading drugs.'b'What if, despite our tips, you nonetheless fail to achieve your New Year\xe2\x80\x99s resolutions? Fortunately, you will have plenty of other chances. In 'b'a paper forthcoming in Management Science'b', a team of researchers (including one of us) documents \xe2\x80\x9cthe fresh start effect.\xe2\x80\x9d We analyzed the frequency with which Americans searched for the term \xe2\x80\x9cdiet\xe2\x80\x9d on Google, students visited a university gym and people signed up to create goals on 'b'stickK.com'b'. We found that the beginnings of many cycles \xe2\x80\x94 including the start of a new week, month, year and semester (for students) \xe2\x80\x94 are associated with increased interest in dieting as well as increases in exercise and goal creation. People also intensify their pursuit of aspirations following birthdays and federal holidays.'b'So although many (in fact most) New Year\xe2\x80\x99s resolutions are unsuccessful, the good news is that if at first we don\xe2\x80\x99t succeed, there are many other \xe2\x80\x9cfresh starts\xe2\x80\x9d on the calendar when we can try again.'b'Readers react to a call for better coverage for psychiatric care.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'It has been a decade of tragedy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports increasing suicide rates since 2000. News articles about mass shootings and extreme violence are routine.'b'The urgency for enhanced mental health services could not be more compelling. Congress responded with the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, intended to end longstanding insurance practices that discriminated against people with mental illness and drug and alcohol addictions.'b'Beginning in 2014, the parity law\xe2\x80\x99s reach will become even broader as millions more Americans gain mental health coverage under the Affordable Care Act. But it won\xe2\x80\x99t be good enough. Many consumers will still face impossible barriers to getting needed mental health and substance abuse services.'b'Insurance programs can pick and choose which services to approve. A significant number don\xe2\x80\x99t cover residential services, partial hospitalization or intensive outpatient care for people who need it.'b'Not to mention that many outpatient psychiatrists do not even accept insurance, requiring patients to pay out of pocket, as your article \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Fewer Psychiatrists Seen Taking Health Insurance'b'\xe2\x80\x9d pointed out. It cites a study showing that a mere 55 percent of psychiatrists accept private insurance and Medicare, while only 43 percent accept Medicaid, far less than other doctors. This is not likely to change, as the demand for psychiatric care far exceeds the supply of physicians.'b'There are numerous reasons for this disparity, although they mostly boil down to the fact that insurance companies, with their poor psychiatric reimbursements and intrusive reviews, provide little incentive for solo practitioners to accept them.'b'To really improve access to mental health care, insurance companies need to reform their policies. Otherwise, millions of Americans will continue to go without a diagnosis and without treatment, leading to more decades of tragedy.'b'HELEN M. FARRELL'b' Boston, Dec. 30, 2013'b''b''b'The writer is a psychiatrist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an instructor at Harvard Medical School.'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b''b'Readers React'b''b'Dr. Farrell notes a number of barriers to mental health care, but does not acknowledge that much of the problem has been self-inflicted by psychiatry and the mental health profession, which have been co-opted by Big Pharma and its push to increase the diagnoses of both minor and major disorders to new heights.'b'This is the only explanation for a 40-fold increase in the diagnosis of bipolar disorder among youth and a doubling in adults. Rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have tripled in some studies, while rates in Denmark have gone up fivefold. Naturally, these increases have resulted in an enormous increase in prescriptions for stimulants in both youth and adults. These figures undercut Dr. Farrell\xe2\x80\x99s claim that \xe2\x80\x9cmillions\xe2\x80\x9d are going without a diagnosis or treatment.'b'It seems to me that the evidence indicates that we are in fact overdiagnosing and overtreating, thus adding to the shortage of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals. The evidence further suggests that psychiatrists are prescribing simply on the basis of symptoms rather than on formal diagnoses, which may or may not be a good development given our flawed manual of mental disorders, but nevertheless further opens the treatment floodgates.'b'CHARLES E. DEAN'b' Apple Valley, Minn., Jan. 1, 2014'b''b''b'The writer is a psychiatrist.'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'While it is true that psychiatric services are poorly paid in general by insurance companies and particularly by Medicare and Medicaid, I am embarrassed by and disappointed in my colleagues who feel the solution is to accept only private-pay patients. With the median household income at about $52,000, it seems highly unlikely that most people could afford $100 to $200 a visit to a psychiatrist.'b'I believe that our professional organizations need to take a much more vigorous and insistent position with insurance companies and the government. Citizens deserve to have their psychiatric illnesses covered as well as their medical problems. And psychiatrists should be as well paid as other physicians.'b'For psychiatrists to decide not to be involved in any insurance plans because of poor reimbursement and intrusive practices is simply to abandon multitudes of patients to their misery.'b'MARYALICE HOUGHTON'b' Milwaukee, Jan. 1, 2014'b''b''b'The writer is a psychiatrist.'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'Those of us who for years lobbied Congress to ban discriminatory mental health coverage practices understood that enactment of parity legislation was only a first step. As Dr. Farrell rightly observes, insurers still maintain practices that deny people access to needed behavioral health care. Most notably, those companies reimburse so poorly for psychiatric care that many practitioners do not accept insurance.'b'Shall we blame the psychiatrist? Consider that managing patients\xe2\x80\x99 often life-threatening illnesses is rarely a 9-to-5 job. Yet after nine or 10 years of post-college professional training, and with at least $40,000 annually in overhead costs, psychiatrists can expect to receive insurance reimbursements no greater than what one might pay for an hour of a plumber\xe2\x80\x99s time.'b'Mental health is integral to overall health.

As a child and adolescent psychiatrist, I was once told by an insurance company representative that the $25-per-visit reimbursement rate was reasonable because I was expected to see six patients an hour: 10-minute visits with children and adolescents with complex mental health and developmental challenges.'b'I have never been able to reasonably accomplish a visit with a child and family in less than 30 minutes. And even then I am usually running over time.'b'Psychiatric care remains a stepchild of health care \xe2\x80\x94 many patients left to fend for themselves \xe2\x80\x94 despite frantic cries for better mental health care when tragedy strikes. Mental health is a core component of healthy development and overall well-being. Attitudes must change within the profession and in the financial reimbursement model before we can expect any real changes in how the public perceives and responds to mental health needs.'b'CANDIDA FINK'b' New Rochelle, N.Y., Jan. 1, 2014'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'I think that a major hurdle to satisfactory mental health care is that even within the profession there is no agreement on what mental illness is, or what causes it. Some maintain that it is due solely to chemical imbalances in the brain, while at the other end people see it as being due to a combination of genetic factors and inadequate parental upbringing.'b'With so little established as fact, it is no wonder that insurance companies, for instance, are reluctant to finance what may be interminable treatments.'b'DAVID HARRIS'b' Alexandria, Va., Jan. 1, 2014'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'Most people would choose to avoid a relationship that is adversarial and borne of mistrust. Such is the predicament of the psychiatrist, especially if talk therapy is involved, in relation to the insurance company.'b'Letters come informing us, for example, that on average patients are seen for eight visits or less. Not a subtle message.'b'On the surface, \xe2\x80\x9cmedical necessity\xe2\x80\x9d as a factor in determining whether to continue coverage seems inoffensive and unobjectionable. But it is often used as a weapon to deny care when intensive treatment is taking place.'b'The practicing psychiatrist must insulate himself from the background threat with which he and his patient are confronted in order to listen carefully to his patient.'b'Yet insurance companies are entitled to know what they are paying for, and cost containment is a legitimate concern. What reforms does Dr. Farrell suggest to remedy this situation?'b'LARRY S.

When is psychiatric care essential to the prevention of suicide or mass shootings (or simple misery), who should provide it (doctors, nurses, psychologists, social workers), and who should determine exactly what needs to be done (in a field that is struggling to be more scientific but is a long way from achieving this)?'b'If I come up with the answers to any of these questions, I will be packing my suitcase for my trip to Stockholm to pick up my prize.'b'MARTIN P.

These breakthroughs opened the \xe2\x80\x9ctreatment floodgates,\xe2\x80\x9d as Dr. Dean puts it \xe2\x80\x94 not undue influence imposed by Big Pharma.'b'Mental disorders, including affective, behavioral, cognitive and perceptual abnormalities, significantly impair one\xe2\x80\x99s ability to love, play and work. Contrary to Mr. Harris\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, psychiatrists agree on the causes of mental illness: a coalescence of genetic, environmental, developmental and social factors.'b'Because of this complexity, psychiatrists make thoughtful assessments and develop patient-centric treatment plans. This takes more than 10 minutes for Dr. Fink (and any diligent psychiatrist), although that is all the time one insurance company was willing to reimburse for!'b'Discriminatory mental-health coverage practices are atrocious. Mr. Ibson\xe2\x80\x99s lobbying of Congress to enact parity legislation is laudable, but as he reminds us, it was only a first step.'b'Dr. Houghton transforms my point about psychiatrists opting out of dismal insurance plans into an assertion about breach of duty of care. She claims that psychiatrists have decided to simply \xe2\x80\x9cabandon multitudes of patients to their misery.\xe2\x80\x9d Not at all. Mental care is a core component of general health, and it is up to insurers to pay adequately for it.'b'HELEN M. FARRELL'b' Boston, Jan. 2, 2014'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9cTO read a novel is a difficult and complex art,\xe2\x80\x9d Virginia Woolf wrote in a 1925 essay, \xe2\x80\x9cHow to Read a Book.\xe2\x80\x9d Today, with our powers of concentration atrophied by the staccato communication of the Internet and attention easily diverted to addictive entertainment on our phones and tablets, book-length reading is harder still.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not just more difficult to find the time and focus that a book demands. Longstanding allies of the reader, professionals who have traditionally provided guidance for those picking up a book, are disappearing fast. The broad, inclusive conversation around interesting titles that such experts helped facilitate is likewise dissipating. Reading, always a solitary affair, is increasingly a lonely one.'b'A range of related factors have brought this to a head. Start with the publishing companies: Overall book sales have been anemic in recent years, declining 6 percent 'b'in the first half of 2013'b' alone. But the profits of publishers have remained largely intact; in the same period only one of what were then still the \xe2\x80\x9cbig six\xe2\x80\x9d trade houses 'b'reported a decline'b' on its bottom line. This is partly because of the higher margins on e-books. But it has also been achieved by publishers cutting costs, especially for mid-list titles.'b'The \xe2\x80\x9cmid-list\xe2\x80\x9d in trade publishing parlance is a bit like the middle class in American politics: Anything below it is rarely mentioned in polite company. It comprises pretty much all new titles that are not potential blockbusters. But it\xe2\x80\x99s the space where interesting things happen in the book world, where the obscure or the offbeat can spring to prominence, where new writers can make their mark.'b'Budgets have been trimmed in various ways: Author advances, except for the biggest names, have slumped sharply since the 2008 financial crash, declining by more than half, according to one recent survey. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine that the quality of manuscripts from writers who have been forced either to eat less or write faster isn\xe2\x80\x99t deteriorating. Meanwhile, spending on editing and promotion has also been pared away.'b'Things don\xe2\x80\x99t get better after the book leaves the publisher. Price cutting, led primarily by Amazon, has reduced many brick-and-mortar bookstores to rubble, depriving readers of direct interaction with booksellers. Despite some recent good news, the number of independents has been halved in the last two decades, and the chain stores that survive 'b'increasingly employ part-time, unskilled staff'b'.'b'The decline in libraries weakens another vital prop for readers. Librarians, described by the novelist Richard Powers as \xe2\x80\x9cgas attendant[s] of the mind,\xe2\x80\x9d saw a national decrease in their numbers of nearly 100,000 over the two decades to 2009. 'b'Two-thirds of public libraries'b' reported 'b'flat or decreasing budgets'b' in 2012.'b'Then there is today\xe2\x80\x99s increasingly rare bird, the professional book reviewer. Stand-alone book sections in major newspapers such as The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post have disappeared. The New York Times Book Review is now just 'b'a third of the length'b' it was in its 1970s heyday. Online reviews like The Los Angeles Review of Books and The New Inquiry are striving to fill the gap. But their rates of pay, predictably, do not rival those at the more established publications they are replacing. Cyril Connolly caustically described the book reviewer as having \xe2\x80\x9ca whole-time job with a half-time salary,\xe2\x80\x9d a job \xe2\x80\x9cin which the best in him is generally expended on the mediocre in others.\xe2\x80\x9d Today, it\xe2\x80\x99s more of a part-time job with no salary.'b'This variety of channels for the expert appraisal of books has been replaced with recommendations thrown up by online retailers\xe2\x80\x99 computers. But as with so much of the Internet, the nuance and enthusiasm of human encounters is poorly replicated by an algorithm. For more personal interactions, many have turned to social reading sites such as Goodreads or LibraryThing.'b'The growth of these sites has been phenomenal. Shortly after its purchase by Amazon in the spring of last year, Goodreads announced it had 20 million users. Whether this is an amelioration or a reflection of an increasingly atomized culture is a question that can be filed in the same drawer as Facebook friending or dating on 'b'Match.com'b'. Certainly the range of collective knowledge in pools of this size is incontestable. But it derives from self-selecting volunteers whose authority is hard to gauge. And though the overall network is vast, recommendations are generally exchanged within tight circles of friends. This results in another typical Internet characteristic: the \xe2\x80\x9cmirroring\xe2\x80\x9d of existing tastes at the expense of discovering anything new.'b'THERE are many who will not mourn the displacement of literary culture\xe2\x80\x99s traditional elite, dominated as it was by white, middle-aged men of comfortable means and conservative taste. Jeff Bezos, the C.E.O. of Amazon, aimed to exploit such disillusion with the old ways when announcing the launch of Kindle Direct. The self-publishing e-book program would, he claimed, produce \xe2\x80\x9ca more diverse book culture\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cno expert gatekeepers saying \xe2\x80\x98sorry, that will never work.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d But to express discomfort at the attrition of expert opinion is not to defend the previous order\xe2\x80\x99s prerogatives. Nor is it elitist to suggest that making the values and personnel of such professional hierarchies more representative is preferable to dispensing with them.'b'On the desolate beach that is the lot of the contemporary book reader, the footprints of one companion can still be found. They belong to the writer, who needs the reader not just to pay her or his wages but also to give meaning to their words. As John Cheever put it: \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t write without a reader. It\xe2\x80\x99s precisely like a kiss \xe2\x80\x94 you can\xe2\x80\x99t do it alone.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The troubling thought occurs, however, that this last remaining cohabitant may also be about to depart the island. With falling advances, writing is evermore dominated by people who don\xe2\x80\x99t need it to earn a living: Tenured academics and celebrities spring to mind. For these groups, burnishing a r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 or marketing a brand is often as important as satisfying the reader.'b'And then there are the hobbyists, those for whom writing is primarily an act of self-expression. This past November, National Novel Writing Month (Nanowrimo) encouraged more than 300,000 participants to produce a novel in 30 days. It would be churlish to gainsay the right of the legions taking up \xe2\x80\x9cnoveling,\xe2\x80\x9d as Nanowrimo describes it, to exercise their creative selves. But such endeavors are not much helping readers. Indeed, to the extent that they expand the mind-boggling proliferation of new titles being published (more than 300,000 in 2012), they are adding to the problem.'b'Faced with a dizzying array of choices and receiving little by way of expert help in making selections, book buyers today are deciding to play it safe, opting to join either the ever-larger audiences for blockbusters or the minuscule readerships of a vast range of specialist titles. In this bifurcation, the mid-list, publishing\xe2\x80\x99s experimental laboratory, is being abandoned.'b'THIS much can be said for Bill de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s inauguration, which featured a concentration of left-wing agitprop unseen since the last time Pete Seeger occupied a stage alone: If the waning years of Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s presidency are going to be defined by a liberal crusade against income inequality, there\xe2\x80\x99s no more fitting place to kick it off than New York City.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s fitting because a glance at New York\xe2\x80\x99s ever-richer 1 percent, its priced-out middle class and its majestic skyscrapers soaring above pockets of squalor makes it easy enough to understand left-wing populism\xe2\x80\x99s appeal.'b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s fitting, as well, because New York also illustrates the tensions that make the war on inequality hard to wage, and suggests reasons to question whether it\xe2\x80\x99s actually worth fighting in the first place.'b'Those tensions start with the fact that despite a run of non-Democratic mayors, the five boroughs have hardly been a laboratory for Social Darwinists in the last two decades. Instead, de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctale of two cities,\xe2\x80\x9d one ever-richer and one struggling to keep up, has been unspooling in a liberal metropolis in a liberal state surrounded by a mostly liberal region, where many obvious anti-inequality 'b'policy levers'b' are already 'b'being pulled'b'.'b'This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean inequality is immune to policy responses, especially when you leap to the national level \xe2\x80\x94 a leap, of course, that liberal populists want to see de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s message make.'b'But the new mayor\xe2\x80\x99s political coalition also provides a clue as to why a comprehensive policy response may never actually be tried. In his primary upset, de Blasio enjoyed strong backing from the city\xe2\x80\x99s college-educated upper middle class. He even did slightly better among voters making between $100,000 and $200,000 than he did among the poor.'b'In a way, this shows the potential breadth of populism\xe2\x80\x99s appeal. But while upper-middle-class voters are happy to support higher taxes on 1 percenters \xe2\x80\x94 not least because they\xe2\x80\x99re tired of trying to compete with them for schools and real estate \xe2\x80\x94 they don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily want a program that would require their own taxes to rise substantially.'b'And this is a problem for the populist left, because to build the kind of welfare state \xe2\x80\x94 European, Scandinavian \xe2\x80\x94 that seems to really level incomes, you need lots of tax dollars from the non-rich. Yet the current Democratic coalition has been built on a promise to never raise taxes on anyone making under $250,000 ... or maybe $400,000 ... or possibly $500,000, the threshold de Blasio chose.'b'That promise has made it safe for many well-off voters, in New York and elsewhere, to cast votes for liberal populism. But it\xe2\x80\x99s also made it impossible for the populist war on inequality to ever actually be won.'b'But should we even want that war to be fought? Here, too, New York\xe2\x80\x99s experience raises difficult questions for egalitarians. Of all the arguments for reducing inequality, the most potent is the claim that a more unequal society is one with fewer opportunities to rise, and that a hardening of class lines in America is intimately connected to growing fortunes at the top.'b'This makes some intuitive sense, and there is international data \xe2\x80\x94 dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cthe Great Gatsby curve\xe2\x80\x9d by the economist Alan Krueger \xe2\x80\x94 suggesting a link between inequality and immobility. But within the United States, that link turns out to be much less readily apparent.'b'Using data from an ambitious research project on social mobility, the Manhattan Institute\xe2\x80\x99s Scott Winship and the Heritage Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s Donald Schneider recently tried to recreate the \xe2\x80\x9cGatsby curve\xe2\x80\x9d for U.S. job markets. Instead, they found little-to-no correlation between inequality and mobility across different regions of the country.'b'And New York illustrates their point, because the city\xe2\x80\x99s extreme income inequality hasn\xe2\x80\x99t led to extreme immobility. In fact, compared with nationwide trends, New Yorkers born into poverty have an above-average chance of rising into the middle class. (And New Yorkers born into affluence have an above-average chance of dropping to the bottom.)'b'Now it\xe2\x80\x99s true that whatever the link between mobility and equality, there are potential policy moves \xe2\x80\x94 an expansion of housing stock, for instance, to make expensive cities more affordable \xe2\x80\x94 that would probably address both issues at once.'b'De Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s signature proposal, universal pre-K, is a more ambiguous case. 'b'Most research indicates'b' that early childhood education doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the benefits to children\xe2\x80\x99s prospects that its advocates suggest. But it\xe2\x80\x99s possible the program could increase the 'b'mobility of parents'b', by lowering costs and stress for two-earner and single-parent households.'b'But there\xe2\x80\x99s also a pessimistic scenario, in which the growing cost of New York\xe2\x80\x99s existing welfare state means that de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s crusade ultimately just devolves into interest-group featherbedding, in which the rich are squeezed to benefit a well-compensated public sector and preserve bureaucracies that ought to be reformed.'b'And that outcome \xe2\x80\x94 a populism that marginally inconveniences the richest without meaningfully changing life for anyone else \xe2\x80\x94 would be less a model for the post-Obama Democrats than a cautionary tale.'b''b' 'b''b''b'Biometric scanners on smartphones and tablets will soon make answering security questions a thing of the past.

It is amazing how many people violate that rule, but especially in Congress and especially among the Tea Party types, where calling someone a \xe2\x80\x9cdeal maker\xe2\x80\x9d is now the ultimate put down. What makes it crazier is that in American education, innovation and commerce today, \xe2\x80\x9ccollaboration\xe2\x80\x9d is being taught and rewarded as the best way to do anything big, important and complex. Indeed, in Silicon Valley, a \xe2\x80\x9ccollaborator\xe2\x80\x9d means someone with whom you\xe2\x80\x99re building something great. In D.C., it means someone committing political treason by working with the other party. And that is why Silicon Valley is now the turbo-engine of our economy and D.C. is the dead hand.'b'To be sure, in politics compromise is not a virtue in and of itself. There are questions of true principle \xe2\x80\x94 civil rights, for instance \xe2\x80\x94 where compromise might kill the principled choice. But there has been an inflation of \xe2\x80\x9cprinciples\xe2\x80\x9d lately that is inhibiting compromise. A certain tax rate or retirement age is not a principle. It\xe2\x80\x99s an interest that needs to be balanced against others. Today, we would be best served in meeting our biggest challenges by adopting a hybrid of the best ideas of left and right \xe2\x80\x94 and the fact that we can\xe2\x80\x99t is sapping our strength.'b'For instance, on the debt/spending issue, Congress should be borrowing money at these unusually low rates to invest in a 10-year upgrade of our crumbling infrastructure (roads, bridges, telecom, ports, airports and rail lines) and in a huge funding increase for our national laboratories, research universities and institutes of health, which are the gardens for so many start-ups. Together, such an investment would stimulate sustained employment, innovation and the wealth creation to pay for it.'b'But this near-term investment should be paired with long-term entitlement reductions, defense cuts and tax reform that would be phased in gradually as the economy improves, so we do not add to the already heavy fiscal burden on our children, deprive them of future investment resources or leave our economy vulnerable to unforeseen shocks, future recessions or the stresses that are sure to come when all the baby boomers retire. President Obama has favored such a hybrid, but it was shot down by the Tea Party wing, before we could see if he could really sell it to his base.'b'We should exploit our new natural gas bounty, but only by pairing it with the highest environmental extraction rules and a national, steadily rising, renewable energy portfolio standard that would ensure that natural gas replaces coal \xe2\x80\x94 not solar, wind or other renewables. That way shale gas becomes a bridge to a cleaner energy future, not just an addiction to a less dirty, climate-destabilizing fossil fuel.'b'In some cities, teachers\xe2\x80\x99 unions really are holding up education reform. But we need to stop blaming teachers alone. We also have a parent problem: parents who do not take an interest in their children\xe2\x80\x99s schooling or set high standards. And we have a student problem: students who do not understand the connection between their skills and their life opportunities and are unwilling to work to today\xe2\x80\x99s global standards. Reform requires a hybrid of both teacher reform and a sustained \xe2\x80\x94 not just one speech \xe2\x80\x94 national campaign to challenge parents and create a culture of respect and excitement for learning. Obama has failed to use his unique bully pulpit to lead such a campaign.'b'Finally, the merger of globalization and the information-technology revolution has shrunk the basis of the old middle class \xe2\x80\x94 the high-wage, middle-skilled job. Increasingly, there are only high-wage, high-skilled jobs. This merger of globalization and I.T. has put capitalism \xe2\x80\x94 and its core engine of creative destruction \xe2\x80\x94 on steroids. That\xe2\x80\x99s why Republicans are wrong when they oppose raising minimum wages and expanding national health care. These kinds of social safety nets make the free market possible; otherwise people won\xe2\x80\x99t put up with creative destruction on steroids.\xc2\xa0'b'But it is capitalism, start-ups, risk-taking and entrepreneurship that make these safety nets affordable, which is why we need more tax incentives for start-ups, the substitutions of carbon taxes for payroll and corporate taxes, and more cuts to regulations that burden business. Unfortunately, promotion of risk-taking and risk-takers is disappearing from the Democratic Party agenda. Its energy and excitement is focused much more today on wealth redistribution than wealth creation. On immigration, Senate Democrats and Republicans forged a sensible hybrid solution, but Tea Partiers in the House are blocking it.'b'These hybrid solutions are not how to split the difference. They\xe2\x80\x99re how to make a difference. But they only get forged if Republican leaders take on the Tea Party \xe2\x80\x94 which transformed the G.O.P. into a far-right party, uninterested in governing \xe2\x80\x94 and remake the G.O.P. into a center-right party again. If that happened, I\xe2\x80\x99m certain that a second-term Obama, who is much more center-left than the ridiculous G.O.P. caricatures, would meet them in the middle. Absent that, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to drift, unable to address effectively any of our biggest challenges or opportunities.'b'THOSE of us in the pundit world tend to blather on about what happened yesterday, while often ignoring what happens every day. We stir up topics already on the agenda, but we falter at calling attention to crucial-but-neglected issues.'b'So here\xe2\x80\x99s your chance to tell us what we\xe2\x80\x99re missing. I invite readers to suggest issues that deserve more attention in 2014. Make your suggestions on my blog, 'b'nytimes.com/ontheground'b'. I hope to quote from some of your ideas in a future column.'b'My own suggestion for a systematically neglected issue: mental health. One-quarter of American adults 'b'suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder'b', including depression, anorexia, post-traumatic stress disorder and more, according to the National Institutes of Health. Such disorders are the leading cause of disability in the United States and Canada, the N.I.H. says.'b'A parent with depression. A lover who is bipolar. A child with an eating disorder. A brother who returned from war with P.T.S.D. A sister who is suicidal.'b'All across America and the world, families struggle with these issues, but people are more likely to cry quietly in bed than speak out. These mental health issues pose a greater risk to our well-being than, say, the Afghan Taliban or Al Qaeda terrorists, yet in polite society there is still something of a code of silence around these topics.'b'We in the news business have devoted vast coverage to political battles over health care, deservedly, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t delve enough into underlying mental health issues that are crucial to national well-being.'b'Indeed, when the news media do cover mental health, we do so mostly in extreme situations such as a mass shooting. That leads the public to think of mental disorders as dangerous, stigmatizing those who are mentally ill and making it harder for them to find friends or get family support.'b'In fact, says 'b'an Institute of Medicine report'b', the danger is \xe2\x80\x9cgreatly exaggerated\xe2\x80\x9d in the public mind. The report concluded: \xe2\x80\x9calthough findings of many studies suggest a link between mental illnesses and violence, the contribution of people with mental illnesses to overall rates of violence is small.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Put simply, the great majority of people who are mentally ill are not violent and do not constitute a threat \xe2\x80\x94 except, sometimes, to themselves. Every year, 38,000 'b'Americans commit suicide'b', and 90 percent of them are said to suffer from mental illness.'b'One study found that 'b'anorexia is by far the most deadly psychiatric disorder'b', partly because of greatly elevated suicide risk.'b'Mental illness is also linked to narcotics and alcoholism, homelessness, parenting problems and cycles of poverty. 'b'One study found'b' that 55 percent of American infants in poverty are raised by mothers with symptoms of depression, which impairs child rearing.'b'So if we want to tackle a broad range of social pathologies and inequities, we as a society have to break taboos about mental health. There has been progress, and news organizations can help accelerate it. But too often our coverage just aggravates the stigma and thereby encourages more silence.'b'The truth is that mental illness is not hopeless, and people recover all the time. 'b'Consider John Nash'b', the Princeton University mathematics genius who after a brilliant early career then tumbled into delusions and involuntary hospitalization \xe2\x80\x94 captured by the book and movie \xe2\x80\x9cA Beautiful Mind.\xe2\x80\x9d Nash spent decades as an obscure, mumbling presence on the Princeton campus before regaining his mental health and winning the Nobel Prize for economics.'b'Although treatments are available, we often don\xe2\x80\x99t provide care, so the mentally ill disproportionately end up in prison or on the streets.'b'One example of a cost-effective approach employs a case worker to help mentally ill people leaving a hospital or shelter as they adjust to life in the outside world. Randomized trials have found that this support dramatically reduces subsequent homelessness and hospitalization.'b''b'Researchers found'b' that the $6,300 cost per person in the program was offset by $24,000 in savings because of reduced hospitalization. In short, the program more than paid for itself. But we as a society hugely underinvest in mental health services.'b'Children in particular don\xe2\x80\x99t get treated nearly often enough. 'b'The American Journal of Psychiatry reports'b' that of children ages 6 to 17 who need mental health services, 80 percent don\xe2\x80\x99t get help. Racial and ethnic minorities are even more underserved.'b'So mental health gets my vote as a major neglected issue meriting more attention. It\xe2\x80\x99s not sexy, and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t involve Democrats and Republicans screaming at each other, but it is a source of incalculable suffering that can be remedied.'b'Now it\xe2\x80\x99s your turn to suggest neglected issues for coverage in 2014. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back with a report.'b'Stephen Kellert is a social ecologist and senior research scholar at 'b'Yale University\xe2\x80\x99s School of Forestry and Environmental Studies'b'. He has written several books and produced a documentary about so-called biophilic design, which goes beyond sustainability to integrate and connect people with the natural world.'b''b'READING'b' 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Making of the Atomic Bomb\xe2\x80\x9d'b' by Richard Rhodes is a terrible read \xe2\x80\x94 so long, boring and difficult to understand \xe2\x80\x94 but it\xe2\x80\x99s a profound book because it really does provide the incredible detail to make you realize here they were moving the boundaries of our understanding of the universe and they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even see the thing they were studying.'b'Good design has an atomic quality. When things are organized in a coherent and integrated way you get these emergent properties so the whole is better than the sum of its parts. A lot of bad architecture, including sustainable architecture \xe2\x80\x94 like the current fascination with the United States 'b'Green Building Council LEED system'b' \xe2\x80\x94 is done by following a checklist. You check off all these things, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily add up to an integrated, attractive whole.'b''b'LISTENING'b' I love listening to the 'b'Sirius XM Classical Pops channel'b'. It\xe2\x80\x99s music by composers like Mozart, Haydn, Brahms and Beethoven. I also have a real predilection for bird sounds. If you live in the East, there is so much forest and vegetation, you use your ears as much as your eyes to bird watch. The 'b'wood thrush'b' has this beautiful fluting piccolo type sound, and each wood thrush\xe2\x80\x99s song is slightly different. It\xe2\x80\x99s subtle, but you begin to appreciate that individual variability.'b''b'WATCHING'b' I like to look at buildings and landscapes that reveal a pronounced and inspired connection to nature. Go to 'b'Grand Central Station'b' in New York City and you see people taking pictures. What is so appealing? Look closely and you will notice the natural materials, the constellations on the ceilings, even the fixtures and lights all have plantlike forms that look like leaves and ferns and vines. You can also see it in very well-designed spaces that aren\xe2\x80\x99t as well known. You see this fractal geometry, which you see in nature, that variation on a theme like a snowflake or seashell. They are recognizable and repeated time after time but not in the same way.'b''b'FOLLOWING'b' 'b'Children and Nature Network\xe2\x80\x99s website'b' is of great interest to me. It provides lots of information and studies about how, when children are deprived of nature, they are more likely to suffer from things like myopia, obesity and A.D.H.D.'b''b'RAISING'b' I raise grass-fed beef cows. They are called Baldies, which is a cross between an Angus and Hereford. As long as I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be a meat eater, I\xe2\x80\x99d much rather know where my meat is coming from and that the animals have been humanely raised or humanely shot. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind telling people they are eating Strawberry, which is the name of the most recent steer we slaughtered. I have a picture of him in my mind and he was the sweetest, loveliest animal. He had a great life until it was over. He tasted great.'b'FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. \xe2\x80\x94 WE don\xe2\x80\x99t get any say about the kind of world we\xe2\x80\x99re born into \xe2\x80\x94 about whether it\xe2\x80\x99s prepared for the likes of us, whether it will open its arms. Hal Faulkner certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the world he deserved. It was needlessly cruel to him, senselessly judgmental. For the most part, he made peace with that.'b'But over the last few months, with cancer spreading fast through his body and time running out, his thoughts turned to one aspect of that landscape that he could perhaps revisit, one wrinkle he might be able to revise, a wrong he had a chance of righting before his death.'b'Back in 1956, when he was 22, he was discharged from the Marines after more than three years of proud service. There were no real blots on his record. No complaints of incompetence or laziness or insubordination. There was only this: A man with whom Hal had spent some off-duty time informed Hal\xe2\x80\x99s commanding officer that Hal was gay. The commanding officer suspected that this was true and, on that basis, determined that Hal had to go. The discharge was classified as \xe2\x80\x9cother than honorable.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt wrecked me,\xe2\x80\x9d Hal told me when I visited him on Friday at his home here on the 16th floor of a high-rise with a panoramic view of the Atlantic. The morning was gloriously sunny, but tears streamed down his cheeks. Although more than half a century has passed since that harsh judgment \xe2\x80\x94 he\xe2\x80\x99s 79 now \xe2\x80\x94 it has always stayed with him, a tight, stubborn knot of sadness and anger.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey gave up on me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, referring to the Marines. \xe2\x80\x9cI never forget it.\xe2\x80\x9d He was haunted in particular by those three words \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cother than honorable\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and wanted more than anything to have them excised from his epitaph. That became his dying wish: that those words not outlive him.'b'Before federal law was changed in 2011, more than 110,000 gay, lesbian and bisexual people were discharged from the United States military over time because of their sexual orientation. And until the 1990s, when the policy tweak known as \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t Ask Don\xe2\x80\x99t Tell\xe2\x80\x9d vaguely softened the prohibition against gays in the armed services, it was common for such discharges to be dishonorable ones that barred gay veterans from receiving any benefits and sometimes disqualified them from civilian jobs they later sought.'b'But now that the military accepts gays, there is also a process that permits those who were dishonorably discharged to appeal for reclassifications of those dismissals as honorable. A military spokesman said last week that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how many veterans had sought to take advantage of it, or with what success. But Hal caught wind of it, and knew that he had to try.'b'He grew up on a cattle ranch in northern Florida, in a strict Southern Baptist family. He was one of eight children. His father died when he was 7, and his family struggled financially afterward. Although Hal (a nickname for Alfred) graduated from high school, college wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the cards.'b'He enlisted in 1953 and attended boot camp in South Carolina from June to August, \xe2\x80\x9cthe hottest months of the year,\xe2\x80\x9d as he said in an email in September to OutServe-SLDN, an advocacy group for gay service members. He was telling them his story in the hopes of rallying them to his cause.'b'He rose in the Marines from private first class to corporal and then to sergeant, and he landed a plum assignment in the Philippines. \xe2\x80\x9cI would have ascended to the top,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be what I wanted to be.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He prospered nonetheless. In a company that sold heavy construction and road-making equipment, he worked his way up to an executive sales position. \xe2\x80\x9cI helped build Walt Disney World,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'But he grew increasingly conflicted about his hand in paving so much of Florida and switched courses, joining a firm that made tools and technology for guarding against environmental degradation.'b'He lived well: expensive cars, world travel, a collection of Native American art.'b'But the bigotry that ended his military career followed him beyond that point, and so did the fear of it. He lost another treasured job, he said, because of his sexual orientation. And from the 1950s through at least the 1970s, he felt that financial security and success hinged on a certain degree of secrecy. Had he been more open about being gay, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here today. I\xe2\x80\x99d probably be on the street.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until 2005 that he finally brought Charles, his longtime partner and \xe2\x80\x9cthe love of my life,\xe2\x80\x9d to a big family gathering. A few years later, Charles died, and Hal now lives alone, with round-the-clock help from a home health care attendant.'b'When he received a diagnosis of cancer in his lungs, liver and adrenal glands a year ago, he was given about six months to live. He\xe2\x80\x99s at least 50 pounds thinner than he once was and moves through his apartment on a tiny scooter. He\xe2\x80\x99s almost deaf, his speech is labored and his thoughts are sometimes confused. To piece together his story, I relied heavily on two nieces who visit him regularly, Michelle and Deborah, and on Anne Brooksher-Yen, the New York lawyer who took on his discharge appeal.'b'The case came to her only two months ago, when doctors were saying that Hal might have only weeks left. She was racing the clock. She pressed the military for an expedited decision. It arrived in a letter in mid-December, and she traveled all the way to Fort Lauderdale for a gathering on Friday afternoon at which the letter was presented to Hal.'b'JOHN GILLESPIE, a member of OutServe-SLDN\xe2\x80\x99s board of directors, traveled here, too, from Mississippi, and he arranged for two local Marines, in uniform, to be on hand to congratulate Hal, who\xe2\x80\x99d been told what the letter said and would now get a special moment to savor it.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe lived his entire adult life with this shame and this stain on his honor,\xe2\x80\x9d John said to me, explaining why he insisted on creating that moment. \xe2\x80\x9cThe world has changed so much that with the stroke of a pen, that stain and that shame are gone.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At the gathering, in a penthouse apartment a few floors above Hal\xe2\x80\x99s, he was given a red Marine cap, but when he tried to put it on, he screamed. There are painful nodules on his scalp from the rapidly spreading cancer.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey hurt so bad,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to John, Anne, his two nieces and several friends from the building. But he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t complaining. He was making clear that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t being discourteous by not wearing the gift.'b'John read from the letter, including its assurance that Hal\xe2\x80\x99s military record would \xe2\x80\x9cbe corrected to show that he received an honorable discharge.\xe2\x80\x9d When Hal took the letter from him, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t hold it so much as knead it, pressing tighter and tighter, maybe because he was visibly fighting tears.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have much longer to live,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I shall always remember it.\xe2\x80\x9d He thanked Anne. He thanked his nieces. He thanked the Marines. He even thanked people in the room whom he had no reason to thank.'b'Someone went off to mix him a Scotch-and-soda, and he finally gave in. He sobbed.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s often said that a man doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a Marine and I am a man. So please forgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'His remarks hung there, because he\xe2\x80\x99d used the present tense. 'b'Am'b' a Marine. And because he was saying he was sorry, this veteran whose country owed him an apology for too long.'b'BILL BRATTON\xe2\x80\x99S biggest problem right now might not be stop-and-frisk.'b'It might be stop-and-sulk.'b'Given a new mayor who catapulted into office by castigating the police, given a City Council that passed two punitive bills related to the police and racial profiling, given the prospect of federal oversight on stop-and-frisk, given the overshadowing of the stunning drop in crime by the open sore of racial insensitivity, New York police may decide to engage in, as police call it, de-policing.'b'If morale sinks too low, one former New York City police official suggests, officers may not go after criminals \xe2\x80\x9cin the most aggressive fashion.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cRight now, police in New York are not happy,\xe2\x80\x9d the new commissioner conceded in his conference room at police headquarters\xc2\xa0Friday\xc2\xa0evening, surrounded by walls of video screens tracking crime around the city. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re frustrated because their good work really did get banged around in the campaign.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There was a record decline in crime and\xc2\xa0a record increase in tourism, Bratton said, and \xe2\x80\x9ccops aren\xe2\x80\x99t feeling the residual benefit of that.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He said \xe2\x80\x9cthe most angst\xe2\x80\x9d was being caused by a City Council bill expanding the ability to sue over racial profiling by officers, because police see it as a risk to themselves and their families.'b'He said New York has \xe2\x80\x9ca crisis of confidence on the part of the cops about what it is that we can do\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca crisis of confidence in the public about what the cops have been doing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Bratton, always very popular with the police who work for him, has been through it before. When he went to head the L.A. force in 2002, he said, police were so demoralized by cascading troubles and bad leadership that some sank into a \xe2\x80\x9cdrive by and wave\xe2\x80\x9d mode.'b'While diplomatically praising his old rival Ray Kelly, Bratton also noted that there were missed opportunities to curb stop-and-frisk.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe shame of it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis it probably could have been addressed a year or two years ago but for the intransigence of Mayor Bloomberg. I hesitate to describe it as intransigence because I really do believe that both Mayor Bloomberg and Commissioner Kelly, both good men, both committed to keeping this city safe, really deeply believed that the reason crime was going down, the reason there was less gun violence, the reason there were fewer guns being taken off the street, was because of the increasing numbers of stop-question-frisk.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd eventually because of that unwillingness to step back from that posture, it became a rallying cry for a number of the mayoral candidates, including Mayor de Blasio, who was able to most successfully use it as a platform.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Police, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cneed clear guidelines, clear guardrails, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t have that right now.\xe2\x80\x9d They are comfortable re-engaging, he said, when they have those guardrails.'b'In Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s final years as mayor, Bratton said, \xe2\x80\x9cCops themselves felt that they were in a\xc2\xa0no-win position.\xc2\xa0They had an administration, Mayor Bloomberg, Commissioner Kelly, who were demanding more and more and more.\xc2\xa0And the cops themselves felt, you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s too much. And the community was saying it\xe2\x80\x99s too much. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a doctor giving too much chemotherapy: \xe2\x80\x98Doctor I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling better but you\xe2\x80\x99re giving me all this chemo and I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling worse again.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'b'In L.A. in 2002, Bratton faced a crisis where morale was low after a corruption scandal and after the city was crowned the murder capital of America, and an inspector general was on hand for oversight. \xe2\x80\x9cWe got the cops out of their cars,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey got back to making arrests. They got back to doing stop-question-frisk. But they were also doing it in a way that was focused.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'His initiatives focusing on gangs and crime data, he asserted, allowed the police an appropriate structure \xe2\x80\x9cso that every black kid that was wearing a long white T-shirt with shorts wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thought of as a potential suspect.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The last time Bill Bratton became police commissioner of New York, in 1994, his mission was to take back the city. Now his mission is to back off \xe2\x80\x94 to rein in the force enough so that minorities do not feel hounded. The last time he was Top Cop, his boss was Mr. Law and Order, and Bratton was the tip of Rudy Giuliani\xe2\x80\x99s spear. This time, he\xe2\x80\x99s working for a liberal populist mayor who got elected thrashing the excesses of stop-and-frisk, and he\xe2\x80\x99s supervising police officers who are trepidatious about working for a man who won office by stoking the fires of public opinion against them. (Dante de Blasio did a potent ad for his father noting that he might be a likely candidate for stop-and-frisk.)'b'Trying to help Christine Quinn (tepidly) and stop de Blasio during the mayoral primary, Michael Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s aides fed the paranoia that under de Blasio, New York would flame into \xe2\x80\x9cBonfire of the Vanities.\xe2\x80\x9d Bratton must be the affirmative answer to all the jittery New Yorkers asking \xe2\x80\x9cIs it safe?,\xe2\x80\x9d fearing that fiends are going to start climbing out of manholes if the new mayor goes all flower power on crime. And he must be the affirmative answer to the minority community\xe2\x80\x99s demand for more sensitivity.'b'After 20 years of news conferences touting crime declines and a safer city, if crime stops going down \xe2\x80\x94 let alone if it goes up \xe2\x80\x94 it will be a political catastrophe for City Hall.'b'Even for a master at shaping perception like Bratton, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to require exquisite balance. Skeptics on both sides of the spectrum, from Al Sharpton to former Mayor Bloomberg, suggest the changes on stop-and-frisk may be cosmetic.'b'On the eve of leaving office, Bloomberg, defensive about the scar on his legacy, noted to Capital New York that in L.A. Bratton \xe2\x80\x94 considered the godfather of the sort of aggressive policing tools that have come under fire \xe2\x80\x94 was just as much a proponent of stop-and-frisk as Kelly was. \xe2\x80\x9cBratton did more stop and frisks per capita than Kelly did,\xe2\x80\x9d Bloomberg said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll call it \xe2\x80\x98frisk and stop\xe2\x80\x99 instead of stop-and-frisk.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Bratton mulled that his specialty had been coming in to lead police departments \xe2\x80\x9cin total crisis\xe2\x80\x9d and, in a way, he violated his own philosophy by following someone so successful.'b'But he believes he can resolve the problems with stop-and-frisk and shaky morale. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t come back to New York to fail,\xe2\x80\x9d he said flatly, dapper as ever in a Herm\xc3\xa8s tie with elephants and a blue Rolex watch his wife gave him.'b'Bratton said he wants to bring in a language expert, as he did back in 1994, to train police on the best ways to use language to \xe2\x80\x9ccalm down incidents\xe2\x80\x9d by being respectful rather than ratchet them up by being confrontational.'b'Noting that you have to use stop-and-frisk \xe2\x80\x9cwith skill,\xe2\x80\x9d he said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have an expression in policing that it\xe2\x80\x99s not the use of force that gets cops in trouble, it\xe2\x80\x99s the use of language.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He said an officer who says, \xe2\x80\x9cSir, can I speak to you?,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cHey, you, get over here,\xe2\x80\x9d will be more productive. They also need exit strategies, he said, to depart from encounters without \xe2\x80\x9cdemeaning\xe2\x80\x9d people.'b'He knows he has a super-healthy ego but says it just reflects confidence. He notes that his famously fractious relationship with Giuliani \xe2\x80\x94 Rudy grew envious of Bratton\xe2\x80\x99s glowing press as \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s Top Cop\xe2\x80\x9d and forced him out \xe2\x80\x94 taught him a good lesson. He plans to meet with Mayor de Blasio once a week \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cno matter what\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 to encourage transparency, so that gossip doesn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cfester.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He said everything was going well so far, even though they are only on the third day of their relationship.'b'His experience with Rudy and two mayors in L.A. has taught him this: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to keep them informed. Try to have no surprises, if you will.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'With that, he headed off through the snowy streets for a meeting with the mayor.'b'BRISTOL, R.I. \xe2\x80\x94 A FEW years ago, when I mentioned to a woman I met at a party that I was teaching in a school for the blind, she seemed confused. \xe2\x80\x9cCan I just ask you one question?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you 'b'talk'b' to your students?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I explained that the students were blind, not deaf. Raising the palms of her hands at me, as if to stem further misunderstanding, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know they\xe2\x80\x99re not deaf. But what I really mean is, how do you actually 'b'talk'b' to them?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I knew, because I had been asked this question before by reasonably intelligent people, that the woman didn\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly what she meant. All she knew was that in her mind there existed a substantial intellectual barrier between the blind and the sighted. The blind could hear, yes. But could they properly understand?'b'Throughout history and across cultures the blind have been traduced by a host of mythologies such as this. They have variously been perceived as pitiable idiots incapable of learning, as artful masters of deception or as mystics possessed of supernatural powers. One of the most persistent misconceptions about blindness is that it is a curse from God for misdeeds perpetrated in a past life, which cloaks the blind person in spiritual darkness and makes him not just dangerous but evil.'b'A majority of my blind students 'b' 'b'at the International Institute for Social Entrepreneurs in Trivandrum, India, a branch of Braille Without Borders, came from the developing world: Madagascar, Colombia, Tibet, Liberia, Ghana, Kenya, Nepal and India. One of my students, the 27-year-old Sahr, lost most of his eyesight to measles when he was a child. (Like many children in rural West Africa, Sahr had not been vaccinated.) The residents of Sahr\xe2\x80\x99s village were certain that his blindness \xe2\x80\x94 surely the result of witchcraft or immoral actions on his family\xe2\x80\x99s part \xe2\x80\x94 would adversely affect the entire village. They surrounded his house and shouted threats and abuse. They confiscated a considerable portion of his parents\xe2\x80\x99 land. Eventually, the elders decreed that Sahr\xe2\x80\x99s father must take the child out to the bush, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the demons live,\xe2\x80\x9d and abandon him there. The parents refused and fled the village with their son.'b'Many of my students had similar experiences. Marco\xe2\x80\x99s parents, devout Colombian Catholics, begged a priest to say a Mass so that their blind infant son would die before his existence brought shame and hardship on their household. The villagers in Kyile\xe2\x80\x99s remote Tibetan village insisted that she, her two blind brothers and their blind father should all just commit suicide because they were nothing but a burden to the sighted members of the family. When, as a child in Sierra Leone, James began to see objects upside down because of an ocular disease, the villagers were certain that he was possessed by demons.'b'In these places, schools for blind children were deemed a preposterous waste of resources and effort. Teachers in regular schools refused to educate them. Sighted children ridiculed them, tricked them, spat at them and threw stones at them. And when they reached working age, no one would hire them. During a visit to the Braille Without Borders training center in Tibet, I met blind children who had been beaten, told they were idiots, locked in rooms for years on end and abandoned by their parents. These stories, which would have been commonplace in the Dark Ages, took place in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. They are taking place now. Nine out of 10 blind children in the developing world still have no access to education, many for no other reason than that they are blind.'b'The United States has one of the lowest rates of visual impairment in the world, and yet blindness is still among the most feared physical afflictions. Even in this country, the blind are perceived as a people apart.'b'Aversion toward the blind exists for the same reason that most prejudices exist: lack of knowledge. Ignorance is a powerful generator of fear. And fear slides easily into aggression and contempt. Anyone who has not spent more than five minutes with a blind person might be forgiven for believing \xe2\x80\x94 like the woman I met at the party \xe2\x80\x94 that there is an unbridgeable gap between us and them.'b'For most of us, sight is the primary way we interpret the world. How can we even begin to conceive of a meaningful connection with a person who cannot see? Before I began living and working among blind people, I, too, wondered this. Whenever I saw a blind person on the street I would stare, transfixed, hoping, out of a vague and visceral discomfort, that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to engage with him. In his 1930 book \xe2\x80\x9cThe World of the Blind,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre Villey, a blind French professor of literature, summarized the lurid carnival of prejudices and superstitions about the blind that were passed down the centuries. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sighted person judges the blind not for what they are but by the fear blindness inspires. ... The revolt of his sensibility in the face of \xe2\x80\x98the most atrocious of maladies\xe2\x80\x99 fills a sighted person with prejudice and gives rise to a thousand legends.\xe2\x80\x9d The blind author Georgina Kleege, a lecturer at the University of California at Berkeley, more tersely wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cThe blind are either supernatural or subhuman, alien or animal.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'WE take our eyesight so much for granted, cling to it so slavishly and are so overwhelmed by its superficial data, that even the most brilliant sighted person can take a stupidly long time to recognize the obvious: There is usually a perfectly healthy, active and normal human mind behind that pair of unseeing eyes.'b'Christopher Hitchens called blindness \xe2\x80\x9cone of the oldest and most tragic disorders known to man.\xe2\x80\x9d How horribly excluded and bereft we would feel to lose the world and the way of life that sight brings us. Blindness can happen to any one of us. Myself, I used to be certain I\xe2\x80\x99d rather die than be blind; I could not imagine how I would have the strength to go on in the face of such a loss.'b'And yet people do. In 1749, the French philosopher Denis Diderot published an essay, \xe2\x80\x9cLetter on the Blind for the Benefit of Those Who See,\xe2\x80\x9d in which he described a visit he and a friend made to the house of a blind man, the son of a professor of philosophy at the University of Paris. The blind man was married, had a son, had many acquaintances, was versed in chemistry and botany, could read and write with an alphabet of raised type and made his living distilling liqueurs. Diderot wrote with wonder of the man\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgood solid sense,\xe2\x80\x9d of his tidiness, of his \xe2\x80\x9csurprising memory for sounds\xe2\x80\x9d and voices, of his ability to tell the weight of any object and the capacity of any vessel just by holding them in his hands, of his ability to dismantle and reassemble small machines, of his musical acuity and of his extreme sensitivity to atmospheric change.'b'The blind man, perhaps weary of being interrogated by Diderot and his friend as if he were a circus animal, eventually asked them a question of his own. \xe2\x80\x9cI perceive, gentlemen, that you are not blind. You are astonished at what I do, and why not as much at my speaking?\xe2\x80\x9d More than any of his sensory skills, it was the blind man\xe2\x80\x99s self-esteem that surprised Diderot most. \xe2\x80\x9cThis blind man,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cvalues himself as much as, and perhaps more than, we who see.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned from my blind friends and colleagues that blindness doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to remain tragic. For those who can adapt to it, blindness becomes a path to an alternative and equally rich way of living.'b'One of the many misconceptions about the blind is that they have greater hearing, sense of smell and sense of touch than sighted people. This is not strictly true. Their blindness simply forces them to recognize gifts they always had but had heretofore largely ignored.'b'A few years ago, I allowed myself to be blindfolded and led through the streets of Lhasa by two blind Tibetan teenage girls, students at Braille Without Borders. The girls had not grown up in the city, and yet they traversed it with ease, without stumbling or getting lost. They had a specific destination in mind, and each time they announced, \xe2\x80\x9cNow we turn left\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cNow we turn right,\xe2\x80\x9d I was compelled to ask them how they knew this. Their answers startled me, chiefly because the clues they were following \xe2\x80\x94 the sound of many televisions in an electronics shop, the smell of leather in a shoe shop, the feel of cobblestones suddenly underfoot \xe2\x80\x94 though out in the open for anyone to perceive, were virtually hidden from me.'b'For the first time in my life, I realized how little notice I paid to sounds, to smells, indeed to the entire world that lay beyond my ability to see.'b'The French writer Jacques Lusseyran, who lost his sight at the age of 8, understood that those of us who have sight are, in some ways, deprived by it. \xe2\x80\x9cIn return for all the benefits that sight brings we are forced to give up others whose existence we don\xe2\x80\x99t even suspect.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I do not intend to suggest there is something wonderful about blindness. There is only something wonderful about human resilience, adaptability and daring. The blind are no more or less otherworldly, stupid, evil, gloomy, pitiable or deceitful than the rest of us. It is only our ignorance that has cloaked them in these ridiculous garments. When Helen Keller wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is more difficult to teach ignorance to think than to teach an intelligent blind man to see the grandeur of Niagara,\xe2\x80\x9d she was speaking, obviously, of the uplifting and equalizing value of knowledge.'b'Drones will soon take to the skies across the United States in 'b'federally approved tests'b' that are meant to clear the way for the commercial use of unmanned aircraft. But before that happens, lawmakers and regulators need to deal with a host of unresolved privacy and safety concerns.'b'The Federal Aviation Administration last week 'b'selected'b' six universities and government agencies to test civilian versions of drone aircraft, which are best known for their use by the military and the Central Intelligence Agency to kill suspected terrorists in places like Pakistan and Yemen.'b'The tests are meant to help the F.A.A. integrate unmanned aerial vehicles, as drones are formally known, into the national airspace by 2015 under a law passed by Congress in 2012.'b'Like many new technologies, drones pose both opportunities and challenges. The aircraft, which can'b' range widely 'b'in size from less than a pound to 'b'more than 30,000 pounds'b', can be incredibly useful but also very dangerous.'b'For example, when outfitted with high-resolution cameras they can help businesses monitor remote infrastructure like pipelines and power lines more cheaply and easily than when conventional means like helicopters are used. But drones can just as easily be used by law-enforcement agencies and big corporations to conduct unconstitutional monitoring of individuals or groups of people.'b'Given the National Security Agency\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'widespread spying 'b' and efforts by advertisers and Internet companies to 'b'track consumers'b' online, another technology capable of conducting mass surveillance could become a serious threat to privacy. There are also safety issues. Drones operated by inexperienced or unlicensed pilots pose a hazard to people and property in populated areas.'b'While the F.A.A. has wisely added privacy requirements to its test program, the agency is primarily a safety regulator. It is best suited for developing the kinds of regulations that require the makers of drones to endow their machines with the ability to sense potential collisions and to avoid them.'b'The F.A.A. is also well placed to determine which kinds of drones are best for specific locations. For example, the agency should make clear that most drones will not be allowed to fly at low altitudes through residential neighborhoods, where they would pose a much greater danger than they would in rural areas. (Current'b' F.A.A. regulations 'b'require police departments and other domestic agencies to fly drones at altitudes below 400 feet to keep them away from commercial planes, and only during daylight hours.)'b'As drone technology improves and becomes more affordable \xe2\x80\x94 some drones outfitted with cameras for shooting high-definition video and still photographs are already selling for'b' as little as $300 'b' \xe2\x80\x94 unmanned aircraft will undoubtedly become more common.'b'Some 'b'state legislatures'b' have passed laws restricting drone surveillance, including requiring a probable cause warrant for law enforcement to use drones to gather evidence. Congress should enact similar safeguards. Lawmakers should also outline how long data collected by drones operated by law enforcement and private businesses can be stored and what it can be used for.'b'In the justice system, prosecutors have the power to decide what criminal charges to bring, and since 97 percent of cases are resolved without a trial, those decisions are almost always the most important factor in the outcome. That is why it is so important for prosecutors to play fair, not just to win. This obligation is embodied in the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s 1963 holding in 'b'Brady v. Maryland'b', which required prosecutors to provide the defense with any exculpatory evidence that could materially affect a verdict or sentence.'b'Yet far too often, state and federal prosecutors fail to fulfill that constitutional duty, and far too rarely do courts hold them accountable. Last month, Alex Kozinski, the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, issued the most stinging indictment of this systemic failure in recent memory. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is an epidemic of Brady violations abroad in the land,\xe2\x80\x9d Judge Kozinski wrote in 'b'dissent'b' from a ruling against a man who argued that prosecutors had withheld crucial evidence in his case. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly judges can put a stop to it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The defendant, Kenneth Olsen, was convicted of producing ricin, a toxic poison, for use as a weapon. Federal prosecutors knew \xe2\x80\x94 but did not tell his lawyers or the court \xe2\x80\x94 that an investigation of the government\xe2\x80\x99s forensic scientist, whose lab tests were critical to the case, had revealed multiple instances of sloppy work that had led to wrongful convictions in earlier cases. A state court found the scientist was \xe2\x80\x9cincompetent and committed gross misconduct.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yet the majority of the federal appeals court panel ruled that the overall evidence of Mr. Olsen\xe2\x80\x99s guilt \xe2\x80\x94 including websites he visited and books he bought \xe2\x80\x94 was so overwhelming that the failure to disclose the scientist\xe2\x80\x99s firing would not have changed the outcome.'b'This is the all-too-common response by courts confronted with Brady violations. Judge Kozinski was right to castigate the majority for letting the prosecution refuse to turn over evidence \xe2\x80\x9cso long as it\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'possible 'b'the defendant would\xe2\x80\x99ve been convicted anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d as the judge wrote. This creates a \xe2\x80\x9cserious moral hazard,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, particularly since prosecutors are virtually never punished for misconduct. According to the Center for Prosecutor Integrity, multiple studies over the past 50 years show that courts punished prosecutorial misconduct in 'b'less than 2 percent'b' of cases where it occurred. And that rarely amounted to more than a slap on the wrist, such as making the prosecutor pay for the cost of the disciplinary hearing.'b'Brady violations are, by their nature, hard to detect, but Judge Kozinski had no trouble coming up with more than two dozen examples from federal and state courts just in the last few years, and those are surely the tip of the iceberg. According to the National Registry of Exonerations, 43 percent of wrongful convictions are the result of official misconduct.'b'The Brady problem is in many ways structural. Prosecutors have the task of deciding when a piece of evidence would be helpful to the defense. But since it is their job to believe in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt, they have little incentive to turn over, say, a single piece of exculpatory evidence when they are sitting on what they see as a mountain of evidence proving guilt. The lack of professional consequences for failing to disclose exculpatory evidence only makes the breach of duty more likely. As Judge Kozinski wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cSome prosecutors don\xe2\x80\x99t care about Brady because courts don\xe2\x80\x99t 'b'make 'b'them care.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Courts should heed Judge Kozinski\xe2\x80\x99s call, but it will take more than judges to fix the problem. Prosecutors\xe2\x80\x99 offices should adopt a standard 'b'\xe2\x80\x9copen file\xe2\x80\x9d policy'b', which would involve turning over all exculpatory evidence as a rule, thus reducing the potential for error.'b'Fighting prosecutorial misconduct is not only about protecting the innocent. It is, as Judge Kozinski wrote, about preserving \xe2\x80\x9cthe public\xe2\x80\x99s trust in our justice system,\xe2\x80\x9d and the foundation of the rule of law.'b'On New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, government-licensed recreational marijuana shops 'b'opened in Colorado'b', the first place in the world to regulate the drug \xe2\x80\x9cfrom seed to sale.\xe2\x80\x9d Later in 2014, marijuana retailers will open in Washington State. As public opinion shifts 'b'away from prohibition'b', these two states will serve as test cases for full-on legalization. Here\xe2\x80\x99s what to watch for in the early stages of this experiment:'b''b'THE FATE OF THE BLACK MARKET'b' One of the basic arguments in favor of legalization is that it could eliminate the black market and create new tax revenue. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear how quickly and to what extent this will actually happen. Marijuana sold at retail shops that pay taxes may well 'b'cost more'b' than illegal marijuana, potentially keeping off-the-books dealers in business.'b''b'UNDER-AGE SMOKING'b' When the Justice Department announced in August that it 'b'would not sue to block'b' state laws legalizing marijuana, James Cole, the deputy attorney general, emphasized that local governments must employ \xe2\x80\x9cstrong and effective regulatory\xe2\x80\x9d systems. To avoid federal intervention, states will have to prove that they\xe2\x80\x99re capable of enforcing bans on selling the drug to anyone under 21. 'b'Roughly 36 percent'b' of 12th graders reported having used marijuana in 2013. From a public-health standpoint, it will be important to monitor whether youth usage rates in Colorado and Washington diverge from those in other states.'b''b'MARKETING'b' Washington banned marijuana ads near schools, libraries and playgrounds. In Colorado, marijuana vendors may run ads in print media only if there is \xe2\x80\x9creliable evidence\xe2\x80\x9d that no more than 30 percent of the readership is under 21. But these policies may not be sufficient to satisfy the Justice Department, which said that it might step in if it saw marijuana \xe2\x80\x9cmarketed in a manner to appeal to minors.\xe2\x80\x9d The Justice Department may not look kindly on THC-infused sweets, like cannabis gummy bears and brownies.'b''b'INTERSTATE TRAFFICKING'b' To stem the flow of marijuana across state lines, Colorado has imposed different rules on residents and visitors. Residents may buy up to an ounce per transaction but visitors only a quarter-ounce. Visitors are supposed to consume their purchases before returning home. Despite these precautions, cross-border trafficking may increase, especially if the price of marijuana in Colorado drops below the price in, say, neighboring Wyoming.'b''b'ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION'b' A big question is whether the widespread availability of marijuana will lead to decreased alcohol consumption, which 'b'recent research'b' suggests might happen. That would be a boon for public health. (Heavy drinking is 'b'more harmful'b' than heavy pot smoking, and costlier to society.) But if the use of one substance encourages use of the other, the consequences might be dire, particularly for road safety. It is more dangerous to drive after combining marijuana and alcohol than after using either alone.'b'Michael Moore called Obamacare both \xe2\x80\x98awful\xe2\x80\x99 and a \xe2\x80\x98godsend.\xe2\x80\x99 Readers offer their opinions.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Obamacare We Deserve'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Jan. 1):'b'Michael Moore is correct \xe2\x80\x94 Americans deserve a single-payer system, and the Affordable Care Act is a poor substitute. But Mr. Moore does not mention that, for all its faults, the law would be working much better but for the unrelenting effort by Republicans to sabotage it by various means, such as propagating outright lies intended to confuse the public (\xe2\x80\x9cdeath panels\xe2\x80\x9d), refusing in numerous states either to extend Medicaid benefits or to establish state insurance exchanges, and proactively urging people not to obtain insurance under the law.'b'Contrast the reaction of Republicans to the health care law with that of Democrats to Medicare, Part D. That prescription drug benefit, enacted by a Republican Congress with the help of parliamentary legerdemain, had terrible flaws, most notably the so-called doughnut hole (partly alleviated by the new health care law) and the provision prohibiting Medicare from negotiating prices with the pharmaceutical industry. Nevertheless, once Part D became law, Democrats never tried to defund or undermine it; to the contrary, they tried to make it work.'b'I doubt that there has ever been a more cynical political action than the effort by Republicans to destroy a law based on ideas that they themselves conceived and first put into practice, thus depriving millions of Americans of the opportunity to receive quality health care. If they succeed, we will continue to have one of the most expensive and least effective health care systems in the developed world.'b'PETER HANAUER'b' Berkeley, Calif., Jan. 2, 2014'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'I read Michael Moore\xe2\x80\x99s Op-Ed essay as I heard news of the death from cancer of Benjamin Curtis, the young guitarist with School of Seven Bells.

Although he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mention them, the law also has provisions to improve quality and contain costs.'b'Nonetheless, the Affordable Care Act could certainly be better. As it is carried out and people begin to experience both its benefits and its imperfections, citizens can take action to make it better. Mr. Moore mentions two ideas already being promoted: a plan in Massachusetts to allow the state to operate a public option in competition with the private plans offered through its exchange, and Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s bold single-payer plan.

Beyond the grand ambitions, though, lies a darker side to Qatar\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup bid: the institutionalized exploitation of workers from South Asia. The facilities under construction are, in many cases, being built by workers who are virtual slaves. Of Qatar\xe2\x80\x99s two million inhabitants, only 225,000 are nationals; the rest are migrant workers, mostly from Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan, brought in to do manual labor.'b'There have been widespread reports that thousands of workers are being abused and hundreds have quietly perished. The International Trade Union Confederation has estimated that, without urgent action to remedy conditions, 4,000 migrant workers will have died before a single ball is kicked in Doha.'b'An investigation by The Guardian recently revealed shocking levels of mistreatment of Nepalese construction workers by their Qatari employers. In addition to denying workers water and wages, some companies have taken their ID cards and prevented them from fleeing. Forty-four Nepalese workers died this summer, their deaths suspiciously attributed to \xe2\x80\x9cheart failure.\xe2\x80\x9d About 80 workers at one of Qatar\xe2\x80\x99s most prestigious development projects have not been paid in 18 months, and they are starving. The dormitories in which South Asian laborers are housed are squalid and unhygienic, often packed with a dozen workers per room.'b'The abuse is not limited to Qatar; migrant workers face similarly horrid conditions in Saudi Arabia. Last month, a video surfaced that appeared to show a worker being violently mistreated by a Saudi man. Saudi human rights groups decried the brutish behavior, and the authorities promised to investigate, but nothing has happened. Unfortunately, none of this is an aberration for the gulf region, where attitudes toward brown-skinned laborers are overwhelmingly discriminatory, and workers have no legal protection.'b'Qatar\xe2\x80\x99s enslavement of migrant workers is deeply embedded. Under the kafala system of company-sponsored labor, employers have legal responsibility for their workers. In theory, this should ensure protection from unfair treatment: Laborers cannot legally work more than eight hours a day (and five consecutive hours without a break). In reality, however, companies routinely ignore the law, confiscate passports and withhold wages.'b'Workers often sign one contract before boarding a plane to Doha, only to have it ripped up before their eyes as they are handed a second contract with big reductions in wages. Sponsoring companies must give their employees permission to move or leave the country.

A logical place to start would be to abolish the kafala system and to allow the free movement of labor within the country.

In July 2011, its secession from Sudan after decades of civil war was feted as a triumph of international advocacy. It seemed a long overdue deliverance for the people of the South, who had borne the brunt of successive Sudanese military assaults. South Sudan has always been viewed through the prism of its victimhood at the hands of its former northern neighbor.'b'Now, two and a half years later, South Sudan is in the news again. It has become clear that the country is not a bucolic land ruled by the freedom fighters. It has its own internal fissures, ethnic tensions and residual wounds of war. But the outside world must not misunderstand the roots of the current outbreak of violence in a rush to come to grips with this new internal conflict.'b'Although there are plenty of reports indicating that the current crisis has unfolded along tribal lines, this is an extremely simplistic and dangerous way to frame events. The real source of South Sudan\xe2\x80\x99s violence is political, not ethnic \xe2\x80\x94 and Western policy makers must grasp this reality before it\xe2\x80\x99s too late. The international media has been all too ready to frame the violence that erupted after Dec. 15 entirely in terms of ethnic violence and state collapse \xe2\x80\x94 a familiar narrative for conflicts in African countries that glosses over the political roots of the conflict.'b'The Guardian splashed its front page with \xe2\x80\x9c'b'South Sudan: The State That Fell Apart in a Week'b',\xe2\x80\x9d and the paper\xe2\x80\x99s reporting reflected a media narrative that has shifted from the South\xe2\x80\x99s victimhood at the hands of the North to one of bipolar tribal conflict between the two dominant tribes in the country, the Dinka, the president\xe2\x80\x99s tribe, and the Nuer, his challenger\xe2\x80\x99s. On Christmas Eve, London\xe2\x80\x99s Sunday Times focused on \xe2\x80\x9cGangs Deal Out Death by Language Test,\xe2\x80\x9d detailing how gangs chose who to kill based on what language they spoke, and therefore what tribe they were from.'b'It is \xe2\x80\x9ca narrative that confirms all that people thought they knew about Africa \xe2\x80\x94 that ancient, intractable tribalism once again brings a country to its knees,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Peter Greste, Al Jazeera\xe2\x80\x99s East Africa correspondent. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an analysis that seems to explain everything without actually telling us anything.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Reducing conflict to tribalism is particularly hazardous when applied to South Sudan. It is a country where foreign stakeholders have significant influence, and any push toward a tribally defined solution to the conflict \xe2\x80\x94 like a Bosnia-style ethnic power sharing deal \xe2\x80\x94 would be disastrous, for it would entrench and validate ethnic fissures, rather than give political power sharing a chance to smooth them over.'b'This is not the first time that simplistic Western narratives about war in Sudan have prevented viable political solutions. The Darfur conflict was sold by activists and the media as genocide perpetrated by an ethnically domineering Arab majority \xe2\x80\x94 a crude and ultimately harmful view that isolated and entrenched the government in the North while eliminating the possibility of international mediation.'b'Advocacy by celebrities like Mia Farrow, George Clooney and Don Cheadle aided the secession cause in South Sudan. Only one possible scenario was ever presented: South Sudan would vote in a referendum and secede immediately after a yes vote. There was no grace period, no foster parenting by the United Nations and no time for political parties and infrastructure to mature.'b'Over the past two weeks there have been eyewitness reports of horrific murders based on racial profiling in several towns, including Juba and Bor. But this alarming ethnic violence is just one strand of a bundle of grievances, and it is by no means without precedent. In countries where nation building remains embryonic and a national identity still fragile, tribe and ethnicity gain more importance. When the chips are down, one\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty tends to default to one\xe2\x80\x99s group. A genocidal meltdown could occur in South Sudan, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t inevitable.'b'After all, the conflict was not precipitated by ethnic grievances, nor is it being fanned by explicit tribal rhetoric on behalf of political leaders. The ethnic element is a symptom, rather than a source, of the problem. As Andreas Hirblinger and Sara de Simone explained in a recent article, no protagonist has \xe2\x80\x9copenly played the \xe2\x80\x98ethnic card.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 Indeed, the outbreak of violence is closely linked to the political standoff between President Salva Kiir and other leading members of the Sudan People\xe2\x80\x99s Liberation Movement, including former members of the government, who accused Mr. Kiir of \xe2\x80\x9cdictatorial tendencies.\xe2\x80\x9d It is essentially a rebellion against the concentration of power.'b'This matters because South Sudan is a country that was midwifed by powerful and committed lobbies in the United States and Europe; its birth was not only a triumph for the South Sudanese, but of Western advocacy. A mere nine days after the first hostilities started, the United Nations Security Council voted on a resolution to send 5,500 additional peacekeepers to South Sudan, boosting its force to 12,500. On Saturday, international and regional pressure also brought Mr. Kiir and his main rival, former Vice President Riek Machar, to the negotiating table in Addis Ababa.'b'South Sudan is a country where Western perceptions hold sway, and Western aid and power can engineer political deals. A misreading of the crisis could result in resolutions that effectively hand out pieces of the cake tribe by tribe, aggravating and endorsing ethnic fissures, rather than helping to eradicate them.'b''b' 'b'Nesrine Malik 'b' is a Sudanese journalist.'b''b''b'North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s harder line'b''b'Regarding the execution last month of Kim Jong-un\xe2\x80\x99s uncle, Jang Song-thaek: It is now clear that the young North Korean leader is still a long way from implementing political or economic reform.

They require, among other things, companies that are willing to operate where you live. Just ask the Seattle-based District 751 of the machinists\xe2\x80\x99 union, which was worried that Boeing will build its new 777X airliner someplace far away where it is cheaper to produce. Last month the union offered contract concessions, as its president explained, to ensure \xe2\x80\x9cthe long-term success\xe2\x80\x9d of Boeing in Washington State. And on Friday, Boeing machinists approved a contract with concessions to keep assembly of the plane in the area.'b'In recent decades, American workers have suffered one body blow after another: the decline in manufacturing, foreign competition, outsourcing, the Great Recession and smart machines that replace people everywhere you look. Amazon and Google are in a horse race to see how many humans they can put out of work with self-guided delivery drones and driverless cars. You wonder who will be left with incomes to buy what these robots deliver.'b'What can workers do to mitigate their plight? One useful step would be to lobby to eliminate the corporate income tax.'b'That might sound like a giveaway to the rich. It\xe2\x80\x99s not. The rich, including Boeing\xe2\x80\x99s stockholders, can take their companies and run \xe2\x80\x94 and not just from Washington State to, say, North Carolina. To avoid our federal corporate tax, they can, and often do, move their operations and jobs abroad. Apple\xe2\x80\x99s tax return says it all: The company, 'b'according to one calculation'b', paid only 8.2 percent of its worldwide profits in United States corporate income taxes, thanks to piling up most of its profits and locating far too many of its operations overseas.'b'I, like many economists, suspect that our corporate income tax is economically self-defeating \xe2\x80\x94 hurting workers, not capitalists, and collecting precious little revenue to boot.'b'The United States may well have the highest effective marginal corporate income tax rate of any developed country. Jack Mintz, a public finance economist and director of the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary, puts the rate close to 35 percent, which is also the statutory rate. Other economists, using different techniques, calculate the marginal rate to be as low as 23 percent. But both figures are miles above zero.'b'They are also miles above our 13 percent average corporate income tax rate \xe2\x80\x94 the ratio of corporate taxes to total corporate profits. The fact that the marginal tax rate, whether 23 percent, 35 percent or somewhere in between, is so much larger than the average rate suggests that a sizable share of corporate profits and production is ending up overseas and untaxed.'b'Making, rather than just stating, this case requires constructing a large-scale computer simulation model of the United States economy as it interacts over time with other nations\xe2\x80\x99 economies, and then seeing how the model reacts when you change the American corporate income tax. I\xe2\x80\x99ve developed such a model with three colleagues through the 'b'Tax Analysis Center'b', a nonpartisan research group. 'b'Our findings'b' make a very strong, worker-based case for corporate tax reform.'b'In the model, eliminating the United States\xe2\x80\x99 corporate income tax produces rapid and dramatic increases in American investment, output and real wages, making the tax cut self-financing to a significant extent. Somewhat smaller gains arise from revenue-neutral corporate tax base broadening, specifically cutting the corporate tax rate to 9 percent and eliminating all corporate tax loopholes. Both policies generate welfare gains for all generations in the United States, but particularly for young and future workers. Moreover, all Americans can benefit, though by less, if foreign countries also cut their corporate tax rates.'b'The size of the potential economic and welfare gains are stunningly large and don\xe2\x80\x99t reflect any extreme supply-side (a k a, voodoo economics) assumptions. Fully eliminating the corporate income tax and replacing any loss in revenues with somewhat higher personal income tax rates leads to a huge short-run inflow of capital, raising the United States\xe2\x80\x99 capital stock (machines and buildings) by 23 percent, output by 8 percent and the real wages of unskilled and skilled workers by 12 percent. Lowering the corporate rate tax to 9 percent while also closing loopholes is roughly revenue neutral and also produces very rapid increases in capital (by 17 percent), output (by 6 percent) and real wages (by 8 percent).'b'Eliminating the corporate tax and raising income tax rates or lowering the corporate tax rate and eliminating its loopholes are not the only options. Elsewhere, 'b'I have proposed eliminating the corporate income tax'b', but making shareholders pay income taxes on their companies\xe2\x80\x99 profits as they accrue. This leaves companies with no tax reason to avoid operating in the United States but ensures that shareholders, not wage earners, make up for any revenue losses through higher personal tax payments.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s been a long time since the typical American worker received a raise in her real pay. In fact, average weekly earnings, exclusive of fringe benefits but adjusted for inflation, are 10 percent lower today than they were in 1966. This is America\xe2\x80\x99s nightmare, not its dream. Turning things around requires getting a lot of things right, starting, I\xe2\x80\x99d argue, with corporate tax reform.'b'THE 'b'Baseball Hall of Fame'b' will announce its new inductees on Wednesday \xe2\x80\x94 a burst of warmth in the cold, diamond-less winter \xe2\x80\x94 and the crop of potential inductees includes, for the second straight year, Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens.'b'Mr. Bonds, baseball\xe2\x80\x99s career home run leader, is arguably the game\xe2\x80\x99s most dominant hitter since Babe Ruth. Mr. Clemens won 354 games and received the Cy Young Award a record seven times. By those measures they are as clear-cut Hall of Famers as ever lived.'b'That neither came close to being chosen for induction by the requisite 75 percent of voters last year (Mr. Clemens was named on 37.6 percent of the 569 ballots, Mr. Bonds on 36.2 percent) is tied to the fact that they, along with other superstars of their era, have been directly linked to using performance-enhancing drugs. While that may cost them a place in the Hall of Fame, at least they are getting the chance to be considered. Assuming they receive at least 5 percent of the vote each year, they\xe2\x80\x99ll remain on the ballot until their eligibility expires in 2027.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity never afforded another tainted player in the Bonds-Clemens stratosphere of accomplishment: 'b'Pete Rose'b', baseball\xe2\x80\x99s career hits leader, who is entering the 25th year of his gambling-related banishment from the game. Still a figure of great interest, who causes a stir each summer by signing autographs near the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., Mr. Rose remains the only player in the Hall\xe2\x80\x99s 78-year history to be explicitly denied a chance to appear on the ballot.'b'In January 1991, less than a year before he was to be eligible for induction for the first time, the Hall of Fame\xe2\x80\x99s board of directors convened a special 10-member committee. Mr. Rose was already on Major League Baseball\xe2\x80\x99s permanently ineligible list, a fate he accepted in 1989 after an investigation revealed that while managing the Cincinnati Reds he had bet frequently on baseball, and on his own team. He was also fresh off serving five months at a federal prison for tax fraud. The possibility that he might be elected into Cooperstown did not sit well in the corridors of baseball power. At that meeting, the committee recommended that anyone banned from baseball should also be barred from eligibility for the Hall. A month later, the rules change was approved by the full board.'b'While it seems like a rule with the breadth to ensnare any number of miscreants, it is, in practice, quite narrow. Consider, after all, the players who might have appeared on Hall of Fame ballots cast by baseball writers but did not because baseball had named them permanently ineligible. The list is printed here in its entirety: Pete Rose.'b'This is not to debate whether he actually deserves to be in the Hall of Fame \xe2\x80\x94 his marvelous, outsize contributions as a player say yes, his persistent, game-endangering gambling says no. But this is to argue that Mr. Rose, just like modern steroid users, deserves his day of judgment. It\xe2\x80\x99s not too late. Just as the Hall abruptly concocted a rule to keep him out in 1991, it could pass an amendment that would make him eligible immediately. Mr. Rose might not be voted in, but we would know where he stands.'b'Baseball, permanently stung by the Black Sox scandal of 1919, clearly views gambling as a far more serious sin than steroid use. The league mandates a permanent ban for any player or manager betting on a game in which he is involved, while first-time steroid users essentially get an extended vacation: a 50-game suspension. Yet those disparate standards needn\xe2\x80\x99t have any bearing on the Hall.'b'From its inception in the 1930s, the Hall\xe2\x80\x99s creators delegated the decision of who got into the shrine to a large and independent body of baseball writers \xe2\x80\x94 a process devised as a way to represent the feelings of the public. The system has generally worked. In the case of Mr. Bonds and Mr. Clemens, the arguments in their favor (\xe2\x80\x9cThey may have done steroids, but they still had to hit and pitch\xe2\x80\x9d) and the arguments against them (\xe2\x80\x9cThey cheated the game and the fans\xe2\x80\x9d) have been distilled in the writers\xe2\x80\x99 vote: They do not deserve to be in the Hall.'b'The banished Mr. Rose received 41 write-in votes in 1991, far short of the 323 he would have needed for induction, but also more write-in votes, by an order of magnitude, than anyone else has ever received. Although write-in votes are not officially counted, and so represent a \xe2\x80\x9cwasted\xe2\x80\x9d vote, Mr. Rose has continued to receive them each year. Maybe, had he been on that ballot in \xe2\x80\x9991, he would have drawn the votes he needed to get in. Maybe he would have received fewer than even those 41 write-ins. Maybe he would have received somewhere in between. We\xe2\x80\x99ll never know. How he would fare today, however, could easily be found out.'b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 IN November, housing starts were up 23 percent, and there was cheering all around. But the crowd would quiet down if it realized that another housing bubble had begun to grow.'b'Almost everyone understands that the 2007-8 financial crisis was precipitated by the collapse of a huge housing bubble. The Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s remedy of choice was the Dodd-Frank Act. It is the most restrictive financial regulation since the Great Depression \xe2\x80\x94 but it won\xe2\x80\x99t prevent another housing bubble.'b'Housing bubbles are measured by comparing current prices to a reliable index of housing prices. Fortunately, we have one. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping track of the costs of renting a residence since at least 1983; its index shows a steady rise of about 3 percent a year over this 30-year period. This is as it should be; other things being equal, rentals should track the inflation rate. Home prices should do the same. If prices rise much above the rental rate, families theoretically would begin to rent, not buy.'b'Housing bubbles, then, become visible \xe2\x80\x94 and can legitimately be called bubbles \xe2\x80\x94 when housing prices diverge significantly from rents.'b'In 1997, housing prices began to diverge substantially from rental costs. Between 1997 and 2002, the average compound rate of growth in housing prices was 6 percent, exceeding the average compound growth rate in rentals of 3.34 percent. This, incidentally, contradicts the widely held idea that the last housing bubble was caused by the Federal Reserve\xe2\x80\x99s monetary policy. Between 1997 and 2000, the Fed raised interest rates, and they stayed relatively high until almost 2002 with no apparent effect on the bubble, which continued to maintain an average compound growth rate of 6 percent until 2007, when it collapsed.'b'Today, after the financial crisis, the recession and the slow recovery, the bubble is beginning to grow again. Between 2011 and the third quarter of 2013, housing prices grew by 5.83 percent, again exceeding the increase in rental costs, which was 2 percent.'b'Many commentators will attribute this phenomenon to the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s low interest rates. Maybe so; maybe not. Recall that the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s monetary policy was blamed for the earlier bubble\xe2\x80\x99s growth between 1997 and 2002, even though the Fed raised interest rates during most of that period.'b'Both this bubble and the last one were caused by the government\xe2\x80\x99s housing policies, which made it possible for many people to purchase homes with very little or no money down. In 1992, Congress adopted what were called \xe2\x80\x9caffordable housing\xe2\x80\x9d goals for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are huge government-backed firms that buy mortgages from banks and other lenders. Then, as now, they were the dominant players in the residential mortgage markets. The goals required Fannie and Freddie to buy an increasing quota of mortgages made to borrowers who were at or below the median income where they lived.'b'Through the 1990s and into the 2000s, the Department of Housing and Urban Development raised the quotas seven times, so that in the 2000s more than 50 percent of all the mortgages Fannie and Freddie acquired had to be made to home buyers who were at or below the median income. To make mortgages affordable for low-income borrowers, Fannie and Freddie reduced the down payments on mortgages they would acquire. By 1994, Fannie was accepting down payments of 3 percent and, by 2000, mortgages with zero-down payments. Although these lenient standards were intended to help low-income and minority borrowers, they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be confined to those buyers. Even buyers who could afford down payments of 10 to 20 percent were attracted to mortgages with 3 percent or zero down. By 2006, the National Association of Realtors reported that 45 percent of first-time buyers put down no money. The leverage in that case is infinite.'b'This drove up housing prices. Buying a home became preferable to renting. A low or nonexistent down payment meant that families could borrow more and still remain within the monthly payment they could afford, especially if it was accompanied \xe2\x80\x94 as it often was \xe2\x80\x94 by an interest-only loan or a 30-year loan that amortized slowly. In effect, then, borrowing was constrained only by appraisals, which were ratcheted upward by the exclusive use of comparables in setting housing values.'b'Today, the same forces are operating. The Federal Housing Administration is requiring down payments of just 3.5 percent. Fannie and Freddie are requiring a mere 5 percent. According to the American Enterprise Institute\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'National Mortgage Risk'b' Index data set for Oct. 2013, about half of those getting mortgages to buy homes \xe2\x80\x94 not to refinance \xe2\x80\x94 put 5 percent or less down. When anyone suggests that down payments should be raised to the once traditional 10 or 20 percent, the outcry in Congress and from brokers and homebuilders is deafening. They claim that people will not be able to buy homes. What they really mean is that people won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to buy expensive homes. When down payments were 10 to 20 percent before 1992, the homeownership rate was a steady 64 percent \xe2\x80\x94 slightly below where it is today \xe2\x80\x94 and the housing market was not frothy. People simply bought less expensive homes.'b'If we expect to prevent the next crisis, we have to prevent the next bubble, and we will never do that without eliminating leverage where it counts: among home buyers.'b'President Obama earned a rare moment of bipartisan acclaim last month when he commuted the sentences of eight long-serving federal prisoners. Their crack cocaine offenses had resulted in the harsh penalties mandated by a sentencing formula that Congress repudiated when it passed the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. The old formula, under which possession of a quantity of crack earned the same sentence as possession of 100 times that quantity of powdered cocaine, was 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cnow recognized as unjust,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' the president said.'b'But there were ghosts at last month\xe2\x80\x99s party: thousands of federal inmates still serving time under sentences that would not have been imposed under the new law. Most are black. As is widely recognized, crack has been the cocaine of choice for African-American users and dealers even as white offenders choose powder. The racially disparate impact of the old law, which dates from the crack-cocaine panic of the mid-1980s with its now-discredited theory that crack was many times more dangerous, made reform a civil rights priority.'b'These prisoners remain in drug-sentencing limbo. When Congress passed the Fair Sentencing Act, which reduced the crack-to-powder sentencing ratio from 1:100 to 1:18, it was silent on retroactivity. The Supreme Court granted limited relief two years ago, ruling that those who committed their crimes before the law took effect in August 2010 but who were not sentenced until later could retroactively get the new law\xe2\x80\x99s benefit.'b'In his 'b'majority opinion'b', Justice Stephen G. Breyer said this outcome was consistent with Congress\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clanguage, structure, and basic objectives.\xe2\x80\x9d But the decision, Dorsey v. United States, said nothing encouraging about broader retroactivity, and the most conservative members of the court wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even have gone that far. The vote was 5 to 4.'b'Senators Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, introduced a bill last summer to authorize judges to grant relief to pre-2010 prisoners on a case-by-case basis. But the 'b'Smarter Sentencing Act'b', as its sponsors call it, has yet to move toward a vote.'b'Something there is that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t love retroactivity. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard-wired in the American DNA, and embodied in the ex post facto clause of Article I of the Constitution, that when things change for the worse \xe2\x80\x94 a harsher sentence, a new crime \xe2\x80\x94 the effect should be prospective only.'b'So maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of balance to the notion that on the rare occasions when the criminal justice system becomes more lenient, the effect should be only prospective as well. After all, offenders knew the rules. And yet there is something too pat about that assumption of equivalency, something grindingly unfair about the plight of those pre-2010 inmates. (As a reminder, the same mandatory five-year minimum sentence resulted from possessing with intent to distribute five grams of crack cocaine, less than one-fifth of an ounce, and 500 grams of cocaine powder, more than a pound.)'b'Society made a judgment, expressed in a bipartisan political consensus, that disparities of this kind were irrational and racially inequitable. Passage of the Fair Sentencing Act was preceded by years of debate, including pleas by federal judges who hated what the law made them do. Gradually, insight emerged. Keeping a known and finite group of people locked in a system acknowledged to be irrational is irrationality itself.'b'A federal appellate panel last spring went further, finding it not just irrational but unconstitutional. In a 2-1 ruling in 'b'United States v. Blewett'b', the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that because \xe2\x80\x9cthe discriminatory nature of prior crack sentences is no longer a point of legitimate debate,\xe2\x80\x9d denying retroactive effect to the new law \xe2\x80\x9cwould perpetuate proven racial discrimination and thereby violate equal protection.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Obama administration moved within days to ask the full Sixth Circuit 'b'to overturn the panel\xe2\x80\x99s decision'b'. Citing Supreme Court precedents holding that only intentional discrimination, and not merely a foreseeable discriminatory effect, violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protection, Justice Department lawyers told the Sixth Circuit that the panel\xe2\x80\x99s decision was based on \xe2\x80\x9ca nonexistent equal-protection problem\xe2\x80\x9d and was seriously flawed. Last month, the full Sixth Circuit 'b'overturned the panel decision'b' by a vote of 10-7.'b'Every appeals court to reach the issue has now ruled against retroactivity for the Fair Sentencing Act. That means the Supreme Court is unlikely to intervene. But another retroactivity question is looming. There is growing disagreement in the state courts over whether to give retroactive effect to the justices\xe2\x80\x99 2012 ruling in 'b'Miller v. Alabama'b', which invalidated mandatory sentences of life without parole for juveniles who commit murder. The fate of some 2,000 life-sentenced inmates hangs in the balance. So does our own sense of justice.'b'Another shameful lesson in the multibillion-dollar entertainment industry euphemistically referred to as collegiate sports is playing out at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A former professor was'b' indicted'b' on fraud charges last month after running dozens of bogus and no-show courses heavily enrolled with student athletes looking for easy academic credits.'b'Investigations have found that over almost two decades as many as 200 classes offered little or no actual instruction, with the mere submission of any sort of term paper the only requirement for a passing mark. As many as 560 unauthorized grade changes were made across the years, some in the name of professors who said their signatures had been forged. This at a campus that presents itself as an academics-first institution.'b'The scandal points to the ever more dominant role in academic life played by revenue-rich intercollegiate athletics, where victories are badges in the booming business of televised sports. Yet Chapel Hill officials have clung to the fiction that the dummy courses were not designed to protect athletes\xe2\x80\x99 eligibility. The university says the fact that nonathletes also had access to the courses shows that the scheme was not designed to protect athletes.'b'But The News &amp; Observer of Raleigh found that counselors were steering athletes to the no-show classes, and that athletes accounted for 'b'nearly two-thirds'b' of those in many of the phantom classes. One notorious class in the summer of 2011 was created for an enrollment of 18 football players.'b'The N.C.A.A. should be alarmed at this scandal, but there is no sign yet of dedicated reform. To the contrary, reports in The News &amp; Observer have detailed how campus and N.C.A.A. officials quietly worked together as the scandal played out.'b'One of the first votes the Senate plans to take when it returns Monday is on 'b'restoring unemployment benefits'b' to 1.3 million people who lost them on Dec. 28. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine a more important action for those who have been out of work the longest and for the economy.'b'And what\xe2\x80\x99s at the top of the House\xe2\x80\x99s agenda? 'b'Yet another vote'b' to undermine the health care reform law. (In this case, a bill to impose unnecessary security requirements on the health care website, though there is not the slightest indication of security problems.)'b'Nothing could show the priorities of the two chambers \xe2\x80\x94 and the slog that lies ahead this year \xe2\x80\x94 better than these votes. At one end of the Capitol, lawmakers are actually trying to help people in deep financial distress, continuing a vital Washington practice. The other end is holding a meaningless symbolic vote, designed solely to embarrass the Obama administration and continue its politically motivated attacks on the health law.'b'The jobless benefits wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even be an issue if Republicans had agreed to extend them last month, at the same time that the budget agreement was being negotiated. The bill proposed by Senate Democrats would extend benefits for three months to those who lost them, at a cost of $6.5 billion. It is not clear that it will get the 60 votes needed to defeat the expected Republican filibuster, and its chances are even worse in the House.'b'But it is still worth trying. As Gene Sperling, director of the White House\xe2\x80\x99s National Economic Council, 'b'noted recently, 'b'it\xe2\x80\x99s been more than 50 years since the government cut off emergency unemployment insurance when the rate of long-term joblessness was even half the current level.'b'Republicans are insisting the cost be \xe2\x80\x9coffset,\xe2\x80\x9d which means they want some other program cut to pay for the benefits. (They would never consider offsetting it by reducing a tax loophole for the rich.) But with the deficit falling sharply, this benefit does not need to be offset because of the positive effect it would have on the economy. Extending benefits through the end of 2014 would help create 200,000 jobs, the White House estimated \xe2\x80\x94 one reason the House would rather change the subject.'b'For nearly two decades, Japan and the United States have been mired in a dispute over the American military presence on Okinawa. 'b'Late last month, 'b' the two sides took an important step toward resolving the issue when the Okinawa governor, Hirokazu Nakaima, approved a landfill permit clearing the way for construction of a new base on a remote coast of the island. There are still hurdles, but the permit was a significant breakthrough.'b'The United States has had troops on Okinawa since it occupied the island after World War II. Since 2006, the two governments have entered into two agreements to reduce the burden on Okinawa by relocating the United States Marine Corps Air Station from the city of Ginowan to a less-congested part of the island, and by moving about 8,000 of the 18,000 Marines now on the island to Guam, Hawaii and Australia. The move was triggered by the 1995 gang rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl by American servicemen, but Pentagon officials now say the relocation is also needed to meet security requirements as the United States rebalances its focus toward Asia.'b'For years, the plans stalled because of political opposition, mostly on Okinawa, with some critics demanding that the base be taken off the island entirely. (Okinawa hosts almost three dozen American military facilities and more than half of the American service members stationed in Japan.) Despite the landfill permit, it is unclear whether local politics could still thwart the project. If the military is to remain for the long term, the United States and Japan must make a more compelling case to Okinawans for why the American presence is still needed. They also must be responsive to Okinawans\xe2\x80\x99 concerns about jet crashes, crime, environmental degradation and noise.'b'Japan\xe2\x80\x99s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, worked to make the deal happen by pressing Okinawan officials to approve the permit and offering financial support for the island. America\xe2\x80\x99s continued military presence in Japan is important to regional stability, a point driven home by North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s warmongering and the increasing face-offs between China and its Asian neighbors, including Japan, over disputed islands in the South China and East China Seas.'b'But the base deal has been overshadowed by concerns in America and elsewhere about Mr. Abe\xe2\x80\x99s aggressive nationalism, which has inflamed tensions with China and South Korea. After Mr. Abe visited Yasukuni, the controversial Shinto shrine honoring Japan\xe2\x80\x99s war dead, including World War II war criminals, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel postponed calling the Japanese defense minister about the base deal. When he spoke to the minister on Saturday, he underscored the importance of Japan improving relations with its neighbors, a spokesman said.'b'Mr. Abe\xe2\x80\x99s wrongheaded version of history has a poisonous effect on regional security, and the United States has warned him about this. Perhaps President Obama will have to make this point more firmly.'b'Schools across the country are rethinking \xe2\x80\x9czero tolerance\xe2\x80\x9d discipline policies under which children have been suspended, even arrested, for minor offenses like cursing, getting into shoving matches and other garden-variety misbehavior that in years past would have been resolved with detention or meetings with a child\xe2\x80\x99s parents.'b'These reappraisals are long overdue. Studies have shown that suspensions and expulsions do nothing to improve the school climate, while increasing the risk that children will experience long-term social and academic problems. Federal data also indicates that minority students are disproportionately 'b'singled out'b' for harsh disciplinary measures.'b'These policies date back to 1994, when Congress required states receiving federal education money to expel students for bringing guns onto school property. States and local governments broadened and distorted this mandate to expel children for minor infractions. At the same time, schools began stationing police officers in hallways, which also increased arrests for nonviolent behavior.'b'The scope of the problem became clear three years ago when the Council of State Governments Justice Center, a nonprofit policy group, 'b'issued a study'b' of school discipline polices in Texas. It showed that nearly 6 in 10 public school students were suspended or expelled at least once between seventh and 12th grade. But only a tiny fraction of the disciplinary actions taken against students were for serious criminal conduct requiring suspension or expulsion under state law.'b'Children who are removed from school are at heightened risk for low achievement, being held back, dropping out or becoming permanently entangled in the juvenile justice system. The Texas Legislature has taken steps aimed at keeping minor misconduct cases from reaching the courts. One law recommends that school districts consider less harsh sanctions, like a warning letter or counseling. Another measure prohibits police from ticketing and fining children under the age of 12 on school grounds or on a school bus.'b'A similar evolution is taking place in California. The Los Angeles school district became the first in the nation to ban suspensions for \xe2\x80\x9cwillful defiance,\xe2\x80\x9d a catchall category that accounted for more than 40 percent of the state\xe2\x80\x99s suspensions in the 2011-12 school year. A new state law allows suspension for serious offenses, like those involving violence or weapons, but requires schools to try alternative strategies, including parent-teacher conferences, before suspending students for nonviolent infractions.'b'Change is also afoot in Broward County, Fla., one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest school districts. The district 'b'has entered'b' into an agreement with civil rights groups and law enforcement to keep troubled children in school, where they can receive counseling and other forms of help. Broward\xe2\x80\x99s superintendent said it was wrong to keep saddling students with criminal records that can hurt their chances of getting a job or college financial aid, or of entering the military. School systems across the country should pay attention.'b'MEDFORD, Mass. \xe2\x80\x94  Late last month, Chinese and North Korean leaders found themselves showered with an unexpected gift from Japan: Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Tokyo\xe2\x80\x99s controversial Yasukuni Shrine, where 14 \xe2\x80\x9cClass A\xe2\x80\x9d war criminals \xe2\x80\x94 the category reserved for political and military leaders prosecuted in 1946 for starting and waging war \xe2\x80\x94 and over 1,000 individuals convicted of lesser war crimes are commemorated. Mr. Abe\xe2\x80\x99s homage to Japan\xe2\x80\x99s war dead, in the court of world public opinion, smacks of denial of his nation\xe2\x80\x99s wartime aggression \xe2\x80\x94 and has been widely condemned.'b'This impression only strengthens China\xe2\x80\x99s hand in current disputes with Japan \xe2\x80\x94 and therefore also in its strategic competition with the United States. It also advances North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s aim of driving wedges into the coalition of the United States, South Korea and Japan.'b'Mr. Abe likely calculated that he could reap domestic political advantage from nationalistic posturing without much consequence, as long as Japan continues its policy of quasi-pacifism under the American security umbrella. But he chose a particularly sensitive moment for his symbolic gesture. This pilgrimage comes just a month after China\xe2\x80\x99s unilateral declaration of an air defense identification zone over a chain of islands in the East China Sea claimed by China and administered by Japan.'b'An increasingly assertive China and belligerent North Korea \xe2\x80\x94 two states founded on the anti-Japanese revolutionary credentials of their respective leaderships \xe2\x80\x94 will surely exploit Japan\xe2\x80\x99s perceived embrace of militarism, particularly at a time when Japan is bolstering its defense policy as never before in the postwar period. The image of an unashamedly bellicose Japan, however, has no benefit whatsoever for the United States, which is allied to Japan by a security treaty that grants the right to maintain military bases on Japanese territory.'b'On the day of Mr. Abe\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the shrine, Washington joined the chorus from Beijing and Seoul, whose denunciation ranged from \xe2\x80\x9cstrong indignation\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9crage.\xe2\x80\x9d Days later, the Chinese Foreign Ministry likened Mr. Abe\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the shrine to honoring \xe2\x80\x9cthe Nazis of Asia,\xe2\x80\x9d while North Korea characterized it as a path to \xe2\x80\x9cself-destruction.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Using unusually blunt language, the American Embassy in Tokyo stated that \xe2\x80\x9cthe United States is disappointed that Japan\xe2\x80\x99s leadership has taken an action that will exacerbate tensions with Japan\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors.\xe2\x80\x9d While the strategic imperatives of the American-Japanese alliance will survive this incident, Mr. Abe has set back Japan\xe2\x80\x99s international diplomacy and undone much of the work of his predecessors who made Japan a model of peace, democracy and development in the post-1945 world.'b'On the surface, the Yasukuni compound offers a typical vignette of Japan, with its meticulously maintained gardens and the graceful movements of its Shinto priests. But just a short stroll from the main shrine, the visitor finds a consecration of lies and half-truths that tarnishes Japan\xe2\x80\x99s post-1945 ascendancy: the Yasukuni War Museum.'b'Here are historical narratives that glorify Japan\xe2\x80\x99s brutal colonization of Korea from 1910 to 1945 and the 1937 invasion of China, which involved the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians. The attack on Pearl Harbor is even presented as contributing to \xe2\x80\x9cworld peace.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The museum also houses a memorial to the Indian jurist Radhabinod Pal, who was the sole judge on the postwar International Military Tribunal for the Far East to argue that all the Japanese defendants were not guilty. The message is clear: Japan fought for peace, fell victim to the more powerful Allies, and was served victor\xe2\x80\x99s justice.'b'This grossly distorted version of Japan\xe2\x80\x99s war record, not surprisingly, ignites righteous indignation among Japan\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors. But Mr. Abe has done more than give offense. His visit has undermined the American strategy of \xe2\x80\x9crebalancing\xe2\x80\x9d in Asia \xe2\x80\x94 in particular, the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to bolster its alliance with Japan and South Korea, in the context of China\xe2\x80\x99s expansionist foreign policy and the ever-present security threat posed by North Korea.'b'South Korea has rebuffed Japan for over a year thanks to historical slights precisely of this nature. Prospects for renewed talks had improved in recent weeks, but it is now extremely unlikely that there will be any thaw. To Washington\xe2\x80\x99s dismay, Mr. Abe\xe2\x80\x99s disregard for Koreans\xe2\x80\x99 sense of the trauma about the Japanese occupation has given South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s president, Park Geun-hye, no option but to cool relations.'b'The specter raised by Japan\xe2\x80\x99s new national security strategy \xe2\x80\x94 with its implication of military operations beyond its borders \xe2\x80\x94 already made Japan\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors wary. Now, because of the Yasukuni Shrine visit, some may band together against the perceived aggressor.'b'Seoul and Beijing are already discussing measures to address the \xe2\x80\x9cJapan problem\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a bilateral conversation that will perturb the Americans. Any fissure in the United States-Japan-South Korea coalition is good news for China and North Korea, which have been fretting over America\xe2\x80\x99s endorsement of Japan\xe2\x80\x99s new national security policy. A possible result is that China will pursue still more aggressively its claim over the disputed islands. North Korea may try to fan anti-Japanese sentiment in South Korea, as well as create security threats to test the alliance of democracies.'b'Mr. Abe may have intended, as he said, simply to pray for the souls of his nation\xe2\x80\x99s war dead. But in the eyes of the world, his pilgrimage to the Yasukuni Shrine appeared a willful evocation of Japan\xe2\x80\x99s pre-1945 imperialism and repudiation of its post-1945 legacy of peace. This was a move that may ultimately serve the interests of China and North Korea, rather than Japan. Given the perception of an unabashedly aggressive Japan that he has created, Mr. Abe will find an already challenging foreign policy environment considerably more daunting as he faces an expansionist China, belligerent North Korea, indignant South Korea and exasperated America.'b''b'\n'b'Sung-Yoon Lee 'b' is a professor of Korean studies and an assistant professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.'b''b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94  Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s military leaders have launched an all-out war against the Muslim Brotherhood. American and European leaders have observed this crackdown with a sense of detachment, both because they have few tools to influence the military\xe2\x80\x99s decision-making and because this conflict appears to be an internal matter.'b'But the belief that this intensifying conflict will play out solely within Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s borders is false. As the violence increases, and the radicalization of Islamists deepens, Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s crisis threatens to add fuel to the ongoing terrorist activity across North Africa and to spawn a new wave of attacks against Western targets just as the anti-Islamist crackdown that began in the late 1970s aided the rise of Al Qaeda.'b'Repression of Islamists in Egypt was an essential stage in the emergence of contemporary jihadism. As splinter groups that were significantly more radical than the Muslim Brotherhood formed, Islamists became more violent. In the 1970s, a charismatic former Brotherhood member, Shukri Mustapha, created Takfir wal-Hijra, one of the early forerunners of Al Qaeda. Meanwhile, Muhammad Abd al-Salam Faraj plotted the ideology of Al Jihad. The latter group eventually assassinated President Anwar Sadat, and later provided much of the leadership for Al Qaeda, including Ayman al-Zawahri, the group\xe2\x80\x99s current leader.'b'The situation in Egypt is bound to worsen and the military clearly knows this, though some delude themselves that enough brutality will bring submission. Criminalizing the Brotherhood, which renounced violence in the 1970s and honored that pledge through the inept tenure of President Mohamed Morsi, shows that a line has been crossed, and that the army\xe2\x80\x99s promises of a return to democracy were empty.'b'The turn against the Brothers is a fateful error. Repression coupled with political exclusion has long been understood to drive radicalization, and the great hope of the Arab Spring was that the passing of the authoritarian regimes would put an end to arbitrary rule and brutality. Instead, the war against the Brotherhood will make violence the rational choice for fence-sitters.'b'Already, an Islamist offensive that began by targeting security forces is expanding to include civilian targets. Some experts have pointed to the Algerian ordeal of the 1990s, when the army nullified an election that would have brought Islamists to power, sparking a war that killed up to 200,000 people. But the regional consequences of protracted conflict in Egypt could be worse.'b'Given the weakness of internal security forces across the region, it is easy to imagine how a pipeline of money, men and mat\xc3\xa9riel could threaten all of North Africa. Weapons from the enormous arsenal of the former Libyan strongman, Muammar el-Qaddafi, could flow into Egypt, stoking the violence, while fighters can cross \xe2\x80\x94 as some already have \xe2\x80\x94 into Libya to strengthen the jihadist forces there. Tunisia, the one hopeful remnant of the Arab Spring, would clearly be endangered. In the other direction, the Sinai Peninsula is poised to become even more chaotic and perilous, jeopardizing Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security.'b'Western governments must recognize the real possibility that a new cycle of conflict could produce more terrorists who wish to target Americans and the West. Rightly or wrongly, Islamists view the status quo as supported \xe2\x80\x94 even engineered \xe2\x80\x94 by the United States. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help when American lawmakers like Michele Bachmann visit Egypt to praise the military regime and condemn the Brotherhood, as she did recently.'b'America has no good options at present. There\xe2\x80\x99s no upside to a confrontation with the military \xe2\x80\x94 only the prospect of losing more sway. An effective policy response will require close cooperation with the Egyptian security services, who caused the problem to begin with. And the need for American military access to the Suez Canal and continued Egyptian support for the peace treaty with Israel also preclude simply walking away from Egypt. The United States will be in a situation much like it was with the Mubarak regime for three decades, working closely on counterterrorism while pressing, however forlornly, for liberalization. It must find new inducements to nudge Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s rulers to open up based on the country\xe2\x80\x99s economic needs. But this is hard, especially in light of what Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will supply.'b'There is a small chance that, together with the West, other powers like Russia and China, which both fear Islamist extremism, can be persuaded to send Egypt a similar message. We should try to forge a common approach.'b'America must do its best to ensure that those outside Egypt who remember the cycle of repression and radicalization that paved the way to 9/11 regularly remind those inside Egypt who appear determined to forget it.'b''b'\n'b'Daniel Benjamin'b' served as coordinator for counterterrorism at the U.S. State Department from 2009-12.'b'Steven Simon'b' was senior director for the Middle East and North Africa at the United States National Security Council from 2011-12.'b''b'BUSAN, South Korea \xe2\x80\x94  On Dec. 10, a handwritten, politically charged poster appeared on a bulletin board at Korea University in Seoul, one of the country\xe2\x80\x99s top institutions of higher education. It began and ended with the same question: \xe2\x80\x9cHow are you all doing?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This simple query hit a nerve. A photograph of the poster went viral on the Internet. Students across South Korea started posting their own political notices on campuses (and pictures of them, too, appeared online). High school students, office workers and housewives joined in, writing posters to air political grievances and posting them in public and on the web.'b'Echoing the plain bureaucratic style of political placards from the military dictatorship of Park Chung-hee \xe2\x80\x94 who ran the country from 1963 until his assassination in 1979, and who was the father of the current president, Park Geun-hye \xe2\x80\x94 the Korea University poster made references to a hodgepodge of hot-button political issues: the more than 4,000 rail workers who were laid off under a national privatization plan; a villager from Bora in the southeast who committed suicide in an apparent protest of government land grabs that are part of a nuclear-development project; and the National Intelligence Service\xe2\x80\x99s alleged interference in the 2012 presidential elections.'b'Jeon Hyun-sik, 22, a student at Korea University, told The Hankyoreh daily newspaper that political posters usually urge people to do something. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I was struck by how this one asked us how we\xe2\x80\x99re doing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI ended up thinking about myself and a lot of other things.\xe2\x80\x9d Another student, Lee Min-ji, a freshman in a Daejeon high school, criticized the television news in her poster, which went viral, asserting that it is slanted toward the government. A housewife\xe2\x80\x99s poster at Korea University said that she was sorry she had taught her kids to focus so intently on making money.'b'Handwritten political posters \xe2\x80\x94 often composed in an artless and unadorned style, usually just words on plain white paper \xe2\x80\x94 were ubiquitous in South Korea in the 1970s and 1980s and were one of the few outlets available for expressing political views. Most posters were anonymous and put up under the cover of night. From time to time, the university authorities and the police would clear off the walls.'b'The posters continued to appear in public even after full civilian rule was established in the early 1990s, but they started to feel outdated, more like mere graffiti than anything else. When I was a graduate student in the early 1990s, posters still covered sections of the campus walls, but like most students I ignored them.'b'Then along came the Internet. In the mid-1990s, web bulletin boards replaced handwritten posters, which began to disappear: People could hope for bigger ripple effects of their views online.'b'There were no fresh facts, shocking revelations or radical opinions in the poster that suddenly appeared last month at Korea University. But it did expose the worries of frustrated and disaffected young people who feel they\xe2\x80\x99ve been left behind by globalization.'b'Economic concerns, like low salaries and high rents, are widespread. College students are angry about expensive tuition and dim employment prospects. Support for the rail workers, another common cause, reflects concerns among young people that the rail privatization plan will start a trend, leading to higher costs for utilities and health care as they too become privatized, and to the end of the era of the coveted permanent government job.'b'The issue that seems to have most galvanized the poster writers is the scandal involving military and National Intelligence Service agents who carried out online campaigns during the 2012 presidential race to manipulate public opinion in favor of Park Geun-hye, who won the presidency by one million votes. Eleven officials in the Defense Ministry\xe2\x80\x99s cyberwarfare unit are accused of spreading 2,100 messages praising Ms. Park. And, in a separate case, a team of N.I.S. agents is being tried for sending out millions of posts on Twitter and news websites in support of Ms. Park. The president has denied having had anything to do with the online campaigns, saying repeatedly that she had not benefited from them.'b'The poster movement \xe2\x80\x94 a return to a more basic sort of expression \xe2\x80\x94 may best be seen as a backlash against an online culture that allows users to post whatever they want using false names or no names at all. Anonymity was once welcomed by political activists as a way to get opinions out in the open, but it has now come to be regarded as an obstacle to meaningful dialogue.'b'Most of the new posters are signed by real people. Ju Hyun-u, 27, who wrote the first poster at Korea University, said in a radio interview that he believed his poster went viral, in part, because it was authentic: He had signed it.'b'In the early 2000s, people expected that anonymity on the Internet would be positive for the development of democracy in South Korea. In a Confucian culture like South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s, hierarchy can block the free exchange of opinions in face-to-face situations. The web offered a way around that.'b'Internet portal services installed bulletin-board systems that allowed users to post opinions anonymously. For example, the popular service Agora was created as a forum for free \xe2\x80\x94 and often anonymous \xe2\x80\x94 exchanges. But South Koreans feel duped by the N.I.S. scandal and they partially blame anonymous commenting.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not yet known how much the poster movement will affect Ms. Park\xe2\x80\x99s government. (The Kyunghyang Shinmun newspaper suggested a recent dip in the president\xe2\x80\x99s approval ratings among young people could be a result of the handwritten poster wave, but there is no definitive data.) Regardless, the posters are getting politicians\xe2\x80\x99 interest: Some even appeared in Congress, put up by both governing party and opposition members.'b'Political posters don\xe2\x80\x99t by any means play the same role as they did under the military dictatorship.

I feel less than I am. The more I cannot see, the more it seems I am not seen.'b'As a teacher of the blind, Ms. Mahoney recalls that a woman at a party asked how she could talk to her students, a query Ms. Mahoney interpreted as coming from ignorance. I think that this woman was showing an empathic response to blind people.'b'One of the first devastating losses for people with creeping blindness is the loss of the ability to read and interpret facial expressions and body language in others. This is such an imperative part of human interactions that when absent it makes talking difficult. This is what the woman was probably trying to articulate.'b'Ms. Mahoney dissolves barriers between the sighted and the blind. Blind people need to do their share in undoing habitual prejudices against them.

As New Yorkers, we hope that he can do this in a manner that gets everyone on board to help fulfill his vision.'b'CHARLES HOUSTON'b'\nBrooklyn, Jan. 3, 2014'b''b''b'To the Editor: 'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'Social Media as a Megaphone to Push Food Makers to Change'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Business Day, Dec. 31) captures well how consumers are using social media to influence the food industry, and kudos to Kraft, PepsiCo and other companies for reformulating several of their products in response to those efforts.'b'But citizens and consumer groups need the Food and Drug Administration to take strong, binding action to improve the entire food supply.'b'The agency has said it may ban most or all artificial trans fat, which causes heart disease. It needs to move on many other fronts as well, including reducing sodium levels and with them the prevalence of hypertension; eliminating synthetic food dyes that impair some children\xe2\x80\x99s behavior, and dropping sugar levels in soft drinks to help tackle the obesity epidemic.'b'MICHAEL F. JACOBSON'b'\nExecutive Director, Center for'b'\nScience in the Public Interest'b'\nWashington, Dec. 31, 2013'b''b''b''b'FOR all the talk of New York\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctale of two cities\xe2\x80\x9d economic divide, last week Mayor Bill de Blasio took charge of a local economy that has far outperformed the rest of the country since the financial collapse \xe2\x80\x94 and not just in a small corner of Manhattan, but across the city. Driven by the expansion of the technology and information sector, New York City today has more private-sector jobs than during the 2007-8 peak of the finance-driven boom years.'b'New York has, over the last decade, become a tech city to rival San Francisco, Boston and Seattle. And it has done so by moving away from its old reliance on the finance and legal sectors, and the industries like hospitality that rely on them. The challenge for Mr. de Blasio is continuing that trend, and making sure all New Yorkers benefit from it.'b'Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, can justifiably boast about New York\xe2\x80\x99s rise to prominence as a \xe2\x80\x9cdigital city.\xe2\x80\x9d On his watch, the technology and information sector has become the city\xe2\x80\x99s second-most-powerful economic engine, after financial services. New York now has 10 percent of the country\xe2\x80\x99s jobs in the \xe2\x80\x9cInternet publishing and web search portal\xe2\x80\x9d industry, up from just over 6 percent in 2007.'b'Surprisingly, over the past couple of years, the city\xe2\x80\x99s minority populations have been among the main beneficiaries of this boom. Since 2010, the number of blacks working in computer and mathematical occupations \xe2\x80\x94 the Census Bureau\xe2\x80\x99s term for tech-related jobs \xe2\x80\x94 in the city has risen by 19.7 percent, based on a preliminary analysis of new census data.'b'Over the same stretch, the number of Hispanics in such occupations in New York City has risen by 25.4 percent. By comparison, non-Hispanic whites in computer and mathematical occupations experienced just a 6.4 percent gain since 2010.'b'The rapid growth of minorities in New York tech jobs reflects, in part, the soaring number of tech degrees earned by minorities in recent years. For example, bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degrees in computer and information sciences granted to Hispanic students have risen by more than 40 percent nationally over the past three years, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics. That supply is then sucked up by the tightness of the city\xe2\x80\x99s technology and information labor markets, which has forced local employers to reach out beyond the usual sources.'b'The boom has also produced benefits across all five boroughs: Private-sector jobs in the outlying boroughs rose by 9 percent from mid-2008 to mid-2013, while private-sector jobs in Manhattan are up only 3 percent over the same stretch. This pattern is the reverse of the financial boom years, when Manhattan generated jobs at a much faster pace than the rest of the city.'b'Moreover, despite worries that the city has not yet spawned a Google or a Microsoft, New York\xe2\x80\x99s strength as a digital city continues to grow. Based on data from the Conference Board, an analysis by the Progressive Policy Institute shows that ads for computer and mathematical jobs in New York rose by 6.8 percent in the first 11 months of 2013 compared with a year earlier, and compared with just 4.0 percent nationwide.'b'Instead, the true weakness in the city\xe2\x80\x99s economy right now lies in the leisure and hospitality industry, which employs almost 400,000 workers in the city. The number of jobs has been rising, but real pay has fallen, perhaps because of continuing weakness in the financial and legal sector, which generates so much demand for hotels and restaurants. These real wage declines undercut gains in the rest of the local economy.'b'What lessons does this have for the new mayor? New York\xe2\x80\x99s gains came, in part, from the aggressive efforts of the Bloomberg administration to stimulate the technology and information sector. These included funding tech incubators; the \xe2\x80\x9cMade in NY\xe2\x80\x9d marketing campaign to support small tech companies; the rapid extension of broadband access across the city; the city\xe2\x80\x99s broad-reaching Open Data initiative, which makes city data available to the public and software developers; and the selection of Cornell and Technion, the Israel Institute of Technology, to open a huge new campus on Roosevelt Island.'b'To achieve the laudable objectives laid out in his inaugural speech, most notably narrowing the income gap, Mr. de Blasio should continue these policies. The technology and information boom needs to be encouraged: It is creating jobs for all corners of the city and helping to reduce the excessive dependence on finance and real estate. That should make the city\xe2\x80\x99s economy \xe2\x80\x94 and tax revenues \xe2\x80\x94 less volatile in the future.'b'In his inaugural address, Mr. de Blasio correctly pointed to the need for better education for all New York children. That, too, needs to be part of a continued tech-centric agenda: to improve schools and maintain the city\xe2\x80\x99s tech advantage, the new mayor also must ramp up the attention to tech and related fields in the city\xe2\x80\x99s schools.'b'The main path to reducing inequality and broadening the city\xe2\x80\x99s prosperity will be better education and training to help New Yorkers prepare for the jobs of the future, and if Mr. de Blasio successfully addresses that issue, his legacy as a great mayor will be secure.'b'For a while he didn\xe2\x80\x99t move. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t clear that he could. He was stretched out on his stomach, a few concerned people bending over him, a few others kneeling beside him, as if in prayer, which they may have been. It would have been an apt response.'b'Seconds ticked by. Still no movement. Just a television replay of what had gone wrong: his head apparently whipping into another player\xe2\x80\x99s leg as the two of them tumbled \xe2\x80\x94 no, hurtled \xe2\x80\x94 out of bounds, where he remained, a few feet beyond the sideline.'b'Would he get up? Or would the cart come out? Those of us who\xe2\x80\x99d watched many a previous football game were all too familiar with that dread ritual, when a player unable to walk off the field is instead carried off, on a backboard and a tiny vehicle that might as well be a hearse, in terms of the chill it sends through you.'b'This game, a playoff match on Saturday between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Indianapolis Colts, was turning into one with too many chills. This player, a star cornerback for the Chiefs named Brandon Flowers, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t its first casualty.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve already lost Jamaal Charles to a concussion,\xe2\x80\x9d said an announcer, referring to the team\xe2\x80\x99s star running back, who\xe2\x80\x99d been forced to leave after only the sixth play of the first half. It was now early in the second half, and the announcer was filling time while Flowers lay motionless. He did so by going through the body count, mentioning yet another Chiefs standout, the wide receiver Donnie Avery, who\xe2\x80\x99d been knocked out of the game. Avery, like Charles, had suffered a concussion.'b'At last Flowers sat up. Then he stood, but only to be escorted to the locker room for a medical evaluation. It turned out that he, 'b'too,'b' had a concussion, and was done for the day.'b'The announcer remarked that there\xe2\x80\x99d been a \xe2\x80\x9cbig-time turnaround in the feel of this game,\xe2\x80\x9d in which the Chiefs\xe2\x80\x99 lead was collapsing and the aggregate injuries were something of \xe2\x80\x9ca momentum-buster.\xe2\x80\x9d What clumsy but telling words. Three men stagger off, their elimination underscoring the plague of serious injuries in this violent sport, and the main takeaway is about 'b'momentum'b'? That\xe2\x80\x99s the National Football League for you. Broken bodies matter mostly in terms of a broken rhythm.'b'The Chiefs-Colts contest, on the first weekend of the postseason playoffs, was one of the most thrilling, spectacular football games I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen. Somehow, some way, with bursts of luck and feats of extraordinary athleticism, the Colts rallied from a 28-point deficit and staged a comeback that will go into the history books, winning 45 to 44.'b'But it was also one of the most discomfiting football games I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen, a blunt reminder of how much pain we fans endorse in the service of our pleasure. All in all five players for the Chiefs went down, exiting before the end of the fourth quarter, and the team\xe2\x80\x99s defeat was inextricable from its physical devastation. In the N.F.L., the spoils often go to the squad that needs the fewest X-rays, crutches, sutures and surgeries.'b'It has been a sickening season that way. At least eight of the league\xe2\x80\x99s 32 teams were without their first-string quarterbacks before October was over. Some of the quarterbacks who went the distance seemed to do so mainly because their teams\xe2\x80\x99 entire architecture had been designed around their protection. The Denver Broncos, a favorite to go to the Super Bowl, did many things right, but none righter than treating Peyton Manning as if he were a Faberg\xc3\xa9 egg.'b'So many other players cracked. Before mid-December, 41 had fallen to season-ending knee injuries, in contrast to just 32 the previous year and 25 the year before that, 'b'as Ben Volin reported'b' in The Boston Globe.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to say definitively whether significant injuries over all are on the rise, and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. They\xe2\x80\x99re too prevalent, period. And the N.F.L. needs to go far beyond its efforts thus far to assess and reconsider anything that might be affecting player safety: what kind of equipment, 'b'head'b' to 'b'toe'b', they wear; the give of the 'b'turf'b' on which they play; the 'b'way they train'b' in the off-season. Maybe there should be 'b'weight limits'b'. There should certainly be more rest between games and there should probably be fewer of them, though there\xe2\x80\x99s been talk of the league\xe2\x80\x99s moving in the opposite direction.'b'The status quo won\xe2\x80\x99t do. It\xe2\x80\x99s untenable. It\xe2\x80\x99s arguably unconscionable. On Saturday, the sight of a crumpled Chief with distraught teammates hovering over him became so common that the announcer remarked, in a voice too glib, on the \xe2\x80\x9cinjury bug\xe2\x80\x9d that was \xe2\x80\x9ccontagious for Kansas City at the wrong time now.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s never a right time. And it\xe2\x80\x99s no little bug.'b'In the age of rail, luxury hotels mimicked European palaces. When rich people arrived at their destination, they wanted to be treated like nobility.'b'Then in the age of the jet, a new sort of hotel emerged, sleek Hiltons and Sheratons. These hotels offered the comfort of familiarity. You could go around the world and the hotels were largely the same. They were efficient and bland, offering quality service and ease of movement. A business traveler could stay in one of these hotels for days and barely notice anything about the place.'b'The computer age has brought yet another new kind of hotel: the mass boutique.'b'Boutique hotels started in the early 1980s in London, with Blakes, and in San Francisco, with the Bedford. These hotels had entirely different goals than the big hotels at the time. Instead of offering familiarity, they offered difference. Instead of offering beige, they offered edginess, art, emotion and a dollop of pretension.'b'The first boutique hotels were founded by entrepreneurs who seemed more like rock producers or psych professors than corporate executives. Chip Conley founded Joie de Vivre Hospitality in the Bay Area when he was 26. He designed his hotel Phoenix around the personality of Rolling Stone magazine. He later organized his business strategy around Abraham Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s hierarchy of needs.'b'At the bottom of the pyramid, Conley\xe2\x80\x99s hotels offer a comfortable bed, but at the top of the pyramid, Conley says that his hotels offer \xe2\x80\x9cidentity refreshment\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmass therapy.\xe2\x80\x9d As he writes in his book \xe2\x80\x9cPeak,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIf we get it right at our boutique hotels, we don\xe2\x80\x99t just satisfy our guests\xe2\x80\x99 physiological, safety, social and esteem needs: We bring them an awareness of self-actualization.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Boutiques cater to the sort of affluent consumer who is produced by the information economy, which rewards education with money. This is a consumer who is prouder of his cultural discernment than his corporate success; who feels interested in, rather than intimidated by, a hotel room stuffed with cultural signifiers \xe2\x80\x94 cerulean sofas or Steichen photos. Boutique hotels hold up a flattering mirror. When guests arrive, they are supposed to feel like they are entering an edgy community of unconventional, discerning people like themselves.'b'In an age when Hotels.com and Travelocity turn hotel rooms into commodities, these are customers who are willing to pay extra, sometimes a lot extra, for a hotel with sensibility. The boutique Soho Grand in New York is currently offering rooms at $339 a night. The Hilton Garden Inn, a very adequate hotel a couple of blocks away, is charging $139.'b'Painfully hip boutique hotels used to seem like a fad, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve spread and spread. Over the past few years, they have gone mass. Starwood has planted large, boutiquey W hotels on five continents. Hyatt has Andaz. And 'b'as Brooks Barnes reported'b' in The Times\xe2\x80\x99s most recent Sunday Business section, Marriott is creating a chain of mass boutiques, called Edition. When Marriott enters the boutique business, everybody has entered the boutique business.'b'It seems as if there is an endless supply of middle-class consumers who have boutique identities and aspirations, especially among people in their 20s. Consumers now use hotels differently. They bring their laptops down to the lobby rather than working in their rooms. Fewer people bother to unpack their bags. Therefore, room desks and closets are less important, but having a happening lobby scene is more important. People need a civic space where they can have their contiguous but individualized iPad experiences.'b'Boutique hotels are, on one level, kind of ridiculous. They are almost invariably too dark throughout, making it hard to read. The bed is often too low. The bathroom door is sometimes a flimsy sliding shutter, sacrificing privacy for style.'b'But they do exemplify a shift in the consumer market, which you might call the shift from the lima bean economy to the edamame economy. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to forget how much more boring the marketplace was a few decades ago \xe2\x80\x94 more boring cuisine, more boring restaurants, more boring hotels. Recently, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a creative brand explosion, to go along with nichification and segmentation. Companies are much more interested in creating emotional arousal. Hotels, sneakers, iced tea and even ice cream is now marketed to people on the basis of psychographic profiles and the result is a profusion of unusual products and distinctive experiences. Consumers have been educated by the market and now the median level of cultural competence is much higher.'b'A basic rule of happiness is don\xe2\x80\x99t buy things; buy experiences. The market has taken one commodity product after another and turned it into an emotional experience \xe2\x80\x94 even hotel stays. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you measure how much better off we are because of that, but we are significantly better off. The world\xe2\x80\x99s a sweeter place when, for an extra 200 bucks a night, you can lodge like Afrojack.'b'On Wednesday, New York City Council members are expected to choose a speaker to lead them and, when necessary, unite them as a counterweight and an alternative voice to the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s. Or that\xe2\x80\x99s how it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to work.'b'Melissa Mark-Viverito of East Harlem declared herself the winner three weeks ago. For that she could thank Mayor Bill de Blasio, who lobbied hard on her behalf.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s troubling enough having a speaker who is handpicked by the mayor, as Mr. de Blasio liked to point out when he used to ridicule Christine Quinn as a tool of Michael Bloomberg. But there are also 'b'the questions raised'b' in recent news reports about Ms. Mark-Viverito. The Daily News 'b'reported'b' that she failed to report any rental income from a building she owns in East Harlem, a disturbing lapse if she has tenants there, as voting records suggest. The Post 'b'noted'b' that she recently signed onto a lawsuit seeking to nullify \xe2\x80\x9cco-locations\xe2\x80\x9d of charter schools in school buildings, including one \xe2\x80\x94 Dream Charter School in her district \xe2\x80\x94 that she boasted of helping to finance.'b'Ms. Mark-Viverito\xe2\x80\x99s supporters insist that she will stand up to Mr. de Blasio. They accuse her main rival for the post, Daniel Garodnick, of representing the old system, in which Democratic leaders picked the speaker and doled out committee chairmanships, patronage jobs and member pork. It\xe2\x80\x99s true that party bosses in Queens and the Bronx, outmaneuvered by Mr. de Blasio, want Mr. Garodnick to win. But 'b'Mr. Garodnick has an independent streak'b' of his own and has distinguished himself in the fight to preserve middle-class housing and other issues.'b'The next speaker will be judged by her or his independence and ability to reform Council rules to introduce transparency and accountability. Council members should consider the reputation and legislative record offered by Mr. Garodnick, who seems the better choice.'b'Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York is set to use his executive powers to loosen restrictions on the use of marijuana for medical purposes. The Legislature, where medical marijuana bills have stalled repeatedly in the State Senate, ought to expand and strengthen the governor\xe2\x80\x99s effort through appropriate legislation.'b'As 'b'reported by The Times'b' on Sunday, Mr. Cuomo, who had long resisted legalizing medical marijuana, is planning to announce a policy on Wednesday that would allow marijuana to be used to treat severe illnesses, like cancer, glaucoma and other serious diseases to be identified by the State Health Department.'b'In many cancer patients, marijuana can alleviate the nausea caused by chemotherapy. The drug is also potentially useful in patients suffering from multiple sclerosis, pediatric brain seizures, and AIDS, among other debilitating illnesses. It would be available in only 20 hospitals across the state.'b'Some 20 states and the District of Columbia already allow medical uses of marijuana, so New York, long a holdout, would be joining a national trend.'b'One concern about Mr. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s plan is that it may be too restrictive. Twenty hospitals, yet to be designated but scattered around this large state, may not provide sufficient access to patients who need the therapy. And the strains of marijuana that can be used may not be best for many patients.'b'A bill introduced in the Assembly by Richard Gottfried, of Manhattan, and in the Senate by Diane Savino, of Staten Island, both Democrats, would allow a wider range of organizations to grow, process and dispense medical marijuana, under monitoring by the State Health Department, for patients certified as eligible. It would also allow the use of strains specifically designed for the needs and conditions of particular patients. Mr. Cuomo ought to support this legislation.'b'The Federal Communications Commission ended a grave injustice last fall when it prohibited price-gouging by the private companies that provide interstate telephone service for prison and jail inmates. Thanks to the F.C.C. order, which takes effect next month, poor families no longer have to choose between paying for basic essentials and speaking to a relative behind bars. The commission now needs to be on the lookout for \xe2\x80\x94 and crack down on, if necessary \xe2\x80\x94 similar abuses involving newer communication technologies like person-to-person video chat, email and voice mail.'b'Research shows that inmates who keep in touch with their families have a better chance of fitting in back home once released. Before the recent ruling, a 15-minute interstate telephone call from prison could easily cost a family as much as $17. The cost was partly driven by a \xe2\x80\x9ccommission\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a legalized kickback \xe2\x80\x94 that telephone companies paid to state corrections departments. The commissions were calculated as a percentage of telephone revenue, or a fixed upfront fee, or a combination of both.'b'State prison officials and phone companies said the extra charges were necessary to pay for security screening. But this argument was discredited years ago in New York State, which has outlawed the kickback system and requires its prison phone company to provide service at the lowest possible cost to inmates and their families. Federal prisons also allow inmates to place calls cheaply to a preregistered, approved list of phone numbers.'b'The F.C.C. ruled that rates and fees may not include the \xe2\x80\x9ccommission\xe2\x80\x9d payments that providers pay to prisons. It also set a cap for interstate calls: 25 cents a minute for collect calls and 21 cents a minute for prepaid and debit calls. And it required the companies to base charges on the actual costs of providing service.'b''b'An analysis'b' provided last month to the commission by the Prison Policy Initiative, a Massachusetts research group, urged similar rules for video visitation, email, voice mail and other systems. It said that for-profit video visitation systems (allowing families and inmates to talk using, in some instances, personal computers outside the prison and video terminals inside) are being \xe2\x80\x9cdriven by the same perverse incentives that caused market failure in the correctional telephone industry.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Absent regulation, prisons and phone companies will simply use the video chats to get around the price caps on interstate calls.'b'Whatever the technology, gouging prison inmates and their families is both unfair and counterproductive, weakening family ties that could be critical to an inmate\xe2\x80\x99s adjustment to the world beyond bars.'b'The most important book I read in 2013 was Jaron Lanier\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Who Owns the Future?'b'\xe2\x80\x9d Though it was published in May, I came to it late in the year. But this turned out to be fortuitous timing. With unemployment seemingly stalled out at around 7 percent in the aftermath of the Great Recession, with the leak of thousands of National Security Agency documents making news almost daily, with the continuing stories about the erosion of privacy in the digital economy, \xe2\x80\x9cWho Owns the Future?\xe2\x80\x9d puts forth a kind of universal theory that ties all these things together. It also puts forth some provocative, unconventional ideas for ensuring that the inevitable dominance of software in every corner of society will be healthy instead of harmful.'b'Lanier has an unusual authority to criticize the digital economy: He was there, more or less, at the creation. Among (many) other things, he founded the first company to sell virtual reality products. Another of his start-ups was sold to Google. As a consultant, he has had assignments with \xe2\x80\x9cWal-Mart, Fannie Mae, major banks and hedge funds,\xe2\x80\x9d as he notes in \xe2\x80\x9cWho Owns the Future?\xe2\x80\x9d But unlike most of his fellow technologists, he eventually came to feel that the rise of digital networks was no panacea.'b'On the contrary: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I came away with from having access to these varied worlds was a realization that they were all remarkably similar,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe big players often gained benefits from digital networks to an amazing degree, but they were also constrained, even imprisoned, by the same dynamics.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Over time, the same network efficiencies that had given them their great advantages would become the instrument of their failures. In the financial services industry, it led to the financial crisis. In the case of Wal-Mart, its adoption of technology to manage its supply chain at first reaped great benefits, but over time it cost competitors and suppliers hundreds of thousands of jobs, thus \xe2\x80\x9cgradually impoverishing its own customer base,\xe2\x80\x9d as Lanier put it to me.'b'The N.S.A.? It developed computer technology that could monitor the entire world \xe2\x80\x94 and, in the process, lost control of the contractors it employed. As for Facebook, Google, Twitter, Amazon et al., well, in Lanier\xe2\x80\x99s view, it\xe2\x80\x99s only a matter of time before their advantages, too, disintegrate.'b'There are two additional components to Lanier\xe2\x80\x99s thesis. The first is that the digital economy has done as much as any single thing to hollow out the middle class. (When I asked him about the effect of globalization, he said that globalization was \xe2\x80\x9cjust one form of network efficiency.\xe2\x80\x9d See what I mean about a universal theory?) His great example here is Kodak and Instagram. At its height, writes Lanier \xe2\x80\x9cKodak employed more than 140,000 people.\xe2\x80\x9d Yes, Kodak made plenty of mistakes, but look at what is replacing it: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Instagram was sold to Facebook for a billion dollars in 2012, 'b'it employed only 13 people'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Which leads nicely to Lanier\xe2\x80\x99s final big point: that the value of these new companies comes from us. \xe2\x80\x9cInstagram isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth a billion dollars just because those 13 employees are extraordinary,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes. \xe2\x80\x9cInstead, its value comes from the millions of users who contribute to the network without being paid for it.\xe2\x80\x9d He adds, \xe2\x80\x9cNetworks need a great number of people to participate in them to generate significant value. But when they have them, only a small number of people get paid. This has the net effect of centralizing wealth and limiting overall economic growth.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus, in Lanier\xe2\x80\x99s view, is income inequality also partly a consequence of the digital economy.'b'It is Lanier\xe2\x80\x99s radical idea that 'b'people should get paid'b' whenever their information is used. He envisions a different kind of digital economy, in which creators of content \xe2\x80\x94 whether a blog post or a Facebook photograph \xe2\x80\x94 would receive micropayments whenever that content was used. A digital economy that appears to give things away for free \xe2\x80\x94 in return for being able to invade the privacy of its customers for commercial gain \xe2\x80\x94 isn\xe2\x80\x99t free at all, he argues.'b'Lanier\xe2\x80\x99s ideas raise as many questions as they answer, and he makes no pretense to having it all figured out. \xe2\x80\x9cI know some of this will turn out to be wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know which part.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Still his ideas about reformulating the economy \xe2\x80\x94 creating what he calls a \xe2\x80\x9chumanistic economy\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 offer much food for thought. Lanier wants to create a dynamic where digital networks expand the pie rather than shrink it, and rebuild the middle class instead of destroying it.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf Google and Facebook were smart,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthey would want to enrich their own customers.\xe2\x80\x9d So far, he adds, Silicon Valley has made \xe2\x80\x9cthe stupid choice\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 to grow their businesses at the expense of their own customers.'b'Lanier\xe2\x80\x99s message is that it can\xe2\x80\x99t last. And it won\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94  Nigeria is arguably the worst run of the world\xe2\x80\x99s seven most populated countries. Despite earning hundreds of billions of dollars in oil revenue over the past decade, it is expected by 2015, by some calculations, to have the second-most destitute people in the world after India. But its largest city, Lagos, which until recently was known as one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most difficult cities to govern, seems to have turned a corner.'b'Even though it remains a slum-ridden and largely impoverished metropolis, with an exploding population estimated at 21 million (of Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s 170 million people), it has seen steady improvement in its governance for over a decade. The government has enhanced public transportation, cleaned up streets, upgraded the business environment and bettered the lives of its inhabitants.'b'So Nigeria, of all places, may be pointing the way to a strategy by which fragile states might begin to succeed: Devolve more power to cities from their corrupt and overcentralized national governments. At least in democracies, the cities have promise because their elected politicians face pressure to deliver specific services to their constituents. In the central governments, which are more remote, there is too much power and wealth to be grabbed by dysfunctional politicians and their cronies, and too little direct accountability.'b'The emergence of fragile states is one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most pressing problems. Such states, which include Nigeria, Iraq and Yemen, contain a rising number of the world\xe2\x80\x99s poor (half of the world\xe2\x80\x99s people who live on less than $1.25 a day will be in fragile states by 2015, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) and contribute disproportionately to the world\xe2\x80\x99s instability and terrorism. They have become a major focus of international aid efforts, but it has proved very difficult to improve governance there.'b'The turnaround in Lagos can be traced to 1999, when Nigeria returned to democracy and the city began holding regular elections. For the first time since independence, Lagos was able to re-elect its own leaders, or turn them out of office. And while national elections became a mud fight between elites to control the state\xe2\x80\x99s enormous oil wealth, local contests forced candidates to show pragmatism and competence.'b'Citizens in densely populated cities find it easier to organize themselves. And in an ethnically and religiously diverse metropolis like Lagos, politicians could not afford to pit ethnic and religious groups against one another, a problem that has long bedeviled Nigeria. Simple geography also helped the city administration. The powerful and wealthy classes are more likely to insist on better governance when their own neighborhoods are affected.'b'And unlike national politicians, local leaders know that the better they perform, the more money their city nets. The better its roads, schools and business environment, the more likely companies will pay taxes, and individuals will buy goods and services, which also contribute to the tax base. At the national level, by contrast, the great majority of the central government\xe2\x80\x99s income has little to do with government\xe2\x80\x99s performance, since about 75 percent of the national budget comes from the $50 billion a year that Nigeria collects in oil revenue.'b'Can Lagos really save Nigeria? Alone, it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely \xe2\x80\x94 one factor is that the country\xe2\x80\x99s population is expected to continue mushrooming to 400 million by mid-century \xe2\x80\x94 but Lagos can now be the model for transferring more authority to other cities, such as Ibadan, Kano and Benin City. And they, in turn, could help to shift the polarized national politics that produce the same cadre of unaccountable elites year after year.'b'For example, if local politicians were better able to raise and regulate local taxes, they would find themselves more accountable to the population. And they would presumably establish a more welcoming local environment for business to flourish, and perhaps start a nationwide chain reaction unleashing the country\xe2\x80\x99s famous entrepreneurialism. If income levels rose, education and a rising middle class might follow. Greater affluence and aspiration, in turn, tend to act as a useful brake on population growth.'b'Elsewhere, other cities offer a similar lesson. In Medell\xc3\xadn, Colombia, the city government outshone the national government in the late 1990s by setting up a network of publicly funded business support centers, investing strategically in transportation and security, and introducing its own program of cash grants to help the poor. Cities such as Chennai and Hyderabad in India have similarly outperformed India\xe2\x80\x99s national government in promoting growth, educating children and reducing crime and poverty.'b'Can this model hold out hope for other fragile states? Countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Pakistan and Kenya all suffer from weak and dysfunctional governments, but have cities that could be the basis for a similar model of development. Regular local elections could spur significant changes in Kinshasa, Karachi and Nairobi, respectively, if the cities were granted more autonomy and the tax base was broadened to make government more dependent on local citizens and companies.'b'Almost half of the developing world\xe2\x80\x99s population now lives in cities, and rapid urbanization is expected to increase this proportion to two-thirds within a few decades, according to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. The city is now the main driver of growth and stability across Africa, the Middle East and South Asia. And the example of Lagos shows that countries can begin to work better when their cities are well governed and thriving.'b'In other words, cities can help save countries.'b''b'\n'b'Seth D.

In late December, for example, when President Vladimir Putin began to set his prisoners free, many people began asking: Is this a thaw?'b'The conclusion to that question \xe2\x80\x94 discussed over holiday dinner tables and on social networks \xe2\x80\x94 was nearly unanimous: It is not. Opinions differed only in the degree and the timing of the next big freeze.'b'This is strange, considering the formidable list of those who were granted amnesty: the former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky; two members of the punk band Pussy Riot, Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova; the 30 Greenpeace activists arrested in September during a protest against drilling in the Barents Sea; four of the young people held in detention since the May 2012 clashes between protesters and the police (the so-called Bolotnaya Case); the teacher Ilya Farber, charged with bribery; and thousands of less-known people, including minors, war veterans, pregnant women and mothers, who are now being granted amnesty.'b'The charges could have been dropped in a more consistent fashion, critics say, but the scale of the pardons is too great to dismiss. Many people, most of them held for political reasons, are free. Nothing like this had ever happened during Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s years in power. Even if his only motivation was to avoid being lectured by world leaders during the winter Olympics next month in Sochi, the December amnesties may prove highly significant, sending a message of moderation to the police, prosecutors and judges.'b'But whether the massive flood of amnesties amounts to a sea change is still in doubt. Everyone understands that the pardons were a one-off event, not a systemic reform. The freeing of high-profile prisoners matters little by itself. The fact that the legal system has been getting consistently tougher despite the release of some prominent prisoners does not leave me with much optimism, at least for the near future.'b'As president, Dmitri Medvedev, now prime minister, took steps to humanize the criminal code, but those efforts have been largely reversed. Legislative changes over the past year have granted greater power to law enforcement structures, not reformed them. Huge fines are now levied for illegal street protests, libel \xe2\x80\x94 decriminalized under Mr. Medvedev\xe2\x80\x99s presidency \xe2\x80\x94 is once again a criminal offense, and the government has banned so-called gay propaganda.'b'The police and the Investigative Committee \xe2\x80\x94 the main investigative authority in Russia \xe2\x80\x94 remain systemically corrupt, the courts are not independent of the Kremlin, and the penitentiary system remains a Stalinist institution.'b'Before Mr. Medvedev\xe2\x80\x99s reforms, law enforcement agencies used their power to put pressure on entrepreneurs, extracting bribes and taking stakes in business ventures. Under President Medvedev, the authority to open criminal cases for tax evasion was taken away from the Investigative Committee and given to the more professional Federal Taxation Service. President Putin give it back to the committee.'b'Despite these reversals, there remains in Russia an important minority that may yet prove a barometer for systemic change. This minority, impossible to define in ethnic, religious or demographic terms, is beyond Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s influence. It is an amorphous group of professional people, middle class workers, small business owners, intellectuals, artists, writers and assorted bohemians.'b'Yuri Pivovarov, a historian of Russia, has a term for those who have not been ground down by the regime. They are Russia\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cspare individuals,\xe2\x80\x9d neither part of the power mechanism, nor of the unquestioning population. Their one common feature is that they are independent of the sources of income controlled by the government.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s easier to say what this group does not do than what it does. Its identity lies in the fact that it does not accept the regime\xe2\x80\x99s rules. Mr. Khodorkovsky said in a recent interview that Mr. Putin aspires to be the Deng Xiaoping of Russian politics \xe2\x80\x94 the wise arbiter between actors and groups. \xe2\x80\x9cBut once he realized that there was a part of the Russian society that did not accept his refereeing,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Khodorkovsky said, \xe2\x80\x9che simply factored that part out of his political scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Putin and his associates realized that they could not win the big cities. So they tried to demonstrate that they could afford to discard their critics as politically negligible. They began to emphasize the \xe2\x80\x9croot\xe2\x80\x9d of the Russian people, those living outside major urban centers, as their power base. In practical terms, that meant leaving out Moscow, St. Petersburg and other big cities. After all what is Moscow? In the words of Sergei Ivanov, Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s chief of staff, \xe2\x80\x9cit consists of street cleaners, car drivers, office plankton, journalists and bloggers who don\xe2\x80\x99t produce anything.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Derided and dismissed by officials, this minority of \xe2\x80\x9cspare individuals\xe2\x80\x9d is in fact of great political importance. True, they cannot unite, but that is only natural: These people are independent and different, they are not supposed to be united. Although they are not represented by any political party, the fact remains that most of the Kremlin\xe2\x80\x99s policies \xe2\x80\x94 alternatively toughening and relaxing the system \xe2\x80\x94 have been in response to their actions.'b'In 2011, angry \xe2\x80\x9ccubicle dwellers\xe2\x80\x9d poured into the streets, refusing to accept the official results of parliamentary elections widely believed to have been rigged. In 2012, the Kremlin had to end the practice of appointing regional governors and restore gubernatorial elections, and also relaxed the rules for the registration of political parties. The following year, it even allowed an election that seemed reasonably fair \xe2\x80\x94 the Moscow mayoral race.'b'A few days ago, Mr. Putin eased a ban on public protest in Sochi, the venue of the Olympic Games. Apparently, now that most of the celebrity prisoners are free, the Kremlin no longer sees reasons why anyone would protest. The issue has been addressed, not in a systemic fashion, but it has been addressed. The independent minority has been the ultimate cause.'b'The word for \xe2\x80\x9cspare\xe2\x80\x9d in Russian (lishniy) also can be translated as superfluous, excessive, odd or unneeded. But in fact, \xe2\x80\x9cspare individuals\xe2\x80\x9d are none of these things \xe2\x80\x94 they are indispensable: When they act, the Kremlin reacts. They raise an issue, the Kremlin responds, and amid the game of alternate thaw and freeze, one can recognize a warming trend. Will this work forever? It is hard to say.

'b''b'On Dec. 17, the European Union drafted important legislation to cut hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, by 79 percent by 2030. This is the most concrete move yet to rein in HFCs, which are potent greenhouse gases used in refrigerators and air-conditioners. In June, the United States and China reached an agreement to reduce these gases, and in September leaders of the Group of 20 nations pledged to do their share. With Europe\xe2\x80\x99s move, the goal of a global agreement on the gases is closer than ever.'b'Global support has been growing for tackling HFCs through the Montreal Protocol \xe2\x80\x94 which phased out chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, that were destroying the ozone layer \xe2\x80\x94 rather than through the broader and more cumbersome United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. While HFCs, developed to replace CFCs in refrigeration and air-conditioning, do not harm the ozone layer, they are fast becoming a significant contributor to global warming.'b'The United Nations Environment Program projects that HFCs, only 1 percent of greenhouse gases today, will make up 20 percent by 2030 if nothing is done. Eliminating HFCs would be the equivalent of taking 100 billion tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. HFCs have higher global warming potential than carbon dioxide, but they disappear from the atmosphere much more quickly. Global negotiations on limiting more persistent greenhouse gases must continue, but eliminating HFCs will help.'b'New technologies exist to replace HFCs. The European legislation proposes phasing out consumer refrigerators using HFCs in 2015 and imposing additional bans on a range of commercial refrigeration and air-conditioning products that use the most potent HFCs in 2020 and 2022.'b'With this breakthrough in Europe, India, one of the fastest-growing markets for coolants, is now the last big holdout on reduction of HFCs. Despite joining the G-20 pledge, India has reiterated its opposition to tackling HFCs through the Montreal Protocol. The United States and India should continue bilateral talks to address concerns about costs so that India can join the international effort. The European Union should move quickly now to pass into law the draft legislation to give industry a clear timeline to begin the necessary transition.'b'Most Asian nations have been expanding their military budgets and capabilities in recent years. Now there is a new rush by Southeast Asian countries to acquire submarines because they have the money to pay for them.'b'On Jan. 1, Vietnam received its first of six Russian Kilo-class submarines.

Thailand plans to include the purchase of submarines in its soon-to-be-announced 10 -year armed forces development proposal. Thai officers are already enrolled at submarine training schools in Germany and South Korea, two potential submarine suppliers.'b'Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia have submarine fleets and plan to procure more. Malaysia paid a Franco-Spanish consortium $1.1 billion for two submarines in 2007 and 2009. Indonesia expects to replace its two aging submarines and expand its fleet to 12 with submarines from South Korea and possibly Russia by 2020. Only the Philippines, among the big nations, has not acquired new submarines yet.'b'These countries are not arming against each other. The arms expansion is a reaction to increasing uncertainty about the distribution of power in the region, caused largely by the extension of Chinese naval power into the South China Sea and Indian Ocean. But Chinese naval expansion is not likely to be halted by these submarine fleets. China will simply augment its anti-submarine capability. Each expansion only adds to regional suspicion and tension.'b'It is not at all clear that China would be more restrained with its aggressive claim if these nations possessed more military power. Japan\xe2\x80\x99s substantial military power, including an advanced submarine fleet, has not stopped China from acting on its territorial claim against Japan in the East China Sea. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations needs to act collectively to negotiate with China to prevent further destabilization, instead of each country dealing separately with China.'b'Much of this arms competition is propelled by growing wealth in Southeast Asia, which is tied to the 21st-century global economy.

On Sept. 9, the Supreme People\xe2\x80\x99s Court and Supreme People\xe2\x80\x99s Procuratorate issued a ruling stipulating that defamatory reports, if reposted more than 500 times on the Internet, are a crime worthy of punishment.'b'A few days later, Yang Hui, a 16-year-old boy in Gansu Province in the northwest, became one of the first to fall afoul of this new rule. After challenging online the official explanation for a local man\xe2\x80\x99s death, he was detained for seven days on charges of stirring up trouble. Only after an outcry, mostly online, was he freed.'b'In fact, the crackdown began in August, before the ruling was even issued. According to local media reports from across the country, hundreds of bloggers may have been arrested and taken into custody. Some were given \xe2\x80\x9ceducational warnings\xe2\x80\x9d; some were jailed. It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to get exact numbers.'b'The policy of cracking down first and only later providing a legal justification seems not to have been questioned on the Internet, because the government has continued to delete posts, gag speech and shut down microblog accounts, making it impossible for critics to protest online.'b'The government campaign came to light on Aug. 21, when one story dominated the web: The Beijing police had closed down an \xe2\x80\x9cInternet rumor company\xe2\x80\x9d and seized someone with the alias Qin Huohuo and five others.'b'The official media, in coordination with the Beijing police, reported in detail on Mr. Qin\xe2\x80\x99s many misdeeds. Prior to this I knew nothing about him, and after reading part of his microblog, it seemed to me that some of his posts were indeed just unsubstantiated rumors.'b'Even so, there were lots of people online who spoke up in his defense, finding weak spots in the official media\xe2\x80\x99s accusations. One of Mr. Qin\xe2\x80\x99s alleged crimes, for example, was that he disparaged Lei Feng \xe2\x80\x94 the young soldier exalted by Mao and his propagandists as an icon of patriotism and self-sacrifice \xe2\x80\x94 claiming in a post that Mr. Lei actually hankered after a life of luxury: \xe2\x80\x9cThe high-end apparel that Lei Feng bought for himself in 1959 \xe2\x80\x94 leather jacket, woolen pants, leather shoes \xe2\x80\x94 would have cost about 90 yuan at the time, but his pay was only 6 yuan a month.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some Internet commentators pointed out that at the end of 2012 the official Xinhua website had already reported Mr. Lei\xe2\x80\x99s purchase of a watch and a leather jacket, and they asked sarcastically why the police weren\xe2\x80\x99t taking Xinhua into custody.'b'Given all the online support for Mr. Qin, and for other well-known bloggers who have been shut down, I am doubtful that the government\xe2\x80\x99s use of punitive measures will achieve its goals.'b'Chinese people of my generation that grew up during the Mao era have long been accustomed to government mendacity: from the Great Leap Forward\xe2\x80\x99s grossly inflated claims about rice production to the recent fib about Mr. Wang\xe2\x80\x99s sick leave. The difference is that before the Internet and microblogs, popular rumors spread mouth to mouth, with very limited circulation, and official fairy tales enjoyed a virtual monopoly. But once the Internet and, more particularly, microblogs came onto the scene, the social reach of rumors soon eclipsed that of official media \xe2\x80\x94 and official mythmaking\xe2\x80\x99s monopoly was broken. That left the government to clamp down not on real violations but on what it labeled as Internet rumors.'b'The best way of putting an end to Internet rumors is for the government to stop disseminating lies. But the government will never do that, and so Internet rumors will continue to sprout and spread \xe2\x80\x94 even after the crackdown.'b''b'\n'b'Yu Hua 'b' is the author of \xe2\x80\x9cTo Live,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cChina in Ten Words\xe2\x80\x9d and other books.

But those benefit checks are still a long way from getting into the mailboxes of the people who desperately need them, thanks to the callousness of Republican lawmakers in both the House and Senate.'b'Six Republicans joined 54 Democrats in the Senate vote, the minimum needed to keep alive the bill, which would reinstate for three months benefits that expired in late December. But some of the six said they would not help push the bill past the next filibuster vote, needed to end debate, unless some other program is cut to offset the $6.5 billion cost. House leaders are also insisting that the benefits be \xe2\x80\x9cpaid for\xe2\x80\x9d with other cuts, though they won\xe2\x80\x99t consider reducing tax loopholes for the rich as an offset. The demand for a \xe2\x80\x9cpay for\xe2\x80\x9d is just another way of saying that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t serious about helping those in need.'b'Long-term jobless benefits have been routinely approved since the 1970s without offsets, except for a handful of times when they were included in larger budget packages. The Tea Party obsession with reducing the deficit, even when it is already falling sharply, is preventing Republicans from quick agreement on an extension, along with a contemptuous belief that unemployed people prefer the benefits over looking for a job.'b'The party\xe2\x80\x99s reputation for hardheartedness is embarrassing a few prominent Republicans who try to pretend they are interested in the less fortunate. Paul Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, for example, wants to \xe2\x80\x9creform\xe2\x80\x9d the social safety net. Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, wants to expand school vouchers. These are ideological goals meant to camouflage opposition to the important (and popular) anti-inequality agenda of the Democrats. But their insistence on cutting food stamps, refusal to expand Medicaid and hostility to jobless benefits and a higher minimum wage show they don\xe2\x80\x99t really care about people falling from the middle to the bottom.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Banished for Questioning the Gospel of Guns'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 5):'b'I read Dick Metcalf\xe2\x80\x99s column, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s Talk Limits,\xe2\x80\x9d in Guns &amp; Ammo magazine and found nothing to cause the extreme overreaction that has come his way.'b'A more constructive response would have been a well-reasoned rebuttal, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the whole point here.

Cheerios is G.M.O.-free! And will soon be labeled \xe2\x80\x9cNot Made With Genetically Modified Ingredients.\xe2\x80\x9d"b'Do we care? Should we? Is this a cynical marketing ploy or a huge deal or both? (It certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t neither.)'b'Without question this could be the start of something big. That it has value to Cheerios and to 'b'anti-G.M.O. activists'b' is also undoubtedly true; the question is whether it matters to the rest of us. It does; but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.'b"First, let\xe2\x80\x99s get this straight. Taking the G.M.O.'s out of Cheerios is only a little bit harder than taking them out of oatmeal: "b'there are no G.M.O. oats'b', and Cheerios are, essentially, oats. (Well, hyper-processed oats.) They also contain small amounts of cornstarch and sugar, so its parent company, General Mills, has done little more than source non-G.M.O. cornstarch and cane rather than beet sugar to use in production. (There are G.M.O. beets, and almost all corn and soybeans grown in the United States use G.M.O. seeds, whose products find their way into most processed foods.) This is what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done for years 'b'in most of Europe'b", where products with G.M.O.'s are almost universally labeled as such."b"But it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if General Mills \xe2\x80\x94 which was among the funders of the opposition to G.M.O.-labeling efforts in California and Washington \xe2\x80\x94 has made a principled decision, or has suddenly seen some kind of light. (Other varieties of Cheerios, such as Apple Cinnamon and Multi Grain, will continue to be made with ingredients containing G.M.O.'s, including corn, corn syrup, beet sugar and others.) It could simply be that the company saw an opportunity to appease part of its market, and to test whether a minimal effort could lead to a labeling opportunity that would boost sales as would, say, a \xe2\x80\x9chigh-fiber\xe2\x80\x9d or cholesterol-reduction notice."b'But the label is only meaningless in terms of Cheerios\xe2\x80\x99 content. My guess is that General Mills is right: the G.M.O.-free label will appeal to consumers who, for whatever reasons \xe2\x80\x94 justified or not \xe2\x80\x94 would rather buy a G.M.O.-free product. Increased sales might come at the expense of other Cheerios products, but then again they might come at the expense of competitors\xe2\x80\x99 cereals that can\xe2\x80\x99t brag about their \xe2\x80\x9cpurity.\xe2\x80\x9d (Let\xe2\x80\x99s remember that few, if any, health-savvy breakfast-eating people would make Cheerios a frequent choice in any case\xe2\x80\x94 even if they are easy for toddlers to nibble on.)'b'All of this makes the announcement significant, because if it works, others will follow suit. And farmers could easily make the switch back to non-G.M.O. seeds (more are beginning to, as the benefits of G.M.O. seeds are increasingly outweighed by their costs), and processed food companies are \xe2\x80\x94 or at least should be \xe2\x80\x94 agnostic as to whether corn, for example, was grown with conventional or G.M.O. seeds.'b"Should we care? Yes. Much of the controversy over G.M.O.'s is being fought between those with a vested interest in their success and those who are willing to overstate the problems with the technology. Producing seeds containing G.M.O.'s is a valid scientific technique. The problem is that the benefits have accrued more to the seeds\xe2\x80\x99 producers than to farmers (who are spending many times more for seeds than they were previously) or consumers (who can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly tell the source of refined products in their processed foods) or to the environment. There\xe2\x80\x99s an argument that G.M.O. seeds increase yields and keep food costs down, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not a convincing one."b'There are three real issues here, and none of them is about whether there are teeny tiny G.M.O. ingredients in our food. One is that G.M.O. seeds have arguably done more harm than good, by making traditional farming 'b'more expensive for farmers'b" \xe2\x80\x94 not only here but internationally \xe2\x80\x94 and by retarding progress in combating weeds and bugs ecologically in industrial farming. Still, eliminating G.M.O.'s would not do much to remedy what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with industrial agriculture; that\xe2\x80\x99s going to require a hard look at crop rotation, chemical applications and monoculture in general."b'Another issue, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve written about this before, is transparency. Increasingly, people want to know how and with what their food is being produced. ('b'Over 90 percent of Americans'b" are in favor of G.M.O. labeling.) Some of this may be for the wrong reason \xe2\x80\x94 fear of eating foods produced with G.M.O. seeds. (About half the population believes G.M.O.'s to be unsafe.) But the argument for labeling and transparency goes way beyond G.M.O.'s, and any labeling that provides more information should be seen as a victory for people who care about food quality."b'This brings us to the third issue, one about which I\xe2\x80\x99m not happy. If opportunistic marketers like those at General Mills can cash in by making insignificant changes in their products that lead to significant marketing benefits, what happens to people who\xe2\x80\x99ve actually put work into making their products significantly cleaner \xe2\x80\x94 that is, organic? Once you have an \xe2\x80\x9corganic\xe2\x80\x9d label, you are forbidden to put \xe2\x80\x9cNot Made With Genetically Modified Ingredients\xe2\x80\x9d on your package \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s theoretically understood, as are more important benefits, like antibiotic- and pesticide-free. But thanks to the way-too-loud G.M.O. screaming match, my guess is that it\xe2\x80\x99s easier to market food using a meaningless \xe2\x80\x9cG.M.O.-free\xe2\x80\x9d label than an organic label. That\xe2\x80\x99s not a cheery thought.'b'KANSAS, like every state, explicitly guarantees a free public education in its Constitution, affirming America\xe2\x80\x99s founding belief that only an educated citizenry can preserve democracy and safeguard individual liberty and freedom.'b'And yet in recent years Kansas has become the epicenter of a new battle over the states\xe2\x80\x99 obligation to adequately fund public education. Even though the state Constitution requires that it make \xe2\x80\x9csuitable provision\xe2\x80\x9d for financing public education, Gov. Sam Brownback and the Republican-led Legislature have made draconian cuts in school spending, leading to a 'b'lawsuit'b' that now sits before the state Supreme Court.'b'The outcome of that decision could resonate nationwide. Forty-five states have had lawsuits 'b'challenging the failure'b' of governors and legislators to provide essential resources for a constitutional education. Litigation is pending against 11 states that allegedly provide inadequate and unfair school funding, including New York, Florida, Texas and California.'b'Many of these lawsuits successfully forced elected officials to increase school funding overall and to deliver more resources to poor students and those with special needs. If the Kansas Supreme Court rules otherwise, students in those states may begin to see the tide of education cuts return.'b'Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 current constitutional crisis has its genesis in a series of cuts to school funding that began in 2009. The cuts were accelerated by a $1.1 billion tax break, which benefited mostly upper-income Kansans, proposed by Governor Brownback and enacted in 2012.'b'Overall, the Legislature 'b'slashed public education funding'b' to 16.5 percent below the 2008 level, triggering significant program reductions in schools across the state. Class sizes have increased, teachers and staff members have been laid off, and essential services for at-risk students were eliminated, even as the state implemented higher academic standards for college and career readiness.'b'Parents filed a lawsuit in the Kansas courts to challenge the cuts. In 'b'Gannon v. State of Kansas'b', a three-judge trial court ruled in January 2013 for the parents, finding that the cuts reduced per-pupil expenditures far below a level \xe2\x80\x9csuitable\xe2\x80\x9d to educate all children under Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 standards.'b'The judges also found that the Legislature was not meeting even the basic funding amounts set in its own education cost studies. The judges called the school funding cut \xe2\x80\x9cdestructive of our children\xe2\x80\x99s future.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To remedy the funding shortfall, the judges ordered that per-pupil expenditures be increased to $4,492 from $3,838, the level previously established as suitable.'b'Rather than comply, Governor Brownback appealed to the Kansas Supreme Court. A decision is expected this month.'b'A victory for the parents would be heartening, but if it comes, would Governor Brownback and legislative leaders uphold the right to education guaranteed to Kansas school children?'b'The signals thus far are not promising. If the Kansas Supreme Court orders restoration of the funding, legislators are threatening to amend the state\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution by removing the requirement for \xe2\x80\x9csuitable\xe2\x80\x9d school funding and to strip Kansas courts of jurisdiction to hear school finance cases altogether. And if the amendment fails, they have vowed to defy any court order for increased funding or, at the very least, take the money from higher education.'b'A court-stripping constitutional amendment, and defiance of a state Supreme Court order, would shred the very fabric of Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 government and send shock waves through state capitals across the nation. It would allow elected branches to avoid any responsibility to adhere to the language and interpretation of their state constitutions by the courts. It would gravely undermine judicial independence and shut the courthouse door to vulnerable children who, as a last resort, seek legal redress to vindicate their fundamental right to an education.'b'As the Gannon trial judges noted, matters such as education are placed in constitutions because they are \xe2\x80\x9cintended for permanence\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cto protect them from the vagaries of politics.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Kansans rightfully take pride in their strong public school system. But as Kansas goes, so may go the nation. The Kansas Constitution, like those in other states, demands that every child be given the educational opportunity to meet his or her promise. This requires, at a minimum, adequate and suitable school funding. Governor Brownback and legislators must meet the constitutional command and, by so doing, advance the core American value of equal opportunity for all.'b'When President Obama took office in 2009, he promised an \xe2\x80\x9cunprecedented level of openness in government.\xe2\x80\x9d In a 'b'memo'b' issued the day after his inauguration, he wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cThe government should not keep information confidential merely because public officials might be embarrassed by disclosure, because errors and failures might be revealed, or because of speculative or abstract fears.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the latest reminder that the Obama administration has failed to live up to that promise, the Justice Department last week 'b'won its fight'b' to keep secret a memo that outlines the supposed legal authority for the Federal Bureau of Investigation to collect Americans\xe2\x80\x99 telephone and financial records without a subpoena or court order.'b'The memo, issued in 2010 by the department\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Legal Counsel, approved of the bureau\xe2\x80\x99s use of what are known as exigent letters to obtain phone records without any legal process, and in the absence of any emergency. From 2003 to 2006, the bureau 'b'used these letters'b' to obtain phone records for 'b'more than 3,500 accounts'b'.'b'Last Friday, a unanimous panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit 'b'ruled'b' that the memo could be kept secret from the public because it was the product of internal agency deliberations and had not been formally adopted as department policy. (The F.B.I. has said it no longer uses exigent letters.)'b'Withholding the opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel, which provides legal advice to the president and executive agencies, is deeply troubling. The office\xe2\x80\x99s advice often serves as the final word on what the executive branch may legally do, and those who follow that advice are virtually assured that they will not face prosecution.'b'During the administration of George W. Bush, the opinions of the office gave 'b'legal cover'b' to officials who wanted to torture prisoners for terror-related intelligence and 'b'approved'b' the 'b'warrantless wiretapping'b' program that operated for years before being 'b'exposed'b' by The New York Times. Many other opinions remain hidden under the specious claim that they are only working drafts, not adopted policies, and that if officials must worry about operating \xe2\x80\x9cin a fishbowl,\xe2\x80\x9d they will avoid seeking legal advice altogether. This rationale is largely a pretext for putting an ever-expanding shroud over almost any controversial, and potentially illegal, government action.'b'In 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. 'b'said'b', \xe2\x80\x9can agency should not withhold information simply because it may do so legally.\xe2\x80\x9d Those were encouraging words, but Mr. Holder\xe2\x80\x99s Justice Department fought the release of the memo. If the Obama administration continues to resist more transparency, Congress can amend the open-records law to require greater disclosure of the office\xe2\x80\x99s opinions.'b'Edward Snowden\xe2\x80\x99s unauthorized disclosures of secret mass surveillance programs have forever changed the public discussion about the relationship between national security and the protection of privacy and civil liberties. That debate is meaningful only if it is open. The public should not be left in the dark about the legal justifications for the most significant actions of its government.'b'Every day the headlines from the Arab world get worse: An Al Qaeda affiliate group, aided by foreign fighters, battles with seven different homegrown Syrian rebel groups for control of the region around Aleppo, Syria. The Iranian Embassy in Beirut is bombed. Mohamad Chatah, an enormously decent former Lebanese finance minister, is blown up after criticizing Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s brutish tactics. Another pro-Al Qaeda group takes control of Fallujah, Iraq. Explosions rock Egypt, where the army is now jailing Islamists and secular activists. Libya is a mess of competing militias.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s going on? Some say it\xe2\x80\x99s all because of the \xe2\x80\x9cpower vacuum\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 America has absented itself from the region. But this is not just about us. There\xe2\x80\x99s also a huge \xe2\x80\x9cvalues vacuum.\xe2\x80\x9d The Middle East is a highly pluralistic region \xe2\x80\x94 Shiites, Sunnis, Kurds, Christians, Druze and various tribes \xe2\x80\x94 that for centuries was held together from above by iron-fisted colonial powers, kings and dictators. But now that vertical control has broken down, before this pluralistic region has developed any true bottom-up pluralism \xe2\x80\x94 a broad ethic of tolerance \xe2\x80\x94 that might enable its people to live together as equal citizens, without an iron fist from above.'b'For the Arab awakening to have any future, the ideology that is most needed now is the one being promoted least: Pluralism. Until that changes, argues Marwan Muasher, in his extremely relevant new book \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cThe Second Arab Awakening and the Battle for Pluralism\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 none of the Arab uprisings will succeed.'b'Again, President Obama could have done more to restrain leaders in Iraq, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran or Syria from going to extremes. But, ultimately, argues Muasher, this is the Arabs\xe2\x80\x99 fight for their political future. If 500,000 American troops in Iraq, and $1 trillion, could not implant lasting pluralism in the cultural soil there, no outsider can, said Muasher. There also has to be a will from within. Why is it that some 15,000 Arabs and Muslims have flocked to Syria to fight and die for jihadism and zero have flocked to Syria to fight and die for pluralism? Is it only because we didn\xe2\x80\x99t give the \xe2\x80\x9cgood guys\xe2\x80\x9d big enough guns?'b'As Muasher, a former Jordanian foreign minister and now a vice president at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, put it in an interview: \xe2\x80\x9cThree years of the Arab uprising have shown the bankruptcy of all the old political forces in the Arab world.\xe2\x80\x9d The corrupt secular autocrats who failed to give their young people the tools to thrive \xe2\x80\x94 and, as a result, triggered these uprisings \xe2\x80\x94 are still locked in a struggle with Islamists, who also have no clue how to deliver jobs, services, security and economic growth. (Tunisia may be an exception.) \xe2\x80\x9cAs long as we\xe2\x80\x99re in the this zero-sum game, the sum will be zero,\xe2\x80\x9d says Muasher.\xc2\xa0'b'No sustainable progress will be possible, argues Muasher, without the ethic of pluralism permeating all aspects of Arab society \xe2\x80\x94 pluralism of thought, pluralism in gender opportunities, pluralism in respect to other religions, pluralism in education, pluralism toward minorities, pluralism of political parties rotating in power and pluralism in the sense of everyone\xe2\x80\x99s right to think differently from the collective.'b'The first Arab awakening in the 20th century was a fight for independence from colonial powers, says Muasher. It never continued as a fight for democracy and pluralism. That war of ideas, he insists, is what \xe2\x80\x9cthe second Arab awakening\xe2\x80\x9d has to be about. Neither the autocrats nor the Islamists can deliver progress. \xe2\x80\x9cPluralism is the operating system we need to solve all our problems, and as long as that operating system is not in place, we will not get there. This is an internal battle. Let\xe2\x80\x99s stop hoping for delivery from the outside.\xe2\x80\x9d This will take time.'b'Na\xc3\xafve? No. Na\xc3\xafve is thinking that everything is about the absence or presence of American power, and that the people of the region have no agency. That\xe2\x80\x99s wrong: Iraq is splintering because Prime Minister Maliki behaved like a Shiite militiaman, not an Iraqi Mandela. Arab youths took their future in their own hands, motivated largely by pluralistic impulses. But the old order proved to be too stubborn, yet these youth aspirations have not gone away, and will not.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Arab world will go through a period of turmoil in which exclusionist forces will attempt to dominate the landscape with absolute truths and new dictatorships,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Muasher. But \xe2\x80\x9cthese forces will also fade, because, in the end, the exclusionist, authoritarian discourses cannot answer the people\xe2\x80\x99s needs for better quality of life. ...\xc2\xa0 As history has demonstrated overwhelmingly, where there is respect for diversity, there is prosperity. Contrary to what Arab societies have been taught for decades by their governments to believe \xe2\x80\x94 that tolerance, acceptance of different points of view, and critical thinking are destructive to national unity and economic growth \xe2\x80\x94 experience proves that societies cannot keep renewing themselves and thereby thrive except through diversity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Muasher, who is returning to Jordan to participate in this struggle for diversity, dedicated his book to: \xe2\x80\x9cThe youth of the Arab World \xe2\x80\x94 who revolted, not against their parents, but on their behalf.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'China\xe2\x80\x99s top officials appear to be moving to address the risks posed by a fast-growing-but-shadowy part of the country\xe2\x80\x99s financial system. The Chinese cabinet is seeking to increase government oversight of lending by companies that currently face little or no supervision, according to 'b'news reports'b' based on an official document that was written last month.'b'Economists have long worried about China\xe2\x80\x99s so-called 'b'shadow banking system'b', in which banks and finance companies loan money to businesses and local governments at high interest rates outside the regulated financial system. Analysts worry that unregulated lenders, which themselves borrow money from regulated banks, have made too many dubious loans that could default and set off a broader financial crisis. In 'b'recent months'b', interest rates in China have surged from time to time in part because of the links between the unregulated and regulated parts of the financial system.'b'The shadow system has grown in recent years because the Chinese government has too tightly controlled traditional banking. It keeps the interest rates that conventional banks pay to depositors extremely low and gives out cheap loans to state-owned enterprises and favored companies that might not be able to repay the money.'b'The low rates, of course, have led savers to invest money in speculative real estate projects or dubious investments known as wealth management products offered by banks and finance companies that promise higher rates of return. Much of that money is then lent to private businesses and local governments, which cannot get conventional bank loans because regulated banks are required to give preferences to state-owned companies.'b'Chinese officials have to tread carefully in changing this system. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences estimates that the size of the shadow sector is equal to 40 percent of the country\xe2\x80\x99s gross domestic product. If the government cracks down on shadow banking too hard and too quickly, it could cause a panic. If it does not move forcefully enough to curb unregulated lending, bad debts will proliferate and become harder to resolve later on.'b'That dilemma helps explain why the cabinet, which is known as the State Council, reportedly described shadow banking as \xe2\x80\x9cbeneficial\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinevitable\xe2\x80\x9d in the document telling financial regulators to increase their oversight of unregulated lending.'b'It will take regulators years to reform the Chinese banking system and put it on more stable footing. Their success will be determined in large part by the willingness of the country\xe2\x80\x99s top leaders to end the flawed policies that encouraged the growth of the shadow banking system in the first place.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s going on with John Boehner, the speaker of the House?'b'On Dec. 12, Boehner 'b'broke with hard-line conservative groups'b', accusing them of \xe2\x80\x9cmisleading their followers\xe2\x80\x9d and charging that \xe2\x80\x9cthey have lost all credibility." It was evident from 'b'the context'b' that Boehner was referring to right-wing powerhouses like Freedom Works, Heritage Action and the Club for Growth.'b'At a news conference a week earlier, on Dec. 5,  'b'Boehner declared 'b'that if the president \xe2\x80\x9chas a plan for extending unemployment benefits I\xe2\x80\x99d truly entertain taking a look at it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'More strikingly, Boehner has signaled that he now supports incremental immigration reform. He recently hired 'b'Rebecca Tallent'b', a former chief of staff for Senator John McCain, a strong backer of immigration reform, and he has encouraged aides to tell reporters that he is prepared to challenge the anti-immigration wing of his party.'b'There are several theories about Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s unexpected turn.'b'One explanation sees Boehner and centrist Republicans generally backing away from some of their more controversial stands in preparation for the 2014 election. Steve Rosenthal, the political director of the AFL-CIO from 1995 to 2002 and now president of the Organizing Group, a Democratic political consulting firm, noted in an email exchange:'b'Boehner, who has primary responsibility for retaining the Republican majority in the House, is less cowed by the Tea Party forces both within his caucus and out in the states. 'b'David Brady'b', a political scientist at Stanford and deputy director of the Hoover Institution, said in an email: \xe2\x80\x9cTea Party threats to run their candidates against incumbents voting against them have lost credibility.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In close contests, the long-term unemployed, along with their families and their friends, have the power to determine the outcome in those 2014 elections in which a percentage point gained or lost can be decisive. On Dec. 28 Congress allowed unemployment benefits to expire for an estimated 1.3 million out of work men and women. A vote against restoring the benefits would create \xe2\x80\x9ca political vulnerability,\xe2\x80\x9d said John Feehery, a public relations executive who was once a top aide to Dennis Hastert, the former House speaker. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of those folks on unemployment are swing voters. They dislike Obama but will vote their economic interests if they have to.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory, agreed:'b'Public Policy Polling, a Democratic firm, 'b'surveyed'b' voters in four competitive congressional districts currently held by Republican, as well as in Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s own district. The results showed that strong majorities back extension of unemployment benefits. Support for restoring benefits ranged from 63 to 68 percent in the five districts; Republicans approved of the idea by a 53.4-41.6 margin. The survey was informative, even though it was designed to poke a stick in Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s eye.'b'There is another clear reason for Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s shift towards the center: the economy has begun to improve. In 'b'Ben Bernanke\xe2\x80\x99s words'b', \xe2\x80\x9cThe combination of financial healing, greater balance in the housing market, less fiscal restraint, and, of course, continued monetary policy accommodation bodes well for U.S. economic growth in coming quarters.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Why would an improving economy encourage John Boehner to be more receptive to extended unemployment benefits and liberalized immigration policies \xe2\x80\x93 and courageous enough to stiff-arm his party\xe2\x80\x99s right wing?'b'To answer that question requires a look at how favorable and unfavorable trends in the economy influence the political views of the electorate.'b'In 'b'recent columns'b', I have reported on studies demonstrating that conservatism often gains strength in downturns and that hard times tend to 'b'push the electorate to the right'b'.'b'There are those who dispute these trends, citing the sharp turn to the left during the 1930s. 'b'Steven Pinker'b', a professor of psychology at Harvard, wrote in response to my question about political responses to adversity:'b'It is, however, one of the ironies of political economy that support for the liberal agenda declines just when the needs of the needy are strongest. Conversely, when the economy begins to expand and the spending cuts sought by conservatives would be least painful, support for conservative belt-tightening drops.'b'One of the best explanations of this phenomenon was published two decades ago. The 'b'paper'b' focused on the differing responses of the right and left to scarcity and plenty, and was written by Linda J. Skitka, a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois-Chicago, and Philip E. Tetlock, a professor of psychology and management at the University of Pennsylvania.'b'Skitka and Tetlock conducted a survey assessing how liberals and conservatives would allocate three resources; azidothymidine (AZT) for AIDS patients; organs for would-be transplant recipients; and low-income housing for the poor \xe2\x80\x93 under conditions of plenty (\xe2\x80\x9cno scarcity\xe2\x80\x9d), low scarcity and high scarcity.'b'When participants in the experiments were told that resources were very scarce, liberals became less generous and began to make the same judgments as conservatives. Both left and right \xe2\x80\x9cdenied assistance to people they deemed personally responsible for their plight.\xe2\x80\x9d In other words, scarcity and a lack of resources made participants more conservative in their outlook.'b'But when participants were told there was \xe2\x80\x9cno scarcity,\xe2\x80\x9d liberals awarded benefits to everyone, and only conservatives made a distinction between giving to the \xe2\x80\x9cdeserving\xe2\x80\x9d and withholding from the \xe2\x80\x9cundeserving.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Skitka-Tetlock findings \xe2\x80\x93 and there are a number of other 'b'studies'b' and 'b'surveys'b' that 'b'confirm'b' the results \xe2\x80\x94 suggest that in the context of the improving economy, legislation extending unemployment benefits will pass the House with Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s support and the votes of a substantial number of Republicans.'b'President Obama knows he has Boehner and the Republican House on the defensive.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cJust a few days after Christmas, more than one million of our fellow Americans lost a vital economic lifeline \xe2\x80\x93 the temporary insurance that helps folks make ends meet while they look for a job,\xe2\x80\x9d Obama declared in his weekly radio address on Jan. 4.'b'Hitting every note in the compassion playbook, the president said:'b'On Tuesday the Senate voted, with the support of six Republicans, to reject a filibuster and take up legislation that would extend long-term unemployment benefits for three months. A major sticking point remains: whether the legislation will be paid for by new revenues or by separate spending cuts as demanded by many Republicans.'b'John Boehner can read tea leaves as well as anyone, and he knows that in order to protect his members who are running in battleground districts, he cannot afford to let the compassion gap get too wide. The Tea Party is the loser in this calculus and the long-term unemployed are likely to be the winners.'b'TODAY, the anniversary of the shooting in Tucson that put a bullet through my head and killed six of my constituents, is when I make my annual resolutions.'b'Many may look at me and see mostly what I have lost. I struggle to speak, my eyesight\xe2\x80\x99s not great, my right arm and leg are paralyzed, and I left a job I loved representing southern Arizona in Congress.'b'But three years ago, dispatched to an almost certain death by an assassin\xe2\x80\x99s bullet, I was allowed the opportunity for a new life. I had planned to spend my 40s continuing my public service and starting a family. I thought that by fighting for the people I cared about and loving those close to me, I could leave the world a better place. And that would be enough.'b'Instead, I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent the past three years learning how to talk again, how to walk again. I had to learn to sign my name with my left hand. It\xe2\x80\x99s gritty, painful, frustrating work, every day. Rehab is endlessly repetitive. And it\xe2\x80\x99s never easy, because once you\xe2\x80\x99ve mastered some movement or action or word, no matter how small, you move on to the next. You never rest.'b'I asked myself, if simply completing a normal day requires so much work, how would I ever be able to fulfill a larger purpose? The killing of children at the school in Sandy Hook a little over a year ago gave me my answer. It shocked me, it motivated me, and frankly, it showed me a path. After that day, my husband and I pledged to make it our mission to change laws and reduce gun violence in a way that was consistent with our moderate beliefs and our identities as proud gun owners. We knew it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be easy, that special interests were arrayed against us, that congressional dysfunction was an enemy.'b'Predictably, Washington disappointed us during the first year of our work with the organization we began, 'b'Americans for Responsible Solutions'b'. Many of you were outraged at the failure of the Senate to pass the background checks bill, and so was I.'b'But I continue to be inspired by my fellow Americans. By any measure, they\xe2\x80\x99re with us. They know gun violence is a complex problem. No one law will make it go away.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re not daunted. We know that the gun lobby, which makes money by preventing sensible change, relies on dramatic disappointments to wound us, reduce our power, push us back on our heels.'b'Our fight is a lot more like my rehab. Every day, we must wake up resolved and determined. We\xe2\x80\x99ll pay attention to the details; look for opportunities for progress, even when the pace is slow. Some progress may seem small, and we might wonder if the impact is enough, when the need is so urgent.'b'But every day we will recruit a few more allies, talk to a few more elected officials, convince a few more voters. Some days the steps will come easily; we\xe2\x80\x99ll feel the wind at our backs. Other times our knees will buckle. We\xe2\x80\x99ll tire of the burden. I know this feeling. But we\xe2\x80\x99ll persist.'b'We can get tough and win elections. We\xe2\x80\x99ll support our allies. And those who stood in the way will face a powerful advocacy community standing between them and re-election. I know that after the next elections, candidates won\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if common-sense gun policies can win elections; trust me, like Governor-elect Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, they\xe2\x80\x99ll know that the answer is yes.'b'We will seize on consensus where it exists, on solutions big or small. We will fight for every inch, because that means saving lives. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen grit overcome paralysis. My resolution today is that Congress achieve the same. How? Step by step: Enhance enforcement by passing a law making gun trafficking a serious crime with stiff penalties. Make it illegal for all stalkers and all domestic abusers to buy guns. Extend mental health resources into schools and communities, so the dangerously mentally ill find it easier to receive treatment than to buy firearms. And even as we lay the groundwork for expanding background checks, pass strong incentives for states to ensure the background-check system contains the records of the most dangerous and violent among us.'b'This past year, I have achieved something big that I\xe2\x80\x99ve not spoken of until now. Countless hours of physical therapy \xe2\x80\x94 and the talents of the medical community \xe2\x80\x94 have brought me new movement in my right arm. It\xe2\x80\x99s fractional progress, and it took a long time, but my arm moves when I tell it to. Three years ago, I did not imagine my arm would move again. For so many days, it did not. I did exercise after exercise, day after day, until it did. I\xe2\x80\x99m committed to my rehab and I\xe2\x80\x99m committed to my country, and my resolution, standing with the vast majority of Americans who know we can and must be safer, is to cede no ground to those who would convince us the path is too steep, or we too weak.'b'In real life, Americans may keen about income inequality. But on TV, they\xe2\x80\x99re keen for it.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDownton Abbey\xe2\x80\x9d continued its upward ascent with viewers Sunday night, a gushing embrace of class snobbery that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been seen since friends clustered across the country in 1981 \xe2\x80\x94 wearing black tie and clutching Teddy Bears and champagne glasses \xe2\x80\x94 to watch \xe2\x80\x9cBrideshead Revisited.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve resisted the \xe2\x80\x9cDownton Abbey\xe2\x80\x9d fervor.

And the good ones instruct and nag their superiors into making the right moves in their royal lives, both personally and professionally. In Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s season premiere, Lady Mary frostily informed Carson the butler that he had overstepped the mark in urging her to move past her grief over her husband\xe2\x80\x99s death and get more involved in running the estate. But she soon humbly apologized for having the cheek to criticize Carson\xe2\x80\x99s cheek. The marble beauty in long black gloves melted into sobs in his arms and then bucked up to rejoin the world.'b'The butler did it.'b'By now, we all know that 'b'a polar vortex'b' is a cyclone of frigid air centered on the Arctic. A rogue sweep of that air moved south and pushed the temperature in Central Park in New York City to a 118-year low of 5 degrees on 'b'Tuesday morning'b'; records were similarly broken in scores of other American and Canadian cities; and flights were canceled across North America. Yet winter has barely begun, and, even before the icy cold of this week, it had already treated the eastern United States to snowstorms, southwest Britain to monster waves and northern Europe to unusually nasty weather.'b'Weather is changing in ways we cannot easily predict or understand. The polar vortex has had kinks before \xe2\x80\x94 most dramatically in March 1921, when temperatures in Central Park plummeted from 82 degrees to 26 degrees in 14 hours \xe2\x80\x94 just as there have been catastrophic floods, droughts, heat waves and blizzards all through recorded history. Experts say this week\xe2\x80\x99s kink in the polar vortex could be the result of warm air over Greenland and Alaska; some point out that changes to the polar vortex have become more common in recent years. 'b'British meteorologists said'b' the brutal storms in Britain since October could be the result of hot Sahara air that got stranded over the North Atlantic.'b'The point stressed by meteorologists the world over is that severe conditions that used to occur infrequently, say once a century, now happen more frequently, with greater and greater consequences. The threat of climate change is real, and our governments should prepare for the damage and dislocations caused by more extreme weather. Common sense would dictate that we attack all the risk factors that might make things worse next time.'b'ATHENS \xe2\x80\x94  The European Union\xe2\x80\x99s rotating presidency may be a symbolic gesture toward equality, but it does allow us to measure a country\xe2\x80\x99s fortunes each time it finds itself in the role. On Jan. 1, Greece took over the leadership at a crucial time for itself and for the union. The most troubled member, still dependent on loans from its partners and with its coalition government hanging on to power by a slim majority in Parliament, will represent the European Union for six months as its 28 members confront major questions on the group\xe2\x80\x99s identity and future.'b'This presidency will not be business as usual. Elections for the European Parliament in May are expected to result in significant gains by parties of the extreme right whose mission is to undermine European unification.'b'Greece\xe2\x80\x99s plight highlights the fact that European Union members are not equal, that some are grappling with debts while others are obliged to lend them money. This has allowed old prejudices to return, testing the limits of solidarity. But Greece, along with its partners and the bureaucrats at the European Union\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters in Brussels and at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, has to make this presidency a success.'b'This is a make-or-break moment: The members have to show whether they will reinforce the union or let it drift. In terms of the economy, the union has allowed itself to be seen as being as weak as its weakest member. It cannot afford to do this at the political level.'b'The situation is awkward indeed. It is difficult to see how the government of a country that depends on foreign loans will meet the target, set out in the European Union\xe2\x80\x99s strategic framework adopted in December 2012, of strengthening \xe2\x80\x9cthe union\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to respond to the current economic, financial and social challenges.\xe2\x80\x9d Can Greece afford the cost, in treasure and human resources, when its economy has shrunk by roughly a quarter since 2008, with unemployment over 27 percent, with taxpayers groaning under the weight of ever higher taxes in return for fewer benefits, and with the civil service facing drastic cuts? These are questions posed not only by European editorial writers but also by Greek citizens, who wonder whether the money could be put to better use.'b'The issue, though, is not the 50 million euros that Greece expects to spend over the next six months as it hosts some 14 informal ministerial meetings and between 100 and 120 working groups on a range of issues. Rather, is Greece up to the task of being a competent member of the union, and can the union concentrate its resources and vision to make a success of the presidency?'b'The Greek prime minister will not be the European Union \xe2\x80\x9cpresident\xe2\x80\x9d in the White House sense, but rather will present for discussion objectives decided by the organization over a year ago, and his ministers will preside over meetings of their colleagues. The union sets out 18-month policy programs to be executed by the next three countries holding the rotating presidency. Greece is the third presiding country in this program (following Ireland and Lithuania) and a file of some 180 pending issues has been handed over to Athens. The presiding country, of course, is able to highlight some issues, delay others, perhaps even surprise us with an inspired idea (something that has been lacking during the crisis).'b'This is Greece\xe2\x80\x99s fifth presidency since it joined what was then the European Economic Community in 1981. It held the post in 1983, 1988, 1994 and 2003. At the start of its challenging last presidency, in January 2003, unity was threatened by some members (notably Britain and Spain) who aligned themselves with the United States as it prepared to invade Iraq; most members opposed the war. The Greek presidency helped cool things down and, toward the end of the semester, Athens\xe2\x80\x99s ancient agora hosted the signing of the accession treaties, by which 10 new members joined.'b'Of course, 2003 is a world away: Greece was booming and about to host a successful Summer Olympics. In the years that followed, public spending and debt flew out of control, leading to the crisis that made Greece the first country to ask its union partners for support.'b'If Greece\xe2\x80\x99s stewardship is deemed successful,  this may give the government in Athens a necessary push before May\xe2\x80\x99s elections for the European Parliament, which in Greece will coincide with elections for municipal and provincial governments. If the government does badly in those polls (especially in the European Parliament one, which in Greece has always been regarded as a referendum on government policies), Prime Minister Antonis Samaras\xe2\x80\x99s position will be untenable, forcing him to hold early national elections.'b'In the coming months, the European Union will be occupied with fostering economic growth and employment, reaching agreement on a banking union, simplifying procedures to boost competitiveness, and setting policy objectives in the areas of migration, security and justice. These issues are important for the future of the union and its members. Success will depend not as much on what Greece does as on the political will of union members to make tough decisions. As many of these imply handing over more national sovereignty in order to create a stronger union, the stakes are very high: Anything short of success will play into the hands of those who oppose unification, yet the fear of \xe2\x80\x9cEuroskeptic\xe2\x80\x9d parties makes governments wary of handing over more power to the union.'b'Greece will not be the only country to gain if progress is made. But if the European Union chooses to stagnate, more people will question its legitimacy, and all of its members will lose.'b''b'\n'b'Nikos Konstandaras 'b' is the managing editor and a columnist at the newspaper Kathimerini. 'b''b'CAIRO \xe2\x80\x94  Since the revolution of 2011, Egyptians have engaged in almost continuous debate over a critical question: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of country do we want?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This past December, I delivered an answer, on behalf of the Committee of 50 entrusted with amending Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution, to Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s acting president, Adly Mansour. Mr. Mansour recently confirmed that a two-day referendum on this draft will take place next Tuesday and Wednesday. We believe that this new charter, shaped over months of discussion and many drafts, reflects the needs and aspirations of all Egyptians, regardless of religious affiliation, gender, race, political views or economic status.'b'Contrary to what critics say, this document turns the page decisively on both the 2012 and 1971 Constitutions, and thus marks a historic step on our path to a government that is of, by and for the Egyptian people. The 2012 Constitution was rushed through by a single dominating political faction and answered only to its priorities. The 1971 Constitution failed to guarantee vital liberties. In short, both previous Constitutions failed because they denied Egyptians the dignity and freedom they deserve and demand; both those Constitutions have been popularly disavowed.'b'The revision process began in July, when our acting president named a committee of 10 judges, law professors and legal scholars to make amendments. Their recommendations were then transferred to the Committee of 50 to finish that job and produce a foundation for a democratic government.'b'The Committee of 50 gave everyone a seat at the table, including Egyptian feminists and young people. Talk that the process left out critical religious voices is inaccurate: An invitation was extended to all Islamic groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood. Of the parties of political Islam, only the Salafist Al Nour responded (the Muslim Brotherhood did not). All three denominations of our Christian community participated, as did representatives from the underdeveloped provinces of Nubia and Sinai.'b'This representation from across Egyptian society became all the more evident as the committee voted in view of television cameras: Each of the charter\xe2\x80\x99s more than 200 articles and provisions was approved with more than the required three-quarters majority, and the document was adopted unanimously. This year, a popularly elected civilian government will have the opportunity to write laws that improve on this foundation.'b'What I observed firsthand was a rare spirit of solidarity that created a draft constitution to transcend Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s current predicament. Chief among our concerns was to create an accountable system of governance, including, notably, for Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s military. Among other measures, this draft charter gives Parliament \xe2\x80\x94 for the first time in Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s history \xe2\x80\x94 the power to impeach the president, not just for criminal acts but also for violations of the Constitution. Unlike the 1971 charter, it also ensures a separation of powers and limits the elected president to two four-year terms.'b'New oversight will be brought to bear on the military through a National Defense Council that must include civilian and legislative officials alongside officers. The Constitution details those specific crimes committed by civilians that mandate trial in military courts, shielding civilians from the abusive interpretations of previous Constitutions. And for the first time, political parties can be dissolved only by a court ruling of the independent judiciary.'b'Unlike the 2012 Constitution, this draft version criminalizes torture and human trafficking, protects women from violence and commits the state to achieving equality between men and women. It provides greater protection for freedom of expression, press freedom, the pursuit of scientific knowledge and religious liberty, and provides equal protection under the law. Significantly, it places all international human rights treaties to which Egypt is a signatory above even national laws.'b'Constructing democratic institutions and political infrastructure  cannot be done overnight. Many countries over several centuries have embarked on similar journeys, and there are few examples of such momentous change occurring with rapidity and ease. Some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s oldest democracies struggle even now to run effective, pragmatic governments and respond to the will of diverse populations.'b'Egypt is still near the beginning of a crucial period in our storied history. And yet I am confident that we will emerge from this tumultuous transition stronger than before because we are willing to unite to create the political structures necessary for stability, prosperity and democracy to endure for generations.'b'Next week, Egyptians  will have the opportunity to vote on the constitution in the referendum. I know the people of Egypt will embrace this moment and I hope the world will as well. For a nation so infused with its past, Egypt is ready to move forward.'b''b'\n'b'Amr Moussa, 'b' a former minister of foreign affairs for Egypt and secretary general of the Arab League, is the president of the Committee of 50.'b''b'PHNOM PENH, Cambodia \xe2\x80\x94  On Dec. 29, more than 100,000 Cambodians \xe2\x80\x94 garment workers, teachers, farmers and students from all over the country \xe2\x80\x94 marched through the streets of the capital calling for Hun Sen, our long-serving prime minister-dictator, to step down or allow an independent investigation into the flawed national elections that took place in July.'b'The massive demonstration was the culmination of months of nonviolent rallies and marches led by the Cambodia National Rescue Party (C.N.R.P.). It was also the most significant challenge to Hun Sen\xe2\x80\x99s 28-year reign of exploitation and corruption.'b'And he could not tolerate it. He would sooner draw blood than enact real reform.'b'For almost three decades, Hun Sen \xe2\x80\x94 a Khmer Rouge defector who was put in power after Vietnam toppled Pol Pot\xe2\x80\x99s regime in 1979 \xe2\x80\x94 has convinced foreign governments to pour aid into the country, even while the ruling Cambodian People\xe2\x80\x99s Party has rigged elections, sold off our natural resources, imprisoned journalists, union leaders, opposition politicians and human rights activists. Some 250,000 people have been evicted because of land concessions that favor the rich and well-connected.'b'On July 28, vast swaths of the country \xe2\x80\x94 civil servants, indebted farmers, educated youth from both the cities and the countryside \xe2\x80\x94 tried to vote for change. But the election was neither free nor fair. A recent report by the Electoral Reform Alliance, a group of independent local and international nongovernmental organizations, describes massive irregularities, including fraudulent voter registries, which may have disenfranchised 1.25 million eligible voters.  So the peaceful protests began.'b'Factory workers joined the movement a few weeks ago. About 500,000 Cambodians are garment workers; most are employed by factories owned by foreigners with the backing of high-ranking Cambodian officials or the military and produce clothes for international brands like H&amp;M, Nike, Gap and Adidas. After the government refused to raise the minimum wage to $160 per month, some unions called for a general strike and workers started staging nonviolent sit-ins in front of the Labor Ministry and the Council of Ministers.'b'Then, last Friday, in an industrial area on the outskirts of Phnom Penh, hundreds of military policemen and municipal police forces  opened fire with AK-47\xe2\x80\x99s and handguns on a crowd of protesters.  At least four people were killed and over 29 were injured, most garment workers.  The human rights group Licadho called the shootings \xe2\x80\x9cthe worst state violence against civilians to hit Cambodia in 15 years.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The next day, police forces, municipal security guards  and thugs  wearing motorcycle helmets and red armbands stormed Democracy Square, a park the government had designated as a haven for peaceful protest. They evicted its occupants, wielding axes, hammers, metal pipes and wooden sticks. They then destroyed what had become, for the country\xe2\x80\x99s myriad marginalized citizens, a rare zone for free speech, a meeting place, a sanctuary. They tore down the stage and leveled a Buddhist altar. They smashed loudspeakers, metal donation boxes and first-aid tents.'b'Fear, and memories of past crackdowns, rapidly spread beyond Democracy Square that afternoon as thousands of security forces  patrolled Phnom Penh to break up public gatherings and threaten bystanders, while military helicopters, newly purchased from China, buzzed overhead.'b'That same day the Interior Ministry  revoked freedom of assembly. And the municipal court issued a summons for the C.N.R.P.\xe2\x80\x99s president, Sam Rainsy, the C.N.R.P.\xe2\x80\x99s vice president, Kem Sokha, and the head of the Cambodian Independent Teachers\xe2\x80\x99 Association, Rong Chhun, to appear next Tuesday for questioning about incitement of criminal acts and social disturbance.'b'Yet blame for the chaos and the violence lies with the government.'b'On Dec. 20, after the C.N.R.P. announced that it would call for sit-ins on main thoroughfares if the stalemate continued, Hun Sen issued this warning: \xe2\x80\x9cBlocking roads is blocking one\xe2\x80\x99s own blood vein.\xe2\x80\x9d The government, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cwould not allow action that would jeopardize national security, and I would urge precaution of the third hand,\xe2\x80\x9d a euphemism for government repression. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the first time if, last Friday, the authorities had sent in agents provocateurs  among the protesters in order to cause disturbances that could then justify the government\xe2\x80\x99s intervention.'b'Despite the government\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to scare them into silence, the Cambodian people remain strong and united in their desire to see their country move out of the shadow of the Khmer Rouge and into the light that is genuine democracy.'b'In this, they deserve more support than they have received. The international community, long content to take Cambodia\xe2\x80\x99s apparent economic and social stability at face value, must now recognize the brutality of this government\xe2\x80\x99s methods and help put an end to them and their underlying causes.'b'Foreign governments could provide technical and financial support for electoral reforms, including reform of the voter-registration system, so that a new election could be held within two years. An investigation must be conducted into the government\xe2\x80\x99s  use of lethal force against protesters, perhaps by the International Criminal Court itself.'b'Foreign companies also have a role to play, by easing the despair of underpaid factory workers: If they reduced their profit margins just slightly, the workers could be paid a living wage without jeopardizing Cambodia\xe2\x80\x99s long-term competitiveness in the garment sector. Gap, Adidas and other companies took a welcome step on Tuesday by condemning the use of force in an open letter to the government and calling for \xe2\x80\x9ca robust minimum wage review mechanism based on international good practices.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Democracy Square now stands empty, save for the military police who watch over it.

Yet in many ways, growing up in Nairobi I was always in the midst of terror. As a boy living in extreme poverty in Kibera, one of Africa\xe2\x80\x99s largest slums, I learned early on that I was disposable, that human life is not equally valued. Life expectancy in Kibera is estimated at 30 years, compared with 64 in the rest of Kenya and 70 worldwide. In Kibera, people are desensitized to death. Living is understood to be the exception.'b'I am 29 years old \xe2\x80\x94 on the threshold of a new decade of life. All my close friends from childhood, save for two, were robbed of this experience. Some took risks to feed their families; for stealing bread or charcoal, they were shot by the police. Others, who worked for as little as $1 per day, fell from construction sites or burned in factory fires. Still others perished in the violence after the 2007 election. Violence and loss became part of day-to-day life.'b'These are more than singular tragedies; they contribute to the psyche of being poor. This psyche inculcates hopelessness, dispels a belief in the possibility of tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s being better than today, compels a resignation to the fact that you may suffer the same tragic fate as your peers, and fuels anger because there is no escape and you did not choose this \xe2\x80\x94 you simply drew life\xe2\x80\x99s short straw.'b'This, perhaps, is terrorism\xe2\x80\x99s fertile ground. Because if you grew up as I did, self-protection requires coming to terms with violence and terror. Violence becomes a vehicle of survival. My friend Boi was 16 when he joined a gang with the goal of supporting his mother and sister. If stealing or fighting was the only way, he was ready. In the end, he was shot dead.'b'An environment in which you cannot get a job despite ability, ambition and persistence fosters anger. My friend James and I used to leave the slum together each morning to look for work as day laborers. We always hoped we\xe2\x80\x99d be lucky, only to be told \xe2\x80\x9cnot today\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 day after day after day. Then one day, James and I got construction jobs. While carrying heavy stones, two of James\xe2\x80\x99s fingers were crushed. He was not compensated and was out of work for more than two years. Later, James caught another break and got a job as a security guard at an upper-class estate. The estate was robbed, and James was fired and never paid.'b'Something broke in James. In the constant degradation he saw that for people like us there was no justice. He joined a local group infamous for terrorizing the community, robbing and stealing. James was ready to die, willing to do anything to provide what he could for his family. Today, this world of violence and uncertainty remains his reality.'b'News reports inform us that Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s slums are ripe for terrorist recruitment. No one is born a terrorist. But being paid a reported $1,000 to undergo militant training in Somalia is more than enough financial incentive; the young people in Nairobi\xe2\x80\x99s slums are accustomed to taking risks that pay far less.'b'A 2011 study in the Journal of Peace Research found that the perpetuation of Islamist extremism was more significantly associated with urban poverty than with variables like religiosity, lack of education and income dissatisfaction. The urban poor are so close to the city\xe2\x80\x99s opportunities \xe2\x80\x94 but they always remain out of reach.'b'Given the link between urban poverty and terrorism, the best strategy to limit the power of militant groups to seduce recruits is to fight poverty, not terrorism. Instead of investing billions of dollars on drones, let\xe2\x80\x99s focus on augmenting economic opportunities and providing basic and essential services like health care and education.'b'Every day, more and more people arrive in Nairobi, drawn by the hope of a better life, only to settle in slums. More than half of those living in Africa\xe2\x80\x99s urban slums are between the ages of 15 and 24. Without access to education, this generation has little hope of escaping its straitened conditions. We must capture the potential of urban youth before they are led to believe that the path of violence is their only option.'b'Over the past few years, the Shabab, the Somali militant group that took credit for the Westgate massacre, has inflicted terror on the citizens of Kenya, throwing grenades into local bars, bus stations and villages near the border \xe2\x80\x94 places frequented by the poor and lower middle class. Only Westgate, however, garnered enormous international media attention. This was of course because of the scale of the tragedy, but also because of the affluent demographic it primarily affected.'b'Westgate was a place marked by economic prosperity, wholly inaccessible to so many, including those who might be recruited from Nairobi\xe2\x80\x99s slums to undertake similar acts. As we condemn those who have carried out these heinous acts, so too must we condemn the systems that perpetuate extremism. We must install new systems of urban promise.'b'If we pursue an antiterrorism strategy based on tactical strikes, it will only further a cycle of violence. The perpetual sense of anger experienced in urban poverty will ensure that there are always new terrorist leaders to replace those who are killed. The war on terror can be won only through education, promise and real opportunities.'b'It is time to give young men like my friends, and like those today living in urban slums, hope.

Barely half of those who start four-year colleges, and only a third of community college students, graduate. That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the worst records among developed nations, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a substantial drain on the economy. The American Institutes for Research estimates the cost of those dropouts, measured in lost earnings and taxes, at $4.5 billion. Incalculable are the lost opportunities for social mobility and the stillborn professional careers.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a remedy at hand, though, and it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty straightforward. Nationwide, universities need to give undergraduates the care and attention akin to what\xe2\x80\x99s lavished on students at elite institutions.'b'If that help is forthcoming, graduation rates more than double, according to several evaluations of an innovative program at the City University of New York\xe2\x80\x99s community colleges.'b'Over the past month, CUNY\xe2\x80\x99s Accelerated Study in Associate Programs (ASAP) has garnered hosannas in the media for its package of comprehensive financial resources, student support systems and impressive graduation rates. The social policy leader MDRC is conducting a multiyear random-assignment study of ASAP and, in a just-released 'b'report'b', describes it as \xe2\x80\x9cunparalleled in large-scale experimental evaluations of programs in higher education to date.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Nearly 90 percent of students who attend a top-ranked university earn a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree in four years. While these undergraduates may well be among the best and brightest, they also get kid-gloves treatment. If they run into trouble, an army of helpmates stands at the ready. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom moving day as a freshman through graduation and beyond,\xe2\x80\x9d Harvard assures its students, \xe2\x80\x9cour advisers are here to help and support you at every step.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The situation is entirely different for most undergraduates, especially poor and minority students. All too often they\xe2\x80\x99re steered to schools where they receive little if any support in mastering tough courses, decoding arcane requirements for a major, sorting out life problems or navigating the maze of institutional requirements. Graduation rates at these so-called dropout factories, especially those in urban areas that largely serve low-income, underprepared minority populations, are as abysmal as 5 percent.'b'Where a student goes makes all the difference. Consider a Chicago public high school graduate with a grade-point average of 3.5. If she enrolls at Chicago State University, a Washington Monthly 'b'investigation'b' shows, the odds against her finishing are high \xe2\x80\x94 the school\xe2\x80\x99s six-year graduation rate hovers at 20 percent. Her chances measurably improve if she attends the University of Illinois at Chicago, where the completion rate is 57 percent. And if she goes to Northwestern, just a few miles away, 93 percent of her classmates will graduate.'b'Six years ago, CUNY decided to confront the high dropout rate at its community colleges with the ASAP initiative. The results are stunning: 56 percent of the first two cohorts of more than 1,500 students have graduated, compared with just 23 percent of a comparable group that didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the same experience. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, most of those graduates are currently pursuing a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree.'b'The program for community-college students addresses money issues, which are typically students\xe2\x80\x99 top concern, by covering tuition that\xe2\x80\x99s not paid for by federal and state grants, as well as paying for public transit and giving students free use of textbooks, saving them upward of $900 a year. To help balance the demands of college with work, life and family obligations, students take their classes in a consolidated course schedule (morning, afternoon or evening).'b'While the added dollars make a big difference, students consistently report in individual profiles found on the CUNY ASAP 'b'website'b' that the personal touch \xe2\x80\x94 biweekly seminars and one-on-one advising \xe2\x80\x94 is crucial. The ASAP adviser for 'b'Desiree Rivera'b', a LaGuardia student, became her life coach. \xe2\x80\x9cI am completely able to let my guard down around her and discuss both personal and academic struggles,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Rivera wrote on her profile. \xe2\x80\x9cHer support has played a major role in my success as an ASAP student.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'An 'b'evaluation'b' last year by the economist Henry M. Levin, a co-director of Teachers College, Columbia University\xe2\x80\x99s Center for Benefit-Cost Studies in Education, and Emma Garc\xc3\xada, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, D.C., concludes that although ASAP isn\xe2\x80\x99t cheap \xe2\x80\x94 the program costs, on average, $3,900 per student each year \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s a solid investment for New York City\xe2\x80\x99s taxpayers. Dr. Levin and Dr. Garc\xc3\xada calculate that the total lifetime benefits \xe2\x80\x94 from increased tax revenues as well as savings in crime, welfare and health costs \xe2\x80\x94 are a whopping $205,514 per associate degree graduate.'b'These results have persuaded CUNY to triple the size of the community college program to 4,000 students by fall 2014, and the system is considering expanding ASAP to its other schools. But this strategy merits a nationwide rollout, for it promises a significant increase in the number of educated workers that the nation badly needs.'b'Well, that didn\xe2\x80\x99t take long.'b'After wall-to-wall Obamacare disaster ruminations, the terrain of the political landscape is shifting, as it always does, and refocusing attention on some familiar themes.'b'The larger-than-life, straight-from-the-hip, quick-with-the-tongue paladin of the Palisades, Chris Christie, is beginning to emerge as small, petty and vindictive.'b'In September, several lanes of the George Washington Bridge were closed, grinding traffic to a halt in the town of Fort Lee, N.J., whose mayor just so happened to have refused to endorse Christie for re-election. In fact, The Record reported yesterday that the EMS coordinator for the borough, Paul Favia, detailed to the mayor of Fort Lee four medical situations in which emergency responders were delayed because of the traffic gridlock.'b'One was particularly disturbing:'b"\xe2\x80\x9cIt also took EMS seven minutes to reach an unconscious 91-year-old woman who later died of cardiac arrest at a hospital. Although he did not say her death was directly caused by the delays, Favia noted that \xe2\x80\x98paramedics were delayed due to heavy traffic on Fort Lee Road and had to meet the ambulance en-route to the hospital instead of on the scene.'\xe2\x80\x9d"b'Christie denied involvement in the closings. In fact, when the governor was questioned about it last month, he laughed it off, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI worked the cones actually. Unbeknownst to everybody, I was actually the guy out there. I was in overalls and a hat, but I was the guy working the cones.\xe2\x80\x9d Ha, ha. That was hilarious. Until it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. Until emails emerged Wednesday that painted a rather disturbing picture of involvement by people in his office.'b'In one email, Christie\xe2\x80\x99s deputy chief of staff for legislative and intergovernmental affairs, Bridget Anne Kelly, wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cTime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\xe2\x80\x9d And the emails get worse from there. While it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear whether Christie himself was involved with the closings, the emails strike uncomfortably close to home.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s almost sad that every time Republicans get behind a candidate, that candidate seems to implode. Almost, but not quite. After Christie\xe2\x80\x99s impressive re-election in November, media folks fawned over him as if he were a newborn panda. He was 'b'the reincarnation of Jack Kemp'b', with an acerbic side, the embodiment of the \xe2\x80\x9cSpirit of Sandy,\xe2\x80\x9d the bipartisan Pied Piper. Praise upon praise.'b'The utterly unearned accolades and the Republican thirst for a winner after two defeats at the hands of the much-reviled President Obama pushed Christie out front in the ridiculously premature horse-race prognostication for 2016. A Quinnipiac University poll last month even had 'b'Christie besting Hillary Clinton'b' in a hypothetical 2016 head-to-head matchup.'b'Hillary the Invincible. Hillary the Inevitable. Hillary \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Her Turn\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton.

He finished, \xe2\x80\x9cThis behavior is not representative of me or my administration in any way, and people will be held responsible for their actions.\xe2\x80\x9d So, in other words, someone else has to take the fall for this. Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99ll be the end of it. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see.'b'While we wait, the Obama administration and Democratic causes are beginning to look less gloomy. Private sector hiring in December was reportedly higher than it had been since November 2012. According to The Wall Street Journal:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPrivate-sector payrolls increased by 238,000 positions in December, according to the national employment report compiled by payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody\xe2\x80\x99s Analytics.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Democrats are pressing their income inequality message on several fronts, including moving to vote on extending long-term unemployment for three more months. It\xe2\x80\x99s by no means clear that the measure will pass, particularly not without budgetary offsets that some Republicans are demanding. But these income inequality issues do resonate with voters. And as we observed the 50th anniversary of the war on poverty, these issues take on added weight. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have the same resonance as, say, gun rights, but if you lay enough of them end to end, they could go some distance.'b'Furthermore, the Affordable Care Act finished last year with a surge. As Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo tabulated on Dec. 31, 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cbetween 9 and 10 million people\xe2\x80\x9d now have health care coverage'b' because of the Affordable Care Act. That number will only grow. If Republicans thought there was a backlash against the president after people lost health care plans they liked, that will be nothing compared to a backlash if these newly insured were stripped of insurance by a repeal of the law.'b'Even the sometimes salacious excerpts from the former defense secretary Robert Gates\xe2\x80\x99s soon-to-be-released book, in which he criticizes the president, the vice president and Hillary Clinton, are not wholly negative for the White House. On one level it\xe2\x80\x99s a glimpse of what happens when a \xe2\x80\x9cTeam of Rivals\xe2\x80\x9d becomes of nest of vipers. On the other hand, painting the president as a man who is constantly questioning military commitment, always looking for a way out, and distrustful of the military brass doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound so negative to many of the president\xe2\x80\x99s supporters. It sounds like the kind of leader they wanted.'b'This all goes to show just how fast the Washington soap opera can change its scripts and how ludicrous long-range predictions can be.'b'Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey has explanations to make, apologies to give and an administrative house to clean now that his top aides and political cronies were shown to have been fully and gleefully aware of the chaos they caused by ordering up lane closings \xe2\x80\x94 and a four-day traffic jam \xe2\x80\x94 in September at the George Washington Bridge.'b'New Jersey residents had suspected for months that the sudden, mysterious shutdown of traffic lanes to the bridge in Fort Lee, N.J., may have had something to do with the refusal of the town\xe2\x80\x99s mayor, Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, to endorse Mr. Christie for re-election.'b'That sounded far-fetched, even for someone known to be as sensitive to slights and as politically belligerent as Mr. Christie. He and his aides said such speculation was crazy talk, and he sarcastically joked that he had done it. \xe2\x80\x9cI worked the cones,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cUnbeknownst to anyone, I was working the cones.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Turns out it was his old friend David Wildstein, whom Mr. Christie had appointed as director of interstate capital projects at the Port Authority, who ordered the closings. Text messages and emails 'b'made public'b' on Wednesday show that Mr. Wildstein and Mr. Christie\xe2\x80\x99s deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, discussed the closings as political payback for Mr. Sokolich, who had no idea the closings were coming.'b'The correspondence shows that the lane closings were indeed a stunningly stupid act of petty revenge. They were also an egregious abuse of power.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Kelly said in an email to Mr. Wildstein in August, a few weeks before the closings.'b'Mr. Wildstein replied, \xe2\x80\x9cGot it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When the Port Authority\xe2\x80\x99s executive director, Patrick Foye, learned what was happening in Fort Lee, he immediately 'b'ordered the lanes reopened'b', calling the closings dangerous, \xe2\x80\x9cabusive,\xe2\x80\x9d and probably illegal. Such big changes to traffic patterns are usually announced well in advance. In this case, the vague explanation by Port Authority officials was that they were for a traffic study that nobody else knew anything about. The gridlock was horrendous; Mr. Christie\xe2\x80\x99s aides were lucky that nobody was seriously hurt in the chaos.'b'Mr. Christie, caught out on Wednesday, could no longer scoff at or dismiss the scandal, or blame Democrats for it. There were two possible explanations: either he had been pathetically misled by his scheming staff, and failed for months to get to the bottom of the scandal, or he had spent those months dissembling to any and all. His excuse? He was a dupe.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen today for the first time is unacceptable,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am outraged and deeply saddened to learn that not only was I misled by a member of my staff, but this completely inappropriate and unsanctioned conduct was made without my knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d He added: \xe2\x80\x9cThis behavior is not representative of me or my administration in any way, and people will be held responsible for their actions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Christie can start by getting rid of every one of his aides and cronies who knew about this scheme and show what actions he will take against the person with ultimate responsibility for his administration: himself.'b'Gov. Andrew Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'State of the State address'b' on Wednesday was a campaign speech for re-election in both style and substance. Whether the policies he laid out are good for the people of New York is another matter. Mr. Cuomo proudly recounted his successes \xe2\x80\x94 on-time budgets, marriage equality, gun control. But the centerpiece was 'b'his plan to cut taxes'b' by $2 billion over the next three years.'b'This is undoubtedly good politics. The\xc2\xa0anti-tax, pro-business label could help his campaign for re-election, especially in conservative areas upstate and outside New York City. But 'b'his proposals'b', which tilt too heavily in favor of the wealthy, could mean less money for education, housing and other vital state services.\xc2\xa0'b'The Cuomo tax cuts do offer some modest relief to middle-class New Yorkers. A tax rebate for renters making less than $100,000 a year could help many residents in New York City. He would give property tax credits to homeowners earning less than $200,000; though this policy would be better if it provided more relief to those earning less money.'b'He also proposes that homeowners get a property tax \xe2\x80\x9cfreeze\xe2\x80\x9d (essentially a tax rebate) if their local governments limit tax increases to 2 percent a year and begin consolidating services to save money.'b'The plan\xe2\x80\x99s broad tax cuts, however, could reduce public services in poor communities, especially those outside New York City where the 2 percent property tax cap championed by Mr. Cuomo has been in effect since 2011.'b'With Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City sitting in the audience, Mr. Cuomo mentioned the need for universal prekindergarten \xe2\x80\x94 a top priority for Mr. de Blasio. But the governor has repeatedly shied away from the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s plan to tax the rich to pay for it.'b'Instead, Mr. Cuomo wants to give a big tax break to the wealthiest New Yorkers. His plan would reduce estate tax rates from the current 16 percent to 10 percent, and raise the state estate tax exemption from $1 million to the current federal level of $5.25 million by 2019. Those changes would deprive the state of more than $500 million in revenues a year, according to James Parrott of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a progressive think tank. To balance this wrongheaded fiscal plan, Mr. Cuomo announced a $2 billion bond referendum to buy equipment like laptops and install high-speed broadband in schools. He vowed to redevelop and modernize LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy airports. He promised full scholarships for top math and science students, bonuses for teachers and more low-cost housing. It is not clear how he would pay for all these enticing programs and cut taxes as well.'b'He said he would prepare the state for the next Hurricane Sandy using primarily federal dollars and would promote women\xe2\x80\x99s rights, including abortion rights. Citing reports of \xe2\x80\x9cbad acts\xe2\x80\x9d by Albany politicians, he once again proposed ethics reform but barely mentioned reforming New York\xe2\x80\x99s scandalous campaign financing system.'b'But cutting taxes and helping businesses and the well-off was at the heart of this political agenda. The New York tax code is cumbersome, often unfair and in need of reform. More than a year ago, Mr. Cuomo appointed a Tax Reform and Fairness Commission led by Peter Solomon, an investment banker, and former Comptroller Carl McCall. That group put out a wide-ranging reform plan that would streamline the tax code, but it was also designed to keep tax revenues at about the same level. Mr. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s proposal has few of those elements.'b'Again and again, Mr. Cuomo has said he wants to end New York\xe2\x80\x99s reputation as a high-tax state. The question now is whether he can do that without making life worse for communities staggering through hard times.'b'The tenuous state of women\xe2\x80\x99s basic right to make their own childbearing decisions was made clear on Monday when a federal appeals court in New Orleans heard arguments on a new abortion restriction enacted in July in Texas \xe2\x80\x94 one that requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.'b'In October, a federal district judge, Lee Yeakel, ruled that the requirement serves no medical purpose and improperly infringes on women\xe2\x80\x99s reproductive rights. A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit overturned his injunction on the rule\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement, and the Supreme Court, in an alarming 5-to-4 opinion in November, declined to upset the panel\xe2\x80\x99s ruling.'b'The requirement immediately forced 12 of the state\xe2\x80\x99s 34 abortion clinics to stop offering the procedure, according to the Texas Policy Evaluation Project, a research group, though four subsequently resumed services because doctors were able to secure hospital privileges.'b'Another provision of the Texas law requires abortion clinics to meet surgery-center standards \xe2\x80\x94 including those that perform only nonsurgical medication abortions and the safest early-stage procedures. When that provision goes into effect in September, the number of facilities performing abortions could drop steeply from the current 26 to as few as eight statewide, according to Planned Parenthood.'b'Two of the judges at Monday\xe2\x80\x99s hearing \xe2\x80\x94 Jennifer Walker Elrod and Catharina Haynes \xe2\x80\x94 were also on the panel that rushed to lift Judge Yeakel\xe2\x80\x99s injunction. The third panel member, Judge Edith Jones, has a record of hostility to abortion rights. The questions and comments at the hearing showed indifference to forcing women, many of them poor and in isolated parts of the state, to travel hundreds of miles round-trip to obtain safe and legal abortion care.'b'The Texas law is part of the 'b'surge'b' of anti-abortion measures \xe2\x80\x94 in the guise of health and safety protections or based on a scientifically dubious theory of fetal pain \xe2\x80\x94 approved in Republican-controlled states over the past three years. In 2013 alone, 22 states adopted 70 different restrictions, the Guttmacher Institute 'b'reports'b', including pre-viability abortion bans that defy Supreme Court precedent, unwarranted doctor and clinic regulations, limits on medication abortion by forbidding use of the most up-to-date drug protocol, and bans on insurance coverage. These restrictions make it more difficult for women in many regions to obtain an abortion.'b'To stand a chance of rolling back these restrictions, supporters of abortion rights will need to fight harder and more nimbly than ever on three fronts \xe2\x80\x94 in the courts, in legislatures and at the ballot box.'b'We have been through a lot of political scandals. But never before has the nation been roiled by a conspiracy to create a traffic jam.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s barely been time to get used to the idea that Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey is a Republican presidential contender. Now we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to wonder if he\xe2\x80\x99s a Republican presidential contender who would deliberately create a monster four-day-long backup on the George Washington Bridge to punish a Democratic mayor for not endorsing his re-election.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,\xe2\x80\x9d emailed a Christie deputy chief of staff last summer. Suddenly, commuters were seeing two, three, four hours added to their drive times.'b'This is very big. Voters have been known to overlook financial chicanery or stuffed ballot boxes. They might continue to love a guy who screwed up the local bond rating or got evicted from the governor\xe2\x80\x99s mansion by an irate wife. But could you ever trust a politician who was implicated in a deliberate effort to ruin rush hour?'b'We are, of course, going to refer to this as Bridgegate. Also, we will try to figure out some way to call it a political polar vortex.'b'One central character in the story \xe2\x80\x94 which unfolds in newly public emails and texts \xe2\x80\x94 is David Wildstein, the governor\xe2\x80\x99s high school pal and a former mayor of their mutual hometown who was appointed to a very important position in the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The Port Authority controls the George Washington Bridge, which carries more motor vehicles than any other span in the world. In September, Wildstein had workers block off two access lanes to the bridge from the city of Fort Lee. This appears to have been an effort to get back at the mayor for his failure to join the governor\xe2\x80\x99s re-election team.'b'Imagine what would happen if the mayor of Tijuana did something to tick off a President Chris Christie administration. Goodbye border crossing.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe lowest level of political venom that you could possibly even make up,\xe2\x80\x9d Mayor Mark Sokolich fumed to CNN on Wednesday. In an email, Wildstein referred to the mayor as \xe2\x80\x9cthis little Serbian.\xe2\x80\x9d Sokolich has described himself as both outraged and Croatian.'b'America has not been this conscious of Fort Lee since the early days of Weekend Update on \xe2\x80\x9cSaturday Night Live,\xe2\x80\x9d when Gilda Radner played correspondent Roseanne Roseannadanna, continually answering questions from \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Richard Feder of Fort Lee, New Jersey.\xe2\x80\x9d Now we are imagining Mr. Richard Feder on his morning commute to Manhattan, sitting behind the wheel and staring bleakly ahead as the clock ticks on toward 10 a.m.'b'Emergency services complained about delays. Children were trapped on buses en route to the first day of school. Meanwhile, the texting by the Christie camp went along the line of: \xe2\x80\x9cIs it wrong that I am smiling?\xe2\x80\x9d One of them expressed some mild regret about the kids. Wildstein pointed out that they were probably the spawn of Democrats.'b'Nothing in the newly uncovered email exchanges came directly from Christie. Perhaps he did not know what was going on. Perhaps Christie, the chairman of the Republican Governors Association, appointed childhood chum and political blogger Wildstein to the Port Authority because of his in-depth expertise in bridges and tunnels.'b'On Wednesday, Christie declared in a brief statement that he was shocked, shocked, shocked, and was determined to hold people \xe2\x80\x9cresponsible for their actions.\xe2\x80\x9d He has apparently dropped his earlier position that the whole blocked-lane thing was probably a useful study of traffic patterns.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a difference between a Jersey attitude of being blunt and direct and telling it like it is, and a Nixonesque act of retaliation that punishes innocent people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Loretta Weinberg, the majority leader of the State Senate who represents Fort Lee. The nation first met Weinberg, 78, when Christie winningly urged reporters to \xe2\x80\x9ctake the bat out on her for once.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Republicans around the nation are going to be brought up short by an idea of a plot to screw up our constitutional right to drive to work. Among the great political divides in this country is mass transit versus cars, and Republicans tend to be rather hostile toward the former. (Driving is individualistic; buses are communal. Driving is the wide open spaces; trains are sort of France.)'b'Also, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to wonder if we really need more people in Washington with no sense of discretion when it comes to the stuff they say on the Internet. Or who suffer from serious problems with proportionality. The governor won re-election with more than 60 percent of the vote. Obsessing over one Democratic mayor\xe2\x80\x99s failure to jump on board is right up there with Martha Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to save her financial empire $45,000 through a gambit that netted her five months in prison.'b'I am really looking forward to hearing all this discussed in the Florida primary.'b'America\xe2\x80\x99s war on poverty 'b'turned 50 years old this week'b', and plenty of people have concluded that, as President Reagan put it: \xe2\x80\x9cWe fought a war on poverty, and poverty won.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That perception shapes the right\xe2\x80\x99s suspicion of food stamps, minimum-wage raises and extensions of unemployment benefits. A reader named Frank 'b'posted on my Facebook page'b': \xe2\x80\x9cAll the government aid/handouts in the world will not make people better parents. This is why the ideas from the left, although always made with the best of intentions, never work. ... All of this aid is wasted.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yet a careful look at the evidence suggests that such a view is flat wrong. In fact, the first lesson of the war on poverty is that we can make progress against poverty, but that it\xe2\x80\x99s an uphill slog.'b'The most accurate measures, using Census Bureau figures that take account of benefits, suggest that poverty rates have fallen by more than one-third since 1968. There\xe2\x80\x99s a consensus that without the war on poverty, other forces (such as mass incarceration, a rise in single mothers and the decline in trade unions) would have lifted poverty much higher.'b'A Columbia University study suggests that without government benefits, the poverty rate would have soared to 31 percent in 2012. Indeed, an average of 27 million people were lifted annually out of poverty by social programs between 1968 and 2012, 'b'according to the White House Council of Economic Advisers'b'.'b'The best example of how government antipoverty programs can succeed involves the elderly. In 1960, 'b'about 35 percent of older Americans were poor'b'. In 2012, 9 percent were. That\xe2\x80\x99s because senior citizens vote, so politicians listened to them and buttressed programs like Social Security and Medicare.'b'In contrast, children are voiceless, so they are the age group most likely to be poor today. That\xe2\x80\x99s a practical and moral failure.'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anybody to be poor, but, if I have to choose, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s more of a priority to help kids than seniors. In part, that\xe2\x80\x99s because when kids are deprived of opportunities, the consequences can include a lifetime of educational failure, crime and underemployment.'b'Research from neuroscience underscores why early interventions are so important. Early brain development turns out to have lifelong consequences, and research from human and animal studies alike suggests that a high-stress early childhood in poverty changes the physical brain in subtle ways that impair educational performance and life outcomes.'b'A careful review of antipoverty programs in a new book, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Legacies of the War on Poverty'b',\xe2\x80\x9d shows that many of them have a clear impact \xe2\x80\x94 albeit sometimes not as great an impact as advocates hoped.'b'For starters, one of the most basic social programs that works \xe2\x80\x94 indeed pays for itself many times over \xe2\x80\x94 is family-planning assistance for at-risk teenage girls. This has actually been one of America\xe2\x80\x99s most successful social programs in recent years. The 'b'teenage birthrate has fallen'b' by half over roughly the last 20 years.'b'Another hugely successful array of programs involved parent coaching to get pregnant women to drink and smoke less and to encourage at-risk moms to talk to their children more. Programs like Nurse-Family Partnership, Healthy Families America, Child First, Save the Children and Thirty Million Words Project all have had great success in helping parents do a better job with their kids.'b'Early education likewise has strong evidence of impact. Critics note that in Head Start, for example, gains in I.Q. seem to fade within a few years. That\xe2\x80\x99s true and disappointing. But in the last five years, robust studies from 'b'scholars like David Deming'b' have shown that graduates of Head Start also have improved life outcomes: higher high school graduation and college attendance rates, and less likely to be out of school and out of a job.'b'Another area of success: Programs that encourage jobs, especially for the most at-risk groups. The earned-income tax credit is a huge benefit to the working poor and to society.'b'Likewise, a program called Career Academies has had excellent results training at-risk teenagers in specialized careers and giving them practical work experience. Even eight years later, those young people randomly assigned to Career Academies are earning significantly more than those in control groups.'b'As that example suggests, we increasingly have first-rate research \xe2\x80\x94 randomized controlled trials, testing antipoverty programs as rigorously as if they were pharmaceuticals \xe2\x80\x94 that give us solid evidence of what works or doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'So let\xe2\x80\x99s drop the bombast and look at the evidence.'b'Critics are right that antipoverty work is difficult and that dependency can be a problem. But the premise of so much of today\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to food stamps and other benefits \xe2\x80\x94 that government assistance inevitably fails \xe2\x80\x94 is just wrong. And child poverty is as unconscionable in a rich nation today as it was half a century ago.'b'There was good news last week in Myanmar when President Thein Sein stated his support for changing the nation\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution to allow \xe2\x80\x9cany citizen,\xe2\x80\x9d including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Prize-winning democracy advocate, to run for the presidency in the 2015 elections.'b'Parliament is reviewing a 2008 constitutional provision that bars presidential candidates with close family members \xe2\x80\x9cwho owe allegiance to a foreign power.\xe2\x80\x9d Since Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\xe2\x80\x99s sons are British citizens, that provision would prohibit her from entering the race. She and her political allies are threatening to boycott the 2015 elections if she is not allowed to run. They are also demanding constitutional changes that would free Parliament and the judiciary from military control and give the ethnic Chin, Karen and Shan states more autonomy.'b'Any change in the Constitution requires approval from more than 75 percent of the members of Parliament. However, 25 percent of the seats are reserved for members of the military, giving them veto power. While President Thein Sein\xe2\x80\x99s support for change is helpful, it may not be enough to sway military lawmakers.'b'Myanmar has made progress on citizens\xe2\x80\x99 rights since the military junta opened the way for democracy in 2011. The travel restrictions on Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi \xe2\x80\x94 held under house arrest for 15 years \xe2\x80\x94 have been lifted, greater freedom of the press has been promised, and Mr. Thein Sein has released some prisoners of conscience, though not all.'b'Still, more reform is needed to realize Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s transition from military dictatorship to democracy. A 1982 law denies citizenship to the Rohingya Muslim minority, native-born Burmese of Indian descent and the foreign-born children of Burmese citizens. A United Nations resolution in November rightly called on Myanmar to grant the Rohingya Muslims citizenship, but the government has rejected that resolution.'b'Parliament should approve the proposed constitutional reform. And democracy advocates should push Parliament to change the 1982 law to expand citizenship to more Burmese. Without citizenship, these people are denied fundamental rights, including the right to travel freely and the right to vote and to participate in the political process.'b'HAMBURG, Germany \xe2\x80\x94  More or less since its birth, the European Union has been a subject of apocalyptic talk \xe2\x80\x94 a permanent crisis mode that has worked beautifully to enhance ever-closer integration.'b'Today, though, the situation is different, and it is serious. Never before have Europeans been more tired and disillusioned with the promises of the Brussels mandarins. In the run-up to the European parliamentary elections in May, the gap between what\xe2\x80\x99s economically necessary and what\xe2\x80\x99s politically justifiable is growing dangerously wide.'b'Europe has come through the last years of crisis with a new momentum, and yet the situation is reminiscent of how a star reaches its greatest density just before it explodes. If that is so, is there a remedy for what the analyst Roderick Parkes has called the \xe2\x80\x9csupernova moment\xe2\x80\x9d?'b'There is. But it would require Germany, the union\xe2\x80\x99s largest and most powerful driver, to support an idea that the country has always fiercely rejected: to activate the thrust reverser for certain parts of the unification project as a way to reduce the Continent\xe2\x80\x99s political stress. It would mean, more specifically, listening to the ideas being laid out by the British prime minister, David Cameron.'b'Integration, Mr. Cameron argues, should be cut back in a variety of policy-making realms \xe2\x80\x94 social and employment laws, for example, or environmental legislation \xe2\x80\x94 and shifted back to the individual countries. That would allow Brussels to focus on other areas more central to its vision, like monetary unification, energy security and enlargement.'b'The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has been ignoring these ideas with a mixture of anxiety, denial and lack of vision. For the sake of Europe, she should think again.'b'Polls show anti-union forces gaining ground in core nations. In France, the right-wing National Front currently ranks as the country\xe2\x80\x99s most popular party. In the Netherlands, the same is true for the Freedom Party. Both parties have just agreed to join forces for the European elections. The very assembly that has always been a club of the European Union vanguard could turn into an arena of political rowdies, trying to destroy the body from within.'b'One wonders how many more warnings Ms. Merkel needs before she realizes that if Europe must be founded on democratic consent, its limits, for the moment, may have been reached. At nearly every opportunity in which voters were allowed to have their say about the form, speed and depth of integration, they said \xe2\x80\x9cstop.\xe2\x80\x9d But the architects of Europe never listened. Now they may have no choice.'b'In the past, integrationists have seen unification as proceeding in just one direction, with the only variable being the speed. But this critical point offers a unique possibility for a spring cleaning \xe2\x80\x94 not to retreat, but to remove those functions of the union that have proved less useful and more controversial than their creators expected.'b'A first move should be for Europe\xe2\x80\x99s leaders to admit that the history of the Continent\xe2\x80\x99s integration has not been a complete success. Everyone but them can admit that the European Union has grown far too big on the small issues, and remained far too small on the big issues; it has banned incandescent light bulbs, but it is unable to implement a common energy policy. It is too soft on the hard issues, and too hard on the soft issues; unable to pool its military capabilities, while being frenetically outspoken about the alleged foreign-policy mistakes of others.'b'Astonishingly, it is failing to deliver on the one promise it made above all others: to create a successful single-currency bloc. At no point have the rules been respected by all member states at once.'b'Now it is the wrong people \xe2\x80\x94 the populists \xe2\x80\x94 who are asking the right questions. Is it really a good idea, for example, to shift more power to the European Commission, a body that has proved repeatedly that it is much better at issuing rules than enforcing them? One reason for the euro\xe2\x80\x99s problems is that the commission is simply ignored by national governments when it comes to existential political questions.'b'Europe\xe2\x80\x99s leaders should also concede that the so-called euro-skeptics have often been right in the past, and that it was a mistake to tar them as primitive, reactionary heretics. Historically, heretics have often been the ones who finally force a belief system to confront its own weaknesses. And so it should be with the European Union.'b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t fear Mr. Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s ideas. More good Europeans, with Angela Merkel in the lead, must take pride in the words: I\xe2\x80\x99m not a euro-skeptic. I am a skeptic because I am European.'b''b'\n'b'Jochen Bittner 'b' is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit. 'b''b'NEW YORK \xe2\x80\x94  When I told my children we were moving from Russia to America, I promised them paradise, more or less. My parents had done the same when they brought me here 33 years ago, to escape anti-Semitic discrimination. Over the years we had spent waiting for our exit visas, they pored over Soviet \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s\xe2\x80\x99 letters by the yellow kitchen light and culled good news to use against me. Like when they said, in response to my repeated requests, that I could not have a pair of American jeans, which cost a month\xe2\x80\x99s salary on the black market in Moscow, because once we emigrated to America they could buy me jeans for $10.'b'As a young teenager I was equally concerned about not owning a pair of Levi\xe2\x80\x99s and about being Jewish; both circumstances made me a misfit. I was concerned that we were exchanging one country in which Jews were a minority for another. The \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s\xe2\x80\x99 letters contained little information on this: Unlike the price of jeans, ethnicity \xe2\x80\x94 we thought of our Jewishness as an ethnicity, not a religion \xe2\x80\x94 seemed to be a nonissue. I was skeptical, but I had no choice about following my parents out of the country.'b'In Boston, where I went to high school, I quickly learned the very peculiar fact that being Jewish meant being part of the majority \xe2\x80\x94 the white majority. Many Soviet \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s, buoyed by this discovery, adopted rabidly racist attitudes. This embarrassed their kids, the people of my generation, who, as they became American adults, usually moved steadily to the left of their parents.'b'I did that. I also became a journalist, went back to Moscow as an American correspondent in the early 1990s, stayed, restored my Russian citizenship, eventually started a Russian family, and then, a few weeks ago, found myself emigrating again \xe2\x80\x94 this time to escape the Kremlin\xe2\x80\x99s anti-gay campaign.'b'And, just like my parents before me, I found myself promising my children that America would feel different because, for the first time in their lives, they would not feel they were different. My oldest son, like me, looks distinctively non-Russian and has known this his whole life. All of our three children stand apart from the crowd because they are being raised by lesbians. I promised the kids that in America they would just be free to be themselves, unmarked. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention that life without labels, which they have never known, is always the prerogative of the majority.'b'We neighborhood-shopped and chose Harlem \xe2\x80\x94 among other reasons, because many people who are roughly my age and in roughly my field of work are moving to the neighborhood. Soon enough, I was speaking to one such woman. She mentioned she sometimes sensed resentment from Harlem\xe2\x80\x99s old-timers. She said she had been the target of \xe2\x80\x9cracist remarks.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I cringed. This woman was white, and the remarks had been made by people who were not. And I knew there was no such thing as \xe2\x80\x9creverse racism\xe2\x80\x9d: You cannot be the object of racial discrimination if you are a member of the powerful majority. I had learned this as an American before I became a Russian again.'b'The day after that conversation, my 12-year-old daughter took her toddler brother to a playground, only to return very soon and very shaken.'b'This park is Harlem in miniature. There are two playgrounds, less than 300 yards apart, an old basic one and a new shiny one. In the new playground, well-dressed toddlers of different races, most of them minded by dark-skinned nannies, played together. At the old one, a few black kids played while their older siblings kept reluctant watch. A couple of drunken men loitered nearby. Apparently, one of them had lashed out at my daughter, calling her a \xe2\x80\x9cwhite bitch.\xe2\x80\x9d He then collected his kids from the playground, making it clear this was done on her account.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t this racism?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked me, shocked.'b'Somehow, my model, which denied the possibility of racism directed against the majority, could not account for the power dynamics involved in being a child being berated by an adult.'b'Back home, the first contender for the position of the toddler\xe2\x80\x99s nanny showed up for her interview. She was a Russian speaker who has lived in New York for many years, and as soon as she walked through the door, she started berating black and Latino nannies, who, she said, can\xe2\x80\x99t even take care of their own children. I ushered her out as soon as I could.'b'This kind of racism we were used to, and it was a good starting point for the complicated conversation I\xe2\x80\x99ll be having with my kids as we all learn to live in America.'b''b'\n'b'Masha Gessen\xe2\x80\x99s 'b' latest book is \xe2\x80\x9cWords Will Break Cement: The Passion of Pussy Riot.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Stanford, Calif. \xe2\x80\x94  As Iranian and Western diplomats continue to negotiate over Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, the details will matter more and more. Obstinacy and obfuscation will return the two sides to deadlock. But there is hope for the long term if Iran and America are willing to break with the past.'b'Iran has very little to show for its 50 years of nuclear pursuit. It has only one commercial reactor ready for electricity production at Bushehr that was supplied by Russia without Iran learning much about the technologies needed for the manufacturing and construction of reactors. The country also has an aging 1960s-era American-supplied research reactor on its last legs of medical isotope production.'b'The heavy-water reactor Iran is building at Arak, ostensibly for medical isotope production, remains a major hurdle in negotiations. The current reactor design appears much better suited for producing bomb-grade plutonium than for civilian uses \xe2\x80\x94 and if producing plutonium were the goal, it would take several years for such production.'b'Iran\xe2\x80\x99s pride and joy, its uranium centrifuge program, can enrich in one year as much uranium as the European consortium, Urenco, can produce in about five hours. A ten-fold increase in Iran\xe2\x80\x99s centrifuge capacity would be required to enrich enough uranium fuel for its Bushehr reactor alone. And no matter how many more centrifuges Iran installs, it can never become self-sufficient because it does not possess adequate uranium ore reserves for a large-scale nuclear energy program. It could purchase enrichment services on the global marketplace just as it would have to buy the natural uranium to feed into the centrifuges.'b'All Iran has today is the capacity to produce small amounts of reactor fuel or, if it decides to, one or two bomb\xe2\x80\x99s worth of highly enriched uranium per year (which it would then need to weaponize).'b'Meanwhile, the direct costs of its nuclear pursuit have been enormous. And the indirect costs to the nation of keeping the nuclear weapons option open, in terms of political and scientific isolation plus economic sanctions, are staggering. If Iran\xe2\x80\x99s endgame really is a civilian nuclear power program, it will require a fundamentally different approach.'b'The best economic option for Tehran would simply be to get out of the nuclear fuel-cycle business altogether, but this is unlikely given Iran\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on its sovereign right to nuclear energy.'b'A second option would be to settle for a modest nuclear electricity program relying on the Bushehr reactor and construction of one or two more Russian-built reactors. Iran could maintain the current arrangement with Russia \xe2\x80\x94 that is, have Moscow supply the nuclear fuel and take back the spent fuel. Iran could then simply forgo all indigenous nuclear power development, including enrichment and the final disposal of spent fuel. It would not be doing so under pressure, but rather acting in its own best interest.'b'If Iran insists on a large and mostly indigenous nuclear electricity program, it can succeed only through international cooperation, not isolation. Like South Korea and Japan, Iran can never become fully independent because it lacks large indigenous uranium resources. It takes decades for countries without an established industrial and regulatory nuclear infrastructure to produce large amounts of nuclear electricity and requires close cooperation with established nuclear suppliers.'b'The lesson for Iran, based on other nations\xe2\x80\x99 experiences, is that it should concentrate on developing the capability to fabricate reactor fuel elements and reactor components, and learning how to build nuclear power plants. Japan and South Korea became leading global reactor vendors by doing so. This could constitute a pragmatic and honorable choice. Domestic enrichment would be abandoned because it isn\xe2\x80\x99t economical. And Iran would forgo the reprocessing of spent fuel because it isn\xe2\x80\x99t cost effective.'b'Such a solution offers the best opportunities for technical and industrial development with greatest economic gain and least danger of proliferation.'b'For the Arak reactor, Iran can still make technical changes that would reduce the proliferation risk and agree to send spent fuel out of the country to eliminate concerns about plutonium production.'b'A radical but even better solution would be to cooperate with other countries that sell and build reactors and tailor the design for medical and research applications in order to limit fears of proliferation. Such reactors are typically operated as international facilities. One is being constructed by South Korea in Jordan and an Argentine-built reactor has operated in Australia for the past six years. Such an arrangement would bring Iran into a cooperative relationship with the International Atomic Energy Agency instead of a confrontational one and integrate, rather than isolate, its nuclear program.'b'Sixty years after President Dwight D. Eisenhower announced the Atoms for Peace program, one lesson is clear: Civilian nuclear programs flourish only through cooperation and openness. Secrecy and isolation are typically signs of a nuclear weapons program.'b'If Iran accepts these pragmatic approaches to nuclear energy, it can resolve the nuclear stalemate in a manner that serves its people well and is acceptable to the international community.'b'Appropriately timed sanctions relief could then convince Tehran to implement the Additional Protocol of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which would provide the unprecedented transparency required to demonstrate the peaceful nature of its program.'b'A successful nuclear deal would also provide an enormous boost for beleaguered global nonproliferation efforts and possibly lead to a productive American-Iranian relationship that could deal with the many complex security problems impeding stability in the Middle East.'b''b'\n'b'Siegfried S.

Some politicians have been accused of boosting their apparent popularity on social media with legions of followers who don\xe2\x80\x99t exist and of using social media to smear their opponents.

Over the next hundred days, Hutu militia groups murdered at least half a million members of the Tutsi minority, along with tens of thousands of \xe2\x80\x9cmoderate\xe2\x80\x9d Hutus. These massacres took place against the backdrop of a war that pitted the Hutu-dominated regime against Tutsi-led insurgents who had invaded Rwanda from neighboring Uganda.'b'Whether the genocide was planned, and was thus foreseeable, has been hotly debated by scholars, politicians and lawyers.

While his prediction of mass murder of Tutsis by Hutu militia groups proved chillingly accurate, he misled United Nations peacekeepers on some key points.'b'Important details about his background and eventual fate are contained in a 2003 'b'interview'b' with his wife by tribunal investigators that has never been officially released but is now available. At the time of his marriage, in 1990, he worked as a driver for a senior Rwandan official. In the turmoil following the rebel invasion, Jean-Pierre used his connections to become an intermediary to the Interahamwe militia, whose principal goal was to defend the Hutu-dominated regime.'b'Curiously, the fact that he was married to a Tutsi and was the product of a mixed Tutsi-Hutu marriage does not seem to have affected his advancement in the Interahamwe, at least until the end of 1993. Around this time, he told his wife that he might have to kill her because the ruling party was planning to carry out \xe2\x80\x9cmassacres.\xe2\x80\x9d As she told investigators, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I am Tutsi and his mother was Tutsi, I understood this to mean that the massacres were going to be against the Tutsi population.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Jean-Pierre told General Dallaire\xe2\x80\x99s aides in January 1994 that he had been instructed to register \xe2\x80\x9call Tutsis\xe2\x80\x9d living in Kigali, apparently for \xe2\x80\x9ctheir extermination.\xe2\x80\x9d He also said that the Rwandan Army had been supplying the Interahamwe with weapons, and identified several arms caches, including one in the headquarters of the ruling party. The Interahamwe went on to commit many of the murders during the genocide.'b'The Arusha-based international tribunal has found that the Rwandan Army channeled weapons to the Interahamwe and provided military training to militia members. But tribunal judges were not convinced that the purpose of that training was the \xe2\x80\x9cextermination\xe2\x80\x9d of Tutsis, as Jean-Pierre claimed, rather than preparation for renewed hostilities with the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front. They found that the Interahamwe had drawn up lists of \xe2\x80\x9csuspected opponents of the regime,\xe2\x80\x9d but such lists were \xe2\x80\x9cnot focused exclusively on ethnicity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Evidence submitted to the tribunal showed that Jean-Pierre may have had other motives for seeking United Nations protection. He had fallen out with party leaders who suspected him of selling arms to rebels in Burundi. Some witnesses believe he might have been an agent of the Rwandan Patriotic Front assigned to penetrate the Interahamwe.'b'While there is no reliable evidence to back the claim that he was an R.P.F. agent in January 1994, it is clear that he had connections to opposition parties allied with the Tutsi-led rebels. According to United Nations cables, a Hutu opposition leader named Faustin Twagiramungu served as Jean-Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s conduit to General Dallaire. These connections caused French and Belgian analysts to suspect that Jean-Pierre might be spreading \xe2\x80\x9cdisinformation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In his 2003 memoir, \xe2\x80\x9cShake Hands With the Devil,\xe2\x80\x9d General Dallaire raised the possibility that his informant had \xe2\x80\x9csimply melted back into the Interahamwe, angry and disillusioned at our vacillation and ineffectiveness, and become a genocidaire.\xe2\x80\x9d Jean-Pierre told the general\xe2\x80\x99s aides at their final meeting in February 1994 that he was planning to go to Zaire, for \xe2\x80\x9ccommando training.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Instead, he went to Tanzania where he joined the R.P.F., according to his wife. In late March, two weeks before the president\xe2\x80\x99s assassination, he moved to a rebel-held enclave in northern Rwanda, where he was reported to be \xe2\x80\x9cin very good books with senior members of the R.P.F.\xe2\x80\x9d In late 1994, a minister in Rwanda\xe2\x80\x99s new Tutsi-led government informed the family that Jean-Pierre had been \xe2\x80\x9c'b'killed in battle'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The circumstances of his death remain a mystery. As his wife told investigators, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not know how he died and where.\xe2\x80\x9d She was unable even to establish whether he was \xe2\x80\x9csurely dead.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'General Dallaire has told the tribunal that he operated on \xe2\x80\x9cinstinct\xe2\x80\x9d in sending the genocide fax, which was followed up by a series of warnings to New York in early 1994 that were rebuffed or ignored. He sensed that the peacekeeping force had to reassert its authority. But his superiors in New York needed something more than their field commander\xe2\x80\x99s instincts to justify aggressive action.'b'Newly released State Department records show that United Nations officials briefed the United States, Belgium and France on the emerging crisis, but there was zero enthusiasm in the Clinton administration following the \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Hawk Down\xe2\x80\x9d debacle in Somalia in October 1993. Much stronger intelligence would have been necessary to disrupt the passivity of senior decision makers.'b'The \xe2\x80\x9cJean-Pierre\xe2\x80\x9d revelations are a tantalizing indication of how much we still have to learn about the Rwandan genocide. Records that could shed light on whether it could have been prevented are still classified in Washington, New York, Paris, Brussels, Geneva, Arusha and Kigali \xe2\x80\x94 unavailable to the public despite pledges by international leaders to fully investigate the tragedy.

And a funny thing happened on the way to this anniversary. Suddenly, or so it seems, progressives have stopped apologizing for their efforts on behalf of the poor, and have started trumpeting them instead. And conservatives find themselves on the defensive.'b'It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to be this way. For a long time, everyone knew \xe2\x80\x94 or, more accurately, \xe2\x80\x9cknew\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 that the war on poverty had been an abject failure. And they knew why: It was the fault of the poor themselves. But what everyone knew wasn\xe2\x80\x99t true, and the public seems to have caught on.'b'The narrative went like this: Antipoverty programs hadn\xe2\x80\x99t actually reduced poverty, because poverty in America was basically a social problem \xe2\x80\x94 a problem of broken families, crime and a culture of dependence that was only reinforced by government aid. And because this narrative was so widely accepted, bashing the poor was good politics, enthusiastically embraced by Republicans and some Democrats, too.'b'Yet this view of poverty, which may have had some truth to it in the 1970s, bears no resemblance to anything that has happened since.'b'For one thing, the war on poverty has, in fact, achieved quite a lot. It\xe2\x80\x99s true that the standard measure of poverty hasn\xe2\x80\x99t fallen much. But this measure doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include the value of crucial public programs like food stamps and the earned-income tax credit. Once these programs are taken into account, 'b'the data show a significant decline in poverty'b', and a much larger decline in extreme poverty. Other evidence also points to a big improvement in the lives of America\xe2\x80\x99s poor: lower-income Americans are much healthier and better-nourished than they were in the 1960s.'b'Furthermore, there is strong evidence that antipoverty programs have 'b'long-term benefits'b', both to their recipients and to the nation as a whole. For example, children who had access to food stamps were healthier and had higher incomes in later life than people who didn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'And if progress against poverty has nonetheless been disappointingly slow \xe2\x80\x94 which it has \xe2\x80\x94 blame rests not with the poor but with a changing labor market, one that no longer offers good wages to ordinary workers. Wages used to rise along with worker productivity, but that linkage ended around 1980. The bottom third of the American work force has seen little or no rise in inflation-adjusted wages since the early 1970s; the bottom third of male workers has experienced a sharp wage decline. 'b'This wage stagnation'b', not social decay, is the reason poverty has proved so hard to eradicate.'b'Or to put it a different way, the problem of poverty has become part of the broader problem of rising income inequality, of an economy in which all the fruits of growth seem to go to a small elite, leaving everyone else behind.'b'So how should we respond to this reality?'b'The conservative position, essentially, is that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t respond. Conservatives are committed to the view that government is always the problem, never the solution; they treat every beneficiary of a safety-net program as if he or she were \xe2\x80\x9ca Cadillac-driving welfare queen.\xe2\x80\x9d And why not? After all, for decades their position was a political winner, because middle-class Americans saw \xe2\x80\x9cwelfare\xe2\x80\x9d as something that Those People got but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'But that was then. At this point, the rise of the 1 percent at the expense of everyone else is so obvious that it\xe2\x80\x99s no longer possible to shut down any discussion of rising inequality with cries of \xe2\x80\x9cclass warfare.\xe2\x80\x9d Meanwhile, hard times have forced many more Americans to turn to safety-net programs. And as conservatives have responded by defining an ever-growing fraction of the population as morally unworthy \xe2\x80\x9ctakers\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a quarter, a third, 47 percent, whatever \xe2\x80\x94 they have made themselves look callous and meanspirited.'b'You can see the new political dynamics at work in 'b'the fight over aid to the unemployed'b'. Republicans are still opposed to extended benefits, despite high long-term unemployment. But they have, revealingly, changed their arguments. Suddenly, it\xe2\x80\x99s not about forcing those lazy bums to find jobs; it\xe2\x80\x99s about fiscal responsibility. And nobody believes a word of it.'b'Meanwhile, progressives are on offense. They have decided that inequality is a winning political issue. They see war-on-poverty programs like food stamps, Medicaid, and the earned-income tax credit as success stories, initiatives that have helped Americans in need \xe2\x80\x94 especially during the slump since 2007 \xe2\x80\x94 and should be expanded. And if these programs enroll a growing number of Americans, rather than being narrowly targeted on the poor, so what?'b'So guess what: On its 50th birthday, the war on poverty no longer looks like a failure. It looks, instead, like a template for a rising, increasingly confident progressive movement.'b'If you just listened to Republican politicians, you\xe2\x80\x99d have almost no sense that conservative thinking has changed much since Barack Obama beat Mitt Romney over a year ago. But if you hang around the conservative policy wonks, and read certain conservative magazines, the picture is quite different.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99d invite you, for example, to cast your eye over the new issue of 'b'National Affairs'b', the right-leaning policy journal edited by Yuval Levin. You\xe2\x80\x99ll find nine different articles that hang together coherently around what could well be the dominant style of conservatism of the coming years. This is the conservatism of skeptical reform.'b'This conservatism is oriented, first, around social problems, not government. For many years, conservatives spoke as if runaway government was the only major threat facing the country. Defining themselves against government, Republican politicians had no governing agenda for people facing concrete needs.'b'But the emerging conservatives begin their analysis by looking at concrete problems: how to help the unemployed move to where they can find jobs; how to help gifted students from poor families reach their potential. If you start by looking at these specific matters, then even conservatives conclude that, in properly limited ways, government can be a useful tool. Government is not the only solution, but it is also not the only problem.'b'In the lead essay of the issue, 'b'Michael R. Strain looks at broken labor markets'b'. Strain embraces some traditional conservative ideas, like streamlining regulations, but also some ideas that use government power: public investments in infrastructure, more aggressive monetary policy, wage subsidies, cash bonuses for people who get off unemployment insurance and find jobs, relocation subsidies to help the unemployed move.'b'Second, this conservatism is populist about ends but not means. Over the past decade, many Republican politicians have spread the message that the country\xe2\x80\x99s problems would be easily solved if only the nefarious elites would get out of the way and allow the common people to take over. Members of this conservatism are more likely to conclude that, in fact, problems are complex and there are no easy answers, but there is room for policy expertise, and perhaps philosophical rigor, even if it comes from Washington.'b'But these experts should focus on specific needs and desires of working-class Americans, not gripes and obsessions of the Republican donor community. \xe2\x80\x9cModern conservatives have tended to discount the moral value of the average person, focusing instead on extolling the moral superiority of the great.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'Henry Olsen of the Ethics and Public Policy Center writes'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cHow many times in recent years have conservative leaders told us about the virtuous entrepreneur?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Third, this conservatism supports effective government, not technocratic government. Like all proper conservatism, it begins with a sense of epistemological modesty, a sense that the world is too complicated to be centrally planned. Therefore, it opposes the style of government embodied in Obamacare, where officials in the center define insurance products and then compel people to buy them.'b'This conservatism knows that central decision-makers, even conservative ones, are no match for complex reality. Therefore, they favor market mechanisms, which take advantage of dispersed knowledge. They prefer simple programs to complex ones. In National Affairs, 'b'Eli Lehrer and Lori Sanders argue'b' that a carefully structured income support grant could replace the morass of existing welfare programs for the poor.'b'Fourth, this conservatism is skeptical in temper, especially about itself. Recently, conservatives have been filled with fervor and conviction, and regarded compromise as selling out. Some recent conservatives have ideologized the Constitution, turning it into a rigid system that answers every political question for us. But the founders constructed a constitutional order that left room for different policy approaches; that was humble before the evolving needs of the future; and that required compromise and coalition building. The founders did not believe in concentrating power in the hands of any group of highly fallible individuals.'b'Today\xe2\x80\x99s emerging conservatives embrace that constitutional mind-set, embodied both by Madison and Hamilton. Moreover, the National Affairs authors understand that most policy programs, like most businesses, fail. Conservative programs like urban enterprise zones failed to produce measurable results. Liberal programs like Head Start scarcely produce identifiable long-term gains. Therefore, it is best to approach government in a mood of skeptical reformism: Engage in a constant process of gradual concrete reform even as you are aware that most of your efforts will not pan out.'b'The Republican style of recent years has produced a vacuum where concrete proposals should be. The emerging conservatives won\xe2\x80\x99t have to argue with or defeat the more populist factions on the right; they can just fill the vacuum. Republican politicians, when they are asked to come up with specific programs, will find there is no other game in town.'b'IN New Jersey, we like our politicians to be entertaining.'b'Watching Chris Christie writhe for what seemed like hours yesterday, denying he knew anything about what has become known as Bridgegate, might have given joy to the \xe2\x80\x9cjust desserts\xe2\x80\x9d crowd.

When he was feeling partisan, he hired a helicopter to buzz the county Republican picnic and blow things around.'b'A little more in the Jersey tough-guy style was a Gewertz opponent, State Senator James M. Turner. He masterminded a plot to plant drugs in Mr. Gewertz\xe2\x80\x99s home in an attempt to frame and ruin him. Senator Turner got five years in prison for that practical joke, but won the Republican primary before disappearing behind bars.'b'The Republican governor Christie Whitman, who ran the state in the 1990s before quitting in 2001 to join George W. Bush in Washington, was entertaining in her own stiff, waspy way. She once allowed herself to be photographed frisking a young black man against a wall during a state police sweep in Camden. The dopey grin on her face made the photo.'b'Nobody much cared that her successor, Jim McGreevey, was, as he put it, \xe2\x80\x9ca gay American.\xe2\x80\x9d What we minded was that he appointed his untrained and incompetent squeeze, an Israeli public relations man, as his homeland security adviser. That put the personal far above the job we expect a governor to do. Mr. McGreevey wasn\xe2\x80\x99t funny, either, although I suppose it was kind of funny, in a pathetic sort of way, that his career imploded when his paramour threatened to sue him for sexual harassment after Mr. McGreevey had installed the guy in a $110,000 state job.'b'Governor Christie, with hardly any visible qualifications, was named United States attorney for New Jersey in 2002. This is a great job. Kim Kardashian could find corruption in New Jersey and get convictions. We have dishonest politicians so stupid that they will risk jail for a no-show job or a free driveway paving. So Mr. Christie had good conviction numbers in the office, then had the great good fortune of running for governor against Jon Corzine, an unpopular Wall Street guy, right after Wall Street crashed the entire American economy.'b'The Fort Lee scandal happened because Mr. Christie (or his aides) weren\xe2\x80\x99t content with winning re-election. He wanted to run up the score and pose as a unifier, despite his documented history of publicly abusing those who disagreed with him. The news conference yesterday was perfect. He said he had just learned what everybody in the state had suspected for weeks \xe2\x80\x94 that his own people had created a traffic nightmare in Fort Lee to get back at its Democratic mayor. Then he slagged his own people and called them names. Then he wallowed in self-pity for the way they had betrayed him. That\xe2\x80\x99s pitiful, not entertaining.'b'Humbug, as we say in Paramus.

If they were incompetents, they were his handpicked incompetents, with whom he was perfectly content until the heat rose on his personal backside.'b'As my friend Tom O\xe2\x80\x99Neil, who has been watching the parade of Jersey pols for decades, put it, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why there are no-show jobs, so the clowns who got you elected don\xe2\x80\x99t mess things up by going to work.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s funny.'b'In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that no prominent banker would be prosecuted for fraud in the run-up to the financial crisis. In 'b'the current issue of The New York Review of Books'b', 'b'Judge Jed Rakoff'b' of the Federal District Court in Manhattan asks why.'b'The comforting answer \xe2\x80\x94 that no fraud was committed \xe2\x80\x94 is possible, but implausible. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile officials of the Department of Justice have been more circumspect in describing the roots of the financial crisis than have the various commissions of inquiry and other government agencies,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cI have seen nothing to indicate their disagreement with the widespread conclusion that fraud at every level permeated the bubble in mortgage-backed securities.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'So why no high-level prosecutions? According to Judge Rakoff, evidence of fraud without prosecution of fraud indicates prosecutorial weaknesses.'b'This is not the first time Judge Rakoff has weighed in on the prosecutorial response to the financial crisis. In 2011, 'b'he rejected a settlement'b' between Citigroup and the Securities and Exchange Commission because it did not require the bank to admit wrongdoing.'b'His insights on financial-crisis cases also apply to cases that have emerged since then, like JPMorgan Chase\xe2\x80\x99s settlement with the government 'b'this week'b' over the bank\xe2\x80\x99s role in Bernard Madoff\xe2\x80\x99s Ponzi scheme.'b'Under the deal, JPMorgan Chase, which served as Mr. Madoff\xe2\x80\x99s primary bank for more than two decades, must pay a $1.7 billion penalty, essentially for turning a blind eye to Mr. Madoff\xe2\x80\x99s fraud. It must also take steps to improve its anti-money-laundering controls. And it had to acknowledge, among other facts, that shortly before the fraud was revealed, the bank withdrew nearly $300 million of its money from Madoff-related funds.'b'By adhering to the settlement terms, the bank will avoid criminal indictment on two felony violations of the Bank Secrecy Act. No individuals were named or charged.'b'And that is the problem. Until relatively recently, it was rare for corporations to face criminal charges without the simultaneous prosecution of managers or executives. That changed over the past three decades, as prosecutors shifted their focus away from individuals and toward corporations, as if fault resides not in executives, but in corporate culture.'b'That shift, in Judge Rakoff\xe2\x80\x99s view, largely explains the lack of banker prosecutions from the financial crisis. It also explains the JPMorgan Chase settlement in the Madoff case. A likely consequence of this approach is more wrongdoing, since, as Judge Rakoff argues, imposing compliance measures that are often just window-dressing is far less potent than \xe2\x80\x9cthe future deterrent value of successfully prosecuting individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Even worse is the distortion of justice. In the financial crisis, prosecutors not only took a hands-off approach to bankers, but to banks as well for fear that indicting a big bank could harm the economy.'b'The JPMorgan Chase settlement in the Madoff case also sidesteps justice by relying on \xe2\x80\x9cdeferred prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d That tactic, wrote Judge Rakoff, makes prosecutors happy because they tell themselves that the threat of prosecution will deter future crime; it makes corporations happy because they avoid indictment; and happiest of all are the executives or former executives responsible for the misconduct who are left untouched.'b'In addition, he explains, deferred prosecution is \xe2\x80\x9ctechnically suspect\xe2\x80\x9d because, under the law, prosecutors should not threaten to indict a company unless they can prove that some company manager committed the alleged crime, and if that can be proved, why not indict the manager? He also finds it \xe2\x80\x9cmorally suspect\xe2\x80\x9d because it punishes innocent shareholders and employees for wrongdoing committed by unprosecuted individuals.'b'As the myriad cases against JPMorgan Chase and other banks demonstrate, misconduct was not limited to the mortgage bubble. But unless prosecutorial weaknesses are remedied, justice will continue to prove elusive.'b'Fifty years ago this Saturday, on Jan. 11, 1964, a myth-shattering surgeon general\xe2\x80\x99s report on smoking and health brushed aside years of obfuscation by tobacco companies and asserted, based on 7,000 scientific articles, that smoking caused lung cancer and was linked to other serious diseases. Those findings expanded as more data was gathered.'b'Research since then has shown that tobacco can cause or exacerbate a wide range of diseases, including heart disease, stroke, multiple kinds of cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, asthma and diabetes, and can injure nonsmokers who breathe in the toxic fumes secondhand. The death toll from tobacco remains stubbornly high but can be driven down by using a range of new and proven tactics.'b'By some measures, the 50-year campaign to rein in tobacco use has been an enormous success. The percentage of American adults who smoke dropped from 42 percent in 1965 to 18 percent in 2012. A 'b'study published'b' in the Journal of the American Medical Association this week estimated that tobacco control measures adopted since 1964 have saved eight million Americans from premature death and extended their lives by an average of almost 20 years.'b'Experts attribute the gains to vigorous campaigns to educate people about the dangers of smoking; increases in cigarette taxes; state and local laws that protect half the nation\xe2\x80\x99s population from tobacco fumes in workplaces, bars and restaurants; restrictions on advertising; prohibition of sales to minors; and various prevention and cessation programs financed by states or private insurance.'b'Despite these gains, nearly 44 million American adults still smoke, more than 440,000 Americans die every year from smoking, and eight million Americans live with at least one serious chronic disease from smoking. Medical costs connected to smoking are nearly $96 billion a year, with an additional $97 billion lost in productivity because of illness.'b'On Wednesday, several health organizations, including the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, the American Cancer Society, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids 'b'called for a new national commitment'b' to drive smoking among adults down to less than 10 percent over the next decade; protect all Americans from secondhand smoke within five years by having every state enact laws against smoking in all workplaces, bars and restaurants; and ultimately eliminate death and disease caused by tobacco.'b'It won\xe2\x80\x99t be easy. The tobacco industry spends more than $8 billion a year to market cigarettes and other tobacco products in this country, with much of its marketing slyly aimed at young people.'b'The industry is also invading foreign markets, often in less developed countries, in an effort to make addicts of millions more customers to replace those in industrialized nations. Although smoking rates among adults around the globe have fallen sharply since 1980, the number of smokers has increased significantly along with population growth and will continue to increase as national incomes and populations rise. The United States government must help counter the tobacco industry\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to spread its noxious products around the world.'b'Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey issued 'b'repeated apologies'b' Thursday for the abuse of office that now threatens to undermine his political future. Though he sounded remorseful \xe2\x80\x94 and clearly sorry that this scandal might sink his ambitions for national office \xe2\x80\x94 he blamed his staff for making him a victim. Unbeknown to him, he said, they shut down lanes to the George Washington Bridge to create a four-day traffic jam to punish a local mayor who failed to endorse him in last year\xe2\x80\x99s election.'b'He said he fired his \xe2\x80\x9cstupid\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdeceitful\xe2\x80\x9d deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause she lied to me\xe2\x80\x9d about the gridlock scheme. Mr. Christie has also asked a Republican operative and former campaign adviser, Bill Stepien, to withdraw as a candidate to take over the state Republican Party. He, too, was on the email chain. Two of Mr. Christie\xe2\x80\x99s appointees to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, David Wildstein and Bill Baroni, resigned in December as news of the traffic vendetta became public.'b'Through his 108-minute news conference, Mr. Christie insisted over and over that he knew absolutely nothing about this illegal scheme. He was \xe2\x80\x9cblindsided\xe2\x80\x9d with the news on Wednesday morning, he said. That was the first time he said he saw emails showing how his aides gleefully plotted to shut down traffic lanes to punish Mayor Mark Sokolich of Fort Lee, N.J. For that reason, he said he is \xe2\x80\x9cembarrassed and humiliated.\xe2\x80\x9d This version of reality simply does not add up.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s good news that the United States attorney for New Jersey, Paul Fishman, has opened an inquiry into the matter and can make certain that all parties testify under oath. While the State Assembly has done a good job of investigating the Fort Lee scandal, it is important that the case be examined by a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s office.'b'There are plenty of questions that Mr. Christie and his aides, current and former, need to answer.'b'First, is it plausible that officials as high up as Ms. Kelly and Mr. Christie\xe2\x80\x99s top appointees at the Port Authority, which controls the bridge, would decide to seek revenge and create this traffic chaos on their own?'b'Did Mr. Christie know in December, when Mr. Baroni and Mr. Wildstein resigned, that these two members of his inner circle had taken part in the scheme? Did he ever ask them what happened?'b'The email documents released on Wednesday were heavily redacted. Why? And when will the full emails be made public?'b'Why did Mr. Christie insist that the traffic snarl was connected to a \xe2\x80\x9ctraffic study,\xe2\x80\x9d even after Port Authority officials denied there was any such study? Did he try to get the Port Authority to stop its own internal investigation of the problem?'b'As governor for the last four years, Mr. Christie has 'b'earned a reputation'b' for running a very tight operation and is known as a top-down, hands-on leader. If he cannot control his top aides, can he be trusted to manage the entire state?'b'What makes Mr. Christie\xe2\x80\x99s claim of victimhood hard to accept is his own history of vindictive behavior. For instance, a Rutgers professor lost financing for a project because he voted against the governor on a redistricting commission. A Republican colleague who had a disagreement with Mr. Christie was disinvited to an event in his own district. Mr. Christie has denied that he sent signals to his staff to punish anyone who crossed him. \xe2\x80\x9cI am who I am, but I am not a bully,\xe2\x80\x9d he said Thursday. But he has set a tone that makes abusive actions acceptable.'b'Mr. Christie has promised to cooperate with investigators \xe2\x80\x94 a vow he and his staff must honor. At this point, the governor has zero credibility. His office has abused its power, and only a full and conclusive investigation can restore public trust in his administration.'b'Regarding \xe2\x80\x9cMy Jewish state\xe2\x80\x9d (Opinion, Jan. 2): Far from being \xe2\x80\x9ca complicating diversion when none is needed,\xe2\x80\x9d as Roger Cohen alleges, explicit recognition by the Palestinian Arab leadership that Israel is a Jewish state is, in fact, fundamental to any long-term definitive resolution of the Arab-Israeli dispute. This is because the roots of this conflict are religious, not territorial, and are to be located in the refusal of Islam to acquiesce in any semblance of Jewish national self-determination (and hence independence) in any part of the Dar al-Islam (The House, or Realm, of Islam). This view of the Jews has informed and continues to inform the obduracy of a succession of Palestinian-Arab spokesmen and negotiators. Its public repudiation is central, therefore, to genuine peacemaking in the region.'b''b'Geoffrey Alderman, Buckingham, England'b''b'The writer is a professor of politics and contemporary history at the University of Buckingham.'b'\xc2\xa0'b''b'The life of the solitary reader'b''b'Regarding \xe2\x80\x9cLoneliness of the long-distance reader\xe2\x80\x9d (Opinion, Jan. 6): I realize that the focus of Colin Robinson\xe2\x80\x99s essay was on the writer, publisher and reviewer, and the dearth of well-paying jobs in these fields. And I can identify with that, as a technical author, copywriter and wannabe novelist. There are very few opportunities over here in Belgium at the moment, and thus this reality becomes a driving force to sit down every day and work on the novel. Ultimately, I spend more time reading than writing, and it often feels very lonely, especially when I seem to have no one with whom to discuss what I\xe2\x80\x99m reading.'b'So the title of this piece clearly resonated with me, but as a reader, not as a writer, and as one who is enjoying the ease of ordering books online and having a wealth of material at my fingertips. I\xe2\x80\x99ve discovered that I much more enjoy getting wrapped up in a gripping tale of fiction on my Kindle than watching a mini-series or film on television. Since I have a lot of free time on my hands, I have the luxury of choosing between the two, and usually opt for the written as opposed to the spoken word.'b'The loneliness comes not just from not having someone to bounce ideas off regarding the book I\xe2\x80\x99m reading, but from the feeling of leaving that fictional world I have been inhabiting and saying goodbye to those characters with whom I have become so intimately entangled. When I experience those withdrawal symptoms, I usually download another title, and dive into another world where I hope I can lose myself.'b'I certainly agree with Virginia Woolf that \xe2\x80\x9cto read a novel is a difficult and complex art,\xe2\x80\x9d and with Mr. Robinson that with today\xe2\x80\x99s addictive entertainment, \xe2\x80\x9cbook-length reading is harder still.\xe2\x80\x9d But I like to say to my friends: \xe2\x80\x9cYou almost always watch your rented movie straight through, not stopping midway and finishing it the next day. And you can often finish an entire season of your favorite mini-series, staring bleary-eyed and exhausted at your television or computer screen at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. So why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you push to finish that great novel that so captivates you?\xe2\x80\x9d Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s because they are afraid of experiencing that loneliness.'b''b'Kirby Hall, Rosi\xc3\xa8res, Belgium'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b''b'More than just a trade pact 'b''b'Regarding \xe2\x80\x9cJoining the new trade club\xe2\x80\x9d (Editorial, Jan. 3): The importance of the Trans-Pacific Partnership extends far beyond the trade realm.

But that study made no quantitative distinction between harmless traces of pesticide products and levels that might be unsafe.'b'As a result, the findings created what you call \xe2\x80\x9can uproar\xe2\x80\x9d mainly by giving people the wrong impression that any detection of residues constitutes a health risk. It does not. In fact, pesticides in Europe are subject to the world\xe2\x80\x99s most stringent regulatory framework, and are shown to be safe for human health and the environment before they are registered for use.'b'The fact that the study found pesticide residues in organic wines should not be alarming, nor taken as a sign of \xe2\x80\x9ccontamination from neighboring vineyards,\xe2\x80\x9d considering that organic wine producers in France and elsewhere can and do use pesticides on their grapes.'b'For the record, it should be noted that in 2012, according the latest data from the Agriculture Ministry, the quantity of pesticides used in agriculture was less than 60,000 metric tons, compared with the 110,000 metric tons that you assert.'b'It is also important to note that the obligation to control the leafhopper that transmits the disease mentioned in the editorial is a prevention measure in very specific areas, with a legal framework based on detection thresholds. The purpose is to thwart the spread of this incurable disease by controlling the insect infestation \xe2\x80\x94 even if a particular grower\xe2\x80\x99s vines are not infected. This is a case in which pesticides are medicine for plants: It\xe2\x80\x99s like a local vaccination campaign.'b'Our industry is committed to the safe and proper use of pesticides in France, across Europe and around the world.

This makes it all the more noteworthy that an 88-year-old German man was charged this week with the murder of 25 people in a wartime massacre in the French village of Oradour-sur-Glane. The case, prosecuted by German authorities, is a reminder of a haunting period of history that must be kept in mind as fresh acts of genocide bedevil the world. In the French massacre, SS troops shot and burned to death 642 people.'b'Anyone tempted to relegate such slaughter to the deep past needs to know of a current development that hardly seems unrelated \xe2\x80\x94 the surge in e-book readership of \xe2\x80\x9cMein Kampf,\xe2\x80\x9d Hitler\xe2\x80\x99s blueprint for the mass extermination of European Jews. The e-book version of the work was reported this week to be the top seller on the Amazon political psychology list. The phenomenon shows that, more than ever, people need to know of the genocide rooted in Hitler\xe2\x80\x99s ideas, and those facts need to be detailed in trials.'b'Since 2001, there have been more than 100 successful legal actions against Nazi war criminals,  according to the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Nazi hunting organization. Dozens more have been prepared, but center workers say other nations are not as committed as Germany to following through on this obligation of justice.

In the last two years, seven countries have forsaken their uranium and plutonium stockpiles, bringing the number of nations still possessing appreciable quantities of nuclear fuel usable for bomb-making down to 25. In 1991, the number was 52.'b'The data comes from the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a private advocacy group that promotes the safekeeping of nuclear materials. Following up on its first report in 2012, the group surveyed the precautions each country had in place and ranked nations based on their security practices. The report issued on Wednesday covered factors like national laws, regulations, participation in international treaties and physical security, including whether a state has armed guards protecting its facilities.'b'The countries deserving special praise \xe2\x80\x94 Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Mexico, Sweden, Ukraine and Vietnam \xe2\x80\x94 effectively gave up their bomb-making capability and now have less than one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of material that can fuel nuclear weapons.'b'Of the countries that still have weapons-usable nuclear material, Australia placed first on the security ranking, because it reduced its supply of nuclear materials and ratified a treaty that commits countries to criminalize acts of nuclear terrorism and bring nuclear criminals to justice. The United States fell to 11th in part because it failed to ratify two nuclear accords.'b'Despite progress, the challenges ahead are daunting. At the bottom of the security rankings were North Korea (25), which is continuing to expand its nuclear weapons program, and Iran (24), which is in negotiations with the United States and other world powers on an agreement to freeze and roll back its program.'b'Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s rank rose to 22, up slightly from two years ago and ahead of India (23), because the Pakistani government took steps to update its nuclear security regulations. Still, both countries are nuclear-armed, have weak safety and security ratings, and are still increasing their nuclear fuel stockpiles for military and civilian purposes.'b'The world is already awash in 2,000 metric tons of weapons-usable nuclear material spread across hundreds of sites around the globe.

His politically motivated \xe2\x80\x9cIndependence Courts\xe2\x80\x9d executed or imprisoned many dissidents. Soon, Turkey imported its penal code from Mussolini\xe2\x80\x99s Fascist Italy, where the law simply served the state, not the citizens. (\xe2\x80\x9cWesternization\xe2\x80\x9d does not always do wonders.)'b'Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s hawkish generals, the self-declared \xe2\x80\x9cguardians\xe2\x80\x9d of Ataturk\xe2\x80\x99s revolution, passionately continued this bad tradition. When they overthrew Adnan Menderes, Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s most popular leader ever, in a coup in 1960, he was subjected to a show trial. When Mr. Menderes asked at the court why he was not given a fair trial, the judge\xe2\x80\x99s answer was telling: \xe2\x80\x9cBecause that is how the power that put you here wishes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For decades, Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s religious conservatives condemned this cynical \xe2\x80\x9cjustice\xe2\x80\x9d and for good reason: They were often its victims. But when those same conservatives rose to power after 2000, with the ascendance of Mr. Erdogan\xe2\x80\x99s Justice and Development Party, known as the A.K.P., they did not abolish the old logic; they just adopted it for their advantage. Now justice was the handmaiden of counterrevolution.'b'This became most evident during the various \xe2\x80\x9ccoup cases\xe2\x80\x9d of 2007-2011 that imprisoned hundreds of military officers and their alleged civilian allies. In these cases, there were certainly some military figures responsible for extrajudicial killings or possible coup attempts. Yet many other suspects were only \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal\xe2\x80\x9d in the ideological sense. As Gareth Jenkins, the only Western journalist who read the colossal indictments in full, observed, the hunt on the coup-makers was blown out of proportion due to a \xe2\x80\x9cconspiratorial worldview\xe2\x80\x9d and through \xe2\x80\x9ccreative interpretation and occasional apparent manipulation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Back then, these coup-hunting conservatives within the judiciary were wholeheartedly supported by Mr. Erdogan, but many whispered that they belonged to a specific religious community: The followers of Fethullah Gulen, a moderate Islamic scholar who lives in Pennsylvania and whose teachings have inspired millions in Turkey and beyond.'b'This Erdogan-Gulen alliance, as many people called it, ultimately won the war against the military old guard, but they could not keep the peace between themselves. Their growing political tension turned into an open political war on Dec. 17, with an unexpected corruption probe that involved four ministers in Mr. Erdogan\xe2\x80\x99s government. The prime minister soon accepted the resignation of those ministers, but also condemned the investigation as a \xe2\x80\x9ccoup attempt.\xe2\x80\x9d He blamed a \xe2\x80\x9csecret organization\xe2\x80\x9d within the judiciary and the police, a conspiratorial cabal directed by the Gulen movement that serves \xe2\x80\x9cforeign powers\xe2\x80\x9d such as the United States and Israel.'b'Since then, in just a month, Mr. Erdogan has pursued a huge purge within the police force, reassigning a staggering 2,500 officers and taking steps to make the judiciary subservient to the executive (such as his new proposal to place the relatively autonomous High Council of Judges and Prosecutors fully under the justice minister), in a reversal of the European Union reforms that his own government had introduced.'b'Last Wednesday, the prosecutor who launched the corruption probe, Zekeriya Oz, once Mr. Erdogan\xe2\x80\x99s favorite due to his leading role in prosecuting military leaders, declared that the prime minister had sent emissaries conveying threats. Mr. Erdogan denied this charge, while the pro-Erdogan media insisted that Mr. Oz himself is corrupt.'b'Objectively speaking, there are good reasons to believe that the corruption probe against the government is politically motivated. After all, it came immediately after the burst of the A.K.P.-Gulen conflict; it is passionately supported by the Gulen movement; and it may influence important local elections in March. But should the political motivations of a prosecutor devalue the evidence he finds? If yes, why was this not an issue during the \xe2\x80\x9ccoup\xe2\x80\x9d cases against the military? And if those cases were really based on manipulated evidence, should we trust the findings of the same prosecutors now?'b'Such questions must be asked in Turkey, but few are asking all of them together. Rather, the warring political camps are focusing only on what benefits their own interests. Some within the secular opposition who once condemned prosecutors such as Mr. Oz as \xe2\x80\x9cthe enemy of the Turkish military\xe2\x80\x9d now praise him for challenging Mr. Erdogan. Meanwhile, some supporters of Mr. Erdogan are arguing, surprisingly, that the Turkish military suffered from a similar judicial \xe2\x80\x9cplot,\xe2\x80\x9d debunking the very cases they once passionately defended.'b'Deep down, this crisis exposes the tragedy of Turkish justice. All political camps seem to believe that justice will only be served when the right people \xe2\x80\x94 their people \xe2\x80\x94 control the judiciary. Moreover, their similarly conspiratorial mind-sets demonize all political opponents as enemies within who need to be cornered and crushed. The result is an endless series of vendettas. Whoever manages to capture state power uses it aggressively, while the victims only grind their teeth and wait for their turn.'b'The only way out is to restructure the Turkish judiciary to make it both independent and nonpartisan, so that it protects the rights of all citizens and rule of law. The current crisis is unlikely to yield any good outcomes soon, but if it can convince more Turks that they really need such a structural, long-lasting solution instead of cosmetic reforms, that will be a significant step forward.'b''b'\n'b'Mustafa Akyol 'b' is a columnist and the author of \xe2\x80\x9cIslam Without Extremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'MONTREAL \xe2\x80\x94 Angela Merkel deemed multiculturalism \xe2\x80\x94 the idea that social harmony is best achieved through celebrating our differences \xe2\x80\x94 a complete failure in Germany.

In 1977, the province passed the French Language Charter, which made French its sole official language and required immigrants to attend French public schools (about 80 percent of Quebecers are native French speakers). Not content to use clean hydroelectric power as its primary energy source, it ratified the Kyoto Accord \xe2\x80\x94 an agreement Canada itself reneged on \xe2\x80\x94 and teamed up with California last year to introduce North America\xe2\x80\x99s first carbon-trading market. And this year, all of its public sector workers and most private ones will be required to adhere to equal-compensation laws, the strongest in North America, that ensure men and women are paid on a par.'b'Quebecers\xe2\x80\x99 dissent from the rest of Canada extends as deep as the country\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution. In 1982, a clause stating the need for the \xe2\x80\x9cpreservation and enhancement of the multicultural heritage of Canadians\xe2\x80\x9d was written into a new Constitution. It is one important reason Quebec, where a quarter of Canada\xe2\x80\x99s people live, has refused to ratify this text that nonetheless holds de facto authority over the province.'b'The Charter of Values is the latest expression of Quebec\xe2\x80\x99s dim view of multiculturalism. Among other things, the bill affirms the secular nature of Quebec\xe2\x80\x99s government and denies religious requests for accommodations of dress in public sector employment: After a transition period, government workers would have to refrain from wearing conspicuous religious symbols \xe2\x80\x94 for instance, the Muslim hijab, the Sikh turban or the Christian cross \xe2\x80\x94 while on the job.'b'As usual, though, when Quebec veers from the Canadian path, controversy breaks out. The Ottawan government has even vowed to challenge the charter in the national courts if it passes. Critics are claiming that the bill infringes on the liberties of Muslims and other minorities. Oddly, though, they do not balk at the current ban, for all government workers, on the expression of other social or political beliefs through their attire.'b'For no clear reason, multiculturalists seem to think some personal preferences are more permissibly expressed by government workers than others. In any case, a truly secular state should not permit the symbols of any religion, whether of the majority or a minority, to breach the wall between church and state advocated by no less than Thomas Jefferson; hence the Parti Qu\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa9cois\xe2\x80\x99 decision to remove the crucifix that famously hangs in the legislature.'b'The charter is actually just the next logical step along the path of secularization. Until 1960, when its authority began to dip, the Roman Catholic Church held much sway in Quebec. It was only 20 years ago that Christian school boards were secularized and only 10 that Catholic and Protestant classes were moved out of the schools and into the churches. Members of the Catholic Church in Quebec used to wear religious gear in the public sector, but gradually shed it in the \xe2\x80\x9960s and \xe2\x80\x9970s. So the return of religious vestments in the public sector can be seen as a regression.'b'Interestingly, women in Quebec are especially likely to see it so. And indeed, the defense of gender equality is a pillar of the charter. It states that no one, man or woman, can work for the state with face covered \xe2\x80\x94 for instance, by the facial veils of the Muslim burqa and niqab \xe2\x80\x94 because such an act would imply inequality and segregation. The bill also clearly signals that no one can refuse to be served by a female public worker.'b'Quebec\xe2\x80\x99s approach to the separation of church and state is thus rigorous, progressive and modern. It is, in fact, in cosmopolitan Montreal, not in more homogeneous French regions of Quebec, that one finds the strongest supporters of the religious neutrality of state employees\xe2\x80\x99 attire: 61 percent of the Francophone majority living in the city. (Admittedly, Montreal\xe2\x80\x99s Anglophone minority is very much opposed, five to one.)'b'But anyone familiar with Quebec knows its distinctive mix of European (especially French) and American values. That European courts have granted considerable legal leeway to implement measures that promote state neutrality and gender equality is significant to Quebecers. And the ban on public employees\xe2\x80\x99 wearing religious and other symbols has actually been on the books in France for about a century: Christian professors, Jewish doctors and Muslim judges know that, from 9 to 5, they work in a neutral zone where such symbols are out of place.'b'If the charter does pass \xe2\x80\x94 a vote is expected in the spring \xe2\x80\x94 the very federal Constitution that Quebec has never approved might be invoked to strike it down. But the Canadian Supreme Court has a history of surprising governments in its major rulings, and it has become less enamored with multiculturalism in recent decisions. In fact, throughout the country, multiculturalists have been increasingly on the defensive in recent years, not least because of the concern over the multiplication of ethnic enclaves. Around 40 percent of Canadians outside Quebec support the Quebec Charter.'b'In a very real sense, the debate over Quebec\xe2\x80\x99s charter may be the last stand of Canada\xe2\x80\x99s multiculturalist experiment. Whatever the immediate outcome, it may be only a matter of time until Canadian multiculturalism finds itself buried alongside its European siblings.'b''b' 'b'Jean-Fran\xc3\xa7ois Lis\xc3\xa9e 'b' is Quebec minister for the Montreal area and for international affairs. 'b''b'DUBLIN \xe2\x80\x94  I was talking just before Christmas to a young man who sells shoes in a department store in Dublin. He told me that a television news crew had filmed interviews in the store the previous day. They wanted to know if sales were picking up during the vital holiday period, indicating that the battered Irish economy was, after five grim years, on the rise at last.'b'Most of his colleagues said that, actually, sales were rather sluggish. One was more hopeful and said that there were signs of improvement. When the young man watched the TV news that night, he was not entirely surprised to find that the only interview that had made the cut was the one with the optimist.'b'Everyone wants Ireland to be a good-news story, proof that a willingness to take the pain of prolonged austerity will be rewarded in the end. Ordinary citizens are hungry for some hope. The government, in the words of Deputy Prime Minister Eamon Gilmore, was \xe2\x80\x9cdetermined that Ireland would be Europe\xe2\x80\x99s success story.\xe2\x80\x9d An influential board member of the European Central Bank, J\xc3\xb6rg Asmussen, says, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Irish program is a success story.\xe2\x80\x9d Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany praised Ireland as an example of how crisis countries could turn themselves around.'b'The only problem is that, for most of us who actually live here, Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s success story feels less like \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shawshank Redemption\xe2\x80\x9d and more like \xe2\x80\x9cRocky.\xe2\x80\x9d We haven\xe2\x80\x99t been joyously liberated; we\xe2\x80\x99ve just withstood a lot of blows. We\xe2\x80\x99re still standing, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken so many punches that it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to see straight.'b'Yes, things are finally looking up, but the hopeful vision is clouded by two nagging questions. Did they need to be so bleak for so long? And has the harsh medicine actually cured Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s ills?'b'For conservatives, in particular, Ireland is the Tyra Banks of nations: a model country. The only problem is that they can\xe2\x80\x99t quite decide what Ireland is a model of.'b'For a long time, when Ireland was booming, it was the perfect face of light regulation and low taxes. (With impeccably bad timing, Senator John McCain cited Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s low corporate taxes as a model for the United States in his presidential election debates with Senator Barack Obama in 2008 \xe2\x80\x94 just as Ireland was sliding into crisis.) Now, with Ireland tentatively emerging from its long slump, it is being cited as the great exemplar of the virtues of austerity.'b'As the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\xc3\xa4uble, a fiscal hawk, put it in October: \xe2\x80\x9cIreland did what Ireland had to do. And now everything is fine.\xe2\x80\x9d Ireland was a success story when it was partying wildly and it is a success story when it is the Grim Reaper of international economics. Binge or purge, we can do no wrong.'b'We Irish are eternal optimists, but Mr. Sch\xc3\xa4uble\xe2\x80\x99s belief that everything is fine is a rare example of a German outdoing us in irrational exuberance. It is certainly true that, if you were to walk around the rebuilt Dublin docklands, with their shiny European headquarter offices for Google, Twitter, Facebook and Yahoo, and their slick cafes and hotels, you might conclude that if this is what an Irish crisis looks like, an Irish boom must be quite something to behold.'b'The supercool new Marker Hotel and apartment complex, which opened its doors in April and cost 120 million euros ($163 million), could be in Los Angeles or Dubai. It looks down on the buoyant American architecture of Martha Schwartz\xe2\x80\x99s Grand Canal Square and a plush Daniel Libeskind theater. In a country wrecked by a spectacular property bubble, house prices in Dublin have begun to soar again, rising 13 percent in the last year.'b'But Ireland has two economies: a global one dominated by American high-tech companies, and a domestic one in which most Irish workers have to make their living. The first is indeed booming. Not least because of those low corporate taxes, large global corporations find Dublin convivial for reasons other than its pubs and night life. The sheer scale of Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s dependence on this kind of investment for its exports can be judged by the fact that Irish gross domestic product took a serious hit in 2013 when Viagra (which is made by Pfizer in County Cork) went off patent in Europe. Broadly speaking, however, the global side of the Irish economy has remained robust.'b'But home is where the heartache is: in the domestic economy outside the gated community of high-tech multinationals. Outside Dublin, property prices are still falling. Wages for most workers have dropped sharply. Unemployment remains very high at 12.8 percent \xe2\x80\x94 and that figure would be higher if not for emigration. There\xe2\x80\x99s always been a simple way to measure how well Ireland is doing: Go to the ports and airports after the Christmas vacation and count the young people waving goodbye to their parents as they head off to the United States, Canada, Australia or Britain, where they have gone to find work and opportunity.'b'Other people protest in bad times; the Irish leave. And they\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing so in numbers that haven\xe2\x80\x99t been recorded since the 1980s. Nearly 90,000 people emigrated between April 2012 and April 2013 and close to 400,000 have left since the 2008 crisis. For a country with a population about the size of Kentucky\xe2\x80\x99s (about 4.5 million), that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of people.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s no great mystery about why they\xe2\x80\x99re going: They don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in the success story. A major study by University College Cork found that most of the emigrants are graduates and that almost half of them left full-time jobs in Ireland to go abroad. These are not desperate refugees; they\xe2\x80\x99re bright young people who have lost faith in the idea that Ireland can give them the opportunities they want. They just don\xe2\x80\x99t buy into the narrative of a triumphant rebound.'b'When the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank \xe2\x80\x94 the so-called troika \xe2\x80\x94 took over Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal governance in December 2010, they somehow convinced themselves that sharp cuts in public spending and reductions in wages would go hand in hand with economic growth. The I.M.F., for example, told us that the Irish economy would grow by 5.25 percent between 2011 and 2013. In fact, it grew at around half that rate.'b'Common sense would have suggested that in an economy in which private investment had dried up (Irish investment rates are now about half the average for the euro zone), there might be a problem with slashing public investment as well. After five years of austerity, it is shocking but hardly surprising that one in four Irish children are growing up in households in which no one at all is in paid employment.'b'Nor is it surprising that the departure of the troika at the end of 2013 and some modest signs of economic recovery have not been greeted by Riverdancing on the rooftops. Irish people were prepared to take some punishment; there\xe2\x80\x99s enough Catholic guilt still around for a story of sin and atonement to have considerable psychological purchase. People do look back ruefully on the Celtic Tiger years and admit that we deserved a whipping for thinking we could get rich by selling one another million-dollar houses. But they are not convinced that the cruel scale of the punishment was necessary or that the nasty medicine has, in fact, worked.'b'Behind both of these propositions looms the great contradiction in the supposed success story of Irish austerity. It was austerity only for citizens.'b'Running parallel to all the cuts in public spending and all the calls for fiscal responsibility has been a program of spending so lavish that it makes a drunken sailor look stingy. One part of the troika program was to cut wages, welfare, health care and education. The other was to insist that Ireland continue to put vast resources into its teetering banks, including the notorious, now liquidated, Anglo Irish Bank.'b'The policy of No Bondholder Left Behind, on which the European Central Bank insisted, has been staggeringly expensive. To put it in perspective, the European Union has just agreed to create a fund of $75 billion to deal with all future banking crises in its member states. Tiny Ireland has spent $85 billion bailing out its own banks.'b'Particularly galling to most Irish people is that there is now an almost casual admission that this was a pretty crazy idea. Olli Rehn, the European Union\xe2\x80\x99s economic affairs commissioner and one of the chief architects of Irish strategy since the crash, now says, \xe2\x80\x9cIn retrospect, I think it is quite easy to spot some mistakes like the blanket guarantee for banks.\xe2\x80\x9d This admission, though, does not imply any change of policy. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that is now water under the bridge,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cand now we have redirected the river.\xe2\x80\x9d Ireland, Mr. Rehn reassured us, is in \xe2\x80\x9ca better place for the moment.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But the river has not been redirected: A torrent of debt continues to flow from the catastrophic decision to save bad banks at all costs. Hopes that Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s debts might be alleviated by its European partners in recognition of the country\xe2\x80\x99s role in saving the euro are now fading.'b'Little Ireland took one for the team. In return, it gets a pat on the head and the dubious pleasure of being called a success story.'b'This is why, in the end, the austerity program has not succeeded even in its basic aim of bringing down Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign debt, which actually rose sharply over the last five years. In 2009, it was 64 percent of G.D.P. Last year, it peaked at 125 percent. The debt has doubled while public spending has been slashed.'b'In this, Ireland may be a model indeed: suffering to maintain an unreal image of slimmed-down perfection.'b''b'\n'b'Fintan O\xe2\x80\x99Toole, 'b' a columnist for The Irish Times, is a visiting lecturer at Princeton. 'b''b'Every weekend in 1979, Ooi Cheng Ghee took his Leica camera out to the docks of Penang, an island off the west coast of peninsular Malaysia. Mr. Ooi, a local physician of Chinese descent, roamed the working-class district of Georgetown to document life in the harbor. By year\xe2\x80\x99s end, he had taken 4,000 portraits, mostly of first-and second-generation migrants from India.'b'The photographs chronicle a vanishing world. You can see it in the sad but defiant eyes of an old man hauling jute sacks of betel nuts, an ancient trade that was fading away. By then, Mr. Ooi said, the Indian enclave of Penang \xe2\x80\x9cgave off a feeling of having been abandoned.\xe2\x80\x9d Modernization had eclipsed the commercial and social patterns of earlier waves of globalization.'b'Many coastal cities across Southeast Asia gained prominence in the 15th century, as power ebbed from ancient upland capitals like Angkor and Bagan, which had become riven by conflict and were weakened by the collapse of agricultural production. Ports developed as ocean trade grew. Textiles from Gujarat and the Coromandel Coast of India were exchanged for staple goods like rice or spices and medicinal products from across Southeast Asia. The Chinese market was the most lucrative of all.'b'Malacca, situated at the junction of the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, emerged in the 1400s as the greatest trading emporium in the region, perhaps even the world. Many smaller ports also thrived, including Aceh, Banten and Manila.'b'Most were small principalities ruled by Muslim families, but their populations were multiethnic. The important political office of harbormaster was often occupied by foreigners, often Indians. Alongside Chinese, Indian and Arab merchants, the port towns relied on a workforce of local peoples and slaves from South and Southeast Asia. When the Portuguese conquered Malacca in 1511, the apothecary Tom\xc3\xa9 Pires claimed to hear 84 languages spoken in its marketplace.'b'After the Portuguese, it was the Dutch who came, then the British and the French, setting up coastal footholds around the Indian Ocean. A British colony was founded in Penang, a strategic location on the Strait of Malacca, by the East India Company in 1786 as a trading and military base. As the British expanded into Malaya in the 1870s and established plantations, Penang prospered. By the early 20th century, Malaya was the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest producer of rubber and Penang among the most culturally diverse cities on earth.'b'Some migrants moved in search of fortune; others were forced to relocate by colonial authorities, labor recruiters or difficult circumstances at home. The Chinese went to all parts of Southeast Asia; Indians stayed mostly within the British Empire, concentrating in the Malay Peninsula, Sri Lanka and the area then known as Burma.'b'But the ports\xe2\x80\x99 fortunes were always precarious, contingent on the fluctuations of global trade. The Great Depression hit them hard, forcing many migrant workers to head back home. Singapore and Malaysia introduced immigration controls for the first time.'b'World War II severed already-strained trading links. After decolonization in the late 1940s and 1950s, newly independent governments favored industrialization over the export of basic goods, and the old port cities suffered. India\xe2\x80\x99s drive for self-sufficiency in food \xe2\x80\x94 supplemented as necessary by aid from the United States and bilateral deals \xe2\x80\x94 brought a decline in the Bay of Bengal\xe2\x80\x99s traditional free trade in rice.'b'By the second half of the 20th century, nearly all of the old ports of the eastern Indian Ocean had been eclipsed by investment in new facilities as part of national development plans: Penang lost out to Port Klang, closer to Malaysia\xe2\x80\x99s capital, Kuala Lumpur; Calcutta gave way to Visakhapatnam. Singapore is the great exception. With few natural resources and, after  independence from Malaysia in 1965, a limited domestic market, it  adapted by investing in a state-of-the-art container port. The old docks at Collyer Quay and Clarke Quay have long since been turned into commercial and entertainment districts.'b'Even the new ports that are built on very old sites \xe2\x80\x94 Hambantota in Sri Lanka was visited by Arab dhows centuries ago \xe2\x80\x94 are unmistakably modern creations: huge industrial facilities that are self-contained and divorced from their surroundings. Inhuman in size, these mega-harbors are built for an economy of scale.'b'If the harbors of the past were set up to make the most of a site\xe2\x80\x99s natural advantages \xe2\x80\x94 like the sheltering shape of a bay \xe2\x80\x94 the new ports remake coastlines according to their own needs, dredging waters and reclaiming land. Fishing communities are relocated. Beaches disappear. Erosion accelerates. There is one plan to spend $60 billion by 2020 in order to build a port every 32 kilometers or so along the coast of India.'b'In comparison, the old port cities are a picture of quaint cosmopolitanism; no wonder they are now looked upon with nostalgia. In 2008, Unesco declared Penang\xe2\x80\x99s Georgetown area a World Heritage Site for bearing \xe2\x80\x9ctestimony to a living multicultural heritage and tradition of Asia, where many religions and cultures met and coexisted.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The designation has brought a heritage boom. Chinese shophouses have been converted into boutique hotels, with the attendant coffee shops and art festivals. Thanks to this trend, a book of Mr. Ooi\xe2\x80\x99s photographs was published in 2011, after his work drew little attention for many years.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a revivalism mostly for tourist consumption, but it has also spawned an unprecedented interest in family history among locals. Small community-led museums have opened in Penang, Singapore and elsewhere in the region, and more are planned. They tap memories long kept dormant because the assertion of ethnic identities, particularly migrant origins, raises uncomfortable questions about relations between peoples, and entitlements such as citizenship.'b'But even these restoration efforts can produce a romanticized rendering of the past; they airbrush the ugly realities of Asia\xe2\x80\x99s earlier globalization. The old port cities boomed on the back of an underclass with few rights, poorly paid migrants who worked desperately to improve their lot.'b'Mr. Ooi points out that in his photographs of Penang, \xe2\x80\x9cThere were no curtains on any of the windows\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a sign, in his view, that people \xe2\x80\x9cknew they weren\xe2\x80\x99t staying.\xe2\x80\x9d These societies were multiethnic because they had to be; their cacophony of languages and competing gods made them messy, sometimes violent, places of rough-and-ready compromise.'b'Such hardships endure today. The dormitory settlements of South Asian migrant workers who toil from Dubai to Singapore are often out of view and far from the container ports they service. By dint of the size of these harbors, the connections between the jobs and their human cost are perhaps less immediate than they were centuries ago or even when Mr. Ooi photographed the docks of Penang. But they are no less real.'b'And we know it. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we recoil at these mammoth creations and look back on the past with longing.

The killings began on April 7 and continued until well into July.

Wyman'b'\nInstitute for Holocaust Studies'b'\nWashington, Jan. 10, 2014'b''b''b''b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 PRESIDENT OBAMA has assured American workers that he won\xe2\x80\x99t let Congress keep him from lending a hand during these tough economic times. \xe2\x80\x9cI will not allow gridlock, inaction or willful indifference to get in our way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a speech last year. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever executive authority I have to help the middle class, I\xe2\x80\x99ll use it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The problem is that most presidential actions that could help significant numbers of middle-class workers do require congressional participation. But here\xe2\x80\x99s one that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t: raising the salary threshold for the exemption to the overtime rules of the 'b'Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938'b'.'b'The act establishes that most workers, after 40 hours of weekly work, are entitled to be paid 1.5 times their regular wage \xe2\x80\x94 a.k.a., overtime. Hourly paid workers fall into this class, as do salaried workers who make less than a specified \xe2\x80\x9cthreshold\xe2\x80\x9d amount. The idea is that employees in higher-status positions (executives, administrators, professionals) ought to be exempt from receiving the overtime premium.'b'But as with the minimum wage, which is not automatically adjusted for inflation and tends to lose real value unless it is raised, the overtime exemption threshold generally languishes. That means that many people who once would have been paid 1.5 times their wage when working overtime are not, violating the spirit of the law.'b'For decades, the Department of Labor periodically updated the overtime salary threshold. But today\xe2\x80\x99s threshold, at $455 a week, is far below historical levels in real terms. And at just $2 a week more than a poverty-level income for a family of four, it is indefensibly low. I propose that President Obama raise the threshold to $970, equal in today\xe2\x80\x99s dollars to the 1975 level of $250.'b'In keeping with the original purpose of the overtime rules, this increase would make overtime pay more expensive, creating an incentive for employers to spread work among other workers (an important goal in today\xe2\x80\x99s low-job-creation environment). It would also more fairly compensate those who do work more than 40 hours.'b'Why do I suggest an updated 1975 value of $970? Because it would restore the proper relationship between the overtime salary threshold and today\xe2\x80\x99s median wage. When the Ford administration raised the threshold in 1975, it was 1.6 times the median wage. Today\xe2\x80\x99s median wage for 40 hours of work is about $670. Were we to update that value by the same 1.6 ratio that prevailed in the mid-1970s, we\xe2\x80\x99d end up with a threshold above $1,000, suggesting that $970 is, if anything, on the low side.'b'At the same time, an updated 1975 value would still leave higher-status positions exempt from the overtime protection. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median weekly earnings for manager-supervisors in various occupations range from $1,520 to $3,995, well above my proposed threshold.'b'You might worry that raising the overtime salary threshold would dampen hiring by creating higher labor costs. But there are good reasons not to expect this outcome. Research suggests that employers have a rough idea of how much overtime they will need from a given hire and adjust the base wage down accordingly. This means that at least some part of the burden of an increased overtime premium falls on the worker. But more important, if employers want to avoid paying overtime, they have an easy way to do so: Hire new workers to do the extra work at the standard wage. (This, again, was one of the objectives of the original law.)'b'The overtime provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act is still a vital contributor to the well-being of millions of American workers, but it needs updating to live up to its potential. At the same time, for President Obama to carry out his pledge to help working people with or without Congress\xe2\x80\x99s participation, he needs policy reforms that make a difference but don\xe2\x80\x99t require legislative approval. Raising the overtime salary threshold would be a simple solution to both problems.'b'Let us count the ways that this week\xe2\x80\x99s traffic-jam scandal is actually 'b'good'b' for Chris Christie\xe2\x80\x99s presidential prospects.'b'First of all, he proved that he could definitely handle an international crisis that required apologizing when the United States did something really stupid. Like \xe2\x80\x94 let\xe2\x80\x99s see. What if the secretary of commerce, in a fit of pique over a Chinese official\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to endorse American seafood products, sent a flotilla of cargo planes to dump tons of surplus mackerel on a Beijing highway? President Christie would be terrific! He could apologize profusely while making it clear that his administration actually had nothing to do with the incident whatsoever and, in fact, was itself a pathetic victim of betrayal by a double agent for the fish industry.'b'And Christie has stamina! On Thursday, he held a press conference on the George Washington Bridge traffic-jam fiasco and talked for nearly two hours. The historian Michael Beschloss says he can\xe2\x80\x99t think of any actual president who ever went on that long. It was even longer than the longest presidential Inaugural Address, which involved an hour and three-quarters of William Henry Harrison.'b'Of course, Harrison then died one month into office. But he did not have a personal trainer, and Chris Christie does. I must admit that I had a mixed reaction to the revelation about the trainer. Good for him on the healthy life front. But there really was something seductive about the idea of a chief executive without a physical fitness regimen. Four years bereft of jogging photo-ops or anecdotes from the pickup games in the White House gym.'b'Anyhow, there are lots of other ways that Christie\xe2\x80\x99s press conference could be viewed as presidential.'b'For instance, Richard Nixon had \xe2\x80\x9cI am not a crook.\xe2\x80\x9d Chris Christie gave us \xe2\x80\x9cI am not a bully.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Also, during Christie\xe2\x80\x99s press conference, he referred to \xe2\x80\x9cmistakes\xe2\x80\x9d 18 times. He seemed to be channeling Ronald Reagan, who famously said \xe2\x80\x9cmistakes were made\xe2\x80\x9d after his administration got caught secretly helping arm rebels in Central America with money made from selling weapons to Iran.'b'O.K., that was a bigger mistake. Although having associates who create a four-day traffic jam on the world\xe2\x80\x99s busiest bridge out of apparent political pique isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly a multiplication error.'b'Christie expressed confidence that the voters would conclude: \xe2\x80\x9cMistakes were made; the governor had nothing to do with that, but he\xe2\x80\x99s taking responsibility for it.\xe2\x80\x9d Here we have an echo of Harry Truman\xe2\x80\x99s announcement that \xe2\x80\x9cthe buck stops here.\xe2\x80\x9d However, Christie took the more modern approach, which is to make it clear that while you\xe2\x80\x99re responsible, you are totally not at fault. The buck that stopped at Christie\xe2\x80\x99s desk was not 'b'his'b' buck, just an errant piece of currency that wound up in the office because of treacherous fools over whom he had no actual control whatsoever.'b'So far, so good.'b'Among the critical qualities for a modern president is the ability to instantly cut off old friends and cast them adrift if they become political baggage. Maybe you remember the way Bill Clinton dumped his law school pal Lani Guinier when her nomination to lead the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s civil rights division ran into trouble.'b'Or maybe you have no memory of that whatsoever. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, because Christie\xe2\x80\x99s example is much better.'b'The central figure in the traffic-jam scandal is a guy named David Wildstein, who is frequently described as a youthful chum of the governor\xe2\x80\x99s. The two were at high school together, and Wildstein later became mayor of Christie\xe2\x80\x99s hometown.'b'Asked about Wildstein \xe2\x80\x94 who spent Thursday pleading the Fifth at a legislative hearing \xe2\x80\x94 Christie expressed joy at having the opportunity to clear up the true parameters of their relationship. \xe2\x80\x9cDavid and I were not friends in high school. ... We didn\xe2\x80\x99t travel in the same circles in high school,\xe2\x80\x9d he said coolly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, I was the class president and athlete. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what David was doing during that period of time.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ouch.'b'The most fascinating part of the governor\xe2\x80\x99s talkathon was his explanation of what he did when he discovered \xe2\x80\x94 just as he was toweling down from a workout \xe2\x80\x94 that his deputy chief of staff had been involved in creating the bridge crisis.'b'Christie claimed he swiftly axed said aide, wasting no time in attempting to find out why she had done it, who she had conspired with, or why she imagined he would think it was a good idea.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m telling you that when I ask for an answer from a member of my staff and they lie ... they\xe2\x80\x99re gone. So I never had to get to the conduct, the underlying conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'What do you think about that, people? Andrew Jackson-like decisiveness? Seems more like a really eerie lack of curiosity.'b'But then we have had presidents who were less inquisitive than a sidewalk. Look at George W. Bush. And he got elected twice.'b'There is often a simplistic, black-or-white, conservative vs. progressive discussion around the dissolution of the traditional family and high single-parent birthrates in America and what these trends may portend for us as a country.'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t see the argument as completely binary or the problem as intractable. But, I do believe that we must focus more on complex areas of causation. We can\xe2\x80\x99t look longingly at the halcyon ideals of yore, where marriage held more primacy and premarital sex was considered more depraved.'b'Those days are gone. But there are ways for us to adjust to a new reality rather than simply bemoan it.'b'First, the parameters of the problems: 'b'According to the Guttmacher Institute'b', \xe2\x80\x9cabout half (51 percent) of the 6.6 million pregnancies in the United States each year (3.4 million) are unintended\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe U.S. unintended pregnancy rate is significantly higher than the rate in many other developed countries.\xe2\x80\x9d Among teenagers in high-income countries, those in the United States have the highest rates of pregnancy and some sexually transmitted infections, according to 'b'a report'b' released last year by the National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine.'b'This, even though young Americans are not necessarily the most sexually active youth of developed countries, according to 'b'a previous Guttmacher report'b'. That report pointed out two important issues. First, \xe2\x80\x9cless contraceptive use and less use of hormonal methods are the primary reasons U.S. teenagers have the highest rates of pregnancy, childbearing and abortion.\xe2\x80\x9d Second, \xe2\x80\x9cmore sexual partners, a higher prevalence of infection and, probably, less condom use contribute to higher teenage sexually transmitted disease rates in the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Now there are things that I assume most Americans still agree on. Most think young people should delay sexual activity until they are mentally and emotionally capable of reasonably consenting and comprehending the consequences. Most want fewer children born to parents unwilling to provide for those children, or incapable of doing so, emotionally or financially. Most want fewer unplanned and unwanted pregnancies. And, most want fewer women to have to face the often wrenching decisions about what to do about such pregnancies.'b'There are some rather simple ways to move in this direction if we can agree to be less puritanical and more practical. We could, for example, begin teaching young people to value themselves in a way that contextualizes the initiation of sexual activity as a thing fully within their control and not so easily manipulated by peer and societal pressures. Abstinence can be honorable, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t be for everyone. Everyone can be affirmed, though, in the fact that they must love themselves enough emotionally to be in control of whom they allow to love them physically, and when.'b'Furthermore, we must provide thorough and unimpeded sex education \xe2\x80\x94 in the home and at school \xe2\x80\x94 about how to engage in sex safely and responsibly. And, we must provide a full range of reproductive services \xe2\x80\x94 prophylactic and contraceptive as well as post-pregnancy. Here we are moving in the wrong direction. 'b'A Guttmacher report'b' released last week found that more abortion restrictions were enacted in the last three years than in the previous decade.'b'Conservatives often stress marriage as a panacea for many of these problems, and indeed, marriage has its benefits. The fewer partners one engages sexually, the lower the risk of encountering disease. And, in terms of having a child, two adults in a home can often do twice as much as one. But, we must respect all family structures and encourage all parents to be active and engaged in child rearing regardless of living arrangements.'b'Furthermore, much of the discussion about single-parent families and births outside of marriage is focused too heavily on young women and is simply a form of sex shaming that blames them for not being proper guardians of chastity. The shaming itself is a shame, and often inflames the pathology of patriarchy in our culture.'b'We teach boys, overtly and implicitly, that sexual potency is a marker of masculinity and that empathy and emotional depth are purviews of a lesser sex. The ways we force boys to adhere to a perilously narrow reading of masculinity become a form of \xe2\x80\x9coppression all dressed up as awesomeness,\xe2\x80\x9d as Lisa Wade, an Occidental College sociology professor, 'b'put it last month'b' in Salon.'b'Boys are not taught to value themselves as fully human, but only as conquerors of everything \xe2\x80\x94 women, the workplace, the world. And men who are incapable of valuing their own humanity are incapable of fully valuing the humanity of a love interest.'b'We can address our societal problems, but to do so we must first address our societal issues.'b'This is certainly turning out to be quite the year for 50th anniversaries. Fifty years ago next month, 'b'the Beatles made their U.S. debut'b' on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ed Sullivan Show.\xe2\x80\x9d In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson started the War on Poverty. And 50 years ago Saturday, the surgeon general of the United States issued the single most important report that would ever come out of that office. It 'b'linked cigarette smoking to illness and death'b'.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to remember now just how prevalent smoking used to be. In the mid-1960s, around half the men in the country smoked; for women, the number was 35 percent. People smoked in their offices, smoked in restaurants, smoked on airplanes. Indeed, Paul Billings of the American Lung Association recalls that the airlines often gave passengers small packets of cigarettes when they boarded the plane.'b'But by the 1950s, scientists were beginning to equate cigarettes with lung cancer and other fatal diseases, a linkage the tobacco industry vehemently denied. In 1962, the prestigious Royal College of Physicians in Britain 'b'issued a report connecting smoking and lung cancer'b'. After seeing that report, Dr. Luther Terry, who was then the surgeon general, put together an advisory board and asked it to report back to him on the potential dangers of cigarettes.'b'Did it ever: the advisory board\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent report not only linked smoking to lung cancer but also to emphysema and cardiovascular disease. It labeled cigarettes a health hazard. \xe2\x80\x9cIn general,\xe2\x80\x9d it concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cthe greater the number of cigarettes smoked daily, the higher the death rate.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a landmark report,\xe2\x80\x9d says Scott Ballin, a longtime tobacco control and public health advocate. For the first time, the full weight of the federal government stood behind the notion that smoking killed. Antitobacco groups felt empowered and pressed for changes. In 1965, Congress passed legislation banning cigarette advertising on television \xe2\x80\x94 while also forcing the tobacco companies to put a surgeon general\xe2\x80\x99s warning on every pack of cigarettes. The tobacco companies fought the legislation, while continuing to deny that cigarettes killed.'b'And so it went for the next 30 years. The surgeon general would issue reports on, say, nicotine addiction or secondhand smoke. The tobacco companies would deny the obvious. And antitobacco activists would push for change.'b'This culminated with the tobacco wars in the 1990s. With the activists continuing to push hard, and whistle-blowers 'b'leaking damning documents'b', attorneys general around the country sued the tobacco companies and 'b'wound up settling'b' for a staggering $246 billion over 25 years.'b'And all the while, as Americans learned more about the dangers of tobacco, cigarette smoking dropped, and dropped again. By 2005, the percentage of Americans who smoked was down to 21 percent, a remarkable achievement. But since then, the percentage drops have been much smaller; today, it is estimated that around 18 percent of the country smokes. \xe2\x80\x9cSeven out of 10 smokers say they want to quit,\xe2\x80\x9d says Billings at the lung association, but their addiction is too powerful. More than 400,000 Americans still die prematurely each year from smoking.'b'Today, thanks to a law passed in 2009, the Food and Drug Administration has the power to regulate tobacco. (Its first set of tobacco regulations has been sitting at the Office of Management and Budget since October.) It\xe2\x80\x99s a different environment now, not only because of F.D.A. regulation but because there are now \xe2\x80\x9charm reduction\xe2\x80\x9d products, like e-cigarettes, that potentially make it easier for people who want to quit.'b'Yet many in the public health community have pushed for 'b'e-cigarettes to be treated the same as combustible cigarettes'b'; when you have been fighting a war for nearly half a century, it is hard to put down your weapons. Instead of focusing on the potential for e-cigarettes to save lives, they worry instead that the new products will serve as a gateway to smoking \xe2\x80\x94 a fear that has yet to show up in any study.'b'In honor of the 50th anniversary of the surgeon general\xe2\x80\x99s report, the Journal of the American Medical Association devoted much of 'b'its current issue'b' to tobacco and tobacco control. It published a study showing that the report may have saved as many as eight million lives.'b'Another article in the current issue of the journal 'b'is by David Abrams'b', the executive director of the Schroeder Institute for Tobacco Research and Policy Studies. He had been among those who had fought in the tobacco wars, but, in recent years, he had come around to the idea that a new way was needed.'b'Yes, he wrote, there needed to be more science around e-cigarettes, and, yes, they should be kept away from minors, and, yes, their advertising shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t resemble the old tobacco come-ons. But, he concluded, with proper regulation, e-cigarettes \xe2\x80\x9chave the potential to make the combusting of tobacco obsolete.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Which was the whole point of the exercise back in 1964. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s time for another surgeon general\xe2\x80\x99s report.'b''b'Dear Readers: Some of you had trouble finding my most recent column, on alcoholism.

They become statistics only. Alas.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There is nothing good to say about 'b'the December employment report'b', which showed that only 74,000 jobs were added last month. But dismal as it was, the report came at an opportune political moment. The new numbers rebut the Republican arguments that jobless benefits need not be renewed, and that the current minimum wage is adequate. At the same time, they underscore the need, only recently raised to the top of the political agenda, to combat poverty and inequality.'b'The report showed that average monthly job growth in 2013 was 182,000, basically unchanged from 2012. Even the decline in the jobless rate last month, from 7 percent in November to 6.7 percent, was a sign of weakness: It mainly reflects a shrinking labor force \xe2\x80\x94 not new hiring \xe2\x80\x94 as the share of workers employed or looking for work fell to the lowest level since 1978. That\xe2\x80\x99s a tragic waste of human capital. It would be comforting to ascribe the dwindling labor force mainly to retirements or other long-term changes, but most of the decline is due to weak job opportunities and weak labor demand since the Great Recession.'b'One result is that the share of jobless workers who have been unemployed for six months or longer has remained stubbornly high. In December, it was nearly 38 percent, still higher by far than at any time before the Great Recession, in records going back to 1948.'b'And yet, nearly 1.3 million of those long-term unemployed had their federal jobless benefits abruptly cut off at the end of last year, after Republicans refused to renew the federal unemployment program in the latest budget deal. Each week the program is not reinstated, another 72,000 jobless people who otherwise would have qualified for benefits will find there is no longer a federal program to turn to. Worse, in the Senate this week, after a show of willingness to discuss renewing the benefits, Republicans objected to a bill to do just that. They had demanded that a renewal be paid for, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t like how Democrats proposed to do that \xe2\x80\x94 with spending cuts at the end of the budget window in 2024 in exchange for relief today.'b'There was no need to pay for the benefits, which have such a crucial and positive effect \xe2\x80\x94 on families, the economy and poverty \xe2\x80\x94 that it would be sound to renew them even if the government borrowed to do so. But Republicans would rather criticize President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s handling of the economy than help those left behind.'b'A similar dynamic is developing around the drive for a higher minimum wage. In the December jobs report, the average hourly wage for most workers was $20.35. That means that the minimum wage, at $7.25 an hour, is only one-third of the average, rather than one-half, as was the case historically. Raising the wage to $10.10 an hour, as Democrats have proposed, would help to restore the historical relationship. But even that would fall far short of the roughly $17 an hour that workers at the bottom of the wage scale would be earning if increased labor productivity were reflected in their pay, rather than in corporate profits, executive compensation and shareholder returns.'b'Republicans, however, are opposed to any increase, as if the numbers don\xe2\x80\x99t speak for themselves. Their stance also dismisses research, and common sense, which says that raising the wages of low- and moderate-income workers is essential for lessening both poverty and inequality.'b'Instead, in the past week, they have introduced ostensibly \xe2\x80\x9cantipoverty\xe2\x80\x9d ideas, most prominently Senator Marco Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'plan'b' to transform federal safety net programs into state block grants, another of the shopworn Republican ideas that also include privatizing federal services and slashing domestic spending. Block grants have allowed states to disregard the needs of the least fortunate. The proposal would set back the debate on wages, poverty and inequality.'b'The December jobs report is telling Congress what it needs to do. Unfortunately, that will not lead to action anytime soon.'b'Four years after the earthquake, Haiti is a fragile, largely forgotten country. It\xe2\x80\x99s possible that some natural or man-made crisis this year could push it back into the headlines. But sustained attention, with the kind of support from outside that Haiti still needs to rebuild and become more self-sufficient, is mostly gone.'b'The United Nations says as much in a 'b'recently published'b' Humanitarian Action Plan for Haiti that strives for an ambitious and hopeful tone but mostly sounds forlorn. It notes some positive changes. More than three-fourths of young children are now in primary school, up from about half. Cholera deaths are down, as is the number of homeless quake survivors. The population in the camps reportedly fell to 172,000 last year, from a peak of 1.5 million who were without shelter just after the quake in 2010.'b'But such hopeful signs are easily displaced by other dreary facts. Humanitarian aid is petering out as agencies leave and money dries up. The decline means Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s partners should be stepping up development efforts, to put the country on a sustainable recovery path, but that isn\xe2\x80\x99t happening. Meanwhile, Haiti still has half the world\xe2\x80\x99s cholera cases, as the United Nations \xe2\x80\x94 whose troops caused the epidemic \xe2\x80\x94 is battling it with an underfinanced eradication plan.'b'For all the talk \xe2\x80\x94 and the $14 billion pledged by governments the world over since Jan. 12, 2010 \xe2\x80\x94 what is there to show? The grand total of new homes built in four years since the quake is dismally low: 7,515. The signature American-led redevelopment project \xe2\x80\x94 an industrial park in Caracol, on Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s north coast, which was supposed to create as many as 60,000 jobs \xe2\x80\x94 had created 2,590 at the end of 2013. Workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights advocates reported last fall that garment factories at Caracol and elsewhere routinely violate Haitian minimum-wage laws and pay most workers too little to live on.'b'The new United Nations action plan lacks the loftiness of previous development proposals, but it focuses on four critical, and surely achievable, goals: housing the homeless, reducing cholera, feeding 600,000 \xe2\x80\x9cfood insecure\xe2\x80\x9d Haitians and strengthening national institutions. Financing it for one year will take $169 million.'b'The United States should stick to its commitments to Haiti, with a particular focus on building and repairing housing (permanent homes, not temporary shelters), supporting agriculture and building the capacity of the Haitian government and local businesses and organizations. Data from the United States Agency for International Development show that barely 5 percent of its financing for projects in Haiti in 2012 went to Haitian-led institutions; that is not good enough.'b'It would help, meanwhile, to have a better idea of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on. A bill, the 'b'Assessing Progress in Haiti Act'b', would require more detail and transparency from the State Department in reporting to Congress how humanitarian and development money is spent. The bill, sponsored by Representative Barbara Lee, a California Democrat, passed the House with bipartisan support; the Senate should follow suit.'b'The United Nations plan notes that \xe2\x80\x9cthe slightest shock\xe2\x80\x9d to Haiti could send it into another round of misery and death. It is a country still in the grips of an emergency, even though beyond its shores, nobody seems to remember.'b'There is some rare good news on the issue of securing and containing deadly nuclear materials. In the last two years, seven countries have forsaken their uranium and plutonium stockpiles, bringing the number of nations still possessing appreciable quantities of nuclear fuel usable for bomb-making down to 25. In 1991, the number was 52.'b'The data comes from the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a private advocacy group that promotes the safekeeping of nuclear materials. Following up on its first report in 2012, the group surveyed the precautions each country had in place and ranked nations based on their security practices. The report issued on Wednesday covered factors like national laws, regulations, participation in international treaties and physical security, including whether a state has armed guards protecting its facilities.'b'The countries deserving special praise \xe2\x80\x94 Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Mexico, Sweden, Ukraine and Vietnam \xe2\x80\x94 effectively gave up their bomb-making capability and now have less than one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of material that can fuel nuclear weapons.'b'Of the countries that still have weapons-usable nuclear material, Australia placed first on the security ranking, because it reduced its supply of nuclear materials and ratified a treaty that commits countries to criminalize acts of nuclear terrorism and bring nuclear criminals to justice. The United States fell to 11th in part because it failed to ratify two nuclear accords.'b'Despite progress, the challenges ahead are daunting. At the bottom of the security rankings were North Korea (25), which is continuing to expand its nuclear weapons program, and Iran (24), which is in negotiations with the United States and other world powers on an agreement to freeze and roll back its program.'b'Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s rank rose to 22, up slightly from two years ago and ahead of India (23), because the Pakistani government took steps to update its nuclear security regulations. Still, both countries are nuclear-armed, have weak safety and security ratings, and are still increasing their nuclear fuel stockpiles for military and civilian purposes.'b'The world is already awash in 2,000 metric tons of weapons-usable nuclear material spread across hundreds of sites around the globe. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, 100 incidents of theft and other unauthorized activities involving nuclear and radioactive material are reported to the organization every year.'b'There are many steps the international community can take to prevent nuclear fuel from falling into terrorists\xe2\x80\x99 hands, including developing a system of global standards for securing the material and persuading nations to ratify nuclear security treaties. World leaders should push this agenda forward when they meet in The Hague for their third nuclear summit meeting this March.'b'TEL AVIV \xe2\x80\x94 POLITICS, to Ariel Sharon, was like a Ferris wheel. But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t make do with just staying on the wheel; he did all he could to climb to the top and stay there.'b'Mr. Sharon exuded strength, authority, leadership and charisma. His briefings before missions were precise, clear and unequivocal, instilling in his men a sense of trust and confidence. His orders were delivered in a lighthearted, sometimes cynical tone, with a piercing sense of humor. And he fought at the front of his forces, taking great risks.'b'While he was still a young, relatively junior officer, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion wrote in his diary about Mr. Sharon: \xe2\x80\x9can insightful young man, innovative; if he were to surmount his weakness of not telling the truth in his reports he could be an exemplary military leader.\xe2\x80\x9d He was right.'b'In 1982, when he was defense minister, Mr. Sharon lied to Prime Minister Menachem Begin and the cabinet by presenting a plan for a limited ground incursion to Lebanon with a strict time limit, while in fact ordering the army to conquer a large part of Lebanon, shattering the Palestine Liberation Organization\xe2\x80\x99s armed forces there and inflicting severe damage on the Syrian military presence. (All this was achieved, but the campaign was a political disaster.)'b'Mr. Sharon realized that shaping the historical narrative to present himself in a positive light would enable him to move up in the military and then the political hierarchy. Even though the operations of the counterterrorism unit he commanded back in the 1950s (known as Unit 101) never actually reduced the level of terrorist attacks, Mr. Sharon managed to shape the way it was portrayed as if he and his commandos had rescued the nation from chaos.'b'In 101\xe2\x80\x99s retaliation raids, many Arab civilians were killed. In one attack he commanded, the unit blew up 45 houses, killing some 65 of their inhabitants, men, women and children. He claimed that he thought the houses were empty.'b'Mr. Sharon devoted similar efforts to perpetuating the myth that it was he, as commander of an armored division, who saved Israel from sustaining a devastating defeat in 1973. He ordered the tapes of his division\xe2\x80\x99s radio messages hidden in a secret location so that he could speak about his feats without allowing others to examine the facts. And he conducted a successful struggle against the Israel Defense Forces\xe2\x80\x99 history department to prevent them from publishing the evidence of what had actually happened: how he had disobeyed many of the orders he received from the supreme command, how his division was only one element among many in the successful counterattack across the Suez Canal and how he had ignored calls for assistance from other forces.'b'Nine years later, Mr. Sharon didn\xe2\x80\x99t even try to find excuses for his disregard for the loss of life on his way to the top. He ordered the forces invading Lebanon \xe2\x80\x9cto finish off\xe2\x80\x9d southern Beirut, where the Palestinian refugee camps and P.L.O. bases were located, and \xe2\x80\x9craze it to the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d An Israeli weekly newspaper depicted him on the cover as a ruthless Viking trampling on Lebanon.'b'Mr. Sharon didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the analogy, but, like the Vikings, he made his goal the physical destruction of the enemy and, in this case, the elimination of its leader, Yasir Arafat. Mr. Sharon was ready to stop at nothing and to implicate himself and the Israeli army in war crimes against large numbers of civilians.'b'The entanglement in Lebanon and the ensuing public protests led to his removal from the defense ministry. Most Israelis believed Mr. Sharon\xe2\x80\x99s career was over.'b'Yet he remained on the Ferris wheel for years, as a Knesset member for the Likud Party and as a cabinet minister \xe2\x80\x94 until February 2001, when, with Israelis desperate for a strong leader who could stop the violence and terrorism of the second Intifada, he defeated the incumbent prime minister, Ehud Barak.'b'And then he changed. As long as he was striving for power, Mr. Sharon had been a wild man, a mega-intriguer. When he reached the top, in the midst of a wave of suicide attacks that were wreaking havoc, Mr. Sharon was the right leader at the right time. He ordered that all the resources the defense establishment had developed in preparation for the next war should now be diverted to fighting terrorism.'b'Mr. Sharon realized that without the consent and support of the United States, he would not be able to wage the aggressive war on terror that he envisaged. His closest counselor and chief of staff, Dov Weissglas, told him, \xe2\x80\x9cany warmth, support and friendship that you may earn from the U.S. government in your role as an antiterror warrior fades away when you put on your mega-settler cap.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In order to obtain America\xe2\x80\x99s consent, Mr. Sharon was prepared to sacrifice the project to which he had devoted years of effort: Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Later on, his readiness for concessions on settlements sprang also from a belief that, in the end, there would be no alternative to Israel withdrawing from most of the occupied territories to enable the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.'b'If Mr. Sharon had not had a stroke in 2006, which led, ultimately, to his death on Saturday, he would most likely have reached a peace agreement with the Palestinians. And he would have used his powerful personality and irresistible drive, as well as the widespread affection he had acquired among his people, to force the right-wing settler movement to accept it.'b'This time, I have no doubt, Mr. Sharon would indeed have saved Israel \xe2\x80\x94 mainly from itself.'b'WITHIN just over a year we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the Newtown shootings, the bombing at the Boston Marathon and the rescue of the kidnapped women in Cleveland. But which details of these events will you remember in a year? In five years? Will you remember the names of the perpetrators or the victims, the places where they happened, or the month and the year?'b'It won\xe2\x80\x99t surprise you to learn that the very recent news events are the ones we remember best. The Japanese psychologist Terumasa Kogure found sharp drops in recollection at four years and eight years after an event, but sometimes we\xe2\x80\x99ll remember the details of far older news stories. Indeed, recent psychological research shows that our memory for news is not as straightforward as we might think \xe2\x80\x94 and the reasons offer insight into how the mind works.'b'Not surprisingly, your proximity to the story makes you remember it better: Two years after 9/11, a study by the cognitive psychologist Kathy Pezdek found that New Yorkers recalled more of the details than those living in California and Hawaii.'b'And the way you get the information matters, too. As an offshoot of research into a new test for amnesia, the Dutch psychologist Martijn Meeter began giving general populations around the world his Daily News Memory Test, asking them about recent news items. It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy. The average score is just 42 percent. What\xe2\x80\x99s striking is that a person\xe2\x80\x99s score is not best predicted by the amount of news they watch on TV, but whether or not they read a daily newspaper.'b'Likewise, whether you hear the news personally or learn it from the news media makes a difference. An individual is more likely to convey shock and genuine emotion, but not to include as much information as the news report.'b'The psychologist John Neil Bohannon asked a large group of contemporary college students how they heard about the Challenger shuttle disaster, while he tracked down alumni from the same college from 1942 to 1945 to ask them about Pearl Harbor. He found that in both sets, those who were told the news personally remembered more about what they were doing at the time, but if they heard it on the news or read it in a newspaper, they remembered more facts about the event.'b'Recalling the timing of an event is particularly tricky. In one experiment, Professor Kogure gave people a general description of a news event, like \xe2\x80\x9ca former member of the Beatles was shot,\xe2\x80\x9d and then asked for his name, the date and the place. People were more likely to recall the name than the date.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising, but the reason is instructive: Working out the timing of events is something we find particularly difficult, partly because of a phenomenon known as telescoping, where you think that events happened more recently than they did. Who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been shocked to hear that, for example, it has already been three years since the Chilean mine rescue, or 27 years since the disaster at Chernobyl?'b'Sometimes we can date a public event through reconstruction, linking it to other personal memories from that month or year. Two British psychologists, Alex Fradera and Jamie Ward, found that if people mapped out timelines of their own lives on a piece of paper, they were better at estimating the dates of news events because they linked them with their personal lives.'b'But occasionally we simply know the exact date of an event, without knowing why. One theory is that we create a memory that comes with some kind of time-tag attached, explaining why it happened. The neurologist Antonio Damasio has found that people with amnesia lose these time-tags, finding it impossible to distinguish which events happened in which decade.'b'And if we think that the years and months are hard to work out, the day of the week is even more difficult, particularly if it was a weekday. On Friday, Jan. 31, 1986, there was a mild earthquake in Mentor, Ohio. Everyone in town felt it. But when the psychologist William Friedman sent out questionnaires about it nine months later, he found that although most people recalled the time of day it occurred to within an hour, they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t name the day of the week.Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s not so much the details of the story itself that we remember well, but where we were when we heard about it. These so-called \xe2\x80\x9cflashbulb\xe2\x80\x9d memories mean that you get a vivid picture in your mind of exactly what you were doing.'b'I remember being awakened at 5 a.m. one Sunday morning by my husband\xe2\x80\x99s boss, a news editor, calling him to come straight to work to cover \xe2\x80\x9cthis Diana death thing.\xe2\x80\x9d Until we turned on the radio, we had no idea what he meant. (Flashbulb memories are hard to study because of course you can\xe2\x80\x99t induce them in a laboratory. You have to wait for the really big news events, like 9/11 or the shooting of John F. Kennedy.)'b'So in a decade\xe2\x80\x99s time you may or may not remember the details of the Newtown shooting, the Boston bombing and the Cleveland rescue. But it won\xe2\x80\x99t be because of the objective importance of the events. It will all depend on how you heard, where you were, what was going on in your life and how many newspapers you read.'b''b'Lise Funderburg, a journalist, interviewed Yael Ben-Zion, a photographer raised in Israel, about her new book, \xe2\x80\x9cIntermarried,\xe2\x80\x9d published by Kehrer,'b' 'b'which features families from the Washington Heights neighborhood where she lives with her French husband and 5-year-old twins.'b''b''b'Q.'b' What inspired this project?'b''b'A.'b' I saw an Israeli television campaign that showed faces on trees and bus stops, like missing children ads. A voice-over said, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen these people? Fifty percent of young Jewish people outside of Israel marry non-Jews. We are losing them.\xe2\x80\x9d I happen to be married to a person who is not Jewish. And, so for me it was, \xe2\x80\x9cAah, they\xe2\x80\x99re losing me.\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99m not religious, but this campaign made me wonder more generally why people choose to live with someone who is not from their immediate social group, and what challenges they face.'b''b'Q.'b' How did you establish your taxonomy for what qualified as mixed?'b''b'A.'b' I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to go in the street and ask couples if they were mixed. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t grow up here; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know what terminology to use. But I live in a very diverse Manhattan community that has an online parent list with more than 2,000 families on it. I put up an ad saying I was looking for couples that define themselves as mixed. I said it could be different religion, ethnicity or social background. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t use the word race, because I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure how politically correct that was. All the couples who responded are either interfaith or interracial or both, but my goal from the beginning wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to create some statistical visual document. For example, I have hardly any Asian people, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there are any Muslims, and the reason is that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t approach me.'b''b'Q.'b' Can you talk about how you chose to communicate the intermarriage experience?'b''b'A.'b' I could have done straight portraiture of people sitting on the couch who either had or did not have different skin color. For me, that would have been less engaging. When I create work, I look for something more complex: it\xe2\x80\x99s not the obvious Christmas tree next to the Hanukkah menorah.

I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if this is clich\xc3\xa9d, but in the end, for me, this book is about love.

If you\xe2\x80\x99d asked me before the boys were born if I\xe2\x80\x99d ever have a Christmas tree in my home, as a good Jew I\xe2\x80\x99d have said no.'b'On paper, we cannot be more different. We come from different countries, religions and professional backgrounds, but there are many things that connect us. This is something that was repeated in my conversations with a lot of couples: When you have a relationship with someone not from your own group or where you expect there might be difficulties, you think of the difficult questions in advance. If there weren\xe2\x80\x99t values that were important to us both, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been together to begin with.'b'I speak to my kids only in Hebrew and Ugo speaks to them only in French.

You walk up the street in my neighborhood, and most people are intermarried in one way or another, but I would never feel comfortable to talk to them about this just out of the blue. When I show the work, though, I always end up in conversations I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had any other way. I showed it in Santa Fe and this guy came over and told me he\xe2\x80\x99s a Jewish person married to a Native American and they had the first bris in Santa Fe Indian Hospital.

John Edwards is slick. Hillary Clinton is expedient. W. was in over his head. Barack Obama is too much in his head. Chris Christie can be a bully.'b'Politicians are surrounded by spinners who work tirelessly to shape our perceptions of the characters of their bosses. Pols know how to polish scratches in their image with sin-and-redemption news conferences, TV confessionals and self-deprecating turns at hoary Washington press banquets. As Carter spokesman Jody Powell joked, if Hitler and Eva Braun came on stage at the Gridiron Dinner and mocked themselves in a song-and-dance routine, Washington chatterers would say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, they\xe2\x80\x99re not so bad.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'After being showered with spin, you say to yourself, maybe that first impression was wrong. But often it isn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'Christie\xe2\x80\x99s two-hour \xe2\x80\x9cI am not a bully\xe2\x80\x9d news conference was operatic about an act of malice so petty it did not merit being called \xe2\x80\x9cauthentic Jersey corruption,\xe2\x80\x9d as New Jersey native Jon Stewart said, adding that it was unworthy of a state with a severed horse head on its flag.'b'If you\xe2\x80\x99re going to wage a vendetta, at least make it a well-thought-out one. How can Christie &amp; Co. run a national campaign when they can\xe2\x80\x99t even aim straight? How moronic to think the mayor of Fort Lee would get blamed for problems on a bridge that everyone knows is controlled by the Port Authority. If you want to be malicious, it would be so easy to put a project close to the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s heart on hold for a few months or redirect 60 state snowplows the night before a storm.'b'The governor groveled to New Jersey residents after his aides so gleefully burned them (even joking about children being late for the first day of school because of the orchestrated gridlock on the George Washington Bridge).'b'After zapping Obama for being so clueless that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find \xe2\x80\x9cthe light switch of leadership\xe2\x80\x9d in a dark room, Christie is trying to salvage his once blazing career by claiming he was in a dark room, clueless to the bogus traffic study masking a revenge plan that top aides were executing in plain sight.'b'The epic news conference felt like a scene out of the governor\xe2\x80\x99s favorite movie, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Godfather\xe2\x80\x9d: Christie offering his tremulous, grandiose, self-pitying public apologia while in cross-cut scenes, his henchmen were getting rid of those who threatened his operation.'b'Calling his deputy chief of staff Bridget Anne Kelly \xe2\x80\x9cstupid\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdeceitful,\xe2\x80\x9d he threw her off the bridge, without talking to her himself or, as Niall O\xe2\x80\x99Dowd slyly wrote in IrishCentral.com, even extending the courtesy of the old Irish wedding night admonition: \xe2\x80\x9cBrace yourself, Bridget.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He also disappeared his two-time campaign manager, Bill Stepien. His cronies at the Port Authority, Bill Baroni and David Wildstein, fell on their swords last month.'b'Christie took a line straight out of the Robert DeNiro handbook, lamenting: \xe2\x80\x9cI am heartbroken that someone who I permitted to be in that circle of trust for the last five years betrayed my trust.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yet we know workplaces are chameleon-like. I once had a publisher who loved the Audubon Society, so we ran a lot of bird stories. I had another boss who wore suspenders, so guys in the office started wearing suspenders.'b'Shades of Watergate: Since they were headed toward a landslide, you\xe2\x80\x99d think the Christie crew would have been in a more benevolent mood. But given the governor\xe2\x80\x99s past flashes of vindictive behavior, this was probably a wink-wink, nod-nod deal. Question: Who will rid me of this meddlesome mayor? Answer: The \xe2\x80\x9clittle Serbian\xe2\x80\x9d has been dealt with.'b'The second thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned from covering politics is that we can debate ad nauseam whether Christie was telling the truth, shading it or bluffing. But we can\xe2\x80\x99t gauge that from his impressive, marathon Trenton performance art.'b'No matter how jaded we feel in the news business, we are still suckers for the big lie. It\xe2\x80\x99s tough to wrap your head around a stunning level of duplicity.'b'I learned this lesson the hard way covering Paul Tsongas\xe2\x80\x99s presidential surge in 1992. When The Times\xe2\x80\x99s Dr. Larry Altman came on the campaign trail to interview Tsongas, he was skeptical about the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s claim that his lymphoma had not recurred. I told Altman it was impossible for me to believe that Tsongas, who prided himself on his honesty and who was so straightforward he was mocked as \xe2\x80\x9cSaint Paul\xe2\x80\x9d by Clinton aides, could lie about that \xe2\x80\x94 especially given the profound political consequences.'b'Dr. Altman was right, as Tsongas later admitted. The candidate and his doctors at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston repeatedly said he was cancer-free when he was not.'b'A cascade of subsequent outraged denials about transgressive behavior delivered with bravado and finger wagging, from Gary Hart to Bill Clinton to John Edwards to Anthony Weiner, has persuaded me that politicians \xe2\x80\x94 who are narcissists and, in essence, actors stuck in the same role \xe2\x80\x94 can persuasively tell the big lie if they believe their futures are on the line.'b'The Christie saga is still unraveling.

For nearly four decades, feminists have decried \xe2\x80\x9cthe feminization of poverty.\xe2\x80\x9d However, since the 1980s there has been a defeminization of poverty, as a growing proportion of men have fallen on hard times. In recent years men have experienced especially significant losses in income and job security.'b'Although women are still more likely to be poor than men, on average women\xe2\x80\x99s income and labor-force participation 'b'have been rising'b' since the 1970s. By contrast, between 1970 and 2010 the median earnings of men fell by 19 percent, and those of men with just a high school diploma by a stunning 'b'41 percent'b'. And while\xc2\xa0women have regained all the jobs they lost during the recession, men have regained just 75 percent.'b'Since about 1980 the percentage of men and women in middle-skill jobs has declined. But for women, nearly all of that decline was because of increased representation in higher-skill jobs. Women\xe2\x80\x99s employment in low-skill jobs increased by just 1 percent. By contrast, for men, half the decline in middle-skill jobs was a result of increases in low-skill jobs.'b'The most urgent issue facing working Americans today is not the glass ceiling. It is the sinking floor. So wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it make more sense to focus on gender-neutral economic policies?'b'Actually, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, because \xe2\x80\x9cgender-neutral\xe2\x80\x9d work practices and social policies were traditionally based on a masculine model. Employers assumed that there was no need to accommodate caregiving obligations because the \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d worker had a wife to do that. Policy makers assumed there was no need for universal programs such as family allowances and public child care because the \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d woman had a husband to support her and her children. Accordingly, most social benefits, such as Social Security and unemployment insurance, were tied to prior participation in the labor market. Welfare was a stigmatized and stingy backup for misfits who were not in a male-breadwinner family.'b'Social and economic policies constructed around the male breadwinner model have always disadvantaged women. But today they are dragging down millions of men as well. Paradoxically, putting gender equity issues at the center of social planning would now be in the interests of most men.'b'This was not so evident 40 or 50 years ago, when the struggle for gender equity threatened many male entitlements. In those days, men of every skill and income level had preferential access to jobs that provided security, benefits and rising wages. As the sociologist Erin Hatton shows, when employers needed cheap temporary workers, they turned to companies like Kelly Girl, whose ads bragged that unlike the gimme-gimme male worker, the Kelly Girl was a \xe2\x80\x9cNever-Never\xe2\x80\x9d employee: \xe2\x80\x9cNever costs you a dime for slack time. (When the workload drops, you drop her.) Never has a cold, slipped disk or loose tooth. (Not on your time anyway!)\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Today, however, becoming a \xe2\x80\x9cnever-never\xe2\x80\x9d employee is increasingly a gender-neutral fate. Millions of men face working conditions that traditionally characterized women\xe2\x80\x99s lives: low wages, minimal benefits, part-time or temporary jobs, and periods of joblessness. Poverty is becoming defeminized because the working conditions of many men are becoming more feminized.'b'Whether they realize it or not, men now have a direct stake in policies that advance gender equity. Most of the wage gap between women and men is no longer a result of blatant male favoritism in pay and promotion. Much of it stems from general wage inequality in society at large.'b'IN most countries, women tend to be concentrated in lower-wage jobs. The United States actually has a higher proportion of skilled and highly paid female workers than countries like Sweden and Norway. Yet as a whole, Swedish and Norwegian women earn a higher proportion of the average male wage than American women because the gap between high and low wages is much smaller in those countries.'b'Establishing a \xe2\x80\x9clivable wage\xe2\x80\x9d floor would immediately reduce the gap in average pay between American women and men. But it would also boost the wages of millions of low-income male workers, who earn a much lower percentage of the average male wage than their counterparts in other wealthy countries. In 2009, one in every four American workers earned less than two-thirds of the national median hourly wage, the highest proportion of low-wage work in 19 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, according to the economist John Schmitt of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.'b'Another source of the gender pay gap is the lack of reliable, affordable child care, which forces many mothers to stay home or work part time even when they need and want full-time work.'b'Prioritizing child care would not just be a boon for mothers but for millions of fathers as well. The highest proportion of stay-at-home moms is found among women married to men in the bottom 25 percent of the country\xe2\x80\x99s income distribution. Most of these women cannot afford to work because of the 'b'high cost of child care'b', even though their partners and children would benefit from the increased income.'b'Putting women first would mean strengthening America\xe2\x80\x99s social safety net, because a higher proportion of single-mother families live in poverty here than in any other wealthy country. But a stronger safety net would help single-father families and two-parent families, too, because these families also have higher poverty rates than their counterparts in other wealthy countries.'b'Putting women first would also mean changing unemployment insurance rules that leave many part-time workers ineligible for benefits and disqualify people who leave a job due to a family member\xe2\x80\x99s medical emergency. Women are especially affected by such rules, but the expansion of part-time and temporary jobs since the 1970s has left a growing number of male workers vulnerable as well. And a recent Pew poll found that almost 30 percent of fathers had reduced their work hours and 10 percent quit a job to care for a family member.'b'Putting women\xe2\x80\x99s traditional needs at the center of social planning is not reverse sexism. It\xe2\x80\x99s the best way to reverse the increasing economic vulnerability of men and women alike.'b'Given the increasing insecurity of many American men, they have good reason to back feminist policies. And if those policies alienate some women in the upper echelons, then maybe feminism isn\xe2\x80\x99t for every woman, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be.'b''b'Anthony Mandler'b' is a film director and photographer probably best known for the noir music videos he has created for pop artists such as Rihanna, Jay-Z, Beyonc\xc3\xa9, Eminem and Lana Del Rey.'b''b'READING'b' Right now I\xe2\x80\x99m into 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cShop Class as Soulcraft,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' by Matthew Crawford.

Even so, a large and troubling body of data \xe2\x80\x94 some if it gathered by the federal government \xe2\x80\x94 shows that black and Hispanic students are disproportionately and unjustifiably subjected to suspension, expulsion or even arrest for nonviolent offenses that should be dealt with in the principal\xe2\x80\x99s office.'b'As a result, minority children who are already at greater risk of dropping out are being ejected from school and denied the right to an effective public education.'b'Over the last several years, civil rights officials in the Obama administration have begun to focus on this problem, increasing civil rights investigations and forcing school districts to revise disciplinary policies that disproportionately affect minorities. The Department of Education\xe2\x80\x99s Office for Civil Rights, for example, has reached such agreements with school districts in Los Angeles; in Oakland, Calif.; and in Delaware.'b'Last week, the Department of Education\xe2\x80\x99s Office for Civil Rights and the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s Civil Rights Division took another welcome step. The agencies jointly 'b'issued'b' an extensive set of guidance documents, informing school districts of the law and showing them how to identify, avoid and remedy discriminatory disciplinary policies.'b'The guidance documents included striking data on racial inequities. For example, African-American students represent only 15 percent of public school students, but they make of 35 percent of students suspended once, 44 percent of those suspended more than once and 36 percent of those expelled. Statistical information does not in itself prove discrimination. But research has shown that black students do not engage in more serious or more frequent misbehavior than other students.'b'The treatment of disabled students should be a source of national shame: They represent 12 percent of students in the country, but they make up 25 percent of students receiving multiple out-of-school suspensions and 23 percent of students subjected to a school-related arrest.'b'Investigations in this area have found two kinds of discrimination: cases in which African-American students are treated more harshly and disciplined more frequently than white students who engage in similar misbehavior; and cases where policies \xe2\x80\x94 like mandatory suspension, expulsion or ticketing \xe2\x80\x94 are administered in a race-neutral manner but have a disproportionate and unjustified effect on students of a particular race.'b'To prevent bad practices, the new federal guidance urges schools to train teachers more intensively in classroom management; to ensure that teachers and administrators know they, rather than security or law-enforcement officers, are responsible for routine discipline; to collect data on disciplinary actions and monitor the actions of security officers; and to emphasize policies that reinforce positive behavior over tactics that drive students out of school.'b'Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was on the mark last week when he said, \xe2\x80\x9cA routine school disciplinary infraction should land a student in the principal\xe2\x80\x99s office, not in a police precinct.\xe2\x80\x9d By making suspension and arrest a last resort, school districts can avoid federal civil rights sanctions and move away from destructive policies that seriously harm the most vulnerable students.'b'The Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'decision'b' to extend the international space station\xe2\x80\x99s time in orbit by at least four years makes good sense. Some $100 billion has been invested to build the station, which was completed less than three years ago. The plan had been to allow the station to plunge into the ocean in 2020.'b'Very little research was conducted during the 13 years the station was being built; research has only been going at a significant clip since 2011. Allowing the space station to operate to 2024, and possibly beyond, would provide more time for scientific and commercial experiments.'b'American space officials hope that other international partners, including the European Space Agency, Russia and Japan, will support the extension, but said that if necessary the United States will go it alone.'b'The move will not be cheap. Operating the space station currently costs the United States about $3 billion a year, a big chunk of the space agency\xe2\x80\x99s proposed $17 billion budget, and that cost could grow. Congress has yet to appropriate funds for specific agencies, so NASA\xe2\x80\x99s financial prospects for the coming year remain uncertain.'b'Administration officials listed several benefits of giving the station four more years of life. The extra time may encourage more scientists and more private companies to develop research proposals that often take years to plan and carry out. It would give commercial launching companies that carry cargo to the station, and will carry humans starting in 2017, a longer period to recoup their investments.'b'Perhaps most important, it will allow NASA to complete the research that is deemed necessary for preparing for long-duration flights beyond low-Earth orbit, including planned human missions to an asteroid by 2025 and to Mars in the 2030s. The research is looking for ways to mitigate many of the health hazards of long-duration flight and will test technologies that are needed to operate safely and productively in deep space.'b'Congress seems likely to support the extension because it will provide local jobs and contracts. The budgetary effect will be negligible through 2020. But eventually, Congress will need to decide whether to keep operating the station for as long as its key components last, possibly through 2028 or beyond, use the money for other manned and robotic space missions or supply enough money to do it all. The station ought to be kept in orbit as long as it yields important research findings, but it should not be allowed to cannibalize other important space activities.'b'NASA\xe2\x80\x99s budget is a tiny part of the trillions of dollars in annual federal spending. Congress ought to appropriate enough money to keep the United States at the forefront in all realms of space research and exploration.'b'Under the Constitution, the president nominates federal judges, cabinet members and officials for executive agencies, and the Senate votes on their confirmation. But what if the Senate isn\xe2\x80\x99t in session? The answer has always seemed clear: The Constitution 'b'gives the president the power'b' to fill \xe2\x80\x9call vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'On Monday, for the first time in its history, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments over the meaning of that clause. On one level, the debate is about language and history: What does \xe2\x80\x9cthe recess\xe2\x80\x9d refer to? What did the framers mean by \xe2\x80\x9chappen\xe2\x80\x9d? But this legalistic dispute should not obscure the larger issue at stake: The government needs to be able to function even when Congress can\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x94 or won\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x94 do its job.'b'The case, 'b'National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning'b', started as an ordinary labor dispute between a soft-drink bottling company in Washington State and the local union over a contractual pay raise. The N.L.R.B., a federal agency that hears such disputes every day, ruled for the union in February 2012. The company appealed, arguing that the decision was invalid because President Obama had 'b'wrongly used the recess-appointment power'b' to install three of the board\xe2\x80\x99s five members the previous month.'b'Without those three, the labor board did not have enough members to function, and in temporarily restaffing it, Mr. Obama was simply following long-established practice by both Democratic and Republican presidents faced with an intransigent Congress. Over the last 150 years, 'b'presidents have made'b' more than 600 such civilian appointments and thousands of military appointments. (A recess appointment expires at the end of the session unless Congress acts on it first.)'b'And yet in a 'b'remarkably myopic ruling'b' last January, the federal appeals court in Washington blocked out that reality and held, among other things, that the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s use of the words \xe2\x80\x9cthe recess\xe2\x80\x9d must mean there is only one, which falls between the end of one Congressional session and the start of the next.'b'There are historical arguments for why that reading may have made sense in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s early days, when travel times were long and recesses could last for months. But in the 21st century, senators come and go as they please, and recesses are short and frequent. What has not changed is a president\xe2\x80\x99s need to be able to staff the cabinets and federal agencies so that the government\xe2\x80\x99s work can be done.'b'Of course, a functioning N.L.R.B. is precisely what business-friendly Republicans want to prevent. They see the board as too pro-union, and are so intent on thwarting it and other agencies that they forced the Senate to hold phony \xe2\x80\x9cpro forma\xe2\x80\x9d sessions every three days during the January 2012 break \xe2\x80\x94 some of which lasted only a minute \xe2\x80\x94 just to prevent the president from using his recess-appointment power.'b'To be fair, Senate Democrats introduced this tactic in the last years of George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s presidency, but Republicans have blocked Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s appointments at a 'b'far higher rate'b'. They have made an art of avoiding up-or-down votes on judges, agency officials and even cabinet members.'b'Since the Senate finally voted last November 'b'to eliminate the filibuster'b' for most presidential nominees, Mr. Obama should have an easier time getting them confirmed. But there are still plenty of tricks senators can use to jam the system, from refusing to conduct hearings to placing holds on nominees. And if Republicans retake the Senate in November, they won\xe2\x80\x99t need a filibuster to keep Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s agencies from functioning.'b'The absurdity of the appeals court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling reaches not just into the future but into the past. If Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s recess appointments are ruled unconstitutional, thousands of other such appointments made over the years by other presidents would be called into question, not to mention 'b'more than 1,300 rulings'b' made by the \xe2\x80\x9cinvalid\xe2\x80\x9d labor board.'b'The Supreme Court should overturn the appellate ruling and reaffirm a longstanding practice that is consistent with both the language and the meaning of the Constitution, and that allows presidents to do their job.'b'Readers respond to an Op-Ed essay that said abolition of the tax would benefit workers.'b''b'To the Editor:'b' Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Abolish the Corporate Income Tax'b',\xe2\x80\x9d by Laurence J. Kotlikoff (Op-Ed, Jan. 6):'b'For decades corporate income taxes have dropped without benefiting working and middle-class America. Chief executives now make 270 times more than the average American worker, whose real wages have fallen since their peak in the 1970s.'b'As most workers in America have seen their hours, wages and benefits shrink, corporate taxes have gone down, job creation and growth have gone down, and corporate profits and executive compensation have skyrocketed.'b'So why does Mr. Kotlikoff think that it will be different this time around? For whom does he think that it will be better? If the past predicts the future, it will not be the American workers or the middle class who benefit.'b'CARRIE GOLDWATER GOLKIN'b' New York, Jan. 7, 2014'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b''b'To the Editor: 'b'Laurence J. Kotlikoff doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mention some key facts.'b'First, the personal income tax would have an enormous loophole for the rich if we didn\xe2\x80\x99t also have a corporate income tax. A corporation can hold on to its profits for years before paying them out as dividends. With no corporate income tax, rich people could create shell corporations to defer paying individual income taxes on much of their income indefinitely.'b'Second, even when corporate profits are paid out (as stock dividends), only a third are paid to individuals rather than to tax-exempt entities not subject to the personal income tax. If not for the corporate income tax, most corporate profits would never be taxed.'b'Third, the corporate income tax is ultimately borne by shareholders and is therefore a very progressive tax, which means that repealing it would result in a less progressive tax system. The Treasury Department concludes that 82 percent of the corporate tax is borne by the owners of stocks and business assets, who mostly have very high incomes.'b'ROBERT S.

As the recent budget agreement between Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat, and Representative Paul D. Ryan, a Republican, shows, the country is hungry for bipartisan agreement, and there is no better opportunity than the simplification of the corporate tax code.'b'Labor and business, left and right, have come together before to reach deals that have boosted America\xe2\x80\x99s economy and created jobs. Mr. Kotlikoff is right that jobs don\xe2\x80\x99t come out of thin air.

That means closing offshore tax loopholes that reward corporations for hiding profits and shipping jobs overseas.'b'In the 1950s, corporate tax receipts represented about a third of federal revenue; now they make up only 10 percent. When corporate taxes decline, everyone else pays more to make up the difference, or loses valuable services and benefits.

The Tax Analysis Center, which sponsored his work, is a project of the National Center for Policy Analysis.

McGINLEY'b' Evanston, Ill., Jan. 8, 2014'b''b'MY favorite story in Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee\xe2\x80\x99s fascinating new book, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Second Machine Age,\xe2\x80\x9d is when the Dutch chess grandmaster Jan Hein Donner was asked how he\xe2\x80\x99d prepare for a chess match against a computer, like I.B.M.\xe2\x80\x99s Deep Blue. Donner replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI would bring a hammer.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Donner isn\xe2\x80\x99t alone in fantasizing that he\xe2\x80\x99d like to smash some recent advances in software and automation \xe2\x80\x94 think self-driving cars, robotic factories and artificially intelligent reservationists \xe2\x80\x94 which are not only replacing blue-collar jobs at a faster rate, but now also white-collar skills, even grandmasters!'b'Something very, very big happened over the last decade. It is being felt in every job, factory and school. My own shorthand is that the world went from \xe2\x80\x9cconnected to hyperconnected\xe2\x80\x9d and, as a result, average is over, because employers now have so much easier, cheaper access to above-average software, automation and cheap genius from abroad. Brynjolfsson and McAfee, both at M.I.T., offer a more detailed explanation: We are at the start of\xc2\xa0 the Second Machine Age.'b'The First Machine Age, they argue, was the Industrial Revolution that was born along with the steam engine in the\xc2\xa0late 1700s. This period was \xe2\x80\x9call about power systems to augment human muscle,\xe2\x80\x9d explained McAfee in an interview, \xe2\x80\x9cand\xc2\xa0each successive invention in that age delivered more and more power. But they all required humans to make decisions about them.\xe2\x80\x9d Therefore, the inventions of this era actually made human control and labor \xe2\x80\x9cmore valuable and important.\xe2\x80\x9d Labor and machines were\xc2\xa0complementary.'b'\xc2\xa0In the Second Machine Age, though, argues Brynjolfsson, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are beginning to automate a lot more cognitive tasks, a lot more of the control systems that determine what to use that power for. In many cases today artificially intelligent machines can make better decisions than humans.\xe2\x80\x9d So humans and software-driven machines may increasingly be substitutes, not\xc2\xa0complements. What\xe2\x80\x99s making this possible, the authors argue, are\xc2\xa0three huge technological advances that just reached their tipping points, advances they describe as \xe2\x80\x9cexponential, digital and combinatorial.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To illustrate \xe2\x80\x9cexponential\xe2\x80\x9d they retell the story of the king who was so impressed with the man who invented chess that he offered him any reward. The inventor suggested rice to feed his family. He asked the king to simply place a grain of rice on the first square of a chessboard and then have each subsequent square receive twice as many grains as the previous. The emperor agreed until he realized that 63 instances of doubling yields a fantastically big number, even starting with one grain \xe2\x80\x94 like 18 quintillion grains of rice, once you finish the second half of the chess board.'b'The authors compare this second half of the chessboard to Moore\xe2\x80\x99s Law about the relentless doubling of digital computing power about every two years. Unlike the steam engine, which was physical and doubled in performance every 70 years, computers \xe2\x80\x9cget better, faster than anything else,\xc2\xa0ever,\xe2\x80\x9d says Brynjolfsson. Now that we\xe2\x80\x99re in the second half of the digital chessboard, you see cars that drive themselves in traffic, Jeopardy-champion supercomputers, flexible factory robots and pocket smartphones that are the equivalent of a supercomputer of just a generation ago.'b'Now add the spread of the Internet to both people and things \xe2\x80\x94 soon everyone on the planet will have a smartphone, and every cash register, airplane engine, student iPad and thermostat will be broadcasting digital data via the Internet. All this data means we can instantly discover and analyze patterns, instantly replicate what is working on a global scale and instantly improve what isn\xe2\x80\x99t working \xe2\x80\x94 whether it is eye surgery techniques, teaching fractions or how best to operate a G.E. engine at 30,000 feet. Suddenly, the speed and slope of improvement, they argue, gets very fast and steep.'b'Combinatorial advances mean you can take Google Maps and combine them with a smartphone app like Waze, through which drivers automatically transmit traffic conditions on their routes by just carrying their phone in their car, and meld both into a GPS system that not only tells you what the best route is to your destination but what the best route 'b'now'b' is because it also sees all the traffic everywhere. Instantly, you\xe2\x80\x99re the smartest driver in town.'b'\xc2\xa0Put all these advances together, say the authors, and you can see that our generation will have more power to improve (or destroy) the world than any before, relying on fewer people and more technology. But it also means that we need to rethink deeply our social contracts, because labor is so important to a person\xe2\x80\x99s identity and dignity and to societal stability. They suggest that we consider\xc2\xa0lowering\xc2\xa0taxes on human labor to make it cheaper relative to digital labor, that we reinvent education so more people can \xe2\x80\x9crace with machines\xe2\x80\x9d not against them, that we do much more to foster the entrepreneurship that invents new industries and jobs, and even consider guaranteeing every American a basic income. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of rethinking to do, they argue, because we\xe2\x80\x99re not only in a recession-induced employment slump. We\xe2\x80\x99re in a technological hurricane reshaping the workplace \xe2\x80\x94 and it just keeps doubling.'b'THE year is new, but we already have a candidate for the most troubling magazine essay of 2014: Amanda Hess on \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Why Women Aren\xe2\x80\x99t Welcome on the Interne'b't,\xe2\x80\x9d in the latest issue of Pacific Standard.'b'Hess takes a reality many people may be only dimly aware of \xe2\x80\x94 that female writers come in for an extraordinary amount of abuse online \xe2\x80\x94 and fleshes it out with detail, data and personal experience. The anecdotes, her own and others, range from the offensive to the terrifying, but there\xe2\x80\x99s also a thudding, soul-crushing sameness to them: graphic threats of sexual violence, rape and murder, intertwining and repeating.'b'Everyone who writes online comes in for abuse, but Hess\xe2\x80\x99s essay describes a form of intimate attack that few male journalists experience. We hear about it over drinks, we catch glimpses of it on Twitter, but it\xe2\x80\x99s easy for us to miss how radically different it makes our female peers\xe2\x80\x99 experience.'b'Hess\xe2\x80\x99s essay is mostly interested in solutions and responses: how women should deal with their harassers; how online forums should police abuse; how the laws surrounding stalking and discrimination might adapt to deal with online threats.'b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s also useful to think about root causes, and where all the hate and twisted fantasies are coming from. Is this misogyny always latent in a subset of the male population, or are there magnifying forces at work?'b'One potential magnifier, of course, is the Internet itself, which by its nature is a kind of unreal space for many users \xe2\x80\x94 a place where a range of impulses can be discussed, explored and acted out in what 'b'feels 'b'like a consequence-free zone.'b'There is some evidence that the emergence of this fantasy space has actually made the real world slightly safer for women: studies have shown 'b'correlations'b' between access to online pornography and lower rates of sexual assault. But the flip side is that many men who might have successfully regulated their darker impulses now have what seems like a green light to be \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually\xe2\x80\x9d abusive ... because they\xe2\x80\x99re just trying out a role, or because the woman on the receiving end seems no more real to them than a character in a pornographic film.'b'Another magnifier is ideology. Hess is a feminist who works in culture-war terrain, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that women writing from that perspective come in for more personal, sexualized abuse than women writing about, say, monetary policy. Where the personal is political, the political becomes personal more quickly, and the grotesque abuse that liberal, feminist writers can receive for being liberal feminists is a scandal that conservatives, especially, need to acknowledge and deplore.'b'But many 'b'conservative and libertarian women'b' also take a remarkable amount of sexual-political abuse. So it may be that the culture war cuts both ways, and a certain kind of left-wing narrative about gender \xe2\x80\x94 in which women are expected to hold liberal views just by virtue of being female \xe2\x80\x94 can become a license for allegedly progressive men to demean and dehumanize women who decline to play that part.'b'And then to further complicate matters, there is the phenomenon of intraliberal misogyny \xe2\x80\x94 like the flood of abuse, cited by Hess, that greeted the atheist writer Rebecca Watson when she 'b'wrote'b' about sexism and harassment at a skeptics\xe2\x80\x99 convention.'b'Cases like Watson\xe2\x80\x99s suggest that there\xe2\x80\x99s a chauvinist attitude in play here, a kind of crypto-ideology of sex and gender, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t map neatly onto what we usually think of as culture-war divides. This attitude is \xe2\x80\x9cliberal\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0in that it regards sexual license as an unalloyed good, and treats any kind of social or religious conservatism as a dead letter. But at the same time it wants to rebel and lash out against the strictures it feels that feminism and political correctness have placed on male liberty, male rights.'b'Sometimes this rebellion is just coarse and libertine: think of lad magazines, or the world of pick-up artists, or Seth MacFarlane on Oscar night. But where it intersects with status anxieties, personal failure and sexual frustration, it can turn vicious \xe2\x80\x94 in effect, scapegoating women (those frigid castraters, those promiscuous teases) for the culture\xe2\x80\x99s failure to deliver a beer-commercial vision of male happiness.'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t think either the left or the right quite understands this worldview: feminists tend to see it simply as a species of reaction, social conservatives as the dark fruit of sexual liberation, when it\xe2\x80\x99s really a combination of the two. And because it channels 'b'some legitimate male anxieties 'b'alongside its chauvinism and resentment, it probably can\xe2\x80\x99t be shamed or driven underground \xe2\x80\x94 or not, at least, without making its side effects for women that much more toxic.'b'Instead, it needs to be answered, somehow, with a more compelling vision of masculine goals, obligations and aspirations. Forging this vision is a project for both sexes. Living up to it, and cleansing the Internet of the worst misogyny, is ultimately a task for men.'b'POLITICS boils down to three pronouns: I, you, we. The politician who has them in balance goes a long way.'b'From the \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d comes the lust for attention necessary to face all the cameras, hear all the clamoring, weather all the commentary. From the \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d comes the yearning to be celebrated and, because celebration often hinges on accomplishment, the drive to get things done. Personal glory and public good dovetail. What we call narcissism overlaps with what we call altruism, neither of which is as tidy as we make it out to be.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x9d matters just as much in this transactional age. A politician must promise measurable improvement to each and every voter\xe2\x80\x99s life. That\xe2\x80\x99s what President Obama was trying to do with his pitch for the Affordable Care Act; he just went way too far. He became utterly fixated on the individual \xe2\x80\x9cyou,\xe2\x80\x9d when the best argument for universal health insurance was and is about the communal us.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x9d is essential. It must be in the mix. A politician who can cast his or her mission as 'b'our'b' mission not only finds the cloak in which self-regard is most fetchingly wrapped but also creates the sense of collective purpose that\xe2\x80\x99s vital to progress.'b'Can Chris Christie do that? Can he fit the \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d into me, me, me?'b'This question preceded the scandal that enveloped him last week. This question will also survive it, even if the public officials and reporters digging into his role in the 'b'lane closures'b' near the George Washington Bridge never find a smoking traffic cone. And that\xe2\x80\x99s because this question strikes to his overarching problem, which isn\xe2\x80\x99t an instance of gridlock but a pattern of grandiosity. While Christie sometimes seems to be fighting for you and for us, he almost always seems to have himself first and foremost in mind. There\xe2\x80\x99s too much \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d in the stew. Its flavor isn\xe2\x80\x99t sufficiently masked or muted.'b'In his news conference on Thursday he found a way to spell apology with a thousand I\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'Perhaps he nonetheless managed to assure voters that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t directed the nightmare on Fort Lee\xe2\x80\x99s streets. His denials couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been more emphatic, unconditional or expansive. He spoke and spoke and spoke, which made some sense, in that he cast himself as someone volunteering information rather than running from the truth.'b'But as he spoke and spoke and spoke, the apology sprawled into an odd aria of self-congratulation, and he even praised his own penance.'b'The incident, he said, didn\xe2\x80\x99t reflect \xe2\x80\x9cthe environment I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked so hard to achieve.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cActions have consequences, and I\xe2\x80\x99m living up to that right now,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am not a focus-group-tested, blow-dried candidate or governor.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am who I am.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am not a bully.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the rare moment in this office when I raise my voice.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Self-pity crept in.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am humiliated.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt is heartbreaking to me that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t told the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI am a very sad person.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBetrayed me.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBetrayed me.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBetrayed me.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There was an abundance of self-fascination, a surfeit of \xe2\x80\x9cme.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Of course calling out politicians for being entranced with themselves is like calling out actuaries for being interested in math. Certain professions require certain temperaments. But the lesson of political success and failure is that egoism does best with checks and camouflage, lest one\xe2\x80\x99s career be shortened, one\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate goal unreached. Newt Gingrich didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to exit the House of Representatives as soon as he did, and his life\xe2\x80\x99s plan wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to wind up hosting \xe2\x80\x9cCrossfire.\xe2\x80\x9d An overblown \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d landed him there.'b'BILL CLINTON\xe2\x80\x99S appetite for adulation may have been almost as keen, but its expression took the form of groveling as often as it did grandstanding. That\xe2\x80\x99s long been his genius: to leaven the boastful with the solicitous. Did he, as a candidate and a president, really feel our pain, or did he just feel the need to have us believe that? It didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. When that lower lip jutted out and those eyes misted, you wanted to give him a blanket, a binky and your support.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s interesting that the most frequently imagined presidential matchup for 2016 is Christie versus Hillary Clinton, because she\xe2\x80\x99s a textbook case in taming what the first President Bush, uncomfortable with the first-person singular, called \xe2\x80\x9cthe big I.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Back in 1993, shortly after she and Bill moved into the White House, she appeared in an angelic pose on the cover of this paper\xe2\x80\x99s magazine, for a profile titled 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSaint Hillary.\xe2\x80\x9d'b' It thrummed with self-satisfaction.'b'Then she fell. And then, as she picked herself up, she learned. In her bid for a Senate seat, she went on that famous \xe2\x80\x9clistening tour,\xe2\x80\x9d an exercise in self-effacement devoted to you, you, you. As secretary of state, she assiduously logged (and publicized) all those miles. It was a way of projecting a nose-to-the-grindstone humility, the appearance of which is a cornerstone of her sustained popularity.'b'Humility comes haltingly to Christie, if it comes at all. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a scintilla of it at the 2012 Republican convention. His keynote speech there was broadly 'b'disparaged'b' for the way the big I eclipsed the little mentions of Mitt Romney, in whose service it was supposedly being delivered. Chris Wallace, an anchor for Fox News, quipped, \xe2\x80\x9cFor a moment, I forgot who was the nominee of the party.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Humility was absent when Christie bragged to Dan Balz of The Washington Post about how many Republican luminaries 'b'pleaded with him'b' to get into the 2012 race and save the party. Humility doesn\xe2\x80\x99t factor into his habit, as governor, of 'b'having someone trail him'b' to collect video of his trademark confrontations with naysayers so that these exchanges can be uploaded onto YouTube, viral testaments to his vaunted truth telling.'b'When a politician\xe2\x80\x99s self-promotion scales the Olympian heights that his has scaled, a dangerous message goes out to aides, who assume that ascendance is everything and that victory vindicates anything: browbeating, rule-tweaking, a knot of traffic around the world\xe2\x80\x99s busiest bridge.'b'Something else happens, too. Or, rather, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. Real friendships beyond a posse of loyalists aren\xe2\x80\x99t made, though they\xe2\x80\x99re essential. A politician needs not just acolytes and fair-weather allies but also peers who feel real admiration and deep affection and will be there when the storm comes.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear, in the early days of this scandal, if Christie has that. Some Republican operatives have been strangely tepid in their assessments and defenses of him. Other Republican governors have been slow to rally around him.'b'Without enough \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwe,\xe2\x80\x9d a politician inevitably bumps up against a word that, unlike apology, is correctly spelled with an I.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s isolation.'b'SLEEP seems like a perfectly fine waste of time. Why would our bodies evolve to spend close to one-third of our lives completely out of it, when we could instead be doing something useful or exciting? Something that would, as an added bonus, be less likely to get us killed back when we were sleeping on the savanna?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSleep is such a dangerous thing to do, when you\xe2\x80\x99re out in the wild,\xe2\x80\x9d Maiken Nedergaard, a Danish biologist who has been leading research into sleep function at the University of Rochester\xe2\x80\x99s medical school, told me. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has to have a basic evolutional function. Otherwise it would have been eliminated.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ve known for some time that sleep is essential for 'b'forming and consolidating'b' memories and that it plays a 'b'central role'b' in the formation of new neuronal connections and the pruning of old ones. But that hardly seems enough to risk death-by-leopard-in-the-night. \xe2\x80\x9cIf sleep was just to remember what you did yesterday, that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be important enough,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Nedergaard explains.'b'In a series of new studies, 'b'published'b' this fall in the journal Science, the Nedergaard lab may at last be shedding light on just what it is that would be important enough. Sleep, it turns out, may play a crucial role in our brain\xe2\x80\x99s physiological maintenance. As your body sleeps, your brain is quite actively playing the part of mental janitor: It\xe2\x80\x99s clearing out all of the junk that has accumulated as a result of your daily thinking.'b'Recall what happens to your body during exercise. You start off full of energy, but soon enough your breathing turns uneven, your muscles tire, and your stamina runs its course. What\xe2\x80\x99s happening internally is that your body isn\xe2\x80\x99t able to deliver oxygen quickly enough to each muscle that needs it and instead creates needed energy anaerobically. And while that process allows you to keep on going, a 'b'side effect'b' is the accumulation of toxic byproducts in your muscle cells. Those byproducts are cleared out by the body\xe2\x80\x99s lymphatic system, allowing you to resume normal function without any permanent damage.'b'The lymphatic system serves as the body\xe2\x80\x99s custodian: Whenever waste is formed, it sweeps it clean. The brain, however, is outside its reach \xe2\x80\x94 despite the fact that your brain uses up about 20 percent of your body\xe2\x80\x99s energy. How, then, does its waste \xe2\x80\x94 like beta-amyloid, a protein associated with Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease \xe2\x80\x94 get cleared? What happens to all the wrappers and leftovers that litter the room after any mental workout?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThink about a fish tank,\xe2\x80\x9d says Dr. Nedergaard. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have a tank and no filter, the fish will eventually die. So, how do the brain cells get rid of their waste? Where is their filter?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'UNTIL a few years ago, the prevailing model was based on recycling: The brain got rid of its own waste, not only beta-amyloid but other metabolites, by breaking it down and recycling it at an individual cell level. When that process eventually failed, the buildup would result in age-related cognitive decline and diseases like Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s. That \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense\xe2\x80\x9d to Dr. Nedergaard, who says that \xe2\x80\x9cthe brain is too busy to recycle\xe2\x80\x9d all of its energy. Instead, she 'b'proposed'b' a brain equivalent of the lymphatic system, a network of channels that cleared out toxins with watery cerebrospinal fluid. She called it the glymphatic system, a nod to its dependence on glial cells (the supportive cells in the brain that work largely to maintain homeostasis and protect neurons) and its function as a sort of parallel lymphatic system.'b'She was hardly the first to think in those terms. \xe2\x80\x9cIt had been proposed about one hundred years ago, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the tools to study it properly,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. Now, however, with advanced microscopes and dyeing techniques, her team discovered that the brain\xe2\x80\x99s interstitial space \xe2\x80\x94 the fluid-filled area between tissue cells that takes up about 20 percent of the brain\xe2\x80\x99s total volume \xe2\x80\x94 was mainly dedicated to physically removing the cells\xe2\x80\x99 daily waste.'b'When members of Dr. Nedergaard\xe2\x80\x99s team injected small fluorescent tracers into the cerebrospinal fluid of anesthetized mice, they found that the tracers quickly entered the brain \xe2\x80\x94 and, eventually, exited it \xe2\x80\x94 via specific, predictable routes.'b'The next step was to see how and when, exactly, the glymphatic system did its work. \xe2\x80\x9cWe thought this cleaning process would require tremendous energy,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Nedergaard says. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so we asked, maybe this is something we do when we\xe2\x80\x99re sleeping, when the brain is really not processing information.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In a series of new studies on mice, her team discovered exactly that: When the mouse brain is sleeping or under anesthesia, it\xe2\x80\x99s busy cleaning out the waste that accumulated while it was awake.'b'In a mouse brain, the interstitial space takes up less room than it does in ours, approximately 14 percent of the total volume. Dr. Nedergaard found that when the mice slept, it swelled to over 20 percent. As a result, the cerebrospinal fluid could not only flow more freely but it could also reach further into the brain. In an awake brain, it would flow only along the brain\xe2\x80\x99s surface. Indeed, the awake flow was a mere 5 percent of the sleep flow. In a sleeping brain, waste was being cleared two times faster. \xe2\x80\x9cWe saw almost no inflow of cerebrospinal fluid into the brain when the mice were awake, but then when we anesthetized them, it started flowing. It\xe2\x80\x99s such a big difference I kept being afraid something was wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d says Dr. Nedergaard.'b'Similar work in humans is still in the future. Dr. Nedergaard is currently awaiting board approval to begin the equivalent study in adult brains in collaboration with the anesthesiologist Helene Benveniste at Stony Brook University.'b'So far the glymphatic system has been identified as the neural housekeeper in baboons, dogs and goats. \xe2\x80\x9cIf anything,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Nedergaard says, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s more needed in a bigger brain.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'MODERN society is increasingly ill equipped to provide our brains with the requisite cleaning time. The figures are stark. Some 80 percent of working adults 'b'suffer'b' to some extent from sleep deprivation. According to the National Sleep Foundation, adults should sleep seven to nine hours. 'b'On average'b', we\xe2\x80\x99re getting one to two hours less sleep a night than we did 50 to 100 years ago and 38 minutes less on weeknights than we did as little as 10 years ago. Between 50 and 70 million people in the United States suffer from some form of chronic sleep disorder. When our sleep is disturbed, whatever the cause, our cleaning system breaks down. At the University of Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s Center for Sleep and Circadian Neurobiology, Sigrid Veasey has been 'b'focusing'b' on precisely how restless nights disturb the brain\xe2\x80\x99s normal metabolism. What happens to our cognitive function when the trash piles up?'b'At the extreme end, the result could be the acceleration of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s and Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s. While we don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether sleep loss causes the disease, or the disease itself leads to sleep loss \xe2\x80\x94 what Dr. Veasey calls a \xe2\x80\x9cclassic chicken-and-egg\xe2\x80\x9d problem \xe2\x80\x94 we do know that the two are closely connected. Along with the sleep disturbances that characterize neurodegenerative diseases, there is a buildup of the types of proteins that the glymphatic system normally clears out during regular sleep, like beta-amyloids and tau, both associated with Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s and other types of dementia.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo me,\xe2\x80\x9d says Dr. Veasey, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the most compelling part of the Nedergaard research. That the clearance for these is dramatically reduced from prolonged wakefulness.\xe2\x80\x9d If we don\xe2\x80\x99t sleep well, we may be allowing the very things that cause neural degeneration to pile up unchecked.'b'Even at the relatively more benign end \xe2\x80\x94 the all-nighter or the extra-stressful week when you caught only a few hours a night \xe2\x80\x94 sleep deprivation, as everyone who has experienced it knows, impedes our ability to concentrate, to pay attention to our environment and to analyze information creatively. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we\xe2\x80\x99re sleep-deprived, we can\xe2\x80\x99t integrate or put together facts,\xe2\x80\x9d as Dr. Veasey puts it.'b'But there is a difference between the kind of fleeting sleep loss we sometimes experience and the chronic deprivation that comes from shift work, insomnia and the like. In one set of studies, soon to be published in The Journal of Neuroscience, the Veasey lab found that while our brains can recover quite readily from short-term sleep loss, chronic prolonged wakefulness and sleep disruption stresses the brain\xe2\x80\x99s metabolism. The result is the degeneration of key neurons involved in alertness and proper cortical function and a buildup of proteins associated with aging and neural degeneration.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s like the difference between a snowstorm\xe2\x80\x99s disrupting a single day of trash pickup and a prolonged strike. No longer quite as easy to fix, and even when the strike is over, there\xe2\x80\x99s likely to be some stray debris floating around for quite some time yet. \xe2\x80\x9cRecovery from sleep loss is slower than we\xe2\x80\x99d thought,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Veasey notes. \xe2\x80\x9cWe used to think that after a bit of recovery sleep, you should be fine. But this work shows you\xe2\x80\x99re not.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If you put her own research together with the findings from the Nedergaard lab, Dr. Veasey says, it \xe2\x80\x9cvery clearly shows that there\xe2\x80\x99s impaired clearance in the awake brain. We\xe2\x80\x99re really starting to realize that when we skip sleep, we may be doing irreparable damage to the brain, prematurely aging it or setting it up for heightened vulnerability to other insults.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In a society that is not only chronically sleep-deprived but also rapidly aging, that\xe2\x80\x99s bad news. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely that poor sleep as a child would actually cause Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s or Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d says Dr. Veasey, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s more likely that you may shift one of those diseases by a decade or so. That has profound health and economic implications.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a pernicious cycle. We work longer hours, become more stressed, sleep less, impair our brain\xe2\x80\x99s ability to clean up after all that hard work, and become even less able to sleep soundly. And if we reach for a sleeping pill to help us along? While work on the effects of sleeping aids on the glymphatic system remains to be done, the sleep researchers I spoke with agree that there\xe2\x80\x99s no evidence that aided sleep is as effective as natural sleep.'b'There is, however, reason to hope. If the main function of sleep is to take out our neural trash, that insight could eventually enable a new understanding of both neurodegenerative diseases and regular, age-related cognitive decline. By developing a diagnostic test to measure how well the glymphatic system functions, we could move one step closer to predicting someone\xe2\x80\x99s risk of developing conditions like Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s or other forms of dementia: The faster the fluids clear the decks, the more effectively the brain\xe2\x80\x99s metabolism is functioning.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a test could also be used in the emergency room after traumatic brain injury,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Nedergaard says, \xe2\x80\x9cto see who is at risk of developing decline in cognitive function.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We can also focus on developing earlier, more effective interventions to prevent cognitive decline. One approach would be to enable individuals who suffer from sleep loss to sleep more soundly \xe2\x80\x94 but how? Dr. Nedergaard\xe2\x80\x99s mice were able to clear their brain\xe2\x80\x99s waste almost as effectively under anesthesia as under normal sleeping conditions. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s really fascinating,\xe2\x80\x9d says Dr. Veasey. Though current sleeping aids may not quite do the trick, and anesthetics are too dangerous for daily use, the results suggest that there may be better ways of improving sleep pharmacologically.'b'Now that we have a better understanding of why sleep is so important, a new generation of drug makers can work to create the best possible environment for the trash pickup to occur in the first place \xe2\x80\x94 to make certain that our brain\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping metabolism is as efficient as it can possibly be.'b'A second approach would take the opposite tack, by seeking to mimic the cleanup-promoting actions of sleep in the awake brain, which could make a full night of sound sleep less necessary. To date, the brain\xe2\x80\x99s metabolic process hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been targeted as such by the pharmaceutical industry. There simply wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough evidence of its importance. In response to the evolving data, however, future drug interventions could focus directly on the glymphatic system, to promote the enhanced cleaning power of the sleeping brain in a brain that is fully awake. One day, scientists might be able to successfully mimic the expansion of the interstitial space that does the mental janitorial work so that we can achieve maximally efficient round-the-clock brain trash pickup.'b'If that day comes, they would be on their way to discovering that all-time miracle drug: one that, in Dr. Veasey\xe2\x80\x99s joking words, \xe2\x80\x9ccould mean we never have to sleep at all.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The first full week of the new year dutifully served up some of the themes likely to command attention in 2014.'b'The raising of Al Qaeda banners over the cities of Falluja and Ramadi, where some of the costliest battles of the American war in Iraq were fought, raised painful memories and renewed questioning about the efficacy of outside efforts to resolve the deep and bitter conflicts of the Middle East. As if to drive the point home, Afghanistan\xe2\x80\x99s United States-installed president, Hamid Karzai, infuriated the Obama administration by releasing dozens of prisoners accused of attacking Americans.'b'Then there was the \xe2\x80\x9cArctic vortex,\xe2\x80\x9d a meteorological phenomenon usually restricted to the top of the earth that became intimately familiar to millions when it sent a rogue southward loop of frigid air over all the states and provinces of North America. Temperatures abruptly plummeted to record lows, partially freezing Niagara Falls and even prompting Anana, the resident polar bear at Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s Lincoln Park Zoo, to take refuge indoors.\xc2\xa0The brutal cold raised the usual nyah-nyah chorus from climate-change deniers, but even as temperatures returned to seasonal norms, meteorologists and lots of other people anxiously wondered what other climactic quirks lay ahead.'b'And on the political front, the Republican who had seemed best positioned for a run for the White House, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, ran up against the conundrum of many ambitious politicians: Where does the buck stop?'b''b'The Pain of Falluja'b''b'The advances of Al Qaeda-backed Sunni insurgents in Falluja and Ramadi, the largest cities of Anbar Province, carried considerable dangers for Syria, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, countries that border on Anbar, and for the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, whose discriminatory policies against Sunnis have been at least partly responsible for the eruption of violence. The main insurgent group, which calls itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, has been increasingly active in Syria. Thousands of people have fled in anticipation of major fighting.'b'But outside Iraq, it was the symbolism of black insurgent flags over Falluja that struck painful chords. For many Americans, the images of destroyed buildings, burned-out vehicles, frightened Arabs and dusty Marines became the images of the war. Over two major operations, American Marines and soldiers did succeed in driving insurgents out or underground. But Sunni resentment continued to fester, waiting only for the Americans to pull out. One quote that surfaced several times over the past week was the conclusion of an 'b'analysis'b' of the battle in 2005 by Jonathan F. Keiler on Military.com: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Battle of Fallujah was not a defeat,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we cannot afford many more victories like it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In fact, Falluja was never really \xe2\x80\x9clost\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwon.\xe2\x80\x9d A former Baathist stronghold that enjoyed a privileged status under Saddam Hussein, it has been rebellious ever since his fall. Mr. Maliki contributed to the problem by discriminating against Sunnis in government. The immediate trigger for the latest violence was a government dismantling of a Sunni protest camp. So the latest battle for Falluja will not be the last.'b'Still, the\xc2\xa0images of\xc2\xa0black flags and masked insurgents brandishing AK-47s in Falluja led to wrenching questions about how and why the United States got into Iraq \xe2\x80\x94 and how it got out. Like Khe Sanh or Hamburger Hill in the Vietnam War, bloody battlefields won at huge cost by American troops and abandoned soon after, Falluja has now assumed the burden of a bloody question mark over the entire American war in Iraq. Many veterans of the battle now wonder what their sacrifice, and that of their fallen comrades, was for. \xc2\xa0'b'The debates and finger-pointing are likely to continue, especially as conflicts in places like Afghanistan, Libya, Egypt and Syria continue to fester. \xc2\xa0But neither President Obama nor the public shows any inclination to return to Iraq. Perhaps that is why in Afghanistan, from which United States troops are preparing to leave by year\xe2\x80\x99s end, Mr. Karzai shows so little regard for American sentiments. In this part of the world, it is not the outsiders who determine the outcome.'b''b'Fun in New Jersey'b''b'The week\xe2\x80\x99s drama in New Jersey was more entertaining than wrenching for most of those who followed it \xe2\x80\x94 except of course for Governor Christie, who suddenly ran up against a major obstacle on his road to the White House. Until now, the going had been good: Mr. Christie easily won re-election in November in a historically Democratic state, and as the chairman of the Republican Governors Association, he had secured a nationwide lectern.'b'Then came the revelation that a deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, and other close aides had sent emails to friends on the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which controls the George Washington Bridge, that it was \xe2\x80\x9ctime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\xe2\x80\x9d Fort Lee is on the New Jersey side of the bridge, and its mayor is a Democrat. So a few lanes were closed, and a nightmarish four-day jam developed in Fort Lee.'b'At his news conference\xc2\xa0on Thursday, Mr. Christie was in full damage control mode. For almost two hours, he did everything he could to present himself as both innocent and deeply penitent. It will be some time to ascertain how deep the damage is. As a moderate, Mr. Christie has plenty of enemies in his own party, and federal prosecutors have announced they have opened an inquiry that will, at the least, keep the story alive for many weeks to come.'b''b'Arctic Vortex'b''b'I encountered the Great Freeze in the Laurentian Mountains of Quebec, where even French Canadians accustomed to extreme cold confessed \xe2\x80\x9cqu\xe2\x80\x99il fait vraiment frette.\xe2\x80\x9d Rising\xc2\xa0from under several quilts on a dark morning is a challenge when the temperature outside is minus 30 and the sad baseboard heaters are in way over their heads.'b'As for the climate-change deniers, it is true that weather is notoriously fickle, and Arctic vortices have drifted on occasion out of their usual counterclockwise track around the North Pole. But the Arctic is heating up faster than the rest of the world, and that can lead to vagaries in air currents, causing, among other things, erratic behavior of the arctic vortex. So I see my frozen cabin as training for what is to come. Next, \xc2\xa0we will learn how to cope with freak floods and great heat waves.'b'\xc2\xa0'b''b'This is the debut of Quick History, a look at the week\xe2\x80\x99s news. 'b''b''b'NAIROBI, Kenya \xe2\x80\x94 SHE\xe2\x80\x99S a 4-year-old girl named Ida, fragile and shy, and when she was raped by a neighbor boy in September, her family tried to have the attacker arrested.'b'Yet the only interest the police showed was to ask for a bribe equivalent to $11.50 to make the arrest, the family says. The family didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the money, but perhaps the rapist did because the supposed police investigation stalled.'b'This kind of police indifference and corruption is a major factor in the impunity that leads to staggering levels of sexual violence in much of the world. 'b'A United Nations study released in September of 10,000 men in six countries'b' in Asia and the Pacific found that almost one-quarter acknowledged having raped a woman.'b'Other studies have reported similar findings. 'b'A 2011 study found'b' that 37 percent of men in part of South Africa acknowledged having raped women.'b'Often the victims, like Ida, are breathtakingly young. Ida lives in the vast, teeming Kibera slum in Nairobi, where she is being raised by a great-uncle and great-aunt, Stephen and Jane, after her parents largely abandoned her. Stephen and Jane are pillars of stability in a troubled area, and they have taken in three street children to raise along with four children of their own.'b'After Ida\xe2\x80\x99s rape, Jane closed her tiny restaurant for two weeks to get Ida surgery to repair internal injuries. Jane then made five trips to 'b'the Kilimani police station'b' that oversees the slum to try to get someone to make an arrest.'b'In this case, the evidence seemed strong: A neighbor had caught the alleged rapist in the house during the attack, and a police doctor had filled out forms documenting the rape and internal injuries.'b'Yet the police shrugged and did nothing. Stephen assumes that the perpetrator bribed the police.'b'After repeated inquiries, the police officers finally threatened to make an arrest in the rape case \xe2\x80\x94 not of the young man caught red-handed, but of Stephen and Jane for leaving the girl unattended and vulnerable.'b'The police station had the right physical infrastructure to deal with sexual violence. It had a separate counter for such cases, staffed by female officers. Posters denounced rape.'b'Yet Stephen and Jane tried to do the right thing \xe2\x80\x94 and then the police, in my presence, shouted at them and threatened to arrest them for their perseverance.'b'That was a terrifying threat, for who would look after Ida then? Stephen, a dignified man who was heartbroken at what happened to Ida, wilted. He seemed to have lost hope of justice.'b'What happened to Ida was no anomaly. I followed two other girls, a 13-year-old and a 14-year-old, who both said that they had been raped by a wealthier neighbor with H.I.V. Their families made eight visits to the Kilimani police station in Nairobi, waiting hours at a time, pleading for justice \xe2\x80\x94 but nothing ever happened. The families did spot the perpetrator\xe2\x80\x99s wife at the station, perhaps paying a bribe.'b'On each visit by the family, the police reported that some paper had mysteriously gone missing from the file. When a witness report was needed, the family brought the witness to the police station \xe2\x80\x94 and then the police charged her a fee for a piece of blank paper to write her statement on.'b'I tweeted a photo from the police station, saying the police wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take action. Soon after the tweet, the police officers\xe2\x80\x99 attitudes miraculously changed, and authorization for an arrest was given. Yet when the police went to make the arrest, the alleged rapist had obviously been tipped off somehow and had fled.'b'This breakdown in justice is common in much of the world. In many poor countries, the criminal justice system was set up decades ago to protect white colonial families and never really made the transition to serving the entire society. Salaries tend to be low, corruption high, accountability nonexistent \xe2\x80\x94 and, as a result, deterrence negligible.'b'In the United Nations survey, by far the most common reason men cited for raping women and girls was a sense of male entitlement, with explanations like \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted her.\xe2\x80\x9d Another factor was impunity, for more than two-thirds of men who acknowledged raping said that they had faced no legal consequences.'b'Attitudes like entitlement are hard to change. Reducing impunity is somewhat easier, and if we need evidence that imposing penalties can reduce the incidence of rape, just look at the United States.'b'Few people realize that rape has fallen by three-quarters over the last four decades in the United States, according to Justice Department statistics. It\xe2\x80\x99s true that underreporting makes the data not fully reliable, but underreporting is unlikely to be more serious now than in the 1970s.'b'The reason for the decline in American rape is simple. Most rapes are acquaintance rapes, and a generation ago police often shrugged. (\xe2\x80\x9cYou were drinking. You were making out with him. You still call it rape?\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'These attitudes still exist in America, rape kits often aren\xe2\x80\x99t tested even after evidence has been properly collected, and plenty of date rapists get away with their crimes. But punishment is still far more likely today than it once was \xe2\x80\x94 and that danger restrains men even when they\xe2\x80\x99re tipsy and lusting. If ending the impunity worked to reduce sexual violence in America, it can do the same in other countries.'b'That may be beginning to happen. After some horrifying rapes, India appears to be taking crimes of sexual violence more seriously in some cases. And here in Kenya, I was following Shining Hope for Communities, a slum-empowerment program in Kibera started by a remarkable young man, 'b'Kennedy Odede'b', who was once a homeless, uneducated street child in Kibera \xe2\x80\x94 and then taught himself to read and write, attended Wesleyan University, and now runs programs serving 43,000 slum residents.'b'Odede operates 'b'the Kibera School for Girls'b', an outstanding elementary school, and he soon found that many girls entering prekindergarten had been raped. To build a safer environment for the girls, he started a system of victim advocates to help push the police to do their jobs, and the group is winning support for its message that \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and that rapists should be punished.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s having an impact, offering a model for efforts to combat sexual violence worldwide.

I\xe2\x80\x99m the former Roving Feast columnist for The San Francisco Chronicle and continue to write and appear on radio and TV. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had about two dozen cookbooks published, and now I\xe2\x80\x99m creating private supper clubs around the world.'b'Whenever I travel I tote back something delicious \xe2\x80\x94 miso-pickles from Japan; ripe Camembert from France; spicy salami from Calabria. My handbag always holds something to make life even more delectable \xe2\x80\x94 a tube of harissa, maybe Sichuan preserved vegetables or a head of garlic.'b'The light changed at the corner, and I began to cross the street.'b'Suddenly I was in the air. Storefronts, billboards and leafy treetops floated slowly by, until my head hit the street and I was flung like a rag doll onto the pavement. I was racked with excruciating pain.'b'When I opened my eyes, emergency workers were asking if I knew who the president was. My arms were broken and I had a concussion. But the worst was just beginning.'b'That night, acrid smoke woke me. Nobody was smoking and no one else around me seemed to notice it.'b'My morning coffee was tasteless. Visitors brought delicacies to soothe me, but with each bite, I tasted dread. These well-chosen treats had no flavor, at least none that I recognized. Cinnamon drops, a childhood favorite, were bitter, horrible.\xc2\xa0Tamales were as bland as porridge. Bananas tasted like parsnips and smelled like nail polish remover.'b'It got no better as days went by. Gently saut\xc3\xa9ed mushrooms seemed like scorched bits of sponge. Red wine was just flat and sweet or unremittingly bitter.'b'I had lost my ability to taste and smell. It was like a musician losing her hearing. Fortunately, my senses weren\xe2\x80\x99t irretrievably destroyed. The nerve that transmits smell and taste to the brain had been injured but not severed, so, my neurologist reassured me, these senses could return. But when and how well? I felt desperate and terrified.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99d also lost all memories of tastes. Later, eating a bowl of ice cream, I murmured: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is delicious. What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d My first mouthful of bacon was \xe2\x80\x9cSo tasty!\xe2\x80\x9d But each encounter with bacon was like eating it for the first time. It might have been wonderful to be thrilled over and over again except that I felt incredibly stupid.'b'The awful phantom scents and distortions of actual smells \xe2\x80\x94 phantosmia and parosmia, respectively \xe2\x80\x94 continued: more smoke, moldering garbage, rotten fabric and worse.\xc2\xa0'b'To not smell the world around me, to not discern tastes, was horrifying. So, in the two years since the accident, I created a taste rehabilitation plan that gradually began to revive my senses of smell and taste.'b'After spitting out my first post-accident chocolate, I sampled as many types as I could. At first I could tolerate only the most insipid milk chocolate, but gradually I upped the cocoa level. Eventually I loved dark chocolate again.\xc2\xa0'b'COFFEE has been heartbreaking. As I sipped my way through San Francisco, New York and the cafe-bars of Naples, its flavor remained elusive. Looking into my cup was like looking at a soon-to-be-former lover. But I refused to just give up on the relationship. I signed up for a monthly delivery of selected beans and roasts from Britain\xe2\x80\x99s Union Roasters, each with their own tasting notes. I read the notes as I sipped: floral and sweet tones, caramel and chocolate and bitter and aromatic. I read and drank, read and drank, sniffed and sipped and drank. Eventually, coffee pleasure inched back, though it sometimes strangely disappears.'b'There were new loves, too. Fish \xe2\x80\x94 never a favorite \xe2\x80\x94 became a near-obsession. I craved it at least once a day. I wanted smoked mackerel, kippered herrings, sea bream and cod, tuna, anchovies and haddock: raw, grilled, fried, simmered.'b'I craved sweets, though I used to lack a sweet tooth. I baked frenetically: double chocolate salted caramel pie, miso-sticky toffee pudding, rhubarb-plum-blackberry crumble.'b'I kept challenging myself. San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s Mission Chinese Food with its roller-coaster of flavors and textures was like a tasting lab. The chef-owner, Danny Bowien, helped reunite me with my pickle-love with his array of pickled vegetables.'b'I noshed at farmers\xe2\x80\x99 markets: ripe berries, slices of juicy fruit. I haunted Korean restaurants, munched on Zar\xc3\xa9 at Fly Trap\xe2\x80\x99s meatballs with fragrant dried lime.\xc2\xa0'b'My regimen turned out to be the best way to rebuild one\xe2\x80\x99s sense of taste, according to Dr. Barry C. Smith, founder of the Center for Studies of the Senses at the School of Advanced Studies, London College.'b'In an interview I conducted with him for a BBC program about taste, he explained that when a part of the brain is injured, connections need to be rebuilt. Dr. Smith said women are statistically more successful at this.'b'He also offered a possible explanation of why new loves arrived as old ones disappeared. My trigeminal nerve, the pathway in the face that senses irritants, was intact. But my damaged brain was not letting alluring, aromatic qualities be brought to the feast. So cinnamon was only harsh, and maybe the qualities of fish and sweets I had previously found unpleasant were now undetected.'b'Often I feel that all is back to normal, but then I\xe2\x80\x99m betrayed. Recently whole grain bread assaulted me with the taste of sawdust, chocolate frozen yogurt was sour one week, sweet the next. I confuse citrus scents and I like too much salt in most things.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cReal smells\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 fragrant flowers, people and places that I love \xe2\x80\x94 are rare and intermittent. Spring and summer had bloomed without the sweetness of blossoms in the air, autumn had passed bereft of the scent of burning leaves and there had been no cozy whiff of roasting turkey or baking pies at Thanksgiving.'b'But one morning I was enveloped by the sweet smell of a freshly mowed lawn. I inhaled with frantic elation. Not knowing how long it would last, I tried to memorize the moment. It gave me hope, though it soon disappeared.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to pretend that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been perky and positive throughout; there were times I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even grateful to have survived.'b'But when I fight my way through to find moments of bliss, it\xe2\x80\x99s good.\xc2\xa0'b'A sardine sandwich at Brooklyn\xe2\x80\x99s Saltie made me nearly cry with pleasure, as did the ripe peach I ate as I walked down the street. A roasted carrot smorrebrod at San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s Bar Tartine made me feel as if I were drifting through layers of flavor and texture: sweet roasted carrot, tangy fresh cheese and a thin layer of dark bread. Looking around, I wondered why everyone wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the same throes of ecstasy.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEven damaged,\xe2\x80\x9d my companion said, \xe2\x80\x9cno one appreciates flavor the way you do.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'YOU get to know all the old people.

Marilyn helped me embrace it. She complained about the slow elevator and taught me how to trick the dryer into running an extra load, free. She was always late for the opera. She was feisty \xe2\x80\x94 a word my peers employ when describing people who curse after the age of 80. And then, according to an index card taped to the lobby wall, she was dead.'b'Blue ink announced that the family would be sitting shiva in her apartment. It listed the hours, the days, and finally, in block letters: ALL FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS WELCOME. I did a double take. Was Marilyn not selling me on the wonders of dryer sheets a mere two days ago?'b'My first thought: I should go. For one thing, I am Jewish and have been to plenty of shivas before, so that takes some of the awkwardness out of it. My second thought: I should definitely not go. I had lived in the building for only seven months. I barely knew this person.'b'Part of what\xe2\x80\x99s interesting about living in New York is how much business you can choose to have with people who are absolutely none of your business. There\xe2\x80\x99s something incongruous about how careful we are to set up boundaries, how ardent we are about maintaining them, and how quick we are to take a wrecking ball to them when it suits us. We train each other to disengage at the daily level, to greet with silent nods, to ignore music coming through the walls or tearful phone calls on the street. Yet when we want to feel we\xe2\x80\x99re doing the right thing, we come swooping in.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not that I had ignored Marilyn. I liked Marilyn. But I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t about to invite her to dinner or ask her if she had grandkids or engage her a moment longer than I had to. I work from home, after all. I need my space. Now tragedy had struck and I was going to, what \xe2\x80\x94 buy a fruit plate and go sit down with a stranger\xe2\x80\x99s family?'b'In the end, I made my decision the way I make all decisions I\xe2\x80\x99ve brutalized with analysis \xe2\x80\x94 by giving up and awaiting logistical intervention. On the second night of the shiva, a friend requested that we move our drinks date to a dinner date, thus giving me a clear window to comb my hair and walk upstairs.'b'When I opened the door, I was momentarily distracted by the fact that Marilyn\xe2\x80\x99s apartment could eat my apartment for breakfast. I nearly forgot why I had come. I made my way through the mourners eating pastrami and found a woman directly related to Marilyn.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWas it sudden?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked after introducing myself.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh no,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was pneumonia. It had been going on for months.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d I shook my head. \xe2\x80\x9cI just can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you sweet to come?\xe2\x80\x9d she grabbed my arm and insisted I squeeze in on the sofa, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he lived a long life.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWho he?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOur father.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWho art in heaven?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy father.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMarilyn\xe2\x80\x99s husband?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The woman cocked her head and blinked at me.

We\xe2\x80\x99re sitting shiva for him.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Lenore. Lenore is the name of the feisty lady who helped me with the dryer.'b'This is the danger of deciding, too late, to be a good neighbor, to care because you think you should. Extricating myself from the situation required a social deftness that I did not possess. I stayed for 11 minutes. Marilyn offered me food, which I was too embarrassed to accept. I had dinner plans and also a hunch that she thought I had secretly come for the food. We chatted about the building and the mayoral election and she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been nicer, suggesting that maybe we were meant to be friends as well as neighbors.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll never forget your name,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, apologizing again, hugging her and slinking back down the stairs.'b'At the mailboxes the next afternoon, I ran into Lenore. Because I was checking my mail in the middle of the day. Because I have become one of them. But I still have my boundaries. So when Lenore exclaimed \xe2\x80\x9cLook at all this junk mail, it\xe2\x80\x99s enough to kill me!\xe2\x80\x9d I only nodded. I did not tell her that I thought it had, in fact, killed her. Perhaps, when it comes to death, it\xe2\x80\x99s better to live and let live.'b'Dennis Rodman helps Kim Jong-un score propaganda points.'b'LONDON \xe2\x80\x94  Should gender segregation be allowed in Muslim public meetings? That question has created a surprising degree of political heat in Britain in recent weeks.'b'The controversy began after a number of hard-line Muslim student groups insisted that men and women must sit separately at their public meetings and lectures. Universities UK, the official voice of British universities, deemed such segregation to be acceptable so long as women were not forced to sit at the back of the room. The guidance caused an uproar, drawing the prime minister, David Cameron, into the debate, and leading an opposition spokesman, Chuka Umunna, to insist that \xe2\x80\x9ca future Labour government would not allow or tolerate segregation in our universities.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For some, the debate has been an expression of Islamophobia, singling out Muslim practices for criticism. For others, the attitude of Universities UK demonstrates how many in authority are willing to appease Islamist extremists, and to tolerate the intolerable so as not to offend minority groups.'b'It is true that many racists have seized on this controversy, as they have done with other issues, to foment hostility toward Muslims. But that only makes it more necessary for progressives to claim issues such as this, to bend them to progressive, rather than racist, purposes. To challenge specifically Islamic practices is not necessarily to be \xe2\x80\x9cIslamophobic.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The problems revealed by the controversy are not only those of Islam: The storm over segregated meetings is merely the latest in a series of clashes. From questions of blasphemy to divisions over same-sex marriage, the fractiousness of such debates reflects growing tensions between some strands of religious thought and the changing demands of a secular society. It also reflects a deep-set confusion over what is meant by \xe2\x80\x9creligious freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Most Western societies have, for historical reasons, come to think of \xe2\x80\x9creligious freedom\xe2\x80\x9d as a special kind of liberty. The modern debate about tolerance and rights developed in Europe from the 17th century onward, primarily within a religious framework. Questions about what could be tolerated were, at heart, questions of how, and how far, the state and the established church should accommodate religious dissent.'b'Today we live in a different world. Religion is no longer the crucible in which political and intellectual disputes take place. Questions of freedom and tolerance are not about how the dominant religious establishment should respond to dissenting theological views, but about the degree to which society should tolerate, and the law permit, speech and activity that might be offensive or hateful, that might challenge the state or undermine national security.'b'From today\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, it is easier to see that religious freedom is not a special kind of liberty, but one expression of a broader set of freedoms of conscience, belief, assembly and action.'b'Whatever one\xe2\x80\x99s beliefs, secular or religious, there should be complete freedom to express them, short of inciting violence. Whatever one\xe2\x80\x99s beliefs, there should be freedom to assemble to promote them. And whatever one\xe2\x80\x99s beliefs, there should be freedom to act upon those beliefs, so long as, in so doing, one neither physically harms another individual nor transgresses that individual\xe2\x80\x99s rights in the public sphere. These should be the fundamental principles by which we judge the permissibility of any belief or act, religious or secular.'b'Many on both sides of the debate about religious freedom fail to grasp these principles. Many secularists, for instance, insist that religious views should be kept out of the public sphere. That cannot be right, any more than it would be right to bar the views of racists, conservatives, Communists or gay activists from the public sphere.'b'Many believers want to retain privileges for religion. As a society, we should tolerate as far as possible the desire of people, religious or secular, to live according to their consciences. But that tolerance ends when someone acting upon his or her conscience causes harm to another or infringes on another\xe2\x80\x99s rights.'b'So religions should have no right to prevent the publication of material believers deem offensive. Religious freedom requires that people of faith be allowed to speak or act in ways that might offend others; it does not require that others do not cause them offense.'b'There is nothing wrong with the American government\xe2\x80\x99s requiring Catholic-run hospitals to give employees health insurance that includes free contraception: Churches are not being forced to provide contraception. In their role as secular employers, they are being asked to provide benefits that all employers must provide. To exempt church-run organizations would be to deny those benefits to a particular group of employees.'b'A religious institution should be free to bar women from acting as clergy members or to segregate the sexes in religious services or private meetings. But enforced segregation in a public forum is a different matter and must be opposed.'b'All this is not, as many believers suggest, to enforce secular discrimination against religious belief. Many nonreligious groups \xe2\x80\x94 fascists, Communists, Greens \xe2\x80\x94 could claim that their beliefs mandated certain actions or practices. Yet, it would be illegal for a racist cafe owner to bar black people, or for Greens to destroy a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s field of legally grown genetically modified crops, however deep-set their particular beliefs.'b'There is a line, in other words, that cannot be crossed \xe2\x80\x94 even if conscience demands it. That line should be in the same place for religious believers as for nonbelievers.'b'Under pressure, Universities UK has withdrawn its advice on segregation, pending a review. Whether it has really understood the meaning of religious freedom in a modern society is a moot question. What seems certain, given continuing confusion about the relationship between the religious and the secular, is that we will see many more such controversies.'b''b'\n'b'Kenan Malik 'b' is a writer, lecturer, broadcaster and the author of \xe2\x80\x9cFrom Fatwa to Jihad: The Rushdie Affair and Its Aftermath.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b''b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94  A month after the execution of Jang Song-thaek, widely viewed as 'b'North Korea'b'\xe2\x80\x99s second-most-powerful leader, 'b'China'b' remains stymied in relations with its reclusive, defiant neighbor. This is not a new story. Though few in Beijing are prepared to admit it, China\xe2\x80\x99s policies toward North Korea have long been a conspicuous failure.'b'China\xe2\x80\x99s official reactions to the North\xe2\x80\x99s internal power struggle have, thus far, been limited largely to formulaic calls for internal stability. But Mr. Jang\xe2\x80\x99s ouster must be deeply disquieting to senior Chinese policy makers, who yet again find themselves on the outside looking in.'b'By nearly all indications, leaders in Beijing were blindsided by the latest events. By contrast, South Korean intelligence disclosed Mr. Jang\xe2\x80\x99s fall from power a full five days before its stunning climax at a Politburo meeting on Dec. 8.'b'The Kim dynasty intends to keep China in the dark as fully as it can. Chinese leaders, including President Xi Jinping, voice periodic frustration with North Korea, but none seems able or willing to translate Pyongyang\xe2\x80\x99s ever increasing economic dependence on China into meaningful influence.'b'From the earliest years of China\xe2\x80\x99s reforms, under Deng Xiaoping, Beijing has repeatedly sought to coax North Korea toward gradual economic change, normal relations with the outside world and increased attentiveness to Chinese interests. Yet North Korea continues to exhibit its characteristic mix of demands and defiance, including repeated threats aimed at South Korea and accelerated development of 'b'nuclear weapons'b' and long-range ballistic missiles opposed by all outside powers, including China. Other than some modest steps toward informal marketization in the North, China\xe2\x80\x99s policy record on Pyongyang over three decades remains unblemished by success.'b'Mr. Jang was China\xe2\x80\x99s primary channel into the North. This did not make him Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s man, but he had far more extensive international experience than any other leader in Pyongyang. His control of various business interests in the North and responsibility for special economic zones along the Chinese border enabled him to amass substantial economic power.'b'Beijing probably calculated that Mr. Jang was prepared to open a limited window into the North. The Chinese may also have seen him as a potential advocate for stability \xe2\x80\x94 which they had long sought in North Korea but never found.'b'But Mr. Jang had undoubtedly acquired numerous enemies during decades of unforgiving political warfare in Pyongyang. There were mounting suspicions within ruling circles that he was too beholden to Chinese interests. Mr. Jang\xe2\x80\x99s accumulation of wealth and his economic links with China proved his undoing once Kim Jong-un, the third leader of the Kim dynasty, demanded a redistribution of the spoils.'b'North Korean officials linked to Mr. Jang now find themselves under suspicion; reportedly, others have also been purged or executed. Advocates of cooperation with China face greater risks as Mr. Kim consolidates his power and demands unquestioning loyalty from all subordinates. Without reliable allies in North Korea, China must deal with an impetuous and grandiose young leader who pays China very little heed.'b'Mr. Jang\xe2\x80\x99s fall from power is the latest in a long succession of Chinese policy failures in North Korea. Many analysts argue that North Korea is a buffer state for China, used by Beijing to insulate it from American pressure. But the reverse is more the case: China is a buffer state for North Korea, for Beijing continues to be Pyongyang\xe2\x80\x99s primary enabler.'b'Chinese foreign policy currently appears bold and assertive, but on the peninsula China\xe2\x80\x99s stance remains exceedingly risk-averse. The question is why Beijing continues to exhibit such caution, even outright timidity, toward the North.'b'Some argue that the legacy of the Korean War weighs heavily on the minds of more traditional constituencies within the Chinese Communist Party and army. But deeper, current anxieties also inhibit Beijing. China fears that extreme actions by an unpredictable, heavily armed neighbor with a xenophobic leadership could trigger a larger crisis on the peninsula that would quickly involve China. Lacking realistic options to control North Korean behavior, China prefers instead to avoid doing anything that might alienate Pyongyang.'b'While China insists that it wants normal state-to-state relations with North Korea, it is not prepared to impose conditions on its isolated, troublesome neighbor, much less undertake a larger reassessment of its policies. As a consequence, Mr. Kim sees little reason to follow China\xe2\x80\x99s advice, and he will continue to zealously guard against Chinese influence on the North.'b'The one exception to China\xe2\x80\x99s passivity toward the North is its promotion of closer ties with Seoul. South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s trade with China now exceeds $250 billion, more than the South\xe2\x80\x99s combined trade with Japan and the United States. (China\xe2\x80\x99s two-way trade with North Korea is worth approximately $6 billion.) South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s president, Park Geun-hye, has already been welcomed on a state visit to Beijing; there has been no equivalent welcome for Mr. Kim, and it is not even certain that he seeks one.'b'China exhibits ample unease about addressing the larger risks posed by North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s actions and goals. The purge of Mr. Jang serves only to underscore Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s lack of influence in Pyongyang. The United States and South Korea both hope for more from China, but Beijing seems paralyzed in policy indecision.'b'The failures of policy on the Korean Peninsula are not those of China alone, but Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s risk aversion bespeaks a larger absence of will and imagination on China\xe2\x80\x99s part. Without a more candid conversation among Beijing, Seoul and Washington, the latent risk of an acute threat on the peninsula remains uncomfortably high.'b'South Korea and the United States seem fully prepared for serious dialogue with China. Only Beijing seems unable to decide, leaving unaddressed the prospect of a severe crisis that cannot possibly be in China\xe2\x80\x99s interest.'b''b'\n'b'Jonathan D.

So when he embarked on the transition from female to male at age 18 \xe2\x80\x94 changing his name, taking testosterone and eventually undergoing surgery to remove his breasts \xe2\x80\x94 he left his female reproductive organs intact.'b'In his mid-20s, he decided it was time. He stopped taking testosterone and started trying to get pregnant. Eventually, in 2009, after beginning graduate school at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, he sought fertility treatment at Baystate Reproductive Medicine. Baystate was one of the few clinics in the country with an anti-discrimination policy for gender identity. And yet, it refused to treat him, arguing that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t have enough expertise to treat transgender patients. Mr. Inkster insisted there was no medical reason to deny him; his baby-making parts were the same as any woman\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'The more than 700,000 transgender people living in the United States have long faced discrimination by health care providers. Over the past 15 years, activists have fought to compel insurers to cover transgender-related health care \xe2\x80\x94 from hormone therapy to gender reassignment surgery \xe2\x80\x94 or at least be prevented from excluding transgender clients from buying policies for basic services. Finally, starting this month, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, \xe2\x80\x9ctranssexualism\xe2\x80\x9d can no longer be considered a pre-existing condition. What\xe2\x80\x99s been left out of the spotlight: having babies. Many Americans have come to accept gay parents; the transgender community is next in line for recognition.'b'Mr. Inkster eventually found another clinic that helped him conceive via in vitro fertilization and donor sperm, and in October 2010, he gave birth to a daughter, Elise. A month later, he sued Baystate for sexual discrimination.'b'According to court documents, he was denied treatment after failing to comply with a clinic counselor\xe2\x80\x99s request that he supply information from his current therapist that he was emotionally ready to handle pregnancy and parenting. Mr. Inkster argued that nontransgender patients weren\xe2\x80\x99t asked to do the same. This fall, the 'b'Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination'b' \xe2\x80\x94 the state\xe2\x80\x99s civil rights agency \xe2\x80\x94 found probable cause for Mr. Inkster. The case will next move on to a conciliation conference, and then to a possible settlement.'b'Admittedly, the idea of a \xe2\x80\x9cpregnant man\xe2\x80\x9d makes many people uncomfortable, and photos of Mr. Inkster caressing his bulging belly are startling. The issue is controversial even within the transgender community. \xe2\x80\x9cSome people believe if you\xe2\x80\x99re a trans man you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be wanting to bear kids,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'Jamison Green'b', the author of \xe2\x80\x9cBecoming a Visible Man,\xe2\x80\x9d told me. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not something men do. Others think, If you have a body part that does something, why can\xe2\x80\x99t you use it? It\xe2\x80\x99s your body.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The issue brings up unprecedented questions: Do you use your genetic material to reproduce, and at what time during your transition? Before or after hormone therapy? Before undergoing reassignment surgery that will make you sterile? Should a transgender man like Mr. Inkster keep his breasts so he can nurse later? Is it generally psychologically healthier for someone like him to freeze his eggs and have them inseminated and the embryos transferred to a female partner or surrogate, rather than leave his female reproductive parts intact? How might years of estrogen or testosterone therapy affect eggs and sperm?'b'These questions matter. 'b'One study'b' published last year in the journal Human Reproduction of 90 transgender men in Belgium found that 54 percent wished to have children, and 38 percent would have considered freezing their eggs if the procedure had been available. Other 'b'research'b', published in 2002, by Belgian fertility doctors with Western European transgender women found that 40 percent wanted to have children, and 77 percent felt they should have the option to preserve their sperm before hormone treatment. As fertility technology improves and becomes more widely available, transgender people are realizing that they will have more options in the future.'b'Jennifer Hastings, a family care physician based in Santa Cruz, Calif., who specializes in transgender health care, says it\xe2\x80\x99s tricky to balance gender identity with family desires. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have preteens who come in and say, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be a mom. I want to be a dad!\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the other hand, there are youth who know they want to have biological kids from the outset and freeze sperm or eggs after going through puberty.\xe2\x80\x9d Since some doctors are concerned that letting transgender teenagers go through puberty in the gender they don\xe2\x80\x99t identify with may be deeply traumatic, they might administer puberty-blocking medications that delay adolescence until the teenagers can begin hormone therapy in their desired gender. But this means the patients may give up the option of having biological children later. \xe2\x80\x9cIt can be a painful choice for their parents to make,\xe2\x80\x9d says Dr. Hastings.'b'All these paths toward creating transgender families deserve careful study. Yet these issues aren\xe2\x80\x99t likely to get the attention they deserve until transgender people succeed in getting basic health care first.'b'Stories of transgender people in health care settings being gawked at, mocked or interrogated about their status abound. A disturbing 2011 study by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force of 6,450 transgender adults found that 19 percent reported having been refused treatment by a health care provider because of their gender identity, and 28 percent said they had postponed medical care because of discrimination. For those who had visited a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office or hospital, 24 percent said they had been denied equal treatment, 25 percent reported having been harassed or disrespected, and 2 percent had been physically assaulted.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s understandable that doctors might be nervous about not having enough training to treat people who are under long-term hormone therapy. Medical schools need to make students more aware of transgender health needs, which in most cases aren\xe2\x80\x99t that different from everyone else\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cIf someone has a sore throat, they have a sore throat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Hastings. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not because of their hormones.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The bigger challenge may be to get medical providers to overcome their bias. Discomfort over difference isn\xe2\x80\x99t an excuse to refuse compassionate care to a transgender person in an emergency room or a fertility clinic, or for insurance companies to refuse to cover that care. Gender identity has nothing to do with the desire to have children \xe2\x80\x94 or with who will make a good parent.'b'Suddenly it\xe2\x80\x99s O.K., even mandatory, for politicians with national ambitions to talk about helping the poor. This is easy for Democrats, who can go back to being the party of F.D.R. and L.B.J. It\xe2\x80\x99s much more difficult for Republicans, who are having a hard time shaking their reputation for reverse Robin-Hoodism, for being the party that takes from the poor and gives to the rich.'b'And the reason that reputation is so hard to shake is that it\xe2\x80\x99s justified. It\xe2\x80\x99s not much of an exaggeration to say that right now Republicans are doing all they can to hurt the poor, and they would have inflicted vast additional harm if they had won the 2012 election. Moreover, G.O.P. harshness toward the less fortunate isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a matter of spite (although that\xe2\x80\x99s part of it); it\xe2\x80\x99s deeply rooted in the party\xe2\x80\x99s ideology, which is why recent speeches by leading Republicans declaring that they do too care about the poor have been almost completely devoid of policy specifics.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with the recent Republican track record.'b'The most important current policy development in America is the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, a k a Obamacare. Most Republican-controlled states are, however, refusing to implement a key part of the act, the expansion of Medicaid, thereby'b' denying health coverage'b' to almost five million low-income Americans. And the amazing thing is that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to great lengths to block aid to the poor even though letting the aid through would cost almost nothing; nearly all the costs of Medicaid expansion would be paid by Washington.'b'Meanwhile, those Republican-controlled states are slashing unemployment benefits, 'b'education financing'b' and more. As I said, it\xe2\x80\x99s not much of an exaggeration to say that the G.O.P. is hurting the poor as much as it can.'b'What would Republicans have done if they had won the White House in 2012? Much more of the same. Bear in mind that every 'b'budget'b' the G.O.P. has offered since it took over the House in 2010 involves savage cuts in Medicaid, food stamps and other antipoverty programs.'b'Still, can\xe2\x80\x99t Republicans change their approach? The answer, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say, is almost surely no.'b'First of all, they\xe2\x80\x99re deeply committed to the view that efforts to aid the poor are actually perpetuating poverty, by reducing incentives to work. And to be fair, this view isn\xe2\x80\x99t completely wrong.'b'True, it\xe2\x80\x99s total nonsense when applied to'b' unemployment insurance.'b' The notion that unemployment is high because we\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x9cpaying people not to work\xe2\x80\x9d is a fallacy (no matter how desperate you make the unemployed, their desperation does nothing to create more jobs) wrapped in a falsehood (very few people are choosing to remain unemployed and keep collecting benefit checks).'b'But our patchwork, uncoordinated system of antipoverty programs does have the effect of penalizing efforts by lower-income households to improve their position: the more they earn, the fewer benefits they can collect. In effect, these households face very high marginal tax rates. A large fraction, in some cases 80 cents or more, of each additional dollar they earn is clawed back by the government.'b'The question is what we could do to reduce these high effective tax rates. We could simply slash benefits; this would reduce the disincentive to work, but only by intensifying the misery of the poor. And the poor would become less productive as well as more miserable; it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to take advantage of a low marginal tax rate when you\xe2\x80\x99re suffering from poor nutrition and inadequate health care.'b'Alternatively, we could reduce the rate at which benefits phase out. In fact, one of the unheralded virtues of Obamacare is that it does just that. That is, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just improve the lot of the poor; it 'b'improves their incentives,'b' because the subsidies families receive for health care fade out gradually with higher income, instead of simply disappearing for anyone too affluent to receive Medicaid. But improving incentives this way means spending more, not less, on the safety net, and taxes on the affluent have to rise to pay for that spending. And it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine any leading Republican being willing to go down that road \xe2\x80\x94 or surviving the inevitable primary challenge if he did.'b'The point is that a party committed to small government and low taxes on the rich is, more or less necessarily, a party committed to hurting, not helping, the poor.'b'Will this ever change? Well, Republicans weren\xe2\x80\x99t always like this. In fact, all of our major antipoverty programs \xe2\x80\x94 Medicaid, food stamps, the earned-income tax credit \xe2\x80\x94 used to have bipartisan support. And maybe someday moderation will return to the G.O.P.'b'For now, however, Republicans are in a deep sense enemies of America\xe2\x80\x99s poor. And that will remain true no matter how hard the likes of Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio try to convince us otherwise.'b'LISA BONCHEK ADAMS has spent the last seven years in a fierce and very public cage fight with death. Since a mammogram detected the first toxic seeds of cancer in her left breast when she was 37, she has 'b'blogged and tweeted'b' copiously about her contest with the advancing disease. She has tweeted through morphine haze and radiation burn. Even by contemporary standards of social-media self-disclosure, she is a phenomenon. (Last week she tweeted her 165,000th tweet.) A rapt audience of several thousand follows her unsparing narrative of mastectomy, chemotherapy, radiation, biopsies and scans, pumps and drains and catheters, grueling drug trials and grim side effects, along with her posts on how to tell the children, potshots at the breast cancer lobby, poetry and resolute calls to \xe2\x80\x9cpersevere.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the last month or two, her broadcasts have changed tone slightly; her optimism has become a little less unassailable. As 2013 ended, the cancer that had colonized her lymph nodes, liver, lungs and bones had established a beachhead in her spine, the pathway to her (so far tumor-free) brain. She was deemed too sick to qualify for the latest drug trial. She is bedridden at New York\xe2\x80\x99s Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, which has embraced her as a research subject and proselytizer for the institution.'b'Lisa Adams is still alive, still blogging, and insists she is not dying, but the blog has become less about prolonging her survival and more about managing her excruciating pain. Her poetry has become darker.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe words of disease become words my brain gravitates to,\xe2\x80\x9d she pecked the other day after a blast of radiation. \xe2\x80\x9cThe ebb and flow of cancer, Of life. And so too, Inevitably, Of death.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In October 2012 I 'b'wrote'b' about my father-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s death from cancer in a British hospital. There, more routinely than in the United States, patients are offered the option of being unplugged from everything except pain killers and allowed to slip peacefully from life. His death seemed to me a humane and honorable alternative to the frantic medical trench warfare that often makes an expensive misery of death in America.'b'Among doctors here, there is a growing appreciation of palliative care that favors the quality of the remaining life rather than endless \xe2\x80\x9cheroic measures\xe2\x80\x9d that may or may not prolong life but assure the final days are clamorous, tense and painful. (And they often leave survivors bankrupt.) What Britain and other countries know, and my country is learning, is that every cancer need not be Verdun, a war of attrition waged regardless of the cost or the casualties. It seemed to me, and still does, that there is something enviable about going gently. One intriguing lung cancer 'b'study'b' even suggests that patients given early palliative care instead of the most aggressive chemotherapy not only have a better quality of life, they actually live a bit longer.'b'When my wife, who had her own brush with cancer and who 'b'has written'b' about Lisa Adams\xe2\x80\x99s case for The Guardian, introduced me to the cancer blog, my first thought was of my father-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s calm death. Lisa Adams\xe2\x80\x99s choice is in a sense the opposite. Her aim was to buy as much time as possible to watch her three children grow up. So she is all about heroic measures. She is constantly engaged in battlefield strategy with her medical team. There is always the prospect of another research trial to excite her hopes. She responds defiantly to any suggestion that the end is approaching.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am not on my deathbed,\xe2\x80\x9d she told me in an email from the hospital. \xe2\x80\x9cPeriods of cancer progression and stability are part of the natural course of this disease. I will be tweeting about my life and diagnosis for some time to come,\xe2\x80\x9d she predicted, and I hope she\xe2\x80\x99s right. In any case, I cannot imagine Lisa Adams reaching a point where resistance gives way to acceptance. That is entirely her choice, and deserving of our respect. But her decision to live her cancer onstage invites us to think about it, debate it, learn from it.'b'The first thing I would say is that her decision to treat her terminal disease as a military campaign has worked for her. Her relationship with the hospital provides her with intensive, premium medical care, including not just constant maintenance and aggressive treatment but such Sloan-Kettering amenities as the Caring Canines program, in which patients get a playful cuddle with visiting dogs. (Neither Adams nor Sloan-Kettering would tell me what all this costs or whether it is covered by insurance.)'b'Whether or not this excellent care has added months or years to her life, as she clearly believes, is a medical judgment, and her doctors, bound by privacy rules, won\xe2\x80\x99t say. Most trials of new drugs aim to determine safety and calibrate dosages, and make no promise of slowing the disease in the participants. But any reader can see that Adams\xe2\x80\x99s online omnipresence has given her a sense of purpose, a measure of control in a tumultuous time, and the comfort of a loyal, protective online community. Social media have become a kind of self-medication.'b'Lisa Adams\xe2\x80\x99s defiance has also been good for Memorial Sloan-Kettering. She has been an eager research subject, and those, I was surprised to learn, are in short supply. Scott Ramsey of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle cited a 'b'study'b' showing that only 3 percent of adult cancer patients who are eligible to enroll in clinical trials do so, and, he said, their reluctance has been \xe2\x80\x9ca huge bottleneck in cancer research.\xe2\x80\x9d Some 40 percent of clinical trials fail to get the minimum enrollment. Adams has been a cheerleader for cancer research in general and Memorial Sloan-Kettering in particular. In fact, she has implored followers to contribute to a research fund set up at the hospital in her name, and has raised about $50,000 so far. \xe2\x80\x9cWe love it!\xe2\x80\x9d the hospital tweeted last week about the Lisa Adams phenomenon. \xe2\x80\x9cAn important contribution to cancer patients, families, and clinicians! :)\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Beyond that, whether her campaign has been a public service is a more complicated question.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am public about this disease in order to shed light on the daily lives of women living with this diagnosis rather than hiding behind the pink party line that is the only one that gets the spotlight,\xe2\x80\x9d she told me in an email. (The ubiquitous pink-ribbon breast cancer campaigners have been 'b'faulted'b' for overselling the wonders of early detection and giving short shrift to research.)'b'Her digital presence is no doubt a comfort to many of her followers. On the other hand, as cancer experts I consulted pointed out, Adams is the standard-bearer for an approach to cancer that honors the warrior, that may raise false hopes, and that, implicitly, seems to peg patients like my father-in-law as failures.'b'Steven Goodman, an associate dean of the Stanford University School of Medicine, said he cringes at the combat metaphor, because it suggests that those who choose not to spend their final days in battle, using every weapon in the high-tech medical arsenal, lack character or willpower.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the last person to second-guess what she did,\xe2\x80\x9d Goodman told me, after perusing Adams\xe2\x80\x99s blog. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure it has brought meaning, a deserved sense of accomplishment. But it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be unduly praised. Equal praise is due to those who accept an inevitable fate with grace and courage.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I was a college sophomore in April 1971, still mourning the death of Jimi Hendrix, when I learned that a campus organization to which I belonged was being spied on by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The news landed in the mailbox of the Black Student Union \xe2\x80\x94 at what is now known as Widener University, not far from Philadelphia \xe2\x80\x94 in an envelope stuffed with documents that had been stolen from an F.B.I. office in nearby Media, Pa.'b'The burglars referred to themselves as the Citizens Commission to Investigate the F.B.I. The streets were soon teeming with agents who tried in vain to find them. But the mailings continued, reaching news organizations, members of Congress and people like us who had been placed under surveillance.'b'A fledgling organization at the time, the Black Student Union was hardly a hotbed of revolutionary agitation. We sponsored cultural events, played a bit of a role in campus politics, recruited black students and threw the occasional party. We were flattered to find that the boogeyman of the era, J. Edgar Hoover, found us worthy of surveillance; it gave us more significance than we deserved and seemed to place us on the level of fearsome outfits like the Weathermen and the Black Panthers.'b'The excitement turned to chagrin as we read the documents. The F.B.I. described us as an incompetent and \xe2\x80\x9cbasically dormant\xe2\x80\x9d group that had displayed no \xe2\x80\x9cradical or militant ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d Based on that judgment, the bureau should have focused its attentions elsewhere. Instead, the Philadelphia office said that it would develop informants on the Black Student Union\xe2\x80\x99s leaders so that it could become \xe2\x80\x9caware of their identity and background.\xe2\x80\x9d In other words, innocence was no defense; people who came under unwarranted scrutiny might never escape it.'b'The F.B.I. agents on the Black Student Union case were either lazy or inept; they targeted the wrong people as purported \xe2\x80\x9cleaders\xe2\x80\x9d of our group. They could easily have learned who the actual leaders were from the local or campus newspapers. Instead, they relied on an informant who knew us only from a distance and who fingered two people so peripheral to the group that it was a stretch to call them members.'b'The woman they mistakenly designated a leader wore her hair in a spectacular Afro reminiscent of Angela Davis. The man \xe2\x80\x94 an amiable soul who had a brooding countenance and an impressive Afro of his own \xe2\x80\x94 was guilty of nothing more than looking the revolutionary part.'b'The burglary exposed a patently illegal domestic spying program that monitored the lives of innocent Americans with the help of an extensive network of informants. Cointelpro, for counterintelligence program, was created under Hoover in 1956, and by this time was aimed mainly at antiwar groups, civil rights organizations and black \xe2\x80\x9chate groups.\xe2\x80\x9d (In Hoover\xe2\x80\x99s world, the latter seemed to mean any organizations that used the words \xe2\x80\x9cblack\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cAfro\xe2\x80\x9d in their name.)'b'The portrait of the F.B.I. that began to emerge with the burglary, and was gradually filled in during the ensuing years, showed a voracious surveillance machine that hounded innocent people and tried to destroy their reputations. The Media burglars were never arrested and their identities were unknown to the general public until 'b'last week'b' when their story was told in a new book, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Burglary: The Discovery of J. Edgar Hoover\xe2\x80\x99s Secret FBI,\xe2\x80\x9d by Betty Medsger, a former Washington Post reporter.'b'The Media burglary, the Watergate break-in and revelations that the Central Intelligence Agency was operating illegally inside the country led to a congressional investigation, conducted under the leadership of Senator Frank Church, Democrat of Idaho. The Church committee\xe2\x80\x99s findings led to stronger oversight and the curtailment of F.B.I. powers.'b'Those safeguards were breached in the wake of 9/11, when Congress passed the Patriot Act. More recently, the stolen documents released last year by Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, showed that new technology has enabled government surveillance on a vast scale. Four decades after the Media burglary, Americans are, if anything, less protected from unjustified spying than they were during the tyrannical reign of J. Edgar Hoover.'b'President Obama has often issued executive orders to get around recalcitrant Republicans in Congress or to clarify existing policy. Yet there are some areas where the president has been too reticent. The start of a new year is a good moment to point out some matters ripe for executive action.'b'We begin with Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s baffling refusal to issue an executive order banning discrimination by federal contractors based on sexual orientation or gender identity. A long-sought measure to outlaw such discrimination by all employers'b' passed the Senate 'b'in November with Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s support, but it remains stalled in the House. Many federal contractors already have anti-discrimination policies in place. With a stroke of his pen, Mr. Obama could stop federal money from going to contractors that discriminate. There is no reason for further delay.'b'Mr. Obama should also use the government\xe2\x80\x99s contracting clout to combat sweatshops overseas. He could issue an executive order to develop and enforce a code of conduct for overseas factories that make uniforms and other clothing for the government. A recent investigation 'b'by The Times'b' found that many of these factories violate basic labor standards, by, for example, hiring underage workers. He should also issue an order directing officials to give preference to companies that offer good pay and benefits.'b'A proposal to do that was sidetracked in early 2010 amid objections from business groups and Republican lawmakers. But that was before Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s new focus on income inequality, and before protests by workers for companies that provide services at federal venues like the Smithsonian museums.'b'On guns, Mr. Obama has issued many executive orders and directives to combat illegal weapons and promote public safety. This month, for instance, he 'b'signed two executive orders'b' to strengthen gun background checks. The first clarified that states must submit notice of involuntary outpatient mental health treatment as well as inpatient commitments to the national database of disqualified gun purchasers. The other confirmed that sharing the information does not violate medical privacy.'b'But he should go further. He can encourage more submissions of eligible mental health records by instructing that Justice Department grants be withheld from the 15 states with egregiously poor compliance records.'b'On another front, Mr. Obama should use his executive authority to end a longstanding misinterpretation of the Helms amendment, which prohibits foreign aid money from being used to \xe2\x80\x9cpay for the performance of abortion as a method of family planning or to motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That language clearly excludes cases of life endangerment, incest and rape. Yet Republican and Democratic administrations, including Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s, have treated it as an absolute abortion ban. As a result, help is denied to women and girls subjected to rape in armed conflicts. Women with life-threatening pregnancies are denied assistance as well, thwarting efforts to reduce unsafe abortions around the world. The misreading of the Helms amendment has also deterred foreign-aid recipients from providing factual information about abortion to the public. It is time Mr. Obama set matters right.'b'Nearly three years after the fighting began, many of the most dire predictions about Syria\xe2\x80\x99s civil war have come true. The conflict has not only engulfed the country, killing more than 130,000 people and forcing more than nine million civilians out of their homes. Increasingly, it has metastasized across the region, destabilizing neighboring countries and serving as a magnet for militants, or would-be militants, including some from the United States.'b'The war has become exceedingly complicated, compounding the bitter rivalry between Saudi Arabia, a Sunni-majority state that is a major backer of Sunni rebels seeking to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad, and Shiite-led Iran, Mr. Assad\xe2\x80\x99s top supporter. And there is no indication that the United States or any other power has the influence to bring it to an end. The prospects for a peace conference planned for Jan. 22 in Switzerland are not encouraging. Just getting all sides to the table will not be enough, and even that looks doubtful.'b'One of the most alarming developments has been the extent to which better-equipped and better-trained Islamist and Qaeda-linked rebel groups have come to dominate the battlefield over more moderate, secular and Western-oriented opposition forces. The moderates have long been fractured and the United States has been slow to provide them with supplies and training, in part because of problems controlling who gets the assistance.'b'Since the beginning of January, a Qaeda affiliate that even other militants consider too extreme, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, known as ISIS, has come under attack from some of its former allies, including another Qaeda affiliate, the Nusra Front, and the Islamic Front, a coalition of Islamic fighters once allied with the American-backed Free Syrian Army. These groups were outraged by ISIS, which wants to build an Islamist caliphate straddling Syria and Iraq, and its campaign to control the insurgency by brutalizing rebel-held areas, confiscating other rebels\xe2\x80\x99 weapons, arresting hundreds of Syrians, and executing those they say have violated Shariah law.'b'The fighting has reportedly forced ISIS to abandon some bases and towns it controlled; it would be good if Qaeda hard-liners were truly on the run. The United States suspended shipments of nonlethal aid (like trucks and food rations) to the moderates in December after warehouses of equipment were seized by the Islamic Front. (The C.I.A. runs a separate covert program to arm and train the rebels.)'b'Administration officials are now 'b'considering resuming the nonlethal assistance'b', which is run by the State Department, after some of the Islamists fought alongside the Free Syrian Army against ISIS and the Islamic Front returned the warehouses and some of the contents. Providing such aid could strengthen the moderates and encourage them to attend peace talks. It could also reassure the Saudis, who want the United States to play a bigger role in Syria and fear that American moves toward cooperation with Iran, especially as America eases sanctions as part of the interim 'b' nuclear deal'b', will propel Iran\xe2\x80\x99s rise as a regional power.'b'There is a danger that American aid could backfire, as it did in the 1980s when support for Mujahedeen fighters battling the Soviets helped to create fertile ground for terrorist movements years later. But the risk may be worth it. Syrian extremists are already trying to recruit and train Americans and other Westerners to carry out attacks in the United States, senior American officials say.'b'A negotiated political agreement remains the best solution to the Syrian war, but there are no signs that Mr. Assad and the rebels are ready to make any deal. Several opposition factions met in Spain last Friday but could not even agree on whether to attend the peace conference. As one of Mr. Assad\xe2\x80\x99s main allies, Iran could go a long way toward persuading the world of its readiness to play a constructive international role by encouraging Mr. Assad to step aside in favor of a transitional government. But there is no sign of that, and it appears that Iran will not attend the peace conference, presuming it even takes place.'b'Both Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and President Park Geun-hye of South Korea are pushing to have high school history textbooks in their countries rewritten to reflect their political views.'b'Mr. Abe has instructed the Education Ministry to approve only textbooks that promote patriotism. He is primarily concerned about the World War II era, and wants to shift the focus away from disgraceful chapters in that history. For example, he wants the Korean \xe2\x80\x9ccomfort women\xe2\x80\x9d issue taken out of textbooks, and he wants to downplay the mass killings committed by Japanese troops in Nanking. His critics say he is trying to foster dangerous nationalism by sanitizing Japan\xe2\x80\x99s wartime aggression.'b'Ms. Park is concerned about the portrayal of Japanese colonialism and the postcolonial South Korean dictatorships in history books. She wants to downplay Korean collaboration with the Japanese colonial authorities and last summer pushed the South Korean Education Ministry to approve a new textbook that says those who worked with the Japanese did so under coercion. (A majority of professionals and elite civil servants today come from families that worked with the Japanese colonizers.) Academics, trade unions and teachers have  accused Ms. Park of distorting history.'b'Mr. Abe and Ms. Park both have personal family histories that make them sensitive to the war and collaboration. After Japan\xe2\x80\x99s defeat in the war, the Allied powers arrested Mr. Abe\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, as a suspected class A war criminal. Ms. Park\xe2\x80\x99s father, Park Chung-hee, was an Imperial Japanese Army officer during the colonial era and South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s military dictator from 1962 to 1979. In both countries, these dangerous efforts to revise textbooks threaten to thwart the lessons of history.'b'LONDON \xe2\x80\x94  \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not from here,\xe2\x80\x9d I heard during a recent visit to my hometown, Wroclaw, in Poland, while I was out for a drink one evening with friends. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? I was born here,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, surprised.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak Polish,\xe2\x80\x9d said my interlocutor, thoughtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there\xe2\x80\x99s something strange about you, something different.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It left me wondering if I was in danger of becoming an immigrant in my own country. Or even whether I would discover \xe2\x80\x94 back home in London \xe2\x80\x94 that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really Polish anymore.'b'For migrants everywhere, the question of belonging is often fraught, sometimes vexing. Like many Poles, I am dismayed by recent remarks about immigration from Britain\xe2\x80\x99s prime minister, David Cameron. Britain\xe2\x80\x99s membership in the European Union meant that restrictions on the free movement of workers from the newer member states Bulgaria and Romania were lifted on Jan. 1. In response, Mr. Cameron introduced a series of measures \xe2\x80\x94 with rhetoric to match \xe2\x80\x94 aimed at discouraging a fresh round of immigration.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe hard-working British public are rightly concerned that migrants do not come here to exploit our public services and our benefits system,\xe2\x80\x9d he said last month. The theme continued, when the prime minister told the BBC last week: \xe2\x80\x9cThere are other European countries who, like me, think it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong that someone from Poland who comes here, who works hard \xe2\x80\x94 and I am absolutely all in favor of that \xe2\x80\x94 but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we should be paying child benefit to their family back at home in Poland.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'With the barbarian hordes from Bulgaria and Romania still massing at the border, it seems that Britain\xe2\x80\x99s Polish community is a convenient stand-in for Mr. Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s populist turn. His words drew a series of stinging ripostes. He received a letter of remonstration from Poland\xe2\x80\x99s former prime minister, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, and a warning from our former president, Lech Walesa, that Britain was acting \xe2\x80\x9cirrationally and shortsightedly.\xe2\x80\x9d Our ambassador to London, Witold Sobkow, published an article protesting that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no need to single out, to stigmatize Poles,\xe2\x80\x9d who come to Britain \xe2\x80\x9cto work hard, not to abuse the system or grab the benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I began to wonder where this sudden hostility toward immigrants in Mr. Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s words came from. My British partner, of Jamaican parents who arrived in Britain in the 1960s, said angrily: \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody is an immigrant here. It\xe2\x80\x99s an island for God\xe2\x80\x99s sakes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Back in 2003, I relocated to London for love, rather than the promise of earning more money than I could make in Poland. In that respect, perhaps, I was unrepresentative of the majority of Poles who immigrated after Poland joined the European Union in 2004, yet I took my part in what has become Britain\xe2\x80\x99s second largest immigrant group (after Indians). Recent data from the Office for National Statistics reveals that 521,000 Poles now live here.'b'During the first few years, I did not spend much time with other Poles in London. I was enthralled by the cultural diversity. My partner was right: In London, the most ethnically diverse city in Britain, 37 percent of residents were born abroad; more than 300 languages are spoken.'b'For middle-class Britons, the Polish influx was generally welcome. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised to learn that the Camerons themselves had employed a proverbial \xe2\x80\x9cPolish plumber\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and marveled at the quick work and modest charge. But it is no secret that the post-2004 immigration did, in some places, have an impact on low-paying jobs, driving hourly rates down, especially in industries like construction or in the service sector. The situation has gotten only worse since the recession.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou see a truck with immigrants arriving and they will work for 5 pounds an hour, with no experience or papers. What am I to do?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a British friend who is a certified carpenter yet struggles to find enough work.'b'With the British economy still striving for recovery, the complex issue of immigration for such a small island will inevitably worry many. If I were the prime minister, I would be concerned, too. It\xe2\x80\x99s no secret that Mr. Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s Conservative Party faces a tough fight before the 2015 general election. The surge of support for the right-wing populist U.K. Independence Party is surely on Mr. Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s mind. What better way to win back lost voters than to demonize immigrants \xe2\x80\x94 even if that means conveniently putting aside the facts.'b'According to the migration research unit of University College London, \xe2\x80\x9cthe recent immigrants were 45 percent less likely to receive state benefits or tax credits than U.K. natives over the period 2000-11.\xe2\x80\x9d So much for benefit-grabbing Poles. People from the European Economic Area also pay about 34 percent more in taxes than they receive in benefits and have made a staggering net contribution of \xc2\xa325 billion ($41 billion) to Britain\xe2\x80\x99s public finances.'b'Data provided by the London School of Economics has also revealed that \xe2\x80\x9cimmigrants are younger and better educated than their U.K.-born counterparts.\xe2\x80\x9d That ought to come as a relief to Mr. Cameron \xe2\x80\x94 considering the problem Britain faces of finding the future tax revenues to support an aging population.'b'Of course, every country has its right to control its borders and the flow of immigration. But inciting fear about immigrants is a cheap, and scary, practice. Mr. Cameron should beware the damage it will do to Britain and its international standing.'b'One evening recently, I called my parents on Skype.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, you can always come back,\xe2\x80\x9d my mother said, hoping I would change my mind. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had this conversation many times over the last 10 years, but this time it seemed different.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLondon is my home, Mum,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever the politicians want us to think.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'By \xe2\x80\x9cus,\xe2\x80\x9d I meant other immigrants.

No one, especially the leadership, is spared, and no perspective is more telling or reliable than the anonymous satirist\xe2\x80\x99s. A popular joke during the last presidential election invited Syrians also to vote: \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, our president will be your finance minister, too!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Even Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, whose dour and scowling face is what many associate with the Islamic Revolution, was said to be a connoisseur of satire. In a recent interview with the website Jamaran, one of Ayatollah Khomeini\xe2\x80\x99s close confidants, Mahmoud Doayee, revealed that the leader demanded to hear the jokes about him, even laughing heartily at times. To him, they were the sociocultural weather vane of all that needed \xe2\x80\x9ccorrecting,\xe2\x80\x9d which at times meant \xe2\x80\x9celiminating.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Long before there was a fatwa against the British novelist Salman Rushdie, there was an official death threat against Iran\xe2\x80\x99s best-known satirist, Hadi Khorsandi, who had allegedly insulted Muhammad.

I laughed and said, \xe2\x80\x98A half-hour delay is in the makeup of the Iranian character.\xe2\x80\x99 The detective sighed and said, \xe2\x80\x98Then God help you, because your killers are Iranian, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99'b'As early as the mid-1970s, the ayatollah began to methodically undermine the regime of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi by following the advice of the philosopher Jean Paul, who said, \xe2\x80\x9cFreedom begets wit, and wit begets freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d He first set out to weaken the shah with words before actually driving him from the palace in January 1979.'b'The shah had been the muse of the poets, but his impeccable wardrobe and fine manners provided little material for the satirists. Irreverence was the ayatollah\xe2\x80\x99s main weapon in his war against elitism.'b'Ayatollah Khomeini never referred to the shah by his royal titles, addressing him by his first name, or worse yet, as \xe2\x80\x9clittle man.\xe2\x80\x9d Soon, the nation ceased to call the shah \xe2\x80\x9cthe king of kings,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthe shadow of God on earth.\xe2\x80\x9d In revolutionary slogans, the shah was reduced to \xe2\x80\x9cMohammed the nose,\xe2\x80\x9d a reference that shattered the sanctity of the royal family.'b'The monarchy had symbolized civility and beauty, but the new theocratic order embraced all that was drab as a way to honor the masses.

Yet Iranians\xe2\x80\x99 reaction to his mysteriously amassed wealth is only occasionally one of outrage.

What if he had been able to follow through on his 'b'dramatic withdrawal'b' of soldiers and settlers from the Gaza Strip the year before?'b'This \xe2\x80\x9cdisengagement\xe2\x80\x9d from Gaza in 2005 was Israel\xe2\x80\x99s first practical act of decolonization since Prime Minister Menachem Begin \xe2\x80\x94 like Mr. Sharon, from the Likud party \xe2\x80\x94 withdrew Israeli troops and settlers from the Sinai Peninsula following a treaty with Egypt. Mr. Sharon\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawal was much more significant because it was intended to lead to a peaceable partition of the Holy Land itself.'b'To Mr. Begin, such ideas remained taboo until the end of his life. Mr. Sharon, too, had devoted much of his career to fighting the Palestinians and building settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. As many of those asking \xe2\x80\x9cwhat if\xe2\x80\x9d believed, only Mr. Sharon, aptly nicknamed \xe2\x80\x9cthe bulldozer,\xe2\x80\x9d could have taken them down with such ease. No wonder many Israelis continue to pine for an alternate reality in which Mr. Sharon remains a vital presence.'b'Still, as we continue to ask \xe2\x80\x9cwhat if,\xe2\x80\x9d we must also recognize the ways that Mr. Sharon\xe2\x80\x99s decisions a decade ago continue to shape Israeli politics.'b'For one thing, they have defined the terms of Israeli-Palestinian talks today. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know what the issues are and the parameters,\xe2\x80\x9d the American secretary of state, John Kerry, recently declared. There\xe2\x80\x99s no deal in sight yet, but there is a sense, among both Israelis and Palestinians, that America means business.'b'Any such speculation around Mr. Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s efforts would have been unimaginable without Mr. Sharon\xe2\x80\x99s efforts a decade earlier. Mr. Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cissues and the parameters\xe2\x80\x9d are the very same that Mr. Sharon promoted during his premiership, in particular his acceptance of a deal enabling Israel to annex the large blocs of settlements close to the West Bank border in exchange for land now inside Israel.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn light of new realities on the ground,\xe2\x80\x9d President George W. Bush wrote in a historic 'b'2004 letter'b' to Mr. Sharon, \xe2\x80\x9cincluding already existing major Israeli population centers, it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The formula in the letter, long haggled over with Israeli diplomats before publication, was now American policy. Following Israel\xe2\x80\x99s lead, it envisioned land swaps, with the Israelis keeping the large settlement blocs near the old border. Swapping land meant ceding land, and this was no less than heresy in pristine Likud doctrine.'b'But Mr. Sharon had made his choice, and not reluctantly. He wanted the blocs-plus-swaps scenario to be the preferred, pragmatic policy not only of the Israeli left and center, which were steadily sliding in his direction, but also of the rightist-religious coalition, which he had been vigorously involved in setting up.'b'Today, apart from the hardest core of settlers, their rabbis and their politician-supporters within the Likud, that consensus has indeed emerged \xe2\x80\x94 and makes the negotiations possible under another Likud prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.'b'This was not a sudden whim on Mr. Sharon\xe2\x80\x99s part. The first significant indicator that he was finally maturing came soon after his election as prime minister, in 2001, with his relatively restrained use of the army and air force during the second intifada. His critics feared that the hawkish Mr. Sharon would send the army in full force against Palestinian terrorist groups, causing a blood bath in the West Bank.'b'It did not happen. \xe2\x80\x9cRestraint is strength,\xe2\x80\x9d he proclaimed, with a decisiveness that harked back to his role during the Yom Kippur War of 1973, when he led his division in a hard drive across the Suez Canal. Many officers and men who had no prior loyalty to him concluded that without his calm, steadfast command there would likely have been no Israeli crossing that October, nor ever.'b'But where did the \xe2\x80\x9crestraint\xe2\x80\x9d come from? Was it an upshot of his generalship during the 1982-1983 Lebanon War, including standing by while Christian militias slaughtered Palestinian and Lebanese Shiites, which brought obloquy on Israel, and especially on him? Perhaps: Despite his hard-boiled image, after weeks of war, it was hard for him to look into the eyes of bereaved Israeli parents of soldiers who were killed in Lebanon and persuade them their sacrifice was justified.'b'As prime minister, Mr. Sharon began using buzzwords like \xe2\x80\x9coccupation\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 once the sole province of the peace movement \xe2\x80\x94 in his speeches explaining Israel\xe2\x80\x99s strategic interest in Palestinian independence. Likud members feared that his secession from the party was imminent. They were right.'b'Above all, Mr. Sharon\xe2\x80\x99s resounding legacy is his confrontation with the settlers in Gaza who refused to leave in 2005, including many from the West Bank who infiltrated the Gaza settlements to \xe2\x80\x9cdefend\xe2\x80\x9d them.

Not even in a boomtown.'b'SHOULD rap lyrics be used in court as evidence of a crime?'b'Next week, the Supreme Court of New Jersey will hear a case that could help decide just that. At issue is a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s extensive use of rap lyrics, composed by a man named Vonte Skinner, as evidence of his involvement in a 2005 shooting.'b'During Mr. Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s trial in 2008, the prosecutor read the jury 13 pages of violent lyrics written by Mr. Skinner, even though all of the lyrics were composed before the shooting (in some cases, years before) and none of them mentioned the victim or specific details about the crime.'b'In keeping with rap\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgangsta\xe2\x80\x9d subgenre, the lyrics read like an ode to violent street life, with lines like \xe2\x80\x9cIn the hood, I am a threat / It\xe2\x80\x99s written on my arm and signed in blood on my Tech\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a reference to a Tec-9 handgun. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in love with you, death.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The other evidence against Mr. Skinner was largely testimony from witnesses who changed their stories multiple times. And yet, the jury found him guilty of attempted murder, and he was sentenced to 30 years in prison.'b'But in 2012, the conviction was overturned by an appellate court that 'b'ruled'b' that the lyrics should never have been admitted as evidence. The majority opinion stated, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a significant doubt about whether the jurors would have found defendant guilty if they had not been required to listen to the extended reading of these disturbing and highly prejudicial lyrics.\xe2\x80\x9d The state appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court.'b'Mr. Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s case is far from unique. Rap lyrics and videos are turning up as evidence in courtrooms across the country with alarming regularity. Last year, the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey 'b'found'b' that in 18 cases in which various courts considered the admissibility of rap as evidence, the lyrics were allowed nearly 80 percent of the time.'b'As expert witnesses who have testified in such cases, we have observed firsthand how prosecutors misrepresent rap music to judges and juries, who rarely understand the genre conventions of gangsta rap or the industry forces that drive aspiring rappers to adopt this style. One common tactic is to present a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s raps as autobiography. Even when defendants use a stage name to signal their creation of a fictional first-person narrator, rap about exploits that are exaggerated to the point of absurdity, and make use of figurative language, prosecutors will insist that the lyrics are effectively rhymed confessions. No other form of fictional expression is exploited this way in the courts.'b'Admittedly, the complex and creative manipulation of identity in rap helps account for its treatment in court. Nobody believes that Johnny Cash shot a man in Reno or that Bret Easton Ellis carried out the gory murders described in \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Psycho\xe2\x80\x9d; neither artist claimed that he was writing autobiographically. That\xe2\x80\x99s not always the case with rappers. Many remain in character long after they leave the recording studio, trying to establish their authenticity by convincing listeners that they live the lives they rap about. Those familiar with the genre understand that this posturing is often nothing more than a marketing pose.'b'But for the uninitiated, it is easy to conflate these artists with their art. It becomes easier still when that art reinforces stereotypes about young men of color \xe2\x80\x94 who are almost exclusively the defendants in these cases \xe2\x80\x94 as violent, hypersexual and dangerous. If that\xe2\x80\x99s what jurors see, what are the chances for a fair trial?'b'To address this question, Stuart Fischoff, a psychologist at California State University, Los Angeles, conducted a 'b'study'b' in the late 1990s to measure the impact of gangsta rap lyrics on juries. Participants were given basic biographical information about a hypothetical 18-year-old black male, but only some were shown a set of his violent, sexually explicit rap lyrics. Those who read the lyrics were significantly more likely to believe the man was capable of committing a murder than those who did not.'b'More than a decade later, this bias appears to persist, leaving rap music as vulnerable as ever to judicial abuse. Although appellate courts in Massachusetts and Maryland have recently reversed convictions after citing prosecutors for their improper use of rap lyrics or videos as evidence, most similar appeals are unsuccessful. Just this summer the Supreme Court of Nevada upheld the admissibility of rap lyrics as evidence in a first-degree murder case. A definitive ruling by the Supreme Court of New Jersey rejecting this use of rap music could help turn the tide.'b'In anticipation of Mr. Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s case, the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey filed an amicus brief arguing that rap lyrics, however unsavory they might be, are \xe2\x80\x9cartistic expressions entitled to constitutional protection.\xe2\x80\x9d For scholars and fans of hip-hop, this is a statement of the obvious. In today\xe2\x80\x99s court system, sadly, it is not.'b'If you are in politics or public life, you probably had some moment of spine-tingling transcendence. Maybe you read the Declaration of Independence or watched the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\xe2\x80\x99s mountaintop sermon, or read Nelson Mandela\xe2\x80\x99s 1964 speech from the dock.'b'Suddenly, your imagination was inflamed beyond its normal scope. You were enveloped by this epic sense that public life could be truly heroic. The people who issue these statements brought their lives to a glorious point, pledging their sacred honor, offering to sacrifice their lives for some public mission.'b'You got into public life inspired by something like that. But how do you execute that sort of vision? How do you translate the poetry of high aspiration into the prose of effective governance? This is the common problem today. Most people go into public life for the right reasons, but government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work. The quality of the people is high, but the quality of leadership is low.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99d suggest three responses.'b'First, apprentice yourself to a master craftsman. Find yourself a modern version of Ted Kennedy cobbling together a Senate majority. Find yourself some silent backstage official, who knows how to slide ideas through the bureaucracy. Glue yourself to that person in order to learn the craft of governance.'b'Schools are good at transmitting what the philosopher Michael Oakeshott called technical knowledge. This is the sort of knowledge that can be expressed in rules and put down in books \xe2\x80\x94 like the recipes in a cookbook. But craftsmen possess and transmit practical knowledge. This sort of knowledge, Oakeshott says, exists only in use. It cannot be taught, only imparted by imitation and experience. It\xe2\x80\x99s knowing when to depart from the cookbook; how much, when running a meeting, to let the conversation flow and how much to rein it in.'b'Practical knowledge is hard to see, but it is embedded in traditions of behavior. It is embedded in the lives of older legislators and public servants, and it is passed down by imitation to the younger ones. This craft of governing well has been forsaken and disrespected, but you will not be effective in public life unless you find a wise old person who will teach you the tricks of the trade, hour after hour, side by side.'b'Second, take a reality bath. Go off and become a stranger in a strange land. Go off to some alien part of this country or the world. Immerse yourself in the habits and daily patterns of that existence and stay there long enough to get acculturated. Stay there long enough so that you forget the herd mentality of our partisan culture.'b'When you return home, you will look at your own place with foreign eyes. You\xe2\x80\x99ll see the contours of your own reality more clearly. When you return to native ground, you\xe2\x80\x99re more likely to possess the sort of perceptiveness that Isaiah Berlin says is the basis of political judgment.'b'This sort of wisdom consists of \xe2\x80\x9ca special sensitiveness to the contours of the circumstances in which we happen to be placed; it is a capacity for living without falling foul of some permanent condition or factor which cannot be either altered, or even fully described.\xe2\x80\x9d This wisdom is based on a tactile awareness of your country and its people \xe2\x80\x94 what they want, how they react. You don\xe2\x80\x99t think this awareness. You feel it. You experience a visceral oneness with culture and circumstance \xe2\x80\x94 the smell of the street, tinges of anger and hope and aspiration. The irony is that you are more likely to come into union with your own home culture after you have been away from it. You have to walk away from the partisan tunnel vision to see how things really are.'b'Finally, close off your options. People in public life live in a beckoning world. They have an array of opportunities. They naturally want to keep all their options open. The shrewd strategists tell them to make a series of tepid commitments to see what pans out. Hedge your bets. Play it smart.'b'But the shrewd strategy leads to impotence. You spread yourself thin. You dissipate your energies and never put full force behind any cause. You make your own trivial career the object of your attention, not the vision that inspired you in the first place.'b'The public official who does this leaves no mark. Only the masters of renunciation leave an imprint, only those who can say a hundred Nos for the sake of an overwhelming Yes. Only the person who has burned the ships and committed to one issue has the courage to cast aside the advice of the strategists and actually push through change.'b'We live in a nation of good people and ineffective government. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if these tactics will improve the quality of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, but something has to.'b'Six weeks ago, 'b'I wrote a column'b' about a ridiculous lawsuit being brought by Carolyn McCarthy, a congresswoman from Long Island. A smoker for most of her life, McCarthy has lung cancer. Yet her lawyers claimed that it was her \xe2\x80\x9cexposure\xe2\x80\x9d to asbestos, through the work clothes of her father and brother, both boilermakers, that triggered her cancer. Though McCarthy certainly deserves our sympathy as she fights cancer, it is hard to see her lawsuit as anything but an undeserved money grab \xe2\x80\x94 and the latest twist in asbestos litigation, the longest running tort in American history, with no end in sight.'b'Then again, maybe there is finally an end in sight. Late Friday afternoon, Judge George Hodges, a federal bankruptcy judge in North Carolina, wrote 'b'a breathtaking decision'b', in which he essentially pulled the lid off another form of asbestos scam. Though he shrank from labeling the actions of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 lawyers involved in asbestos litigation as \xe2\x80\x9cfraudulent,\xe2\x80\x9d he did describe the litigation as \xe2\x80\x9cinfected with the impropriety of some law firms.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s a potential game-changer.'b'There are two reasons it can be difficult to write about asbestos lawsuits. The first is that the modern-day plaintiff truly is sick \xe2\x80\x94 if not with lung cancer then with mesothelioma, a deadly disease that results from extensive exposure to asbestos decades earlier. Given the rules of American society, mesothelioma victims undoubtedly deserve compensation from whichever company used the product that caused their illness.'b'The second reason is that asbestos litigation has become more complicated than 3-D chess. For years, it was easy to explain the scam: People who weren\xe2\x80\x99t sick were being diagnosed with asbestosis by doctors being paid by asbestos lawyers. That has largely ended \xe2\x80\x94 hence the current emphasis on mesothelioma lawsuits, which have the added advantage (for the lawyers) of being potentially multimillion-dollar cases. Today, with around 100 companies having been bankrupted by asbestos litigation, and $37 billion set aside in trusts for victims, you would think the litigation would be winding down. Guess again.'b'Enter Garlock Sealing Technologies, a maker of gaskets. For years, it was on the periphery of asbestos litigation because, while its gaskets had once contained asbestos, it was a kind that had 1/100th of the risk of the more commonly used product. In addition, the asbestos was sealed, usually behind far-more-dangerous asbestos insulation made by some other, more culpable, company.'b'Stephen Macadam, the chief executive of EnPro, Garlock\xe2\x80\x99s parent company, told me that he had expected that the litigation pressure would ease on Garlock as other companies succumbed to bankruptcy and set up trusts for victims. Instead, the opposite happened. Garlock became a prime target, precisely because it was still standing.'b'For years, Garlock had made calculated decisions about how to deal with its asbestos litigation. It fought some cases and settled others. But, by 2010, inundated with mesothelioma cases, it too filed for bankruptcy protection. Then it did something different. 'b'It fought back'b'.'b'The judge allowed the company to do a deep dive into 15 cases that Garlock had previously settled. For a victim to demand money from Garlock, he or she had to stipulate that Garlock\xe2\x80\x99s gasket had been a primary exposure to asbestos. To maximize the money they could get from Garlock, they would deny, under oath, other exposures to the products of the bankrupt companies that had set up trusts.'b'But as Garlock soon discovered, no sooner had the victims settled then they would file documents with a dozen or more trusts stipulating the opposite: that they had had \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningful and credible exposure\xe2\x80\x9d to asbestos from the bankrupt companies. (The plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 lawyers, who control the trusts, have successfully fought to keep this information confidential.) Judge Hodges, in his decision, seemed thunderstruck that this pattern occurred in every case that Garlock investigated. The phrase he used to describe this behavior was \xe2\x80\x9cwithholding evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It would have been helpful if this decision had come a decade or more ago, before so many companies were forced into bankruptcy. But maybe, just maybe, other companies will start to follow Garlock\xe2\x80\x99s example and finally put an end to the asbestos scam.'b'As to why anyone should care whether innocent companies have to pay millions to asbestos victims and their lawyers, I would offer three reasons. First, when victims get more than they should under the rules, it means that someone else down the road will wind up with less than he or she should. Second, litigation designed to bring innocent companies to their knees is an impediment to economic growth and job creation.'b'And, finally, there is the rule of law, which the asbestos lawyers suing Garlock clearly flouted. We are very good in this country at pointing out the failure of other countries\xe2\x80\x99 judicial systems to abide by the rule of law. Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we be just as rigorous when the failure is our own?'b'If all goes according to plan, Iran will begin freezing and then rolling back its most worrisome nuclear activities on Monday under 'b'an agreement reached over the weekend'b' with the United States and other major powers. This would be the most significant restraint ever on a program that has threatened international stability since it was first disclosed in 2002 and an undeniably important step toward the peaceful resolution of a serious dispute. Even so, dangerously misguided forces, including leading Democrats and Republicans in Congress, are working to sabotage it.'b'The broad outlines of the deal, to be replaced in six months by a more permanent one, 'b'were reached in November'b'. Now the major powers and Iran have settled on detailed procedures for making it work. Iran has agreed to stop enriching uranium beyond 5 percent, a level sufficient for energy production but not enough to fuel a bomb. Its stockpile of uranium enriched to 20 percent \xe2\x80\x94 a level alarmingly close to weapons-grade fuel \xe2\x80\x94 will be diluted or converted to a less threatening substance.'b'Iran also agreed not to install new centrifuges, start up any that were not already operating or build new enrichment facilities. It will allow inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to have unprecedented, in some cases daily, access to some sites.'b'Once the agency confirms that Iran has begun to take the promised actions, the major powers will suspend certain sanctions so Iran can resume petrochemical exports, trade in gold and other precious metals, and imports of spare parts, especially for airplanes. The major powers will stop pressuring other countries to reduce oil imports from Iran and will facilitate humanitarian trade, making it easier for Iran to obtain needed medicines and make tuition payments for Iranian students abroad.'b'Iranian funds frozen in foreign banks amounting to $4.2 billion will be released in increments, beginning with a $550 million payment in February.'b'The most crippling sanctions will remain in force until a permanent agreement is in place. These sanctions have severely constrained Iran\xe2\x80\x99s oil exports, foreign investment in Iran\xe2\x80\x99s energy industry and Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ability to engage in international financial transactions.'b'American officials have made clear that if Iran cheats, any sanctions that had been eased would be reimposed and tougher ones enacted. Nevertheless, these commitments have not dissuaded lawmakers like Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Mark Kirk, a Republican from Illinois, from pushing legislation that would impose new sanctions. This would violate the interim agreement and set unworkable conditions for a final deal. Israel\xe2\x80\x99s government and pro-Israel interest groups are pressing the same hard line.'b'President Obama has threatened to veto such a bill if it passes. But it would be far better if the critics, especially members of his own party like Mr. Menendez, came to their senses. There are no guarantees that the next six months will produce a final deal that permanently restrains Iran from a nuclear weapon, but the interim deal at least offers hope for one. Conversely, if negotiations fail \xe2\x80\x94 which would surely happen if Congress ties Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s hands \xe2\x80\x94 Iran is likely to embark on an even more aggressive search for a nuclear weapon. And that could leave war as the only option.'b'The Supreme Court made a good call, 'b'announced on Monday'b', not to review a 2013 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which 'b'struck down'b' Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s 20-week abortion ban as unconstitutional. For women in Arizona, the appellate ruling is critically important in protecting their reproductive rights.'b'The Arizona law was clearly unconstitutional in outlawing abortion procedures at 20 weeks, measured from a woman\xe2\x80\x99s last menstrual period, which is about 18 weeks after fertilization.'b'The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal\xe2\x80\x99s decision was wholly consistent with 40 years of legal precedent \xe2\x80\x94 established since Roe v. Wade in 1973 \xe2\x80\x94 that prohibits states from banning abortions before a fetus can survive outside the womb, which occurs at about 24 weeks after fertilization.'b'Like 11 other states that have passed similar bans, Arizona simply decided to defy the Supreme Court on the right to choose abortion. These states justify such laws with a faulty theory that a fetus at that stage can feel pain, which is at odds with the scientific consensus.'b'There may be various reasons the Supreme Court did not take up Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s appeal; as is customary, it did not issue any explanation for its move. Though the result \xe2\x80\x94 leaving the Ninth Circuit Court\xe2\x80\x99s sound decision to stand \xe2\x80\x94 is undeniably welcome, it did not signal where the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s current members are heading on reproductive rights or whether a majority of justices will protect women\xe2\x80\x99s childbearing decisions against an onslaught of harsh new state restrictions.'b'In an alarming 5-to-4 procedural ruling in November, the court 'b'declined to block a Texas law'b' from going into effect as it faces legal challenges and appeals. That law \xe2\x80\x94 which requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital \xe2\x80\x94 has significantly reduced access to abortion services by forcing eight of 34 abortion clinics in Texas to stop offering the procedure.'b'A Supreme Court review of that law could well happen next term. The court\xe2\x80\x99s pass on Monday does not provide any clue about the way it would view that case.'b'Abortion is one of the most emotionally fraught issues in American society, and public discussion often turns into an attack on the women who choose to exercise their constitutionally protected rights.'b'That is essentially what happened for years outside reproductive-health clinics in Massachusetts, where dozens of anti-abortion protesters have gathered since the late 1980s in an organized effort to stop women from getting abortions. Some held up signs or handed out leaflets, while others surrounded the arriving cars of doctors and patients or chained themselves together and physically blocked clinic entrances.'b'Eventually, protesters in support of abortion rights started showing up, and the two groups pushed and jockeyed for better position. As a result, women approaching the clinic had to endure a frenetic gauntlet of activists. Many were intimidated, and some chose to leave rather than confront the crowds. Police arrested some protesters for harassment and other violations but had trouble keeping the peace.'b'In response to this public-safety problem, 'b'Massachusetts passed a law'b' in 2007 that created a 35-foot buffer zone around clinic entrances. Within the zone, which is the width of about two parking spaces and marked by a yellow line, only patients and clinic employees are permitted. Protesters \xe2\x80\x94 whether anti-abortion or pro-abortion rights \xe2\x80\x94 must stay behind the yellow line.'b'On Wednesday, in 'b'McCullen v. Coakley'b', the Supreme Court is scheduled to consider whether this law violates the protesters\xe2\x80\x99 free speech rights under the First Amendment. While that is the legal question before the court, the broader issue at stake is protecting women\xe2\x80\x99s access to abortion, which is under assault around the country by lawmakers and protesters alike.'b'The anti-abortion protesters who challenged the law 'b'argue'b' that it improperly restricts speech based on content because it applies only at clinics where abortions are performed. They also say that it favors the voices of those who support abortion rights because it allows clinic workers inside the buffer zone.'b'Far from limiting speech, the law is a prime example of a state\xe2\x80\x99s power to protect public safety, even if it has incidental effects on some speech. The history of abortion protests in Massachusetts surely merits such a response. In addition to regular incidents of harassment and intimidation, in 1994 a man named John Salvi III 'b'went on a shooting spree'b' in two clinics outside Boston, killing two employees and injuring five others.'b'Before the current law was enacted, Massachusetts legislators tried numerous other solutions, including a smaller, \xe2\x80\x9cfloating\xe2\x80\x9d buffer zone \xe2\x80\x94 which set an 18-foot perimeter around clinic entrances and made it unlawful to approach within 6 feet of anyone in that zone, if done without the person\xe2\x80\x99s consent to engage \xe2\x80\x9cin oral protest, education or counseling.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The zone, modeled on a Colorado law that the Supreme Court 'b'upheld in 2000'b', quickly proved unworkable, as police struggled to play referee against protesters who violated the 6-foot limit. The fixed buffer zone came about after years of consultation with police officers and is the first law that has succeeded in keeping a clear path for women trying to get into the clinics (more than two-thirds of whom go to the clinics for health care appointments, not abortions).'b'The government may reasonably impose \xe2\x80\x9ctime, place, and manner\xe2\x80\x9d restrictions on speech, provided that they are neutral as to content and allow other channels of communication. The Massachusetts law 'b'does both'b'. It is aimed at certain clinics because that is where the public-safety risk exists. And anti-abortion protesters may still picket, hand out leaflets and speak freely to women outside the buffer zone. Eleanor McCullen, the lead plaintiff in the case, testified that while standing outside the zone she had personally 'b'persuaded more than 80 women'b' not to go through with a planned abortion.'b'That is, of course, their choice. But the vast majority of women who do choose to end a pregnancy do not do so lightly, contrary to the condescending assumptions of anti-abortion activists and lawmakers. The Supreme Court should uphold this sensible law and allow women to make choices free from intimidation, harassment or worse.'b'Regarding \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The shroud over Rwanda\xe2\x80\x99s nightmare'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Opinion, Jan. 10): The crucial January 1994 \xe2\x80\x9cgenocide fax\xe2\x80\x9d to which Michael Dobbs refers \xe2\x80\x94 warning of an \xe2\x80\x9canti-Tutsi extermination\xe2\x80\x9d plot \xe2\x80\x94 was never shared with the United Nations Security Council in any way. But, in his preface to a major volume of Rwanda-related documents published by the United Nations in 1995, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali asserted that the fax actually had been shared with the council.'b'Since I was president of the Security Council when the fax arrived, I confronted the secretary general on this issue toward the end of 1995. In a subsequent meeting also attended by Chinmaya Garekhan of the United Nations Secretariat, a right-hand man of Mr. Boutros-Ghali\xe2\x80\x99s, the secretary general stuck to his position. In the end, however, Mr. Boutros-Ghali conceded that the Americans, at least, had been informed \xe2\x80\x94 which in his view should have been enough as far as the Security Council was concerned. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'Engaging in \xe2\x80\x9cwhat-if\xe2\x80\x9d history is rarely fruitful. But if the Security Council had been aware of Brig. Gen.

It\xe2\x80\x99s a miraculous restart for an industry that has seen more highs and lows than a three-hour Bollywood blockbuster. Taking the power of storytelling into their own hands, Pakistani filmmakers are fashioning much-needed, nuanced portraits of their country \xe2\x80\x94 and cultivating a degree of national pride that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been felt for a long time.'b'In 2012, Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSaving Face,\xe2\x80\x9d about victims of acid attacks in Pakistan, earned the country its first Academy Award, in the best short documentary category. For local film buffs, the win was a harbinger of good things to come. In preparation for this year\xe2\x80\x99s Oscars, for the first time in half a century Pakistan submitted a film for consideration in the best foreign-language film category. While the entry, \xe2\x80\x9cZinda Bhaag\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cRun For Your Life\xe2\x80\x9d), failed to make the short list for nomination, \xe2\x80\x9cthe very fact that we could select a movie that would represent us at the Oscars makes us proud,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ms. Obaid-Chinoy. The director believes that 2013 will \xe2\x80\x9cgo down in history as the year that Pakistani cinema was reborn.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Pakistani cinema thrived in the 1960s, with political and romantic films like \xe2\x80\x9cBombay-Wallah\xe2\x80\x9d (1961), \xe2\x80\x9cShaheed\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cMartyr,\xe2\x80\x9d 1962) and \xe2\x80\x9cArmaan\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cDesire,\xe2\x80\x9d 1966), featuring the screen legends Waheed Murad, Nadeem Baig and the actress Shabnam, among others.

That decade\xe2\x80\x99s ultraconservative mores discouraged the participation of talented Pakistanis, especially women. The collapse was swift: \xe2\x80\x9cLollywood,\xe2\x80\x9d Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s affectionate nickname for its Lahore-based film industry, churned out tasteless films replete with violence, choreographed disco numbers, melodramatic plotlines and poor acting. By the end of the 1990s, production had slowed to about 50 films each year. Hundreds of cinemas across the country were torn down.'b'In 2006, Pervez Musharraf, as president, began to ease restrictions on the importation of Indian films, which had been banned in Pakistan since the war between the countries in 1965. The newly available Bollywood productions drew so many viewers that multiplexes were built to meet the demand. The new capacity, in turn, gave a new generation of Pakistanis, either trained abroad or already working in television and advertising, an incentive to start making movies of their own. With advances in digital filmmaking permitting lower budgets and an audience already exposed to high-quality international cinema, Pakistanis began to produce bold works.'b'Eight years later, high import taxes on equipment and lack of government support still impede industry growth, and financial investment by wealthy producers remains difficult to find. But Ms. Obaid-Chinoy is optimistic. The approximately 100 cinemas now operating in Pakistan (for a population of over 180 million) are \xe2\x80\x9cmore than I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in my entire life,\xe2\x80\x9d she says.'b'Tired of the one-dimensionality of the portrayal of Pakistanis on Western screens (as terrorists, bombers, victims or collaborators), independent Pakistani filmmakers are telling other, more sophisticated, stories.'b'With more than 20 films released in 2013, production is rising.

The directors, Meenu Gaur and Farjad Nabi, enlisted real Lahoris in the depiction of the grim realities faced by Pakistanis who attempt to escape economic hardship through illegal emigration. Equally unconventional were decisions to cast the Bollywood legend Naseeruddin Shah in a lead role, and to take postproduction to India instead of Malaysia or Thailand. These fresh approaches augur well for greater Indo-Pakistani cooperation, and have jump-started an industry declared all but dead a few years ago.'b'Last year, Lollywood, too, stepped up its game. In \xe2\x80\x9cWaar\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cStrike\xe2\x80\x9d), an English-language thriller inspired by the 2009 Taliban attack on a police training center near Lahore, Pakistan is rived by the pressures of the \xe2\x80\x9cwar on terror.\xe2\x80\x9d The film\xe2\x80\x99s unabashed patriotism attracted huge audiences nationwide. \xe2\x80\x9cWaar,\xe2\x80\x9d which was Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s first big-budget film, earned some $1.9 million in just over one month, making it also the country\xe2\x80\x99s highest-grossing film to date.

And the number of countries where polio is present rose to eight from four between December 2012 and December 2013, with 'b'polio spreading 'b'out of Nigeria into the Horn of Africa and from Pakistan into the Middle East. Violent conflict and distrust of vaccination programs are to blame.'b'Cases of polio in Pakistan, where skepticism of vaccination efforts remains after the revelation that the United States Central Intelligence Agency used a 'b'fake vaccination program'b' in its hunt for Osama bin Laden, rose to 85 in 2013 from 58 in 2012.

Mr. Pollard pleaded guilty to espionage in 1987.'b'At the time of his arrest and trial, I was the liaison officer for the Department of Defense to the Department of Justice, and the coordinator of an investigation into the damage Mr. Pollard\xe2\x80\x99s treachery had done to the American intelligence community.'b'Every few years, there is an orchestrated attempt to forge popular support for Mr. Pollard\xe2\x80\x99s release. It is now happening again. In addition to calls for clemency coming from across the Israeli political spectrum, Lawrence J. Korb, the assistant secretary of defense at the Pentagon at the time of Mr. Polland\xe2\x80\x99s arrest, has said that his punishment was disproportionate to his offense. R. James Woolsey, a former director of central intelligence echoed that sentiment at a security conference in November. Last month, when Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to Israel, there was a rash of hopeful reports in the Israeli press that he was considering releasing Mr. Pollard in exchange for Israeli concessions.'b'Mr. Pollard\xe2\x80\x99s apologists portray him as a sort of dual patriot: loyal to the United States, but also motivated to help Israel. In fact, he was primarily a venal and selfish person who sought to get rich. When dealing with his handlers at a meeting in Paris, he commented on the risks he faced and told them to up his \xe2\x80\x9csalary\xe2\x80\x9d by $1,000 a month.'b'The apologists seek to portray him as being treated unfairly. However, they never compare his sentence with that of any other person convicted of a similar treason. In fact, there are no other Americans who have given over to an ally information of the quantity and quality that Mr. Pollard has.'b'Furthermore, they argue that a similar conviction today would be punished with no more than a 10-year sentence. It\xe2\x80\x99s true that most espionage convictions do fall under a statute that provides for 10-year sentences. Mr. Pollard, however, pleaded guilty to a far more serious offense under a different statute, which provides for punishment \xe2\x80\x9cby death or by imprisonment for any term of years or for life.\xe2\x80\x9d This statute deals with the disclosure of information that might result in the death of an agent of the United States or that \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly concerned nuclear weaponry, military spacecraft or satellites, early warning systems, or other means of defense or retaliation against large-scale attack; war plans; communications intelligence or cryptographic information.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The argument that Mr. Pollard did no harm to the United States echoes his own claim at his sentencing hearing. There, the judge stopped him and pulled out Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger\xe2\x80\x99s affidavit. He asked Mr. Pollard to explain a section noting the disclosure of one particular document \xe2\x80\x94 the Top Secret Radio Signal Notations Manual. The manual listed the physical parameters of every known electronic signal, noted how America collected signals around the world, and listed all the known communications links then used by the Soviet Union. It would permit any recipient to take measures to avoid the United States\xe2\x80\x99 collection of signals and communications intelligence information, and we have no idea how widely this might have been shared. Both during the Cold War and in counterterrorism today, intercepting enemy communication is vital; disclosing our methods is an even greater danger than releasing what we have collected.'b'Other defenders of Mr. Pollard believe that he never gave information that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t already supposed to be shared with Israel. But he sold the daily report from the U.S. Navy\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Fleet Ocean Surveillance Information Facility in Rota, Spain \xe2\x80\x94 a top-secret document filed every morning at the time reporting all activity in the Middle East during the previous 24 hours. These were so important that, when Mr. Pollard missed stealing some of them, his Israeli handlers were upset.'b'Finally, there is the defense that he gave information only to an ally. This assumes that all allies are entitled to full disclosure on everything, which is a dangerous idea. As Benjamin Franklin put it, three can keep a secret if two of them are dead. This claim also assumes that Mr. Pollard dealt only with Israel, when in fact he attempted to deal with multiple countries and even disclosed classified information to a South African defense attach\xc3\xa9.'b'We will never know the full extent of the damage caused by Mr. Pollard. The Israelis returned to the United States a paltry few thousand documents, which they claimed was all that they had received. However, Mr. Pollard confessed in a debriefing that he had turned over enough documents to occupy 360 cubic feet. The quantity was so vast that his handlers rented an apartment and installed high-speed copy machines.'b'In 2001, Seymour Hersh reported that William J. Casey, the former director of central intelligence, charged that information relayed by Mr. Pollard had been traded to Russia for Jewish \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s. Others, including a former director of naval intelligence, have expressed concern about information passed to Israel having ended up in Soviet hands.'b'At the time of Mr. Pollard\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing, federal law did not permit the death penalty, and a life sentence meant a maximum of 30 years. As such, Mr. Pollard is close to release, counting time off for good behavior. That release, however, should occur when his sentence expires and not, as four former directors of naval intelligence have put it, as a result of a \xe2\x80\x9cclever public relations campaign.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Pollard has never expressed regret or admitted to harming America\xe2\x80\x99s national security, and he has not applied for parole even though he is eligible. He has done his crime. Let him do his time.'b''b'\n'b'M.E.

This zeal stems from the belief that an increased domestic gas supply will drive down national prices, at once enhancing export competitiveness while addressing growing public concern over rising domestic energy bills. But this strategy is misguided: Unlike in the United States, a shale gas revolution will not bring down prices in Britain.'b'In Britain, proponents of increased drilling, including Prime Minister David Cameron, like to point to the success of expanded shale gas production in America. There, the ability to tap into vast resources of shale gas, thanks to developments in a technology called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has led to a significant drop in domestic gas prices, created tens of thousands of jobs and helped to move the United States away from dependence on gas imports. But America\xe2\x80\x99s shale gas revolution, which was over 25 years in the making, occurred in a context that would be very difficult to replicate in today\xe2\x80\x99s Britain.'b'A number of specific conditions helped to drive the American shale gas revolution, not least favorable geology. Much of America\xe2\x80\x99s shale yields high levels of very valuable liquids, like crude oil, as well as gas. The ability to extract these liquids, produced as a byproduct of shale gas operations, has tended to make the economics of American shale operations favorable despite low domestic gas prices.'b'The geological know-how underpinning the success of drilling in the United States was the product of government-funded research dating as far back as the 1980s, the results of which were widely disseminated to private industry. (This sort of research would not \xe2\x80\x94 and should not \xe2\x80\x94 be funded by private companies, as fundamental science cannot be patented.) Extensive tax breaks for shale operations were allotted early on in the game, and environmental regulations were relatively weak. Capital markets were willing to provide risk finance for oil and gas operations, and the industry was dominated by a network of small, entrepreneurial companies, supported by a dynamic and highly competitive service sector. Finally, property rights in the United States make any extracted shale gas the property of the landowner, incentivizing private owners to tolerate the disruptions caused by shale operations.'b'Virtually none of these characteristics are present in Britain. The British government is ideologically reluctant to fund basic scientific research. Environmental regulations are extremely strict, and public opposition to fracking is vehement. Capital markets are not accustomed to funding high-risk petroleum exploration activities, and the onshore service industry is woefully undeveloped compared with its American counterparts. The vesting of British oil and gas rights in the state, instead of with the private landowner, discourages individuals from supporting new drilling operations.'b'Moreover, without major government intervention in the domestic gas market, greater shale gas production will simply enable the big British companies to send more gas through the interconnector pipeline to Belgium, taking advantage of higher prices on the Continent. They would not leave money on the table for British consumers. Although Britain does appear to have significant technically recoverable resources of shale gas, a revolution along American lines is therefore unlikely.'b'Greater emphasis on shale may still generate revenue and make Britain more energy-secure, but only if the British government implements strategic policy measures. Tax breaks could be offered to communities that host shale gas wells (indeed, breaks along these lines have recently been proposed, with payouts of 100,000 pounds, or about $162,000, for each hydrofractured well, plus one percent of the revenues from each well \xe2\x80\x94 but the specifics remain unclear). Incentives could also be implemented to spur the development of a service industry that could eventually become a major earner, exporting its services to a Europe hungry for shale gas operations.'b'Most crucially, in a country where communities are being mobilized to actively resist the presence of shale gas operations, the British government must make a concerted effort to address public concerns. Among these is the fact that current shale gas activities are subject to a plethora of regulations, and monitored by multiple, often obscure, authorities. The establishment of a designated administrative body for shale gas operations, armed with a single set of production guidelines, might go some way to assuaging community fears.'b'There are legitimate environmental concerns, and these will have to be weighed against any benefits of increased shale gas production. Many fear that a greater emphasis on shale will lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, a byproduct of methane emissions and burning larger volumes of natural gas. Groundwater pollution and waste are real risks. Also significant is the argument that a ramping up of shale gas operations would come at the expense of needed investments in renewable energies like wind and solar.'b'To the extent that it may reduce Britain\xe2\x80\x99s dependence on gas imports, shale gas has the potential to make the country more energy secure. And it may also generate some much-welcomed revenue. But even if the public relations campaign can be won, the British government is ultimately likely to be disappointed because a shift to shale will not bring down domestic gas prices.'b''b'\n'b'Paul Stevens 'b' is a distinguished fellow at the Energy, Environment and Resources Department at Chatham House in London.'b''b''b' 'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'I am a lifelong registered Republican who is angry about the choices my party has presented to me.'b'In 2008, I had to choose whether to help place Sarah Palin a heartbeat away from the presidency.

Families without secure rights to land (and that is a majority of rural residents in many developing countries) often remain in their homes when it is dangerous to do so, fearing they won\xe2\x80\x99t be allowed to return. And without the security of ownership and access to collateral, their homes are often not built to withstand earthquakes, typhoons and other disasters.'b'This has profound consequences that extend far beyond the squatter camps and plantations with their legions of impoverished laborers.'b'Landlessness and the lack of secure property rights among the poor not only hurt a country\xe2\x80\x99s resiliency and slow post-disaster recovery. Those inequities also hold back economic development, perpetuate poverty and fan social tensions. Fixing this problem is not easy. But many countries, including South Korea, Vietnam and Rwanda, have reformed their laws and institutions to provide the rural poor with enforceable rights to the lands they live on and farm.'b'Those success stories are important because the vulnerability of the world\xe2\x80\x99s landless \xe2\x80\x94 squatters, indigenous people, farm laborers and tenant farmers \xe2\x80\x94 cannot be overstated.'b'Consider the case of the cyclone that struck the Indian state of Orissa in 1999, killing an estimated 10,000 people.

In the Philippine city of Tacloban, which was ravaged by Typhoon Haiyan, government officials are considering buying a six-acre parcel that was a squatter camp and preventing reconstruction.

You can treat the animals as you like and damn the consequences, from salmonella contamination to antibiotic resistance to water contamination to, of course, cruelty. There are even incentives, in the form of subsidized prices for animal feed.'b'The next group is most easily labeled junk food; you might call it \xe2\x80\x9chyperprocessed.\xe2\x80\x9d This comprises aisles and aisles of \xe2\x80\x9cedibles\xe2\x80\x9d sold in supermarkets and restaurants, and is often \xe2\x80\x9cfood\xe2\x80\x9d that\xe2\x80\x99s unrecognizable as such, ranging from soda and other sugar-sweetened beverages to things like chicken nuggets and Pringles and tens of thousands of other examples. These are mostly made from commodity crops, especially corn, soybeans and wheat. Federal subsidies abound in many forms here, from direct payments (in theory, 'b'these are ending'b', to be replaced by a bizarre form of crop insurance) to 'b'the ethanol mandate'b' to virtually unregulated land use that permits toxic overapplication of fertilizers and other chemicals. There is also that same failure to recognize the public health and environmental costs of what is probably the least healthy diet a wealthy nation could devise. You could even say that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, usually called food stamps) acts as a subsidy to junk food, since nothing limits using food stamps for food that promotes disease. It\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that for the past century the bulk of university research, much of it paid for with tax dollars, has gone into figuring out how to increase the yield of the crops and processes that turn out this junk that sickens.'b'Then, in the third group, there\xe2\x80\x99s everything else, from fruits and vegetables \xe2\x80\x94 absurdly called \xe2\x80\x9cspecialty crops\xe2\x80\x9d by the Department of Agriculture \xe2\x80\x94 to animals raised in sustainable and even humane ways. But here, disincentives abound: farmers may be encouraged to allow some land to go fallow, but not to be planted in specialty crops, and research money, subsidies, insurance, market promotion and access to credit are directed toward industrial food production, distribution and sales. These inefficiencies make most of this real food, which is health-promoting and closer to environmentally neutral, appear to be more expensive. (Only \xe2\x80\x9cappear,\xe2\x80\x9d though. If you account for the costs of environmental and public health damage, industrially produced junk food and animal products actually cost more.)'b'In a neutral (\xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d) market, there\xe2\x80\x99d be more room for producers and processors of fruits and vegetables to make money by responding to increased demand for wholesome fruits and vegetables without competing with subsidized junk food. In a sane \xe2\x80\x94 let\xe2\x80\x99s say properly regulated \xe2\x80\x94 market, there\xe2\x80\x99d be incentives for agriculture that benefited both grower and consumer with products that were less damaging to the environment and public health. Food stamps, for example, would be restricted to use for nourishing food. Direct subsidies might be used to encourage new farmers who wanted to grow \xe2\x80\x9cspecialty crops\xe2\x80\x9d rather than for farmers working thousands of acres of corn.'b'One could imagine a government that encourages more life-giving (and less disease-causing) agriculture just as one can acknowledge that sanity prevails when government steeply taxes tobacco and encourages its farmers to move on to something else. (I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying, by the way, that tobacco farmers have been treated fairly; much more could have been done \xe2\x80\x94 and still could be done \xe2\x80\x94 to help them transition to other profitable crops.)'b'Of course this is disruptive; change the status quo, and someone is hurt. But the public health disaster created by our commodity-pushing agricultural policies is only getting worse, and calls for the same kind of action in industrial agriculture that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in tobacco and, to a lesser extent, in guns. That kind of action will happen only when we have political representatives who care about food, health and the environment.'b'We can pressure corporations all we want, and what we\xe2\x80\x99ll get, mostly, is healthier junk food. Really, though, as long as sugar is profitable and 100 percent unrestricted ('b'and subsidized and protected!'b'), marketers will try to get 2-year-olds hooked on soda and Gatorade.'b'But the job of government is not to encourage profitable businesses at the cost of public health; it\xe2\x80\x99s to regulate them so that the public is served. Who is this country for, anyway?'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve always thought that the reason Ariel Sharon was such an enduring presence in Israeli political life is that he personally reflected three of the most important states of mind that the state of Israel has gone through since its founding. At key times, for better and for worse, Sharon expressed and embodied the feelings of the Israeli Everyman as much, if not more, than any Israeli leader.'b'The first was the enduring struggle for survival of the Jewish people in Israel. The founding of a Jewish state in the heart of the Arab-Muslim world would never be a natural act, welcomed by the region. There is a Jewish state today because of hard men, like Ariel Sharon, who were ready to play by the local rules, and successive Israeli prime ministers used him to do just that. Sharon \xe2\x80\x94 whom I first met at age 16 when I interviewed him for my high school newspaper after a lecture he gave at the University of Minnesota in 1969 \xe2\x80\x94 always had contempt for those in Israel or abroad who he believed did not understand the kill-or-be-killed nature of their neighborhood. He was a warrior without regrets and, at times, without restraints. Not for nothing was a Hebrew biography of him entitled, \xe2\x80\x9cHe Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Stop at Red Lights.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Sharon could have perfectly delivered a Hebrew version of the speech Marine Col. Nathan Jessep, played by Jack Nicholson, delivered in the climactic courtroom scene in \xe2\x80\x9cA Few Good Men,\xe2\x80\x9d justifying the death of a weak soldier, Santiago, under his command. In Sharon\xe2\x80\x99s case, it would be justifying his no-holds-barred dealing with Arabs who resisted Israel\xe2\x80\x99s existence back in the 1950s and \xe2\x80\x9960s.'b'As Jessep told the lawyer trying him: \xe2\x80\x9cSon, we live in a world that has walls, and those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. Who\xe2\x80\x99s gonna do it? You? ... I have a greater responsibility than you could possibly fathom. ... You have the luxury of not knowing what I know. That Santiago\xe2\x80\x99s death, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want the truth because deep down in places you don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about at parties, you want me on that wall, you need me on that wall.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Many Israelis wanted Sharon on that wall, which is why he survived so many crises. At the end of the day, they always wanted to know their chief warrior, who played by the local rules, was available.'b'But, in the 1980s, Sharon also embodied a fantasy that gripped Israel \xe2\x80\x94 that with enough power the Israelis could rid themselves of the Palestinian threat, that they could have it all: resettling Jews in their biblical heartland in the West Bank, plus settlements in Gaza, docile Palestinians, peace with the neighbors, and good relations with the world. That fantasy drove Sharon to team up in 1982 with the Christian Phalangist leader Bashir Gemayel on a strategic overreach to both oust Yasir Arafat and the P.L.O. from Lebanon and install Gemayel as a pro-Israeli president in Beirut. Ronald Reagan was in power in America; Sadat had just made peace with Israel and taken Egypt off the battlefield. The little Jewish state, Sharon thought, could rearrange the neighborhood.'b'That Israeli overreach, which I covered from Beirut, ended badly for everyone. Sharon was deemed by a 1983 Israeli commission of inquiry as \xe2\x80\x9cindirectly responsible\xe2\x80\x9d for the horrible massacre of Palestinian civilians by Phalangists in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. The fiasco in Lebanon (which also gave birth to Hezbollah), followed by two Palestinian intifadas, seemed to impress on Sharon the limits of Israeli power.'b'Indeed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what, if any, epitaph the Sharon family will etch on his gravestone one day, but an adaptation of the most memorable line from Clint Eastwood\xe2\x80\x99s classic \xe2\x80\x9cMagnum Force\xe2\x80\x9d would certainly be appropriate: \xe2\x80\x9cA country\xe2\x80\x99s got to know its limitations.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That was the conclusion that Sharon, the settlements builder, came to late in life \xe2\x80\x94 and so, too, did many Israelis. He acted on it by getting elected prime minister and then parting ways with his old Likud/settler allies, moving to the center and orchestrating a unilateral withdrawal from Gaza. He surely would have tried something similar in the West Bank if he had not had a stroke. Sharon remained skeptical that the Palestinians would ever make a true peace with Israel, but he concluded that occupying them forever was harmful to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s future and, therefore, a third way had to be found.'b'Once again, Sharon was expressing the sentiments of the Israeli Everyman \xe2\x80\x94 which is probably why President Obama got such a warm reception from Israeli youths when, on his visit to Israel last March, he justified his own peace diplomacy by quoting a wiser and older Ariel Sharon, as telling Israelis that the dream of a Greater Israel had to be abandoned: \xe2\x80\x9cIf we insist on fulfilling the dream in its entirety, we are liable to lose it all,\xe2\x80\x9d Sharon said.'b'Few Israelis are neutral about Sharon. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s because some part of him \xe2\x80\x94 the hardheaded survivor, the dreamer that hoped Israel could return to its biblical roots and that the Palestinians would eventually acquiesce or disappear or the sober realist trying to figure out how to share the land he loved with a people he\xe2\x80\x99d never trust \xe2\x80\x94 touched something in all of them.'b'Far be it from me to defend what Jon Stewart has demolished.'b'But I would like to speak up on behalf of the fledgling New York mayor\xe2\x80\x99s de Blasphemy, now universally deemed his first mistake and possibly grounds for impeachment: daintily carving up his smoked-mozzarella-and-sausage pizza at Goodfellas in Staten Island with a knife and fork.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying it\xe2\x80\x99s right. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong. I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying I do it, too. I eat pizza with a knife and fork because I want only the gooey stuff on top, not the crust.'b'(When I first started in The Times\xe2\x80\x99s Washington bureau, I soothed my nerves by noshing on pizzas slathered with mashed potatoes, a dish that required a spoon and bigger jeans.)'b'I almost didn\xe2\x80\x99t become a Times columnist because of a de Blasio-like faux pas. When Arthur Sulzberger Jr. took me to breakfast to discuss the possibility of a column, we were talking when he suddenly looked dismayed. I thought it was my ZERO knowledge about NATO, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked me, \xe2\x80\x9care you eating your muffin with a knife and fork?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I thought I was being ladylike, which might have been de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s problem as well.

But switching to your hands midway, as the mayor also did, simply makes you seem feckless as well as forkless; better to stick to your guns, and tines.'b'David Letterman\xe2\x80\x99s Top Ten \xe2\x80\x9cOdd Habits of Mayor Bill de Blasio\xe2\x80\x9d on Monday featured this one: \xe2\x80\x9cRefers to himself as \xe2\x80\x98Her Majesty.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'b'Indeed, when F.D.R. served King George VI and his wife, Queen Elizabeth, their first hot dogs on a 1939 visit to America, the confused queen ate hers with a knife and fork, afraid to heed the president\xe2\x80\x99s advice to pick it up and relish it.'b'Pizza can be hazardous to an administration. We all remember what happened when a Clinton intern delivered a pie to the Oval Office during a government shutdown.'b'But de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s offense was so trivial that the most irritating part was the labor-loving mayor\xe2\x80\x99s labored explanation, grandly attributing it to \xe2\x80\x9cmy ancestral homeland.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have been in Italy a lot, and I picked up the habit for certain types of pizza,\xe2\x80\x9d he told reporters. \xe2\x80\x9cSo when you have a pizza like this, it had a lot on it, I often start with a knife and fork but then I cross over to the American approach and pick it up when I go farther into the pizza. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very complicated approach, but I like it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He sounded like a parody of the self-serious New York liberal, convinced he\xe2\x80\x99s right about everything from the Sandinistas to stop-and-frisk to a slice in Staten Island.'b'De Blasio sounded alarmingly like Zosia Mamet\xe2\x80\x99s mega-rambling character, fellow Brooklynite Shoshanna Shapiro, on a recent \xe2\x80\x9cGirls,\xe2\x80\x9d when she quizzes a quizzical Adam about his favorite utensil.'b'When he says, \xe2\x80\x9cI guess a fork,\xe2\x80\x9d she lectures: \xe2\x80\x9cO.K., that is crazy. Like, why would you want a cold metal prong stabbing you in the tongue when instead you could have food delivered into your mouth on, like, a cool, soft, pillowy cloud?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The new mayor should have just laughed it off. Then he might not have ended up getting reduced to rubble by Jon Stewart, who asked \xe2\x80\x9cthe champion of the middle class\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cWere you elected the mayor of Italy? No!

But her case and the issues it raised are not resolved, and the damage to India-America relations is unlikely to dissipate soon. This unfortunate episode is a reminder that while both nations are democracies, neither can avoid the hard work necessary to make the relationship work.'b'The envoy, Devyani Khobragade, 'b'was arrested last month'b' on a criminal complaint charging that she had paid her maid, Sangeeta Richard, $1.42 an hour or less despite promising on her visa application to pay the minimum wage of $9.75 an hour. Prosecutors said that Ms. Richard was not only underpaid but overworked. Last Thursday, a federal grand jury indicted Ms. Khobragade on similar charges and accused her of trying to intimidate the victim.'b'India, its passions fanned by election-year politics, pushed back hard at what many Indians said was American arrogance. Authorities removed security barriers at the American Embassy in New Delhi, canceled the embassy\xe2\x80\x99s food and alcohol import privileges and engaged in other fits of pique. The State Department, at India\xe2\x80\x99s request, granted Ms. Khobragade diplomatic immunity. But after negotiations with prosecutors on a plea bargain failed, she was asked to leave the United States and, in exchange, an American diplomat was withdrawn from India.'b'Ms. Khobragade has been hailed at home as a symbol of Indian pride. Her father, a retired bureaucrat and her chief defender, is talking of running for public office with a campaign focused on his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s case. Indians have been overwhelming sympathetic to Ms. Khobragade and shockingly indifferent to Ms. Richard, one of untold numbers of powerless domestic workers lured to America by the promise of a job gone bad.'b'Even so, the case might have been handled better. The United States cannot ignore laws that mandate how workers should be paid and that they be treated fairly. But federal prosecutors have wide discretion, and the State Department, before the criminal investigation, could have urged India to reassign Ms. Khobragade to New Delhi and required her to make restitution.'b'The United States has to make sure that foreign diplomats understand American laws, although the indictment says that this defendant knew exactly what she was doing. America should also re-examine its own demands for special privileges for its diplomats overseas. More broadly, the case has exposed differences between the two countries over such basic concepts as fairness and equality, while revealing a troubling level of Indian animosity toward the United States. The two governments are trying to turn the page by resuming high-level meetings. But it will take more than that to achieve the \xe2\x80\x9cglobal strategic partnership\xe2\x80\x9d with India that President Obama has boasted about.'b'Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey tried to change the subject on Tuesday with his annual 'b'State of the State'b' speech, talking about longer school days and reducing urban crime. But there is no diverting attention from the unanswered questions about how Mr. Christie and his close advisers have used his office to mete out rewards or punishment for political reasons.'b'The give and take of politics is one thing. But Mr. Christie\xe2\x80\x99s team crossed that line into political abuse.'b'New Jersey lawmakers announced on Monday plans to create two investigative committees and a special counsel to look into the growing scandals. Their original mission was to find out why the governor\xe2\x80\x99s appointees to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey closed lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge, creating a four-day traffic jam in Fort Lee, N.J. Mr. Christie denies knowing that this scheme was revenge against the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, who failed to endorse him in November\xe2\x80\x99s election. It is hard to imagine that he did not somehow encourage this type of conduct.'b'Now there is even more to investigate. Mr. Christie and his advisers were clearly eager to get Democratic endorsements \xe2\x80\x94 no doubt to show that he\xe2\x80\x99s a Republican who would be able to win bipartisan support on the national stage. But, apparently, making his case that he was the best candidate wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sufficient. Democrats who endorsed him received big financial payouts for their towns; Democrats who did not suffered reprisals.'b'As Kate Zernike 'b'reported in The Times'b', the Democratic mayor of Harrison, who endorsed Mr. Christie, received $250 million in Port Authority money for a new transit station. The Democratic mayor of Union City, another endorser, got $3 million for his town even though the authority doesn\xe2\x80\x99t operate there. The Democratic county executive of Essex County, who rounded up a number of endorsements for Mr. Christie, received $7 million in Port Authority funds for a park.'b'The Democratic mayor of Jersey City, Steven Fulop, appeared poised to reap similar rewards \xe2\x80\x94 until he told Mr. Christie\xe2\x80\x99s aides that he would not endorse the governor. After that, all meetings with Christie administration officials were canceled and requests for help with Hurricane Sandy recovery went unanswered.'b'The new legislative committees, which are expected to issue subpoenas this week, will need to investigate these matters in detail. They should demand all the pertinent documents unredacted and interview Mr. Christie\xe2\x80\x99s entire inner circle under oath \xe2\x80\x94 including Bridget Anne Kelly, the former deputy chief of staff, and his former campaign manager, Bill Stepien, who were both fired last week \xe2\x80\x94 as well as Kevin O\xe2\x80\x99Dowd, the chief of staff. And it is time to examine how Mr. Christie\xe2\x80\x99s patronage hires at the Port Authority, including the two who resigned in this scandal, conducted business and used authority money.'b'Besides the legislative inquiries and investigation by the United States attorney in New Jersey into the Fort Lee traffic plot, Mr. Christie and his political advisers are also facing a separate federal inquiry into the use of Hurricane Sandy relief dollars on the \xe2\x80\x9cStronger Than the Storm\xe2\x80\x9d advertising campaign to promote New Jersey tourism last summer. After questions were raised in The Asbury Park Press, Representative Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat, asked the Department of Housing and Urban Development to investigate. He wants to know why the Christie administration chose a $4.7 million ad contract that featured Mr. Christie in a TV spot, when another bidder offered to do the ads for nearly $2 million less.'b'Mr. Christie\xe2\x80\x99s office has called this ad campaign \xe2\x80\x9croutine and standard,\xe2\x80\x9d but that money could have been put to better use by helping people whose homes are still damaged from that storm. He said Tuesday that New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s citizens \xe2\x80\x9cdeserve better.\xe2\x80\x9d He is certainly right about that.'b'The last time Congress approved a series of spending bills to pay for the government \xe2\x80\x94 its most basic job \xe2\x80\x94 was in 2011. Since then, Republican lawmakers, determined to thwart the Obama administration at every step, have forced the government to subsist on stopgap measures that simply carry over or cut previous spending, with no accounting for growth, inflation or changing priorities.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s about to change this week, in one of the few pieces of good news to emerge from the current Congress. Assuming hard-right members of the House don\xe2\x80\x99t manage to block it, 'b' a $1 trillion appropriations bill'b' is about to be approved by both chambers for the rest of the 2014 fiscal year, through the end of September. That means some of the most important domestic programs, starved for cash by budget caps and the sequester, will finally get much of the money they need.'b'Republican moderates, politically burned by the government shutdown last fall, joined Democrats in fending off almost all of the Tea Party\xe2\x80\x99s demands. Right-wing Republicans failed to prevent any money from being spent on implementing the health care law, or enforcing power-plant regulations, or reforming financial practices under the Dodd-Frank law.'b'While the bill still reflects many Republican priorities, most of the worst proposals are gone. So are the deepest cuts of the sequester, following the budget agreement reached last month. Head Start would get $612 million more than last year, enough to restore the 57,000 slots that were cut by the sequester. The bill creates a new $250 million grant program that would encourage states to build or expand high-quality preschool classes for poor families. There would also be significant increases for health agencies whose research budgets had been cut: $1 billion more for the National Institutes of Health, $567 million more for the Centers for Disease Control, and $91 million for the Food and Drug Administration. NASA gets a boost over last year\xe2\x80\x99s amount, and the administration\xe2\x80\x99s transportation grant program for the states, intended to create jobs and rebuild infrastructure, won $600 million, more than the White House requested.'b'Republicans did win some victories. The financial regulators, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, received far less money than they need to do their jobs rigorously, and there was an unnecessary cut to a fund for disease prevention and public health. There will not be enough money for the United States to fulfill its pledges to the International Monetary Fund. One terrible environmental rider was included, a gift to the coal industry that allows continued dumping of toxic coal-mining waste in streams. Also included is the ridiculous provision that prevents enforcement of new light-bulb standards, a triumph for those who consider incandescent lights a symbol of freedom.'b'The right-wing\xe2\x80\x99s larger victory is in the overall spending amount, which is far less than it should be to revive the economy. In 2008, discretionary spending under President George W. Bush was $1.176 trillion. That amount should have gone up in the following six years to reflect growth and inflation, paid for with new tax revenues. Instead it has fallen sharply to $1.012 trillion. The spending bill is better than a stopgap measure, but it is nowhere near sufficient to pay for the necessary investments in education and infrastructure that the country needs.'b'CAPE TOWN \xe2\x80\x94 This year\xe2\x80\x99s parliamentary elections in South Africa will be the first in which the first children born after the 1994 transition to democracy become eligible to vote.

Historically, these schools have been provided with better resources and gaining entry to them is now expensive and fiercely competitive. They mostly admit students from the affluent, disproportionately white communities in which they are located.'b'Meanwhile, those wealthy enough to opt out send their children to private schools, which prepare them for different final exams. In 2013, 85 percent of these students attained grades good enough to attend university.'b'Earlier this month, amid much fanfare, the country\xe2\x80\x99s basic education minister released results of the final public school exams. She announced that 78 percent of those who took the exams in 2013 had passed. However, only 31 percent passed with grades good enough to have the option of a university education. The rest have no other alternatives but to go to technical colleges, enter the job market or attempt to defy nearly impossible odds and try to succeed as entrepreneurs \xe2\x80\x94 without any capital, experience or support.'b'For these students, the national high school certificate is a qualification that looks increasingly like it is not worth the paper it\xe2\x80\x99s printed on.'b'An increasing number of employers and institutions of higher education have begun to mistrust the high school certificate. They believe it provides only a weak indication of skills, knowledge and abilities. And the state exams do not allow students to show employers what they actually know and the fields in which they excel. To further exacerbate the desperate situation many young people face, employers, institutions of higher education and the government have responded with a mix of casual disregard, well-intentioned actions with perverse effects and populist policies.'b'In 2005, an additional set of optional standardized national tests \xe2\x80\x94 the national benchmark tests \xe2\x80\x94 were introduced. Conceived by Higher Education South Africa, a government-funded association of the country\xe2\x80\x99s 23 public universities, the new tests were ostensibly created to provide universities with information on what kind of additional academic support students needed to bridge the gap between the poor high school education they\xe2\x80\x99d received and the unrelenting demands of university studies. The tests are priced low enough to make taking them a no-brainer for well-off students. For many poorer students, however, paying the testing fee or traveling to testing centers is prohibitive.'b'Employers, meanwhile, have not changed their hiring practices much, or adjusted their training and skills-development programs, for which they receive incentives from the state. Many simply put out the same ads for interns and entry-level workers as they always have, then complain about the quality of resum\xc3\xa9s and application letters they receive, or the apparent lack of a good work ethic on the part of the few young people they hire.'b'These employers complain without recognizing that behind almost every unimpressive resum\xc3\xa9 and job application is a first-time worker in need of intensive training and development \xe2\x80\x94 a young person let down not by his or her lack of ability or lack of interest in exercising the care and diligence required to get and hold onto a job, but by an inferior public school system that has prepared them poorly for life.'b'What employers and higher education institutions are tacitly saying here is that this is not their problem.'b'Instead of responding with policies to address these problems, like reforming the final exam system so it actually tells employers what students know, the government has bowed to public sentiment and pressure from opposition parties. Last year, it enacted a populist youth employment incentive aimed at reducing the cost to companies of hiring first-time workers. The outcry over youth unemployment has since diminished, yet the problem remains. Even the most generous projections say the measure will not make a significant dent in the youth unemployment rate, which, including those who\xe2\x80\x99ve given up looking for jobs, stands at a staggering 65 percent for those under 25.'b'For now, the government is congratulating itself on an increasing pass rate on the final national exam. Left unsaid is that the students of the class of 2013 who took the final exam were part of a cohort of 1.2 million who entered school in 2002. The nearly 700,000 students not included in the celebrated statistics \xe2\x80\x94 now members of a growing lost generation \xe2\x80\x94 were either held back or ejected from the system before the final exam, the vast majority between grades 9 and 11.'b'They, too, face a grim future.'b'Because of its inability to provide quality public schooling for all, the government finds itself saddled with the biggest failing of post-apartheid South Africa.

Two weeks ago, after waiting for six years for Israel to review my application for refugee status \xe2\x80\x94 something it has repeatedly refused to do \xe2\x80\x94 I joined thousands of other Africans in a strike to force the government to recognize our basic human rights.'b'I am not in Israel on a whim. I had no choice but to leave Eritrea, where arrest, forced labor and indefinite military conscription are facts of daily life. In 2008, after four years in the military \xe2\x80\x94 which often contracted me out to private companies as an unpaid construction worker \xe2\x80\x94 I asked when I would be discharged. The military refused to answer.'b'Shortly after, I was warned that I was about to be thrown in prison. My brother had already escaped the military into Ethiopia, and though my mother had been imprisoned for six months as a result, I decided to flee as well. I left, not knowing where I would end up; I only knew that I could not stay.'b'I traveled with several others through Sudan, fearing that the Eritrean Army would catch us, and through Egypt, where half our group was caught by the Egyptian police and sent back to Eritrea. I was shot at by Egyptian soldiers at the Israeli border, and spent two days alone in the desert before I was found by an Israeli soldier and brought to a hospital.'b'I have encountered great moments of individual kindness here in Israel. If it were not for an Israeli family that took me in after seeing me homeless and injured in south Tel Aviv, my story might have ended there.'b'And yet the government has repeatedly denied the fundamental reality of my situation. Much of the world would consider me a refugee, and I would not have risked my life unless I thought so as well. But Israel has refused to determine my refugee status in any systematic or transparent manner, leaving me in a legal limbo, unable to work on the books and unsure of whether I will be allowed to stay.'b'I am not alone: More than 50,000 refugees reside in Israel, but only a handful have been given refugee status.'b'The Israeli government may not know what to do with us, but the Israeli economy does: We are busboys and construction workers, labor that countless businesses could not do without. While I was trained as an engineer in Eritrea, in Israel I washed dishes and worked as a cook.'b'Meanwhile, we live in fear of the arbitrary summons that sends asylum seekers to prison facilities, where we can be detained without trial. Israel claims that these facilities are \xe2\x80\x9copen,\xe2\x80\x9d with detainees free to leave, but they are isolated \xe2\x80\x94 one new facility is far out in the Negev Desert. There is nowhere to go. While I have not received a summons yet, many of my friends have been less lucky.'b'Instead of trying to understand our situation and work toward a solution, many members of the Israeli Parliament would rather demonize us, calling us \xe2\x80\x9cinfiltrators\xe2\x80\x9d and criminals. This language has crept into the news media and become mainstream in a culture already suspicious of \xe2\x80\x9cthe other.\xe2\x80\x9d Though they hardly know us, Israelis are taught to hate us, to think of us as outsiders coming to take their jobs or, worse, to harm them.'b'In December, about 200 asylum seekers 'b'walked out of a desert detention facility'b', and after two days of traveling arrived in Jerusalem to protest their conditions.'b'Drawing inspiration from their brave actions, a few weeks later the larger community of asylum seekers in Israel \xe2\x80\x94 mostly Eritrean and Sudanese \xe2\x80\x94 announced a general strike, demanding that Israel finally adhere to its obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention and undertake an honest, thorough determination of our refugee status. The convention, which Israel not only signed but helped write, states that those identified as refugees are guaranteed safe haven and the right to work in their host countries.'b'And we have done more than strike. A week ago, more than 25,000 of us gathered in Tel Aviv\xe2\x80\x99s Rabin Square shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are refugees!\xe2\x80\x9d The next day, I stood outside the American Embassy with many thousands of my fellow asylum seekers; others went before the British, Canadian, French and Italian Embassies. No one came out to greet us, but they most certainly heard our chants. Meanwhile, more than 10,000 refugees traveled from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to protest in front of the Israeli Parliament. Even more would have gone, but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have enough buses.'b'I do not want to stay in Israel any longer than I have to. If I could return to a peaceful Eritrea, I would. I want to see my family, and to return to my engineering job.'b'Until then, however, I must make the best out of what is sometimes an unbearable situation. Until then, the Israeli government must recognize our right to live and work in this country. And until then, the international community must insist that Israel drastically shift its policy regarding refugees.'b''b' 'b'Ghirmay Birhane 'b'is awaiting refugee status in Israel.

Even so, it remains the largest religious organization in the world, with a formidable global network of charitable, educational and health services, as well as growing authority in the third world.

President Obama has staked the success of his foreign policy on this bold gamble. But discussion about the nuclear deal has diverted attention from an even riskier bet that Obama has placed: the idea that Iran can become a cooperative partner in regional security.'b'Although they won\xe2\x80\x99t say so publicly, Mr. Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry surely dream of a \xe2\x80\x9cNixon to China\xe2\x80\x9d masterstroke. They are quietly pursuing a strategic realignment that, they believe, will end decades of semi-open warfare between Iran and the United States and their respective allies. In our view, the Obama administration wants to see in its place a \xe2\x80\x9cconcert\xe2\x80\x9d of great powers \xe2\x80\x94 Russia, America, the European nations and Iran \xe2\x80\x94 working together to stabilize the Middle East as in the 19th century, when the \xe2\x80\x9cConcert of Europe\xe2\x80\x9d worked together to stabilize that Continent.'b'As a first step, Mr. Kerry has made no secret of his desire to involve Iran in Syrian peace talks, scheduled to convene next week in Geneva. And much more than previous administrations, this one has refrained from countering Iranian machinations in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.'b'There are two main reasons for this attempted shift. One is simply the desire of the president to extricate the United States from the Middle East. The other reason, arguably more important, is fear of Al Qaeda: The White House undoubtedly sees Iran and its Shiite allies as potential partners in the fight against Sunni jihadism.'b'The Obama strategy is breathtakingly ambitious. It is also destined to fail.'b'First, it ignores the obvious fact that, unlike China at the time of President Richard M. Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s diplomacy in the 1970s, Iran does not share a common enemy that would force it to unite with America. Though Iran\xe2\x80\x99s proxies are fighting Sunni extremists in a number of theaters, Iran itself has cooperated with Al Qaeda and other Sunni extremists, such as Hamas and the Taliban, when it has served its interests to do so. Iran\xe2\x80\x99s rulers simply do not regard Al Qaeda as an existential threat on a par with the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Satan\xe2\x80\x9d (as they see the United States). By contrast, Mao did see the Soviet Union as a sufficient threat to justify an alliance with the \xe2\x80\x9ccapitalist imperialists\xe2\x80\x9d in Washington.'b'The second major problem is that Iran has always harbored dreams of regional hegemony. There is no sign that the election of the \xe2\x80\x9cmoderate\xe2\x80\x9d cleric Hassan Rouhani as president has changed anything.'b'On the contrary, Iran is stepping up its support for militants in the region. There have been reports recently that Iran is smuggling sophisticated long-range missiles to Hezbollah via Syria and that it sent a ship, intercepted by the Bahraini authorities, loaded with armaments intended for Shiite opponents of the Sunni government in Bahrain.'b'Iran under President Rouhani has done nothing to lessen its support for the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria either. It has, in fact, gone \xe2\x80\x9call in,\xe2\x80\x9d sending large numbers of its own operatives and its Hezbollah allies, along with copious munitions, to help the regime stay in power.'b'Iran\xe2\x80\x99s power play is engendering a violent pushback from Sunnis increasingly radicalized in the process. This is the third and final problem that will doom Obama\xe2\x80\x99s outreach to Tehran.'b'In Iraq, the Shiite prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, who is surrounded by aides with ties to the Iranians, has been arresting prominent Sunnis in Anbar Province, thereby driving many of the tribal fighters who once fought Al Qaeda in Iraq back into an alliance with the terrorist group. Al Qaeda-linked fighters have now taken control of Falluja, a town that American forces secured in 2004 after a costly campaign.'b'Jihadist influence now extends from western Iraq into neighboring Syria, where Sunnis are reacting just as violently to the Iranian-orchestrated offensive to keep Assad\xe2\x80\x99s Alawite regime in power. With the United States providing little or no support to moderate opposition elements, extremist groups such as the Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (an offshoot of Al Qaeda in Iraq) are increasingly prominent among the rebel forces.'b'The spillover from Syria is also affecting Lebanon, where Hezbollah has long been the dominant force. But now Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s ruthlessness has been matched by Sunni terrorists who, on Nov. 19, bombed the Iranian Embassy in Beirut. Hezbollah is presumed to have retaliated when Mohamad B. Chatah, a leading opponent of Syrian and Iranian interference in Lebanon, was killed by a car bomb on Dec. 27 close to the spot where a former Lebanese prime minister, Rafik Hariri, was also killed by a car bomb in 2005.'b'This shows what happens when the United States stands aloof and refuses to do more to counter Iranian power: America\xe2\x80\x99s allies in the region take matters into their own hands. The result is the polarization of the entire region into pro- and anti-Iran blocs that feed a mushrooming cross-border civil war.'b'The situation will only get worse if Iran is allowed to maintain its nuclear program with international blessing. Saudi Arabia has made clear that it is prepared to build its own bomb, while Israel has threatened to launch a unilateral strike on Iranian nuclear facilities.'b'Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s hopes of using an opening to Iran to stabilize the Middle East will almost certainly backfire. Before long, America is likely to be forced back into its traditional, post-1979 role as the leader of a coalition to counter Iranian designs. The place to begin is in Syria, which is now ground zero in the struggle between the two regional blocs.'b'Trying to draw the Iranians into a negotiated solution will almost certainly mean keeping Mr. Assad in power. That, in turn, will only play into the hands of Sunni extremists.'b'The United States must work, together with its allies, to build up a non-Qaeda alternative to the Assad regime by providing moderate rebel fighters with arms, training, coordination \xe2\x80\x94 and, if necessary, the support of Western air power. It would have been  better if we had done this at the beginning of the civil war when extremists were less prominent in the rebel camp. But even now, there is no better alternative.'b''b'\n'b'Michael Doran 'b' is a senior fellow at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution.

He believes in exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother, but also supports parental notification and a 24-hour waiting period.'b'And, although he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that homosexuality is a sin and believes \xe2\x80\x9cpeople are born with the predisposition to be homosexual,\xe2\x80\x9d he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support same-sex marriage. In fact, Christie vetoed a same-sex marriage bill in the state in 2012. Last year a judge ruled that the state must allow same-sex marriages.'b'As for immigration, 'b'this is how the editorial board'b' of The Star-Ledger put it in December:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf Gov. Chris Christie thinks voters won\xe2\x80\x99t notice if he promises one thing when he\xe2\x80\x99s running for governor, then another when he\xe2\x80\x99s running for president, he\xe2\x80\x99s dreaming. Yet that\xe2\x80\x99s what he appears to be doing when it comes to the Dream Act. When the governor was seeking the Latino vote weeks ago, he assured advocates he\xe2\x80\x99d support New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s version of this bill. But now that he\xe2\x80\x99s been re-elected with 51 percent of the Hispanic vote, 'b'he\xe2\x80\x99s backpedaling'b'. Christie told a radio station last week that he would not sign the Dream Act, which passed the state Senate and is expected to be taken up soon by the Assembly, for reasons that make no sense.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ve been to this flip-flop Republican sock hop before \xe2\x80\x94 in 2012 with Mitt Romney \xe2\x80\x94 and we don\xe2\x80\x99t need a repeat.'b'Instead of rooting for a bridge to drag Christie under, progressives must focus without deviation on the issues that cry out for continuity in 2016. We are moving toward more equality for all. Income inequality has taken a proper place of prominence. We are working to fix a broken health care system. We extricated ourselves from senseless wars rather than rushing headlong into them.'b'I find the pro-progressive argument more exciting than the anti-Christie one.'b'S\xc3\x83O PAULO, Brazil \xe2\x80\x94 LAST Saturday, security officers stopped two tall young black men at the entrance of JK Iguatemi, a luxury shopping mall in S\xc3\xa3o Paulo. The young men were wearing flashy tennis shoes and brand-new soccer jerseys. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d I heard the guards ask. \xe2\x80\x9cWe came to buy something,\xe2\x80\x9d explained one. \xe2\x80\x9cMy cousin here is a soccer player. From Bragantino.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The guards didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem impressed (Bragantino is a lower-division team), but eventually let them inside, where they bought a pair of flip-flops and then left. The whole time they were shopping, they stuck to their story \xe2\x80\x94 my cousin is a soccer player, sir, so we\xe2\x80\x99re entitled to be here.'b'That afternoon, JK Iguatemi had established a tight security zone at the entrance. Guards were asking for the documents of those who \xe2\x80\x9clooked like unaccompanied minors.\xe2\x80\x9d A second checkpoint was directed at those who, well, looked definitely suspicious but not underage. Some visitors were asked their intentions, or to show an ID if they claimed to work at the mall. As far as I could tell, older people with whitish skin and richer looks weren\xe2\x80\x99t stopped.'b'The mall\xe2\x80\x99s security had been stepped up because of an event that had been publicized on Facebook: the \xe2\x80\x9crolezinho,\xe2\x80\x9d or little strolling \xe2\x80\x94 a gathering of teenagers from the poor suburbs for the purpose of \xe2\x80\x9ckissing, enjoying, taking photos and scoring some babes.\xe2\x80\x9d The rolezinho is a recent phenomenon, dating from early December, when some 6,000 young people turned out at the Metr\xc3\xb4 Itaquera mall. One week later, something similar happened at the Guarulhos International mall; 23 people were arrested (and later released without charges).'b'Now, as if in response to the crackdown, rolezinhos are spreading fast: There are five more scheduled in S\xc3\xa3o Paulo over the next two weeks, and other cities are planning solidarity events. On Tuesday, President Dilma Rousseff convened an emergency staff meeting on the issue.'b'All this because some young people wanted to (as they wrote on Facebook): \xe2\x80\x9cgo up the down escalator,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpress all the elevator buttons\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9center the movies through the exit door.\xe2\x80\x9d Some predicted a food fight. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s show up at the mall tomorrow \xe2\x80\x99cause we\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing else to do,\xe2\x80\x9d they wrote, all of it in a messy mix of capital letters and slang.'b'From the beginning, the middle class has panicked. Shopkeepers have called 911. Restraining orders have been issued, even though there was no actual organized movement \xe2\x80\x94 nothing related to the political protests that swept across Brazilian cities in June. Just a lot of youngsters walking around and singing.'b'The poor suburbs where many of them live are roughly two hours by bus from downtown, and they offer few free opportunities for entertainment. S\xc3\xa3o Paulo has 64 parks and squares for a population of 10.8 million; 13 of the 96 city districts don\xe2\x80\x99t have any green spaces at all. There are 40 cultural centers, 41 recreation centers and 23 public pools. Number of shopping malls: 79.'b'Many of the teenagers are fans of a Brazilian funk music called \xe2\x80\x9c'b'funk ostenta\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o'b',\xe2\x80\x9d whose lyrics speak of expensive clothes, cars, watches, women and money. Wearing flashy baseball caps, colorful tennis shoes, soccer jerseys, sunglasses and rings, they aspire to be part of the very consumer society that excludes them.'b'At JK Iguatemi, a man was approached and asked to show his employee ID. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is absurd, I work here,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me angrily. He defended the rolezinho: \xe2\x80\x9cPeople from the suburbs really need to start invading everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d I heard someone saying, sarcastically, \xe2\x80\x9cLook, he\xe2\x80\x99s wearing a flat-brimmed cap! Arrest him.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the end, the strolling at JK Iguatemi never happened \xe2\x80\x94 it turned out to be a prank. The real rolezinho took place 16 miles away, at the same mall where it had all started \xe2\x80\x94 Metr\xc3\xb4 Itaquera, in the heart of the suburbs. Little by little, some 3,000 young people filled the corridors, outnumbering security officers and the military police. Some were detained and searched, but officers found nothing illegal. I went to Metr\xc3\xb4 Itaquera in the afternoon, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t witness a single robbery or act of violence by the teenagers. There was only a growing tension between the police and the participants, who became increasingly cornered within the building, as shops were closed and escalators shut down.'b'At one point, a policeman passed by me saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m gonna beat you all up,\xe2\x80\x9d then kicked a boy for no apparent reason. When I approached him and asked his name, saying I had seen what he did, he promptly tore off his name tag. He said I should be writing about \xe2\x80\x9cimportant people.\xe2\x80\x9d Another officer told a reporter she\xe2\x80\x99d better keep away from the police if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to \xe2\x80\x9ctomar pedrada\xe2\x80\x9d (be hit by a stone). Later that day, the police tossed stun grenades to disperse the crowd in the mall parking lot.'b'At least six malls have gotten restraining orders against rolezinhos, and the majority of the public favors drastic action by the police. Some say these teenagers are favela-dwelling vagrants who should find a job and stop frightening decent people. They are seen as criminals and treated accordingly \xe2\x80\x94 hence the rush to identify yourself (or your cousin) as a soccer player from the Bragantino team, as if that were the only way to be seen as a real citizen.'b'At one point, I saw a bunch of youngsters detained and searched in the parking lot. They acted as if they were accustomed to this, and were expressionless, even numb. \xe2\x80\x9cCan we go now, sir? Are we released?\xe2\x80\x9d one of them asked. I surely wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so polite.'b'LOS ANGELES \xe2\x80\x94 IF I were to attack you and slam you to the ground as you stood in line for your morning coffee, you might not get up. But if I put a helmet on you and put you on a football field, then did the exact same thing, you\xe2\x80\x99d pop up and ask for another. There is something powerful about football, something that grants men temporary invincibility, makes them immune to pain and anguish.'b'I played for six seasons in the National Football League, from 2002 to 2008. I know this feeling well. It is empowering and intoxicating, but it has its consequences. The day after a football game, the adrenaline is dead. You are in pain. The next six days are a gradual buildup from Monday Mushmouth to Sunday Superman. By the time you step out of the phone booth for kickoff, nothing can make you flinch.'b'Not even snow and frigid cold. The Super Bowl this year will be played on Feb. 2 in East Rutherford, N.J. \xe2\x80\x94 not exactly the mild climate we\xe2\x80\x99ve come to expect for our big game. This has some folks concerned. What if there\xe2\x80\x99s a blizzard? Last week, the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell, declined to say whether the league would ever plan another cold-weather championship.'b'But don\xe2\x80\x99t count the players among the worried. The elements are irrelevant, we tell ourselves. Waking up on game day to storm clouds and freezing temperatures only hammers home the need for an iron will. There is no pain.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why you see players wearing no sleeves in freezing temperatures. It\xe2\x80\x99s better to have the skin of your arms exposed when playing football, especially as a ball carrier, because one of the \xe2\x80\x9cpoints of pressure\xe2\x80\x9d when carrying the ball is the forearm. When you tuck it in tight, the pigskin and your skin make one skin, and the ball is easier to hold. If you put on some poly-techno-Lycra long-sleeve shirt, the intimacy is lost, and the ball falls to the ground.'b'Ever since I started playing football, the closer to naked I was, the more connected I felt to my task. I wore no undershirt under my pads, no cup (no one wears a cup) and no gloves until I got to the N.F.L. and my fingers started snapping like chicken bones. Finger injuries are a constant in the N.F.L., but you never hear about them because, c\xe2\x80\x99mon, it\xe2\x80\x99s your finger! Suck it up! I wore gloves for protection (as well as a thin strip of tape on each finger between each knuckle). But not for warmth. My idealism was hot enough.'b'But even idealism freezes up on the sidelines. Football is a lot of standing around for everyone, starters included. And for players like me, special teamers who play sparingly on offense or defense, staying warm on the sidelines is an art. Cold muscles don\xe2\x80\x99t fire well. To step on the field cold and sprint 60 yards covering a kickoff is to dare the Laws of Snap.'b'The sideline benches are heated. They\xe2\x80\x99re made of hollow metal and hot air is pumped through. Sit for too long and your ass burns. But your hamstrings are nice and loose. Next to the bench is also an industrial-size heater \xe2\x80\x94 it looks like an airplane propeller \xe2\x80\x94 that blows all game long. I stood in front of one on a cold December day once and turned my attention to the field. My parka caught on fire. I stopped, dropped and rolled.'b'Up in the stands there is beer to warm the heart. But not on the field. We played a game in Kansas City one year. It was very cold. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t suited up for the game. I was inactive, doing my best to stay warm. One of my fellow inactives handed me a Gatorade bottle with white athletic tape wrapped around it. Drink first, ask questions later. I took a swig: Gatorade\xe2\x80\x99s newest flavor. Very similar to cognac.'b'Bad weather means staying on top of your equipment, which basically means the shoe and cleat. But when it snows, cleats can be rendered moot. After only a few steps, the snow can fill in the space between the cleats, turning the bottom of the shoe into a well-packed snow cone. This slows down the action on the field, but the ball is easier to handle than one soaked by rain. Snow games can be surprisingly high-scoring affairs.'b'There is a great leveling that happens when extreme weather hits. Game-week preparations are highly managed affairs, with coaches removing all the variables to control every last detail of the product. The game plan is followed with maddening precision, often to the point of stifling the football player\xe2\x80\x99s raw athletic instinct. But on a gusty game day, the scripted plan blows away in the gale force, and what\xe2\x80\x99s left are the best football players on planet Earth, playing the game they know how to play.'b'This is why we should cross our fingers for snow and cold in East Rutherford on Feb. 2. The elements grant the players a reprieve from no-variable football. There is only this ball, on this field, and us, together, screaming silently toward an invisible line, underneath a frozen banner of hope.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s discuss state of the state speeches.'b'No wait! Don\xe2\x80\x99t go away! We can start with Chris Christie.'b'This week, Christie gave his annual address, and everybody was wondering what he\xe2\x80\x99d say about the traffic-jam scandal. It is possible the crowd of cameras set some kind of state of the state record.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMistakes were clearly made,\xe2\x80\x9d Christie told the New Jersey Legislature. It\xe2\x80\x99s been more than a week, and he still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t managed to get himself out of the passive voice.'b'Then the governor quickly switched gears, and announced that \xe2\x80\x9cthe state of our state is good.\xe2\x80\x9d He dropped the George Washington Bridge brouhaha and began calling for more spending on education and economic development, coupled with lower taxes. Most of the cameras quickly switched off.'b'Made sense. Unless you live in New Jersey, there\xe2\x80\x99s a limit to how much you need to know about the governor\xe2\x80\x99s call for reform of the state interest arbitration award system. But the policy part of the speech didn\xe2\x80\x99t even get Christie\xe2\x80\x99s constituents talking. Like almost every state of the state speech by every governor every year, it was exceedingly boring. This is their big moment, yet we pay more attention to the F.B.I. warning on a DVD.'b'Why can\xe2\x80\x99t they do it better? I have been to way more of these events than the average American, and the only one I remember at all is an irritable Mario Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s address to the New York Legislature in 1993, when he referred to the applauding lawmakers as \xe2\x80\x9cmonkeys.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Nothing that interesting has happened so far this year. In Virginia, the outgoing governor, Bob McDonnell, who\xe2\x80\x99s facing a possible indictment for accepting loans and gifts from a maker of dietary supplements, did tell the Legislature that he was \xe2\x80\x9cnot perfect.\xe2\x80\x9d But, like Christie, McDonnell swiftly veered upbeat. \xe2\x80\x9cHe had 12 exclamation points. Up from eight last year,\xe2\x80\x9d reported Daniel Luzer, the news editor of Governing magazine, which has a website that\xe2\x80\x99s the absolute Rosetta Stone of state of the state information.'b'The governor of Alabama devoted much time to assaulting Obamacare, along with calls for controlling taxes, economic development and better education. In Idaho, Gov. Butch Otter asked for a new wolf control panel. Plus discussed lower taxes, economic development and education. Also, Otter patted himself on the back for appointing the first woman ever to the Idaho Potato Commission.'b'The ritual will go on for weeks, and, in general, the speeches will all sink into oblivion as soon as they\xe2\x80\x99re delivered. The reason they\xe2\x80\x99re ignored \xe2\x80\x94 and why, to be honest, citizens don\xe2\x80\x99t even focus much on the State of the Union \xe2\x80\x94 is that they\xe2\x80\x99re generally about everything and, therefore, nothing. Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York not only called for lower taxes, economic development and education, but also affordable housing, a medical marijuana plan, women\xe2\x80\x99s equality, a crackdown on drunken driving, a crackdown on texting while driving, \xe2\x80\x9ca second round of the yogurt summit,\xe2\x80\x9d ethics reform and a raft race upstate featuring teams from the State Legislature.'b'The one exception this year was Gov. Peter Shumlin of Vermont, who used his entire speech last week to talk about his state\xe2\x80\x99s terrible problem with heroin addiction.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGenerally I do what everybody does \xe2\x80\x94 hit 250 points that nobody remembers after you leave,\xe2\x80\x9d Shumlin said in a phone interview.'b'Opiate addiction is the curse of rural America, and a particularly huge problem in the Northeast. In Vermont, it accounts for nearly 80 percent of the population in the state prisons. Still, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the kind of issue governors like to dwell on in what is supposed to be their most high-profile moment of the year.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo be honest, what I really wanted was to have a conversation with Vermont,\xe2\x80\x9d Shumlin said.'b'And it worked. He used his speech to call for more drug treatment, as well as quick intervention programs for newly arrested addicts. It got national attention, and the response from most residents, Shumlin says, has been resounding. This year, Vermonters may actually know what their governor talked about in the State of the State Address. (On the negative side, one Republican state representative 'b'told The Times\xe2\x80\x99s Katharine Seelye'b' that the governor should have also talked about the pressing problem of \xe2\x80\x94 yes! \xe2\x80\x94 Obamacare.)'b'Why can\xe2\x80\x99t other chief executives pick one topic like Shumlin did? Because the state of the state speeches are really about the people who give them, not the tasks at hand. They\xe2\x80\x99re about a governor listing the many, many wonderful things he or she thinks are good ideas. They\xe2\x80\x99re campaign ads delivered from a podium.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s really a waste. And it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if there aren\xe2\x80\x99t other opportunities to make points. Governor Shumlin used his budget address this week to call for a big boost in financing for drug treatment \xe2\x80\x94 plus the need to control taxes, expand economic development and improve education.'b'If you clapped your hands for every initiative, he said dryly, \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99d be bleeding.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It was a rare peek behind the Oz-like curtain of gun journalism in its role as the gun industry\xe2\x80\x99s mouthpiece: A respected columnist was dismissed from Guns &amp; Ammo magazine in October after he dared to write the obvious \xe2\x80\x94 that all constitutional rights, including the right to bear arms, are and \xe2\x80\x9cneed to be\xe2\x80\x9d subject to legitimate regulation. This was heresy for Second Amendment absolutists.'b'Furious readers threatened a boycott, and the magazine quickly apologized, saying the column titled \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s Talk Limits\xe2\x80\x9d by Dick Metcalf never should have been published. Mr. Metcalf, a self-described gun rights \xe2\x80\x9cfundamentalist,\xe2\x80\x9d soon found himself \xe2\x80\x9cvanished, disappeared\xe2\x80\x9d as a writer for that audience, he said in 'b'a recent interview'b' with Ravi Somaiya of The Times. His column was gone along with his starring role on a TV gun show. Mr. Metcalf said his editor called saying two major gun manufacturers threatened to end business with the publisher if he was not dismissed.'b'Jim Bequette, the editor who apologized after publishing the column (and went immediately into retirement), told readers he mistakenly thought \xe2\x80\x9cit would generate a healthy exchange of ideas on gun rights.\xe2\x80\x9d Imagine that, a healthy exchange of ideas in the gun debate. This is exactly what is needed by a nation suffering tens of thousands of gun deaths each year.'b'Polls have shown that even a majority of members of the National Rifle Association support safer regulation. But the association sticks to false and alarmist warnings that the Constitution bars compromise. No less a conservative than Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has written that \xe2\x80\x9cthe right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited.\xe2\x80\x9d Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell that to Guns &amp; Ammo.'b'Republican senators are pulling out every fake excuse they can think of for 'b'filibustering an extension of jobless benefits'b' for the long-term unemployed on Tuesday. The majority leader, Harry Reid, was mean to us and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let us offer amendments, they say. Democrats refused to pay for the benefits. It\xe2\x80\x99s President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s fault people can\xe2\x80\x99t find work because he won\xe2\x80\x99t approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline.'b'The truth is the Republican Party simply does not believe that job-seekers who have been out of work for six months or longer deserve government assistance. The most hardhearted believe cutting benefits will give people an incentive to get back to work. The most cynical are hoping for widespread misery, which they can then pin on \xe2\x80\x9cObama\xe2\x80\x99s economy\xe2\x80\x9d for political gain in the elections this fall. Whatever the reason, nearly five million unemployed people will go without benefits by the end of 2014, unless the party backs down.'b'The most appalling demand from Republicans was that the benefits be paid for with cuts to other programs. For example, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire proposed requiring that parents have a Social Security number to receive the child tax credit \xe2\x80\x94 a move that would eliminate an important anti-poverty measure for millions of children who are citizens though their parents are not.'b'In the past, Congress has generally extended emergency jobless benefits without demanding an offset. The current level of long-term unemployment, about 2.6 percent, is 'b'much higher than it was'b' when previous emergency jobless benefits expired and were renewed.'b'The demand for offsets is highly selective. Last month, a group of more than 60 tax breaks expired, and members of both parties said they were willing to renew them without finding an offset. These breaks are the usual Washington mix of important and useless, ranging from wind-production credits to a deduction for racehorse owners; they would cost 'b'$50 billion a year to renew'b'. A year of unemployment insurance costs about $26 billion. Republicans are happy to give out government benefits, but not to those who need them the most.'b'In a discouraging ruling, a federal appeals court on Tuesday 'b'struck down'b' regulations that prohibited phone and cable companies from charging different rates for delivering different types of content to consumers or even blocking certain content.'b'The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the Federal Communications Commission exceeded its authority by imposing rules that barred Internet service providers like Verizon, which brought the case, from giving preferential treatment to some content over others.'b''b'The ruling'b', by a three-judge panel, could undermine the open nature of the Internet. The court\xe2\x80\x99s decision turned on how the F.C.C. classified broadband Internet service, which in recent years has become a major telecommunications utility used by most Americans to reach popular services like YouTube, Skype and Netflix. The trouble is that the commission called Internet service an \xe2\x80\x9cinformation\xe2\x80\x9d service, which Congress has said can be only lightly regulated. By contrast, the traditional telephone network is considered a telecommunications service and is closely regulated, with companies prohibited from engaging in \xe2\x80\x9cunjust or unreasonable discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d in selling those services.'b'If this ruling stands, broadband providers would be free to strike deals with companies like Netflix and Apple to pay to have their movies, software and other data streamed to customers faster than or ahead of other content. Such deals would hurt smaller businesses or start-ups that cannot afford to pay for preferential treatment.'b'Broadband was not always considered an information service. The F.C.C. classified it as such during the administration of George W. Bush, and that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed in the Obama administration. The court has said the agency is free to change the classification if it explained why it was doing so. The F.C.C. chairman, Tom Wheeler, 'b'said'b' on Tuesday that the commission would consider its options, including appealing the decision, but later he 'b'suggested'b' that it might only intervene if it saw that broadband companies were restricting content.'b'Verizon and other broadband providers have 'b'said'b' they have no intention of blocking Internet traffic. But their commitment to an open Internet could change in the future. Ideally, Congress would pass a law prohibiting broadband companies from discriminating or blocking content, but that is unlikely to happen given industry opposition. That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the commission to reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service.'b'A constitution is supposed to be a set of governing principles around which citizens can unite and peacefully build a democratic state. Tunisia is providing a constructive path to this goal. Egypt is not. Sadly, 'b'Egypt is on the verge of enacting a Constitution'b' that would effectively legitimize last year\xe2\x80\x99s coup and further enable the kind of authoritarian system that the 2011 revolution was intended to displace.'b'Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution gives power and immunity to the military and is widely seen as an opening for the country\xe2\x80\x99s defense minister and top general, Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, to run for president. Tunisia\xe2\x80\x99s constituent assembly, meanwhile, 'b'is expected to approve soon'b' one of the most liberal constitutions in the Arab world.'b'Tunisia\xe2\x80\x99s prospects for a democratic outcome \xe2\x80\x94 'b'after the ouster'b' of the strongman, President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011 \xe2\x80\x94 have always been better. With a population eight times smaller than Egypt and close ties to Europe, it has largely avoided political score-settling against its former elite and kept its military under civilian control.'b'Tunisia, too, has had its dark days, including political assassinations, an economic crisis, threats from Islamists and deadlock over an elected, moderate-but-ineffective Islamic government. But last month, 'b'the government and the secular opposition reached an accommodation'b' that provided for a caretaker prime minister and allowed work on the charter to proceed. The Islamists won wording in the Constitution stating that Islam is Tunisia\xe2\x80\x99s religion but gave up any reference to Islamic law. The more liberal parties secured guarantees that Tunisia would remain a civil state with separation of powers and freedoms and rights normally associated with a democracy.'b'Egypt is a different story. Although thousands of Egyptians turned out for the constitutional referendum on Tuesday and Wednesday, the process was anything but free or fair.'b'The vote came after the military, with popular backing, ousted Mohamed Morsi, the country\xe2\x80\x99s first freely elected president in July, then proceeded to carry out a series of crackdowns on protesters that killed more than 1,000 people and effectively seized control. The government has crushed the Muslim Brotherhood\xe2\x80\x99s party, arrested its leaders, seized its assets and criminalized membership. It shut down Egyptian news media sympathetic to the Brotherhood and arrested secular activists merely for trying to hang signs or stickers opposing the new charter.'b'As in any democratic evolution, there are certain to be plenty of stumbles ahead in Tunisia. On Wednesday, for instance, hundreds of lawyers and judges demonstrated outside the constituent assembly building in Tunis to condemn the draft Constitution, which they say does not guarantee the independence of the judiciary. Still, the process, and the text of the charter so far, offers hope that Tunisians are figuring out a reasonable way to move forward.'b'That is not the case in Egypt where many of the activists who risked their lives to overthrow President Hosni Mubarak in 2011 in favor of greater political freedoms have either given up or bought into the military\xe2\x80\x99s promise that only it can restore stability and move the country forward. General Sisi\xe2\x80\x99s election as president may well bring stability, but only at the cost of democracy.'b'NAIROBI, Kenya \xe2\x80\x94 For a window into rape culture, consider an 11-year-old girl named Flevian, who says that her grandfather has been raping her almost daily since she was in the first grade.'b'She\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant, and, even as she lived with constant abuse and fear, she alternated between first and second in her class of more than 100. Flevian says she could have done better if she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been terrified of her grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s threats to cut her throat if she told anyone about the rapes.'b'Yet her family and community didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to take the issue seriously, and the Kenyan police haven\xe2\x80\x99t taken sexual violence seriously.'b'Once, when Flevian was about 8 years old, the grandfather was caught abusing her. After much discussion, the extended family decided to \xe2\x80\x9cpurify\xe2\x80\x9d Flevian with traditional herbs \xe2\x80\x94 and left it at that.'b'Flevian\xe2\x80\x99s fate is common. 'b'The World Health Organization estimates'b' that 35 percent of women worldwide have been sexually assaulted or subjected to domestic violence. In the Kibera slum here in Nairobi where Flevian lives, many residents say that for a majority of women, their first sexual experience is rape.'b'Rapes happen partly because women and girls are devalued and blamed. In India, 'b'a poll found'b' that 68 percent of judges believed that \xe2\x80\x9cprovocative attire\xe2\x80\x9d amounts to \xe2\x80\x9can invitation to rape.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yet there is hope. Rape thrives when it is a taboo \xe2\x80\x94 considered too indelicate to discuss. Now more and more women and men are speaking out, from India to Kenya to America. Here in Nairobi, there were public protests late last year after a group of young men who brutally gang-raped a 16-year-old girl were \xe2\x80\x9cpunished\xe2\x80\x9d by 'b'being made to cut the grass'b' at a police station.'b''b'In my last column'b', I wrote about a grass-roots organization in Kibera, 'b'Shining Hope for Communities'b', that is tackling the sexual violence epidemic. Now it is handling several rapes each week, pushing to get prosecutions in each one.'b'One of Shining Hope\xe2\x80\x99s social workers, who is helping victims and their families get justice from the police, is Editar Adhiambo. She is an ebullient woman of 25 who says that she was raped at age 6 and again at 15 \xe2\x80\x94 and is determined to end the impunity.'b'It was Editar and her colleagues at Shining Hope who received a tip about Flevian and rushed to help. Words can\xe2\x80\x99t capture the horror of that scene. Flevian is tiny and fragile, and she was in great pain after what she says was a particularly brutal rape. A social worker carried her to the police station.'b'In a terrified whisper, she identified the rapist as her grandfather, and neighbors confirmed that they had known about the abuse for years.'b'In this case, the system worked. The police agreed to arrest the grandfather. He insisted that he had never raped her, but the court later set bail for $4,700, an unusually high amount here. The arrest sent shock waves throughout the community because punishment for rape has been so rare.'b'That may be changing. In my last column I introduced Ida, a 4-year-old Kenyan girl who had been raped by a neighbor. Ida\xe2\x80\x99s family made repeated visits to the Kilimani police station to seek justice, but the police kept \xe2\x80\x9cmisplacing\xe2\x80\x9d documents and no arrest was made.'b'Yet, eventually, as in Flevian\xe2\x80\x99s case, police arrested the young man whom Ida and a neighbor eyewitness identified as the rapist. Yes, my presence may have played a role in the police turnabout, but the more sustainable intervention is the constant prodding by local activists from Shining Hope for Communities.'b'The young man arrested gave his age as 12, although neighbors said they thought he was a few years older. He admitted the rape.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis has had a big impact here,\xe2\x80\x9d Rosemary, the neighbor who caught the boy during the rape, said of the arrest. \xe2\x80\x9cParents are talking to their sons, telling them to be careful.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s a lesson for the world, including the United States. We need to erode the sense of male entitlement, build up female empowerment, end the taboos and, above all, end the impunity.'b'One step that the United States could take would be for Congress to pass 'b'the International Violence Against Women Act'b'. This wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t require new spending but has been stalled for years by a combination of lack of interest and perplexing hard-line Republican opposition.'b'Passage wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t solve the pathologies of sexual violence, but it would elevate the issue and show support for those like Ida and Flevian who could use our backing. When sexual violence is endemic worldwide, does Congress really want to continue sitting on the fence?'b'That Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande is having an affair should not come as a surprise. Every French president since Charles de Gaulle was either rumored or known to have mistresses, and a deferential press, strong privacy laws and a generally tolerant public have protected the incumbents from serious political damage \xe2\x80\x94 even when Val\xc3\xa9ry Giscard d\xe2\x80\x99Estaing crashed a Ferrari into a milk truck in the wee hours of the morning with a woman not his wife at his side.'b'The office of the Pr\xc3\xa9sidence de la R\xc3\xa9publique enjoys a certain reverence in France, and so long as the politician projects a dignified image in public, his private affairs are his business. The French have always viewed the American obsession with the peccadilloes of their politicians \xe2\x80\x94 not to mention the tawdriness of those affairs \xe2\x80\x94 with a degree of disdain.'b'But Mr. Hollande may have subjected national tolerance to one too many tests. In his campaign to succeed Nicolas Sarkozy, who irritated the French with his bling-bling lifestyle, Mr. Hollande projected himself as Mr. Normal, who would bring decorum back to the \xc3\x89lys\xc3\xa9e Palace (despite the fact that he had left S\xc3\xa9gol\xc3\xa8ne Royal, the mother of his four children, for another woman, Val\xc3\xa9rie Trierweiler, and made her his official consort).'b'Now it appears that Mr. Hollande has discovered another sweetheart, the actress Julie Gayet. At the normally staid New Year\xe2\x80\x99s press conference on Tuesday, the first question was whether Ms. Trierweiler would be accompanying him to a state dinner at the White House on Feb. 11. Mr. Hollande\xe2\x80\x99s carefully scripted response was that he was going through a rough time, was entitled to privacy, would report on Ms. Trierweiler\xe2\x80\x99s status before going to Washington and would answer no further questions on the matter.'b'Ms. Trierweiler, meanwhile, checked into a hospital, indicating that presidential dalliances can and do hurt people, as former President Jacques Chirac\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Bernadette Chirac, testified in her autobiography. Add in Mr. Hollande\xe2\x80\x99s abysmal approval ratings and the failure of his policies to do much about high unemployment and deficits, and he may find that times have changed.'b'MANSOURA, Egypt \xe2\x80\x94 On Tuesday, the first day of a two-day referendum on Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s new constitution, voters outside the main polling station in this provincial city didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about the content of the new national charter. Instead, they focused on what this vote has come to signify: support for the army, and abhorrence of the Muslim Brotherhood.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re here so the world will know that this is the people\xe2\x80\x99s will, not a military coup,\xe2\x80\x9d said Iman Mahmoud, a middle-aged housewife who, like everyone else in line, intended to vote in favor of the new constitution.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want the Muslim Brotherhood or Morsi,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dalia Abdel Aziz, standing next to her, referring to the Islamist organization and to Mohamed Morsi, who was ousted as president in July. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re terrorists.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This run-down city of half a million in the Nile Delta, about 120 kilometers north of Cairo, last month witnessed the 'b'worst terrorist attack in Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s recent history'b'. A bomb tore through a police headquarters, killing at least 15 people and wounding over 130. In less than a month, the building has been rebuilt and freshly painted, though it is surrounded by rubble and the fractured remains of nearby buildings.'b'Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, a jihadist group that has carried out several other attacks in the last six months, claimed credit for the Dec. 24 attack. But the Interior Ministry nonetheless blamed the Muslim Brotherhood \xe2\x80\x94 which emerged after President Hosni Mubarak\xe2\x80\x99s ouster in 2011 as Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s dominant political force \xe2\x80\x94 and the next day a government decree designated the Islamist group a terrorist organization.'b'In Mansoura, many voters waved Egyptian flags and held portraits of Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, who led the military\xe2\x80\x99s overthrow of President Morsi following massive street protests, and who is inching toward his own candidacy for the presidency.'b'No one here said they would vote no. Then again, the Brotherhood has called for a boycott, and most of the demoralized young activists and bloggers who were at the forefront of the 2011 uprising \xe2\x80\x94 part of a shrinking middle ground opposed to both military and Islamist rule \xe2\x80\x94 have also chosen not to participate.'b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to gauge public opinion when dissenters are so thoroughly shouted down, or in prison.'b'The Brotherhood has been the target of a massive crackdown, its supporters killed in street fighting and arrested by the thousands, its leadership (including Mr. Morsi) on trial for charges ranging from incitement to espionage. Many of the secular activists instrumental in laying the ground for the 2011 uprising against Mr. Mubarak are also in jail, charged with organizing illegal protests in violation of a repressive new law. Three reporters with Al Jazeera English recently joined the many journalists who have been arrested, seemingly simply for having met with members of the Brotherhood.'b'As the day wore on, the atmosphere outside the polling station here grew frenzied, with dancing, singing and chants of \xe2\x80\x9cLong live Egypt!\xe2\x80\x9d Passing vans and cars blasted nationalist songs. Street vendors made a brisk business selling flags. But in the rest of the city, it was business as usual, without the sense of momentousness that surrounded earlier votes. The forced unanimity and festivity were reminiscent of referendums under Mr. Mubarak. Then, too, there was also only one acceptable way to vote, and those who disagreed simply stayed home.'b'The government wanted to surpass the turnout (33 percent) and approval (64 percent) that the Islamists mustered for their constitutional referendum in December 2012. ('b'Unofficial tallies released on Thursday indicated that the charter had been overwhelmingly approved'b', but final results aren\xe2\x80\x99t in yet.)'b'So for the last month, Egypt was blanketed with posters and ads urging a yes vote \xe2\x80\x94 many of them financed anonymously by businessmen with ties to the Mubarak regime. TV and radio stations put dozens of nationalist, get-out-the-vote songs on air. (The army\xe2\x80\x99s morale division even produced one.) Meanwhile, the authorities harassed and arrested the few who campaigned for a no vote.'b'But a recent survey found that nearly 60 percent of respondents hadn\xe2\x80\x99t read the draft constitution. There has been little substantive discussion of the charter, which would make several improvements over the Brotherhood\xe2\x80\x99s 2012 constitution, but would give the military and the judiciary protection from civilian oversight.'b'Egyptians largely see the vote as a chance to reject the Brotherhood and support the army-backed regime and its leader. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you love el-Sisi, and you want him to run, then you must participate in the referendum and vote yes,\xe2\x80\x9d Mahmoud Badr, a leader of the pro-military group Tamarrod, told a recent rally. General Sisi has suggested that, if the public demanded it, he would consider running, out of patriotic duty \xe2\x80\x94 exactly the kind of statement Mr. Mubarak made during his nearly 30 years in power. If General Sisi becomes president, it will mark Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s return to military autocracy.'b'This is the third constitutional referendum since Mr. Mubarak was forced out. Security conditions have deteriorated and political divisions deepened. Instead of real conversation about policies and politics, the debate has been reduced to slogans: vote for Islam, vote to protect Egypt from terrorism and foreign plots.'b'This constitution promises, on paper, a way forward. But the onslaught against the Brotherhood risks creating more religious extremism, and a long cycle of violence and repression. Drafted by an appointed assembly with only two Islamists among its 50 members, the constitution in theory would enshrine many crucial rights and freedoms. But these ideals are completely at odds with the politicized trials and human rights violations in the name of fighting \xe2\x80\x9cterrorism.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The result of the vote is not in question. But it is unlikely that even resounding approval will bring to Egypt the stability, democracy and development that the interim government and its military backers are promising.'b''b' 'b'Ursula Lindsey'b' is a reporter and writer based in Cairo. 'b''b'GARDEZ, Afghanistan \xe2\x80\x94  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Taliban are still here,\xe2\x80\x9d a pharmacist who sells medicine to remote villages in the southeast told me last month in this shabby frontier town. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople are anxious about 2014 because the troops are leaving.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'After his customers started to understand recently that the United States and its allies will pull out most of their forces this year, he said, his sales of medication for anxiety, depression and insomnia increased 30-fold. Fear of a Taliban resurgence is so widespread that it is hurting property prices and the value of Afghanistan\xe2\x80\x99s currency, scaring investors away and impelling Afghans to seek foreign asylum. Worries about the year ahead are a kind of pathology here.'b'Yet if Afghans are too scared about the withdrawal of American troops, the United States government may not be scared enough. In its latest report to Congress, the Pentagon said that fighting had eased in 2013, reporting a 12 percent drop in security incidents over the previous summer.'b'The United Nations, by contrast, found an 11 percent increase between May to August 2013, compared with the same period in 2012. During my visits to seven Afghan provinces over the last year, I saw no sign of the war cooling down.'b'In the short term, the Taliban are very unlikely to take over the country, or even march on major cities, but trouble should be expected in smaller outposts. Peace negotiations with the Taliban have stalled. This, combined with the imminent pullout of foreign forces, has given insurgents renewed confidence that the military balance of power will shift in their favor. In Kandahar last summer, one Taliban supporter (and sometime participant) confidently predicted that the insurgents would soon capture Kabul, repeating the northward sweep that brought them to power in 1996.'b'He didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to grasp the obstacles: Even if international forces are reduced, as anticipated, to less than one-fifth of the 84,000 troops now deployed, Afghan security forces still number roughly 350,000. That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of firepower standing on the road to Kabul. The capital itself, despite a few spectacular attacks, has enjoyed some respite.'b'The provincial capitals I visited \xe2\x80\x94 Kandahar, Asadabad, Gardez, Jalalabad, Herat, Mazar-i-Sharif, Maimana \xe2\x80\x94 also seemed well-defended. According to Western analysts, in Kandahar, the largest city in the south, insurgent attacks have dropped by half since 2011, the violent peak of American troop surges.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a different story among the few hundred small outposts in the outlying districts. In places where international troops are pulling back, Afghan officials reported a rising number of attacks by the Taliban and told me they were worried about administrative centers being overrun in coming years. Some of these are strategically inconsequential desert towns or mountain hideouts, but losing others could enable the Taliban to choke off major roads.'b'The insurgents have already resorted to medieval siege tactics, surrounding some towns and cutting off food supplies. (As a result, the price of wheat in Azra district of Logar Province last summer was six times the usual.) They put up roadblocks to prevent wounded Afghan police and soldiers from reaching medical help, leaving them to die of minor injuries as they screamed into their phones, begging for scarce helicopters. Some Afghan cities risk becoming lonely archipelagos of government influence.'b'Local security forces have responded with desperate measures. Afghan commanders in Faryab Province described to me in September a risky summer offensive to smash a Taliban outpost. The insurgents were flying a white Taliban flag over their shadow office, displaying their rising presence even hundreds of miles northwest of their heartland. In the absence of American air support, the government troops deployed a cavalry charge, sending out dozens of men firing automatic weapons on horseback. (The operation was successful.)'b'Fraying government control at the edges should serve as a warning. An unraveling of the Afghan state can be avoided, but it will require the international community to stay involved. The mission has not been accomplished, despite what Britain\xe2\x80\x99s prime minister, David Cameron, has claimed. Afghan forces stand a fighting chance, but they need help.'b'Afghan and American leaders must sign a bilateral security agreement to allow a modest number of NATO troops to stay. Afghan forces need more helicopters, as well as logistics, intelligence and medical support. They will need, at a minimum, the $4.1 billion in annual funding promised by participants at the NATO summit in Chicago in 2012.'b'There is no other option, according to a local journalist in Gardez. \xe2\x80\x9cFighting in Afghanistan is like grabbing a wolf\xe2\x80\x99s tail,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile you hold on, you\xe2\x80\x99re worried it will bite you.

Unesco thinks so. In 2008, the United Nations body inaugurated its \xe2\x80\x9cintangible cultural heritage\xe2\x80\x9d listings. The point of the designation, the organization explains, is not to set \xe2\x80\x9cany standard of excellence or exclusivity\xe2\x80\x9d but to ensure protection of \xe2\x80\x9cthe wealth of knowledge and skills\xe2\x80\x9d transmitted by a culture over generations.'b'Unesco has identified 282 so-called elements, including Azerbaijani polo, calculation with a Chinese abacus and Peruvian scissors dancing. Lately, 'b'it extended the honor to washoku'b', or traditional Japanese cuisine \xe2\x80\x94 which now joins, among the culinary entries, the French gastronomic meal, Mexican traditional cuisine and the Mediterranean diet, as well as nearly 20 specific dishes or practices such as kimchi.'b'The accolade is usually seen as a boost, in terms of both prestige and commercial potential. Japan\xe2\x80\x99s food industry, which has been battered by safety issues, greeted the news with elation. But in the case of washoku, Unesco\xe2\x80\x99s imprimatur could undermine the very thing it seeks to preserve \xe2\x80\x94 not least by encouraging chefs to oversimplify and overcommercialize their traditions at a time when Japanese tastes are shifting toward Western cuisine.'b'Unesco\xe2\x80\x99s citation praises washoku\xe2\x80\x99s distinctive social and cultural characteristics. It singles out the special new-year cuisine called osechi-ryori, with its elaborate multilayered boxes that retail for $100 to $10,000 in top department stores. These edible treasure chests brim with ornate arrangements of delicacies, often sprinkled with gold leaf: seaweed-rolled herring, simmered giant black beans, red caviar \xe2\x80\x94 all representing good fortune and good health.'b'In its range of colors, flavors and ingredients, osechi-ryori is a showcase for washoku\xe2\x80\x99s most prized culinary discipline: kaiseki, or haute cuisine, which insists on rigid cooking styles and strict seasonality, in addition to artful presentation. Yet for many ordinary Japanese, washoku also means home-style dishes like grilled fish or the meat-and-potato stew called nikujaga. The lofty and the mundane are related. Both, for example, relentlessly pursue umami, or the fifth taste \xe2\x80\x94 an improbably delicate yet hearty flavor, which finds its purest expression in dashi, a thin stock made from dried kelp and bonito flakes that is the foundation of all Japanese cooking.'b'Another defining feature of traditional Japanese food, from kaiseki to tofu and soba (buckwheat noodles), is the time its makers spend honing their craft. These skills are passed on to younger generations through grueling apprenticeships. Traditional washoku has few culinary courses or textbooks, and its recipes are jealously guarded \xe2\x80\x94 hence Unesco\xe2\x80\x99s claim that it \xe2\x80\x9cplays an important role in strengthening social cohesion among the Japanese people while providing them a sense of identity and belonging.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yet that characterization also exaggerates the role of washoku as a cultural glue. Younger Japanese have been turning to high-end Western cuisine and fast-food chains. Japan\xe2\x80\x99s annual rice consumption has fallen by 17 percent in the past 15 years. Demand for meat has exceeded that for fish since 2006, according to government figures. Some of the bigger kaiseki establishments are suffering from declining patronage, the soaring cost of seasonal ingredients and a shortage of apprentices willing to work backbreaking years for pitiful pay.'b'Japan is still food-obsessed. Cooking schools are booming. And the cheaper forms of washoku, like soba and yakitori (skewers of all things chicken) will remain popular. But many aspiring young chefs are turning to Western cuisine, a faster route to success.'b'Meanwhile, sales of Japanese food products have plunged, at home and abroad, partly because of radiation scares from the damaged Fukushima nuclear plant after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. A longer-term concern is the impact of shifting tastes and lifestyles on traditional society, particularly on family rituals around meals. Reliance on convenience foods is growing as more women enter the workforce and more young people opt to eat out.'b'Unesco\xe2\x80\x99s listing of washoku and its endorsement of \xe2\x80\x9csafeguarding measures\xe2\x80\x9d to protect the cuisine would seem to come at precisely the right time. And it will undoubtedly drive new promotional initiatives. But it could also create economic incentives to corral washoku into just its most popular forms.'b'That would undermine the more exciting work of the young restaurateurs who are trying to preserve the best of washoku while adapting to contemporary realities. Take Keiji Mori, a classically trained chef who spent much of the 1980s in a top kaiseki establishment in Kyoto, working up to the rank of nikata, or overseer of the dashi stock. A decade ago, he opened a low-key restaurant in Tokyo that serves a lighter, more modern form of high-quality washoku. He also implemented training to teach his entire kitchen staff \xe2\x80\x94 including women, a rarity in traditional kitchens \xe2\x80\x94 all aspects of food production. Everyone, he says, does a bit of everything.'b'At his newly opened branch in Tokyo\xe2\x80\x99s ritzy Ginza district, a signature lunch of simmered pork-belly or grilled, sake-marinated fish with rice and sesame tofu is just $10. Mori\xe2\x80\x99s margins are low, but his restaurants\xe2\x80\x99 leaner cost-base and contemporary take on tradition are a signpost for the future of washoku.'b'As Unesco stresses, intangible heritage is \xe2\x80\x9cconstantly changing and evolving.\xe2\x80\x9d And so kaiseki-refugees like Mori, who straddle Western and Japanese traditions, make washoku\xe2\x80\x99s best argument against chain-store burgers and takeaway pizza.'b''b' 'b'Gwen Robinson, 'b' a former Japan correspondent for The Financial Times, is senior Asia editor at the Nikkei Asian Review. 'b''b'CAMBRIDGE, Mass. \xe2\x80\x94 IN less than 20 years, ubiquitous, reliable high-speed Internet access has gone from a vision to a novelty to a fundamental part of the American economy \xe2\x80\x94 not to mention our civic, social and personal lives.'b'Central to this is the principle of 'b'net neutrality'b': that the cables that bring the Internet into our homes should be there for all to use equally. Whether you are a content provider or a subscriber, as long as you pay your bill, it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t matter whether you use them to send email or connect to Netflix or YouTube.'b'That, however, may change, thanks to a circuit court ruling this week in the case of 'b'Verizon'b' v. the 'b'Federal Communications Commission'b'. The decision deferred to an old F.C.C. determination that telecom cables, the primary conduit for Internet access, are not utilities, and cannot be regulated as such, leaving American businesses unprotected from the depredations of a handful of giant Internet access providers.'b'Service providers can now strike a deal with YouTube to get faster delivery speeds to customers, and 'b'Comcast'b', which owns sizable content assets itself, can use its control of the cables to get an edge over rival content providers.'b'But rather than despair, this is a moment of opportunity. The court didn\xe2\x80\x99t make its decision because it was opposed to net neutrality, but because the F.C.C. had painted itself into a regulatory corner, having developed a convoluted, contradictory set of rules regarding Internet access over the last decade.'b'The decision now forces the commission to go back to square one and reverse the industry-compromised decisions that set it on this path in the first place and that have long undermined its authority over this crucial infrastructure.'b'The problem began in 2002, when Michael K. Powell, the F.C.C. chairman who now heads the cable industry\xe2\x80\x99s trade association, decided to exempt high-speed Internet access from so-called common carriage regulation. Those rules, applied most notably to phone service, bar providers from discriminatory service \xe2\x80\x94 everyone who pays a phone bill gets the same quality of service.'b'But Mr. Powell reasoned that Internet access was an information service, distinct from the traditional communications infrastructure, and that competition would be better than oversight at protecting Americans from any abuses by access providers.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing the F.C.C. is staffed by so many lawyers, because it was soon faced with complaints by consumer groups and Internet content providers alleging that companies like Comcast, far from being checked by competition, were using the lack of competition in local Internet service, combined with the lack of oversight, to favor their own commercial interests.'b'After it was revealed in 2008 that Comcast had interfered with access to certain file-sharing networking applications, the commission performed an about-face, ordering the company to adhere to a new approach for managing bandwidth demand.'b'This put the commission in a logical bind. It claimed, somehow, that it both repudiated the need for \xe2\x80\x9ccommon carriage\xe2\x80\x9d rules and, at the same time, had the power to prevent discrimination by service providers.'b'Comcast, Verizon and other Internet service providers quickly filed suit. Though the commission fought a valiant fight, defending this contradiction was always a losing battle. The commission first lost following a challenge by Comcast in 2010, after which it recast its net neutrality stance, mandating that service providers not choose winners and losers among providers of online content or require them to pay fees as a condition of carriage.'b'Verizon then challenged that mandate, and the result was this week\xe2\x80\x99s court ruling. Unlike the 2010 decision, this time the circuit court left little room for the commission to revise its rules yet again.'b'The court did, however, offer a way forward, if the commission was willing to take it. The agency must revisit and reverse Mr. Powell\xe2\x80\x99s 2002 decision, relabeling high-speed Internet access a common carriage service.'b'That has always been the obvious solution. But for years the commission has refused to do so, because its jury-rigged, contradictory stance worked well enough. Now it has no choice.'b'And it must act, soon.

I learned from incredible mentors, have lived abroad (in the Andes) for 15 years, and have committed myself to a set of causes that are lifelong and beyond retreat. \xc2\xa0'b'But Mr. Brooks\xe2\x80\x99s prescription misses an urgent point: Public leadership is not solely about running for office or working for those who do (I did that, too). I have worked across five continents with thousands of gifted and inspiring public leaders who exercise their leadership not as politicians but as citizen-activists. On issues from children\xe2\x80\x99s rights to climate change, it is these activists who generate creative solutions to public problems and jab at the political system to take action.'b'I respect those whose who serve in office, but as they become increasingly drowned in a system driven by campaign fund-raising and attention to image, it is often in activism rather than public office where real democracy is most vibrant. \xc2\xa0'b'So I would add to Mr. Brooks\xe2\x80\x99s list one more ingredient: Don\xe2\x80\x99t think that democracy and leadership are just about who wins elections.'b'JIM SHULTZ'b'\nExecutive Director'b'\nThe Democracy Center'b'\nCochabamba, Bolivia, Jan. 14, 2014'b''b''b''b'I haven\xe2\x80\x99t paid much attention to Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande, the president of France, since it became clear that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to break with Europe\xe2\x80\x99s destructive, austerity-minded policy orthodoxy. But now he has done something truly scandalous.'b'I am not, of course, talking about his alleged affair with an actress, which, even if true, is neither surprising (hey, it\xe2\x80\x99s France) nor disturbing. No, what\xe2\x80\x99s shocking is his embrace of discredited right-wing economic doctrines. It\xe2\x80\x99s a reminder that Europe\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing economic woes can\xe2\x80\x99t be attributed solely to the bad ideas of the right. Yes, callous, wrongheaded conservatives have been driving policy, but they have been abetted and enabled by spineless, muddleheaded politicians on the moderate left.'b'Right now, Europe seems to be emerging from its double-dip recession and growing a bit. But this slight uptick follows years of disastrous performance. How disastrous? Consider: By 1936, seven years into the Great Depression, much of Europe was growing rapidly, with real G.D.P. per capita steadily reaching new highs. By contrast, 'b'European real G.D.P. per capita today'b' is still well below its 2007 peak \xe2\x80\x94 and rising slowly at best.'b'Doing worse than you did in the Great Depression is, one might say, a remarkable achievement. How did the Europeans pull it off? Well, 'b'in the 1930s most European countries eventually abandoned economic orthodoxy'b': They went off the gold standard; they stopped trying to balance their budgets; and some of them began large military buildups that had the side effect of providing economic stimulus. The result was a strong recovery from 1933 onward.'b'Modern Europe is a much better place, morally, politically, and in human terms. A shared commitment to democracy has brought durable peace; social safety nets have limited the suffering from high unemployment; coordinated action has contained the threat of financial collapse. Unfortunately, the Continent\xe2\x80\x99s success in avoiding disaster has had the side effect of letting governments cling to orthodox policies. Nobody has left the euro, even though it\xe2\x80\x99s a monetary straitjacket. With no need to boost military spending, nobody has broken with fiscal austerity. Everyone is doing the safe, supposedly responsible thing \xe2\x80\x94 and the slump persists.'b'In this depressed and depressing landscape, France isn\xe2\x80\x99t an especially bad performer. Obviously it has lagged behind Germany, which has been buoyed by its formidable export sector. But French performance has been better than that of most other European nations. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not just talking about the debt-crisis countries. 'b'French growth has outpaced'b' that of such pillars of orthodoxy as Finland and the Netherlands.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s true that the latest data show France failing to share in Europe\xe2\x80\x99s general uptick. Most observers, including the International Monetary Fund, attribute this recent weakness largely to austerity policies. But now Mr. Hollande has spoken up about his plans to change France\xe2\x80\x99s course \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard not to feel a sense of despair.'b'For Mr. Hollande, in announcing his intention to reduce taxes on businesses while cutting (unspecified) spending to offset the cost, declared, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is upon supply that we need to act,\xe2\x80\x9d and he further declared that \xe2\x80\x9csupply actually creates demand.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Oh, boy. That echoes, almost verbatim, 'b'the long-debunked fallacy known as Say\xe2\x80\x99s Law'b' \xe2\x80\x94 the claim that overall shortfalls in demand can\xe2\x80\x99t happen, because people have to spend their income on something. This just isn\xe2\x80\x99t true, and it\xe2\x80\x99s very much not true as a practical matter at the beginning of 2014. All the evidence says that France is awash in productive resources, both labor and capital, that are sitting idle because demand is inadequate. For proof, one need only look at inflation, which is sliding fast. Indeed, both France and Europe as a whole are getting dangerously close to Japan-style deflation.'b'So what\xe2\x80\x99s the significance of the fact that, at this of all times, Mr. Hollande has adopted this discredited doctrine?'b'As I said, it\xe2\x80\x99s a sign of the haplessness of the European center-left. For four years, Europe has been in the grip of austerity fever, with mostly disastrous results; it\xe2\x80\x99s telling that the current slight upturn is being hailed as if it were a policy triumph. Given the hardship these policies have inflicted, you might have expected left-of-center politicians to argue strenuously for a change in course. Yet everywhere in Europe, the center-left has at best (for example, in Britain) offered weak, halfhearted criticism, and often simply cringed in submission.'b'When Mr. Hollande became leader of the second-ranked euro economy, some of us hoped that he might take a stand. Instead, he fell into the usual cringe \xe2\x80\x94 a cringe that has now turned into intellectual collapse. And Europe\xe2\x80\x99s second depression goes on and on.'b'People love a man who tells it straight, the authentic stand-up guy who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to let you know he\xe2\x80\x99s that guy.

You may have heard Brit Hume, that is, Senior Political Analyst Brit Hume of Fox News, refer to Governor Christie\xe2\x80\x99s problem. It\xe2\x80\x99s not that he\xe2\x80\x99s arrogant, paranoid, testy, bullying or too blunt for the P.C. culture.

He was asked to elaborate.'b'He said, \xe2\x80\x9cBy which I mean that men today have learned the lesson the hard way that if you act like a kind of an old-fashioned guy\xe2\x80\x99s guy, you\xe2\x80\x99re in constant danger of slipping out and saying something that\xe2\x80\x99s going to get you in trouble and make you look like a sexist or make you look like you seem thuggish or whatever.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'His complaint is a favorite theme of Rush Limbaugh, the national bully, who\xe2\x80\x99s constantly harping about \xe2\x80\x9cthe feminization of America,\xe2\x80\x9d and in the broadcast realm, \xe2\x80\x9cthe chickification of the news.\xe2\x80\x9d Of late, he\xe2\x80\x99s gone after the National Football League, with all its concerns about lifetime brain damage to players and harassment in the locker room, as further evidence that the American male has become a wuss. \xe2\x80\x9cMen now have linguini spines,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s stick with Christie for now. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked his Jersey edge, his greatest commodity. Even if most voters couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you his politics, they would say Christie is no plastic pol, nor a ditherer. Plus, he has a man-crush on Bruce Springsteen (certified guy\xe2\x80\x99s guy), whose recent parody with Jimmy Fallon probably broke Christie\xe2\x80\x99s heart.'b'But look beyond his appealing persona. There\xe2\x80\x99s a reason \xe2\x80\x9cNixonian\xe2\x80\x9d is moving up the Google search-pairing chart with Christie; he\xe2\x80\x99s vindictive, and never forgets a slight. His world is divided between enemies and loyalists. And you look at the way he talks to people in public with far less power than he \xe2\x80\x94 teachers, students, lowly constituents at town hall meetings. They\xe2\x80\x99re idiots, morons. Ha ha ha. 'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the microphone, fool. 'b''b'Would a guy\xe2\x80\x99s guy try to weasel out of a friendship since high school? Christie went out of his way to stress that David Wildstein, one of his top appointees linked to the traffic shutdown at Fort Lee, was in essence a loser who never was a Christie friend at all. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, I was the class president and athlete,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christie. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what David was doing during that time.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'David was, at the least, on the same high school baseball team as Christie, as the coach revealed. Yeah, but Christie, the big man on campus, probably never talked to that poor little nebbish Wildstein.'b'Incidentally, baseball this week offered another example of guy dichotomies. Alex Rodriguez, the preening, desperate phony who tried to preserve his diminishing athletic powers with a grab bag of pharmaceutical enhancements, showed once and for all that he\xe2\x80\x99s no guy\xe2\x80\x99s guy. For that moniker in pinstripes, look to Derek Jeter, who struggled through his injuries the old-fashioned way.'b'What frightens Hume and Limbaugh and all their listeners in the aging male demographic has little to do with traits of loyalty or honesty, or even plain-speaking. They see that women will soon make up a majority of people in the workforce, and women bosses at every turn, and worry that the old towel-snapping days are over for good. Somehow, altering the balance of power makes men soft, forced to speak in touchy-feely pap. Watch what you say, boys, and put that cigar out.'b'If they were talking about the huge diminishment of opportunity for blue-collar men, and the inability of our culture to find a place for those who put their backs into their living, the defenders of a lost era would have a point. But they\xe2\x80\x99re not.'b'Christie, in Hume\xe2\x80\x99s definition, is \xe2\x80\x9cvery much an old-fashioned masculine, muscular guy.\xe2\x80\x9d The consequence of being that guy, he said, is the risk of appearing sexist or thuggish. He\xe2\x80\x99s got it exactly wrong. A truly muscular politician \xe2\x80\x94 think Teddy Roosevelt or Lyndon Johnson, both of whom brought lasting changes to American life by sheer force of their political skills \xe2\x80\x94 can govern without acting like a thug or a Neanderthal. (Johnson, of course, could also be a bully.)'b'Books like \xe2\x80\x9cThe End of Men\xe2\x80\x9d and the inevitable Fox crusade against \xe2\x80\x9cThe War on Men\xe2\x80\x9d are squeaks of the turning wheel. The \xe2\x80\x9cMad Men\xe2\x80\x9d days are not coming back. You will never convince a majority of Americans to vote for your political party if you call smart young women \xe2\x80\x9csluts,\xe2\x80\x9d as Limbaugh did, for using birth control.'b'If you say something that genuinely offends women, it\xe2\x80\x99s not because you\xe2\x80\x99re a brawny dude, speaking freely, or even standing up to the culture patrol. It\xe2\x80\x99s because you\xe2\x80\x99re insensitive to people in general \xe2\x80\x94 the daughters, wives and mothers of many a manly man.

Without admitting fault, it will pay up to $10.3 million to about 1,600 plaintiffs, who will get an average of about $6,400. The lawyers will split $7.6 million. This settlement comes on top of about $16 million already spent on legal fees and $2.1 million to settle more than 100 earlier claims. That\xe2\x80\x99s more than $35 million total \xe2\x80\x94 an expensive legal course in basic civil liberties.'b'Mayor Bill de Blasio, who inherited this costly cleanup, has promised more robust protection of First Amendment rights. He can use the Republican National Convention as a reminder of simple lessons the city and the Police Department failed to grasp: mass arrests without probable cause to arrest each individual are illegal. It often pays just to let angry people walk and talk. Overreaction to a perceived threat is often worse than the threat itself.'b'A long-shot lawsuit that could have damaged the effectiveness of health care reform got a well-deserved brushoff from a federal district judge on Wednesday. The suit was brought with the help of conservative legal groups and cheered on by Congressional Republicans eager to disable the Affordable Care Act.'b'The plaintiffs argued that the wording of the act allowed federal subsidies (in the form of tax credits) only for those buying insurance on the 14 health exchanges managed by a state, not on the exchanges established by the federal government in the 36 states that refused to set up their own. That contention was ridiculous on its face.'b'Judge Paul Friedman of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, a Clinton appointee, 'b'dismissed the legal theory behind the lawsuit'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cThe plain text of the statute, the statutory structure and the statutory purpose make clear that Congress intended to make premium tax credits available on both state-run and federally facilitated exchanges,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'Judge Friedman said in his ruling'b'.'b'The law, he notes, was designed to provide quality, affordable health care for \xe2\x80\x9call\xe2\x80\x9d Americans, not just those buying insurance on state-run exchanges. Similar lawsuits are pending in Virginia, Oklahoma and Indiana.'b'The wording could have been further clarified long ago if Republicans had been willing to cooperate in minor changes to the health reform law instead of trying to repeal or disable it. Instead, they are 'b'continuing to wage partisan warfare on this issue'b' and others. The losing plaintiffs have vowed to appeal Judge Friedman\xe2\x80\x99s decision.

But state and federal agencies clearly should have done more to limit the risks. For starters, the state failed to adequately inspect how the facility stored chemicals, though it did send inspectors there to check on 'b'air quality'b'. The chemicals were kept in tanks on the riverbank, upstream from a large water-treatment plant that supplies Charleston.'b'The spill is the 'b'third major'b' chemical accident in the region in five years. State lawmakers and regulators in West Virginia have a long history of coddling the coal and chemical industries, which dominate the state\xe2\x80\x99s economy. According to a 2009 'b'investigation'b' by The Times, companies that pollute state waters are rarely fined. And state officials have so far 'b'ignored'b' a 2011 proposal from the federal Chemical Safety Board urging new rules to prevent industrial accidents and spills. That recommendation came after an explosion at a chemical plant near Charleston that killed two people in 2008.'b'The federal government also has a checkered record on chemical safety. The main law regulating chemicals, the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, has 'b'allowed'b' tens of thousands of inadequately tested chemicals, including MCHM, to remain in use. (Experts say it\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'unclear'b' how harmful MCHM is and how much exposure could lead to death or a serious illness because the company that makes it has not publicly disclosed detailed information about the chemical.) Instead of requiring manufacturers to show that their products are safe before they can be used, the law puts the burden of proof on the Environmental Protection Agency \xe2\x80\x94 a huge investigative and regulatory undertaking. The result is that the E.P.A. has 'b'tested just 200'b' of the roughly 85,000 chemicals in use today, and restricted fewer than a dozen.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s needed is meaningful reform like the Safe Chemicals Act of 2013 introduced by Senator Frank Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, the New York Democrat, that would require manufacturers to prove that chemicals are safe before they can be sold.'b'In recent days, concentrations of MCHM in the water system have fallen sharply and some in the Charleston area can now drink the tap water. But the passing of this crisis should not dissuade the state or the federal government from strengthening and enforcing statutes.'b'The latest report on the 2012 debacle in Benghazi, Libya, where Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three others were killed in an attack on an American diplomatic mission, 'b'offers new detail and a chilling bottom line'b': the tragedy was \xe2\x80\x9cpreventable.\xe2\x80\x9d Released in unclassified form by the Senate Intelligence Committee, 'b'the report'b' reflects a bipartisan consensus about the tragedy that is broadly consistent with the findings of previous inquiries. Even so, it contributes to a better understanding of what happened and why and what must be done to mitigate the chances of its happening again.'b'The committee found that in the months before the attack, the intelligence community produced hundreds of analyses warning that militias and terrorist and affiliated groups had the capability and intent to strike American and Western facilities and personnel in Libya. A week before the attack, the United States Africa Command warned of a growing threat to Americans \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly in northeast Libya.\xe2\x80\x9d The report, parts of which are blacked out, says there is no indication that the C.I.A. and other agencies knew of a time and place of a specific attack. It describes the attack as \xe2\x80\x9copportunistic\xe2\x80\x9d and not \xe2\x80\x9ca highly coordinated plot.\xe2\x80\x9d This dovetails with 'b'an investigation by The Times'b', which found that the attack was triggered in part by spontaneous anger over an anti-Islamic video.'b'The Senate report sheds some insight into the C.I.A.\xe2\x80\x99s role, about which little has been said. As the situation deteriorated in the months before the attack, the C.I.A. bolstered security at its own facility, about a mile from the diplomatic mission. The State Department did not take similar precautions to protect its compound. Part of the problem was poor communication among security agencies. This is troubling since American officials are supposed to have put a premium on integrated governmentwide intelligence-sharing after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The report says the Africa Command did not even know the C.I.A. had an annex in Benghazi.'b'The report also addressed a more delicate subject, implicitly criticizing Mr. Stevens. It said that on several occasions he requested more security resources from the State Department, which made few significant improvements. As the warnings mounted in June, he recommended training local Libyan guards as a security team in Tripoli and Benghazi, showing a trust in local support that proved disastrous on the night of the attack. Later, Gen. Carter Ham, leader of the Africa Command, twice asked Mr. Stevens if the diplomatic mission needed more military personnel; the ambassador twice declined.'b'In the last analysis, however, it is the State Department that must bear most of the blame for failing to provide adequate security and not preventing the preventable. This leaves the department on the same hook that an investigation by former Ambassador Thomas Pickering and Adm. Mike Mullen, the retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, put it on last year when it faulted the department\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csystemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The department says it is correcting weaknesses, creating a new senior position to oversee high-threat diplomatic missions. Congress, often an obstacle, has supported the hiring of 151 new diplomatic security personnel and efforts are underway to find more money for embassy security. This is all very necessary but, as the Senate report makes clear, tragically very late in the game.'b'Suddenly the whole world is talking about income inequality. But, as this debate goes on, it is beginning to look as though the thing is being misconceived. The income inequality debate is confusing matters more than clarifying them, and it is leading us off in unhelpful directions.'b'In the first place, 'b'to frame the issue as income inequality is to lump together different issues that are not especially related'b'. What we call \xe2\x80\x9cinequality\xe2\x80\x9d is caused by two different constellations of problems.'b'At the top end, there is the growing wealth of the top 5 percent of workers. This is linked to things like perverse compensation schemes on Wall Street, assortative mating (highly educated people are more likely to marry each other and pass down their advantages to their children) and the superstar effect (in an Internet economy, a few superstars in each industry can reap global gains while the average performers cannot).'b'At the bottom end, there is a growing class of people stuck on the margins, generation after generation. This is caused by high dropout rates, the disappearance of low-skill jobs, breakdown in family structures and so on.'b'If you have a primitive zero-sum mentality then you assume growing affluence for the rich must somehow be causing the immobility of the poor, but, in reality, the two sets of problems are different, and it does no good to lump them together and call them \xe2\x80\x9cinequality.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Second, 'b'it leads to ineffective policy responses'b'. If you think the problem is \xe2\x80\x9cincome inequality,\xe2\x80\x9d then the natural response is to increase incomes at the bottom, by raising the minimum wage.'b'But raising the minimum wage may not be an effective way to help those least well-off. Joseph J. Sabia of San Diego State University and Richard V. Burkhauser of Cornell 'b'looked at the effects of increases in the minimum wage'b' between 2003 and 2007. Consistent with some other studies, they find no evidence that such raises had any effect on the poverty rates.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s because raises in the minimum wage are not targeted at the right people. Only 11 percent of the workers affected by such an increase come from poor households. Nearly two-thirds of such workers are the second or third earners living in households at twice the poverty line or above.'b'The primary problem for the poor is not that they are getting paid too little for the hours they work. It is that they are not working full time or at all. Raising the minimum wage is popular politics; it is not effective policy.'b'Third, 'b'the income inequality frame contributes to our tendency to simplify complex cultural, social, behavioral and economic problems into strictly economic problems'b'.'b'There is a very strong correlation between single motherhood and low social mobility. There is a very strong correlation between high school dropout rates and low mobility. There is a strong correlation between the fraying of social fabric and low economic mobility. There is a strong correlation between de-industrialization and low social mobility. It is also true that many men, especially young men, are engaging in behaviors that damage their long-term earning prospects; much more than comparable women.'b'Low income is the outcome of these interrelated problems, but it is not the problem. To say it is the problem is to confuse cause and effect. To say it is the problem is to give yourself a pass from exploring the complex and morally fraught social and cultural roots of the problem. It is to give yourself permission to ignore the parts that are uncomfortable to talk about but that are really the inescapable core of the thing.'b'Fourth, 'b'the income inequality frame needlessly polarizes the debate'b'. There is a growing consensus that government should be doing more to help increase social mobility for the less affluent. Even conservative Republicans are signing on to this. The income inequality language introduces a class conflict element to this discussion.'b'Democrats often see low wages as both a human capital problem and a problem caused by unequal economic power. Republicans are more likely to see them just as a human capital problem. If we\xe2\x80\x99re going to pass bipartisan legislation, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to start with the human capital piece, where there is some agreement, not the class conflict piece, where there is none.'b'Some on the left have always tried to introduce a more class-conscious style of politics. These efforts never pan out. America has always done better, liberals have always done better, when we are all focused on opportunity and mobility, not inequality, on individual and family aspiration, not class-consciousness.'b'If we\xe2\x80\x99re going to mobilize a policy revolution, we should focus on the real concrete issues: bad schools, no jobs for young men, broken families, neighborhoods without mediating institutions. We should not be focusing on a secondary issue and a statistical byproduct.'b'Ultimately, the Thai military will determine the winner.'b'Spain\xe2\x80\x99s conservative Popular Party, led by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, is pushing a bill that would restrict reproductive rights so severely that many women would be forced to travel abroad to seek abortions or turn to illegal and risky procedures. The bill would allow abortion only in the case of rape or grave danger to the health of the mother as determined by two independent medical professionals. Minors who seek abortions would need parental approval. Fetal abnormalities would no longer qualify as a reason to terminate a pregnancy. If the bill is passed, Spain will become the first member of the European Union to retreat from a decades-long trend toward safe and legal abortion.'b'Fortunately, the bill is meeting stiff resistance in Spain\xe2\x80\x99s Parliament. Protests have erupted in cities across Spain. The Socialist Workers Party, under whose watch a 2010 bill liberalizing access to abortion was passed, is fiercely opposed. Even some members of the Popular Party have revolted, with the party leader for the Extremadura region, Jos\xc3\xa9 Antonio Monago, pressing for changes.'b'The debate is moving beyond Spain. Alberto Ruiz-Gallard\xc3\xb3n, the main architect of the bill and Spain\xe2\x80\x99s minister of justice, has vowed to take his anti-abortion crusade to the European Parliament and shatter \xe2\x80\x9cthe myth of the moral superiority of the left.\xe2\x80\x9d Jean-Marie Le Pen, the former head of France\xe2\x80\x99s far-right National Front party, has hailed the Spanish bill. Both parties are fighting to gain seats in May elections for the European Parliament, guaranteeing that the issue will play a central role.'b'Already, leftist parties in the European Parliament have joined forces to reject the restrictions in the Spanish law. Mikael Gustafsson, chairman of the Parliament\xe2\x80\x99s committee on women\xe2\x80\x99s rights and gender equality, condemned the retrograde bill. Parliament can do even more to protect women in Spain, and all of Europe, by trying again to pass a report, narrowly defeated in December, that would designate a woman\xe2\x80\x99s right to abortion a fundamental human right.'b'The plane stood motionless on the tarmac for five hours as I sat in seat 26A, staring out the window at the blanket of black ice, remembering a silvery New Year\xe2\x80\x99s holiday in New York.'b'It felt as if I was leaving a lover, not a town.'b'My trip had begun perfectly. Shortly after arriving, I raced to a Bikram yoga studio to unbend after a 21-hour flight and encountered a Manhattan unicorn: a man both sensitive and brawny, a fireman who was a yoga instructor in his spare time.'b'Instead of savaging us, Hot Yoga Man soothed us: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s O.K.

We can\xe2\x80\x99t all be stars!\xe2\x80\x9d When we lay on our backs, roasting in the heat, he opened a window, and fog slid across the room; the cold ushered in a cloud.'b'New York never fails to deliver. Like many who fall in love with another country, with escape and exploration and the exotic, I cannot forget New York, where I have lived as both a child and an adult, where I got engaged and had my second baby. I have pined for it ever since I reluctantly left and returned home to Australia, in a way I can barely explain; if I were your friend, and New York were a man, you would slap me and stage an intervention.'b'Australia is sunny, certain, prosperous and beautiful. Dolphins and turtles swim in the bay at the bottom of my street.'b'But New York is a lover that has never betrayed me, constant in its promise, in its enduring embrace and unerring belief that my plodding self could do or be anything. Stepping out of a cab in Manhattan is like licking your finger and sticking it in an electrical socket, or, as Alicia Keys sings, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing you can\xe2\x80\x99t do, these streets will make you feel brand-new.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'New Yorkers are usually fired by an infectious sense of eternal possibility. When I tell American friends I am writing a biography of Queen Victoria, for example, they invariably beam: \xe2\x80\x9cWow, great subject! Perfect for you!\xe2\x80\x9d Australian acquaintances crinkle their noses: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Why? That is going to be So. Much. Work.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'New York is a stoker of dreams, a disreputable, charming, buoyant rake.'b'Australia is easier; the fit, strong, stable man you know you should commit to.'b'When I lived in Manhattan, I longed for my small children to be able to run barefoot in summer, not to fry like eggs on dirty, steaming sidewalks in the heat, nor see rats coughing up poison on our street corner, nor suffer the round of inexplicable flus that plague kids in New York City. I wanted them to know a country of endless waves, broad skies and red dirt.'b'But I also want my children \xe2\x80\x94 now 4 and 7 \xe2\x80\x94 to know Christmas in New York, to walk past rows of pine trees for sale, leaning against lampposts, and wander Fifth Avenue, bug-eyed, faces lit by lights sparkling from the glowing panther crawling up the Cartier store. I want them to see the rows of trees wrapped with tiny, twinkling globes, and to know snow, the pounding rush of sleds on dirty white hills, the sudden hush of blizzards, Central Park laced with ice.'b'I will always be torn. There is a word for the pain of homesickness in German, \xe2\x80\x9cSehnsucht,\xe2\x80\x9d which is a certain longing, a pining that is both pleasurable and difficult. Some, like C.S. Lewis, understand it to mean a deep craving for perfection, or the divine.'b'New York is the crack of the Northern Hemisphere. Australian designers push their wares in SoHo, and our actors tend bar. We have even \xe2\x80\x94 grudgingly \xe2\x80\x94 given you Hugh Jackman, who used to pump gas at my local station when I was a teenager (oddly enough, I never ran out of gas that year). There is competition in expat communities over who\xe2\x80\x99s been there longest, who\xe2\x80\x99s cracked the codes, climbed the furthest, who\xe2\x80\x99s most like a local. Many write gloating Facebook updates about a reportedly elevated Manhattan existence and scorn Australia \xe2\x80\x94 our culture, distance and insular prosperity. This affectation is maddening.'b'What struck me on this trip was that the streets I walked daily as a local were still shiny, dirty and busy, but many stores had changed. The turnover was remarkable, but the awnings and lighting were often the same. This is what New York does, for all its flaws: It models reinvention, motion and constancy all at once. New York perseveres through everything.'b'And this is what lures so many of us back: the idea that we can simultaneously grow, transform and be our better selves. As E.B. White wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cthe city is buoyed by the hopes and ferments of so many awakening millions rising \xe2\x80\x94 this vigorous spear that presses heaven hard.\xe2\x80\x9d This is the core of the expat experience \xe2\x80\x94 we seek to shed duller skins and find new ones. Our new countries do not just lend us fresh coats; they scrub the patina off old dreams.'b'Just as Paris is a city where you go to lose yourself, and Sydney is a city where you go to enjoy yourself, New York is a city where you go to remember yourself.'b''b'\n'b'Julia Baird 'b' is an author, a journalist and a television presenter with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 'b''b'BANGKOK \xe2\x80\x94  Even as demonstrators were spreading across Bangkok this week, they were losing ground with a constituency whose support they badly need: the urban middle class.'b'The protesters \xe2\x80\x94 themselves mainly from white-collar  backgrounds \xe2\x80\x94 are intent on bringing down Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. She was elected in 2011 on promises to revive the popular policies of her elder brother, Thaksin, who was prime minister from 2001 until he was ousted in 2006. But her opponents are claiming that the government is corrupt, and those policies ruinous.'b'Meanwhile, the threat of violence is growing: Dozens of people were wounded on Friday when an explosion hit antigovernment demonstrators marching through the city.'b'The government has tried to mitigate the crisis by calling an early election, for Feb. 2 \xe2\x80\x94 even though that will not improve its legitimacy. The Democrat Party has said it will boycott the vote;  it wants nothing less than Ms. Yingluck\xe2\x80\x99s departure.'b'This was what the protest leader, Suthep Thaugsuban, was hoping to achieve when he called, earlier this month, for vast protests to try to shut down Bangkok. But the demonstrations have threatened to become so disruptive to everyday life and the economy that even people who support the opposition are being turned off it. This is a significant shift, for it presents Thailand with an 11th-hour opportunity to find a peaceful resolution to the deadlock.'b'The standoff is the latest round in a conflict that began in 2006 when the army toppled Mr. Thaksin on grounds of abusing power and offending the monarchy. The next election restored a pro-Thaksin government, sparking mass protests by the so-called Yellow Shirts; more instability ensued. After yet another election in 2011, won decisively by Ms. Yingluck, opponents of the Shinawatras have repeatedly tried to stir up public opposition and vainly appealed to the generals and the palace to throw her government out.'b'The  crisis exploded in late October when the government clumsily attempted to pass an amnesty bill that would have allowed Mr. Thaksin to return to Thailand and even possibly reclaim his seized assets. There was an immediate outburst of anger, which then matured into more general discontent with the politicians in power.'b'At first, in the fall, the demonstrations were brilliantly devised for urban white-collar workers: Messages on social media invited flash mobs to convene over the lunch break at intersections served by mass transit and on Sundays for major gatherings. Since then, the protesters have marched around the city along the routes that the so-called Red Shirts backing Mr. Thaksin had followed in 2010, when they were demanding a new election.'b'Yet Mr. Suthep and leaders of the protest movement have struggled to keep the demonstrations going on a large scale: Their core supporters need to keep office hours. Organizers have tried to make up by bussing in supporters from the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 stronghold in southern Thailand and recruiting students, especially from vocational schools, which are notorious for brawls. These recruits have been involved in  several clashes that have left eight dead.'b'The protest leaders have proposed no attractive alternative to the Yingluck government \xe2\x80\x94 just the vague notion of creating a \xe2\x80\x9cpeople\xe2\x80\x99s council\xe2\x80\x9d that would set up an interim government and oversee a reform agenda (still to be determined). And their rhetoric has grown increasingly shrill.  A varied roster of speakers \xe2\x80\x94 politicians, doctors, high-society women \xe2\x80\x94 have taken turns hounding the whole Shinawatra clan, sometimes with lewd, sexist and ultranationalist abuse.'b'After Thailand\xe2\x80\x99s leading English-language daily, The Bangkok Post, called the demonstrators its \xe2\x80\x9cpeople of the year,\xe2\x80\x9d the paper\xe2\x80\x99s editorial writers began lambasting Mr. Suthep for disrupting the city, provoking violence and wrecking the national economy. Other media outlets also have cooled down.'b'Huge billboards have appeared demanding \xe2\x80\x9cStop Suthep Shutting Down the Country and Damaging the Economy.\xe2\x80\x9d Citizens\xe2\x80\x99 groups have begun holding candlelit vigils calling for peace. A coalition of  business associations has desperately tried to broker a compromise to stem economic damage. Parts of the urban middle class have cooled on Mr. Suthep\xe2\x80\x99s plans to oust the government by paralyzing their city. Even if they still support the objective, they have come to question the method.'b'This is a chance to get beyond the current political impasse. The Democrats strongly supported the protests at first, but have moved quietly into the background over recent weeks. Dissenting voices in the party have pressed its leaders to accept the government\xe2\x80\x99s recent proposals to set up a process for reform and to drop its boycott of the election.'b'The Election Commission has proposed delaying the voting by several weeks so that more candidates can be registered \xe2\x80\x94 demonstrators have blocked registration in several constituencies \xe2\x80\x94 and the Democrat Party can reconsider its boycott. So far, the party is still refusing to participate.'b'Unless the party changes its position, it risks losing even more support among the urban middle class.

To which the response from most quarters is likely to be \xe2\x80\x9cGeorges who?\xe2\x80\x9d Even in his native France, his centenary is passing largely unremarked. Yet in the days of Queen Victoria and Theodore Roosevelt, Picquart was a figure of global controversy, revered and reviled in equal measure as the world\xe2\x80\x99s most famous whistle-blower.'b'Unlike his 21st-century counterparts Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden, Picquart was neither a disaffected nor a junior figure in the organization he was to expose. On the contrary: In October 1894 he was a brilliant, rising army officer. One of his steppingstones to advancement had been a professorship at the \xc3\x89cole Sup\xc3\xa9rieure de Guerre, and one of the officer-cadets he had taught there was a Jewish artillery captain, Alfred Dreyfus.'b'Picquart, like many of his contemporaries, was casually anti-Semitic. It came as no surprise to him when Dreyfus \xe2\x80\x94 the only Jew on the general staff \xe2\x80\x94 was suspected of passing secret intelligence to the Germans. It was Picquart who provided a sample of Dreyfus\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting to the investigators. And when expert analysis seemed to confirm Dreyfus\xe2\x80\x99s guilt, it was Picquart who met his unsuspecting former pupil in the Ministry of War so he could be quietly bundled off to prison.'b'In December, Picquart attended Dreyfus\xe2\x80\x99s court-martial as an official observer. For reasons of national security it was held behind closed doors. When told that a file of intelligence evidence existed, conclusively proving Dreyfus\xe2\x80\x99s guilt, Picquart supported the decision to show it in secret to the judges.'b'The file clinched the conviction. Dreyfus was sentenced to life imprisonment. On Jan. 5, 1895, before a crowd of 20,000 shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cDeath to the Jew!\xe2\x80\x9d Dreyfus had his sword broken and the insignia of his rank torn from his uniform. Observing the spectacle, Picquart remarked laconically to a fellow officer: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a Jew, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that. He\xe2\x80\x99s thinking of the weight of the gold braid and how much it\xe2\x80\x99s worth.\xe2\x80\x9d In March, Dreyfus was transported to Devil\xe2\x80\x99s Island, off the coast of South America, where he was denied all human contact, including conversation with his guards.'b'Picquart, meanwhile, prospered. Six months later, at age 40, he was made the youngest colonel in the French Army and put in charge of the tiny intelligence unit, known as the Statistical Section, that had compiled the evidence against Dreyfus.'b'The section\xe2\x80\x99s prize agent was a cleaner at the German Embassy, Marie Bastian, who supplied the contents of the wastepaper basket of the military attach\xc3\xa9, Col. Maximilian von Schwartzkoppen. It was she who was the source of the \xe2\x80\x9cbordereau\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the note that an expert had concluded was in Dreyfus\xe2\x80\x99s hand.'b'Nine months into Picquart\xe2\x80\x99s tenure, Bastian passed on a pneumatic telegram card \xe2\x80\x94 a \xe2\x80\x9cpetit bleu\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 that von Schwartzkoppen had torn into 40 fragments. Glued together, the telegram revealed that the German attach\xc3\xa9 was receiving intelligence from a serving French officer, Maj. Charles Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy. Picquart immediately put Esterhazy under surveillance. He turned out to have the classic profile of a spy: a drunkard, a gambler, heavily indebted, and leading a double life with a prostitute in Montmartre. Moreover, he was dangerously active: He had recently applied for a job in the general staff.'b'Sitting in his office, Picquart compared Esterhazy\xe2\x80\x99s letters with the bordereau. \xe2\x80\x9cI was terrified,\xe2\x80\x9d he testified later. \xe2\x80\x9cThe two writings were not similar; they were identical.\xe2\x80\x9d The next day he showed them to the handwriting expert, Alphonse Bertillon, whose evidence had helped convict Dreyfus. Bertillon confirmed Esterhazy\xe2\x80\x99s writing was a perfect match, but saw no reason to revise his original judgment: \xe2\x80\x9cIt merely shows that the Jews have trained someone else to write using the Dreyfus system.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Picquart\xe2\x80\x99s next step was to inspect the intelligence that had been passed to Dreyfus\xe2\x80\x99s judges. \xe2\x80\x9cI took possession of the secret file for the first time since my entry into the service. I confess that my amazement was profound. I was expecting overwhelming evidence. I found nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed, such scant evidence as there was had plainly been fabricated.'b'Picquart took his discoveries to the chief of the French general staff, Gen. Raoul de Boisdeffre, and to the overall head of military intelligence, Gen. Charles-Arthur Gonse. Their reaction appalled him. He was told to avoid any avenues of inquiry that might lead to a reopening of the Dreyfus case. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it matter to you,\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Gonse, \xe2\x80\x9cif one Jew stays on Devil\xe2\x80\x99s Island?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Picquart, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause he\xe2\x80\x99s innocent ...\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He pressed on with his investigation, to the irritation of his superiors. Two months later, he was relieved of his duties. By the spring of 1897, he was an exile, transferred to a native regiment in Tunisia on what amounted to a near-suicidal mission into the southern Sahara.'b'It was then that Picquart, after 25 years\xe2\x80\x99 army service, realized he had no alternative but to break ranks. He passed his evidence against Esterhazy to a senior politician, the vice president of the senate, Auguste Scheurer-Kestner. Then, at the end of 1897, he provided \xc3\x89mile Zola with the information that enabled the novelist to write his celebrated expos\xc3\xa9 of the affair, \xe2\x80\x9cJ\xe2\x80\x99Accuse ...!\xe2\x80\x9d Picquart\xe2\x80\x99s reward was to be dismissed from the army, framed as a forger and locked up in solitary confinement for more than a year.'b'It was not until 1906 that justice was finally done; Dreyfus\xe2\x80\x99s conviction was quashed, and Picquart was restored to the army with the rank of brigadier general. That fall, when his friend and fellow Dreyfusard, Georges Clemenceau \xe2\x80\x94 the owner of the newspaper that published \xe2\x80\x9cJ\xe2\x80\x99Accuse ...!\xe2\x80\x9d became prime minister, he made Picquart minister of war, a post he held for three years.'b'On Jan. 18, 1914, six months before the outbreak of the First World War, while in command of the Second Army Corps at Amiens, Picquart died of edema of the face \xe2\x80\x94 effectively, suffocation \xe2\x80\x94 following a riding accident. He was 59.'b'He had no family to preserve his memory: A bachelor with a succession of married mistresses, he left no children. A large section of the army never forgave him for betraying his comrades. And some of Dreyfus\xe2\x80\x99s supporters continued to accuse him of anti-Semitism. An awkward figure in death as well as life, he slipped through the cracks of history.'b'And yet the injustices against which he fought so courageously \xe2\x80\x94 the inherent unreliability of secret courts and secret evidence, the dangers of rogue intelligence agencies becoming laws unto themselves, the instinctive response of governments and national security organizations to cover up their mistakes, the easy flourishing of \xe2\x80\x9cnational security\xe2\x80\x9d to stifle democratic scrutiny \xe2\x80\x94 all these continue. \xe2\x80\x9cDreyfus was the victim,\xe2\x80\x9d Clemenceau observed, \xe2\x80\x9cbut Picquart was the hero.\xe2\x80\x9d On this day, he deserves to be remembered.'b''b'\n'b'Robert Harris'b' is the author of a forthcoming novel about Georges Picquart, \xe2\x80\x9cAn Officer and a Spy.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b''b'PHNOM PENH, Cambodia \xe2\x80\x94 Just over two years ago, at the Anful Garments Factory in Kompong Speu Province, a young worker named Chanthul and 250 of her colleagues collapsed in a collective spell of fainting. They had to be hospitalized; the production line shut down.'b'Two days later, the factory was back up, and the mass faintings struck again. A worker started barking commands in a language that sounded like Chinese and, claiming to speak in the name of an ancestral spirit, demanded offerings of raw chicken. None were forthcoming, and more workers fell down. Peace, and production, resumed only after factory owners staged an elaborate ceremony, offering up copious amounts of food, cigarettes and Coca-Cola to the spirit.'b'This episode, however bizarre, was not singular. In the past few years, Cambodia has experienced a slew of mass faintings among garment workers: One after the other, hundreds of women have fallen to the floor of their factories in a dizzy spell called duol sonlap in the Khmer language. The swooning has been attributed, variously, to heat, anemia, overwork, underventilation, chemical fumes and food poisoning. But according to one group of medical anthropologists and psychologists who have studied the phenomenon, two-thirds of these episodes are associated with accounts of possession by local guardian spirits, known as neak ta.'b'The mass faintings have paralyzed production, to the consternation of the government, factory owners and international clothing retailers. The United States opened its market to Cambodian exports in the 1990s, and the garment industry in Cambodia has since become a $5 billion-a-year business. According to the country\xe2\x80\x99s Garment Manufacturers Association, there are now over 600 garment factories, most owned by Taiwanese, Korean, Chinese, Hong Kong and Singaporean companies. Many were hastily erected on the dusty outskirts of Phnom Penh and in a few other free-trade zones \xe2\x80\x94 on land where people believe neak ta have lived for generations.'b'Although Theravada Buddhism has been the official religion of Cambodia since the 13th century, it never supplanted the existing pantheon of ancestral spirits, local gods and Brahamanic deities. Perhaps the most important of these is the neak ta, a spirit strongly associated with a specific natural feature \xe2\x80\x94 a rock, a tree, a patch of soil. These spirits represent a village-based morality and are inseparable from the land. This connection is so strong that in past times even some kings were seen to be merely renting the land from neak ta.'b'Like those kings of old, Cambodia\xe2\x80\x99s deeply superstitious prime minister, Hun Sen, in power for almost three decades, calls on land and water spirits to curse his enemies. Most Cambodians today, while Buddhist, ply spirits with tea and buns at small altars.'b'These days, when neak ta appear on the factory floor \xe2\x80\x94 inducing mass faintings among workers and shouting commands at managers \xe2\x80\x94 they are helping the cause of Cambodia\xe2\x80\x99s largely young, female and rural factory workforce by registering a kind of bodily objection to the harsh daily regimen of industrial capitalism: few days off; a hard bed in a wooden barracks; meager meals of rice and a mystery curry, hastily scarfed down between shifts. These voices from beyond are speaking up for collective bargaining in the here and now, expressing grievances much like the workers\xe2\x80\x99 own: a feeling that they are being exploited by forces beyond their control, that the terms of factory labor somehow violate an older, fairer moral economy.'b'Early last year, I met a 31-year-old woman called Sreyneang, a worker at Canadia Industrial Park, west of Phnom Penh. She had recently caused dozens of her co-workers to collapse after speaking in the voice of a neak ta. While entranced, she had also assaulted the president of the factory\xe2\x80\x99s government-aligned union, pounding him with her fists and pelting him with insults.'b'We chatted on the dirt floor of the tiny wooden house where she lived; there was nowhere else to sit. She said she had been feeling ill on the day of the fainting, and that the factory nurse had refused to let her go home. She did not remember most of what had happened next, but a spirit healer later explained that a neak ta had entered her, infuriated that a banyan tree on the factory site which had been his home for centuries was chopped down, with neither ritual propitiation nor apology, during the construction of the building.'b'A few months after that event, something similar happened at a sporting-goods factory near the capital that was said to have been haunted ever since it opened in August 2012. Female workers asked their supervisor, a man named Ah Kung, if they could hold a ceremony and offer a chicken to a neak ta angered at being displaced from the site. He refused. Two days later, the spirit entered the body of a young female worker, Sreymom, and claiming, in her voice, to have been \xe2\x80\x9clooked down upon,\xe2\x80\x9d began shouting in a mixture of Khmer and short, quick syllables her colleagues took to be Chinese. Several dozen other workers lost consciousness and had to be treated at a local clinic.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen she was possessed, she just pointed around everywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d one eyewitness explained afterward. \xe2\x80\x9cShe said, \xe2\x80\x98I want to meet Ah Kung.\xe2\x80\x99 She said, \xe2\x80\x98I want to meet him because I lived here a very long time and he never respected me and this is my land.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 When Ah Kung arrived, the bystander said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe came out and knelt down in front of her and offered whatever the neak ta asked.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What the spirit was asking for was respect. He demanded that an altar be built and that ritual offerings be made to him there four times a month. He demanded that the owner roast a pig for him and throw a Khmer New Year party for the workers. The owner complied. The faintings stopped.'b'In other times and places, ethnographers have also noted seemingly magical manifestations when indigenous populations first confront industrial capitalism. As the manufacture of linen intensified in northern Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, household spirits began to appear in textile workshops in a more malevolent form. There was the story about the demonic imp Rumpelstiltskin, for example, who helped a young woman spin grotesque amounts of thread, but only in exchange for her firstborn. Other fairy tales sublimated the distress caused by the environmental and social costs of intensified flax production. The anthropologist Michael Taussig has written about Colombian peasants who were newly incorporated into wage labor on sugar cane plantations in the 1970s and reportedly sold their souls to the devil to increase their productivity.'b'Aihwa Ong, another anthropologist, documented an outbreak of spirit possession in the 1970s among Malaysian women in Japanese-owned electronics factories. These workers often screamed hysterically and attacked their supervisors under the influence of a native spirit called a datuk. Ms. Ong interpreted these acts as a spiritual rebellion against the drudgery of factory life and the rupturing of the women\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding social ties as they migrated from villages to newly established free-trade zones.'b'She also concluded that the spirit visitations did the women little good because they allowed the factory owners to cast the women\xe2\x80\x99s valid complaints about working conditions as mass hysteria.'b'In Cambodia, the opposite seems to be true. Like Ms. Ong\xe2\x80\x99s subjects, the vast majority of garment workers here are female and young. Many are the first generation in their families to work outside their native rice-farming communities. They often send a large portion of their wages back home, and feel both lucky to be able to do this and desperate. \xe2\x80\x9cThe conditions are terrible \xe2\x80\x94 very, very bad,\xe2\x80\x9d Sreyneang told me as she described working six days a week to eke out $120 a month, without being allowed to take days off even when sick. \xe2\x80\x9cThe factory has always been really strict.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Despite efforts to diversify, the garment industry in Cambodia still makes up around 80 percent of the country\xe2\x80\x99s total exports. Because the economy is so vulnerable to instability in the sector, the government has often reacted harshly, even violently, to garment workers\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to unionize or take any collective action to ask for higher wages. During recent demonstrations, on Jan. 2 and 3, striking workers at Canadia Industrial Park and another factory near Phnom Penh were set upon by soldiers and military police; at least four were killed and dozens were injured.'b'Cambodian workers frequently complain that they are forced to work overtime and threatened when they try to join independent unions rather than one of the many government- or factory-backed unions that have sprung up over the past decade. (For an estimated garment workforce of at least 450,000, by the International Labor Organization\xe2\x80\x99s tally, there are now over 400 unions, according to Solidarity Center, an international labor rights group.) Pro-government and pro-factory unions occupy most of the seats allotted to labor on the national committee that determines wage increases, and their dominance complicates collective bargaining.'b'In September 2010, when the national minimum wage was $61 per month, some 200,000 workers took to the streets to ask for a raise. It was the largest-ever strike in the garment sector, but after just three days it came to an anticlimactic halt due to police violence and threats against union leaders. Hundreds of the striking workers were illegally fired in retaliation. The minimum wage remained the same.'b'Then the neak ta appeared. Mass faintings in garment factories increased exponentially in early 2011, just a few months after the mass strike fizzled. Production lines shut down after the workers\xe2\x80\x99 bodies shut down, and spirits bargained with management on the factory floor.'b'Public sentiment started to shift. During the 2010 strikes, few seemed preoccupied with workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights. Even the foreign media and the Asian Development Bank\xe2\x80\x99s chief economist wondered aloud whether the workers\xe2\x80\x99 demands would hurt the industry. But when the mass faintings began, concern for the workers grew: Were they earning enough to feed themselves? Were they being exposed to dangerous chemicals?'b'Since then, basic pay for garment workers has risen from $61 to $80 per month, and is set to rise again to $100 in February. Numerous conferences on occupational health and safety have been convened. Individual factories, the consortium of garment producers and mass retailers like H&amp;M have commissioned studies of working conditions in Cambodian factories. Garment workers have started to receive monthly bonuses for health and transportation.'b'Not all improvements can be attributed to spirit visitations: The country\xe2\x80\x99s six independent unions have been fighting hard for wage increases. And working conditions still leave a great deal to be desired; labor rights advocates say that $160 a month is the minimum workers need to adequately feed and house themselves. But insofar as conditions have gotten better, it is partly because the factory-floor faintings have reframed the debate. The government\xe2\x80\x99s brutal repression of this month\xe2\x80\x99s strike has shown that it will still not tolerate large-scale collective bargaining. But mass swooning is a rare form of group action that can hardly be suppressed.'b'And now neak ta have been showing up to defend other victims of development. The spirits have appeared at demonstrations and sit-ins organized by the political opposition, which has been contesting the results of elections held in July, which kept Hun Sen\xe2\x80\x99s governing party in power. At protests against urban dispossession in Phnom Penh, traditional animist curses are often levied at state institutions. Salt and chilies are hurled at courthouses, chickens are offered to spirits, mediums summon local gods to mete out justice in land disputes.'b'Last year, in a slum in Phnom Penh, a demonstration by residents who were being evicted by a wealthy landlord was interrupted when a neak ta possessed an indigent woman who lived under a staircase with her mentally ill husband, both suffering from H.I.V. The woman assaulted a local official who was trying to shut down the protest, forcing him to stand down. Previously, the landlord had cut down an old banyan tree believed to be the neak ta\xe2\x80\x99s home.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have been protecting this area for a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d the woman shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am very angry because the company demolished my house. I am very, very angry.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b' 'b'Julia Wallace 'b' is executive editor of The Cambodia Daily in Phnom Penh. 'b''b'Regarding \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Quebec\xe2\x80\x99s latest stand'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Review, Jan. 11) by Jean-Fran\xc3\xa7ois Lis\xc3\xa9e:'b'Ever since the Quebec government proposed its Charter of Values, people have punctuated the social debate with examples of other countries\xe2\x80\x99 policies to back up their positions. While Jean-Fran\xc3\xa7ois Lis\xc3\xa9e and other members of the Parti Qu\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa9cois scoff at \xe2\x80\x9cfailed\xe2\x80\x9d British multiculturalism policies, critics of their bill reply by pointing to the ghettoization of French cities following the implementation of strict la\xc3\xafcit\xc3\xa9. While neither model is perfect, it might be time we stop invoking oversimplified examples rather than addressing, in specific terms, the ways in which the Charter of Values will affect the lives of Quebecers.'b'First, we should see the suspicious gap between the principles used to defend the Charter of Values and the legislative intent behind it. The most striking case might be the gap between the feminist rhetoric the Parti Qu\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa9cois employs and the specific discrimination against women of religious minorities that the bill commands. Let us be clear: The ban will hinder the employment of thousands of women, some of them among the most vulnerable of Quebec society. Women will lose jobs. Women will be sent home. Can such prejudicial measures, based on fear, be labeled feminist? Can they be deemed progressive?'b'The Parti Qu\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa9cois\xe2\x80\x99s position is informed by a shocking oversimplification of the complex set of norms regulating veiling practices. In their rhetoric, only two extreme options can motivate the choice to wear a hijab: blind submission to a patriarchal institution from which we must liberate them or complete demonstration of religious piety that they ought to refrain from. Is this the \xe2\x80\x9crigorous, progressive and modern\xe2\x80\x9d secularism that Quebec should be so proud of?'b'Moreover, when elaborating on the conspicuous religious symbols ban, Mr. Lis\xc3\xa9e conveniently gives \xe2\x80\x9cthe examples of the Muslim hijab, the Sikh turban and the Christian cross.\xe2\x80\x9d Oddly enough, he omits the Jewish kippa, the prohibition of which will cause tremendous problems for wide sectors of the population.'b'(In an irony of history, the Montreal-based Jewish General Hospital was founded partly in reaction to the rise of anti-Semitic sentiment \xe2\x80\x94 Jewish doctors were not permitted to practice in other Quebec hospitals at the time \xe2\x80\x94 with the purpose of providing a safe space for patients of all faiths and cultures. Not surprisingly considering the extent to which the Charter of Values\xe2\x80\x99 dress code would affect its operations, the hospital has vowed to defy these measures.)'b'Mr. Lis\xc3\xa9e finds it odd that people who are opposed to his position do not \xe2\x80\x9cbalk at the current ban, for all government workers, on the expression of other social or political beliefs through their attire.\xe2\x80\x9d His analogy, while not void of any value, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hold water. There is a fundamental difference between political and religious neutrality in the public administration. The state\xe2\x80\x99s public administration is enabled by a governing party, which has to keep its executive functions and electoral interests separate.'b'By contrast, wearing a religious symbol out of personal faith does not affect the impartiality of the services rendered, unless any individual departing from the majority norm is de facto seen with suspicion. It is also a bit absurd to imply that the sacrifice of not wearing your preferred party\xe2\x80\x99s colors or slogans at work is of the same magnitude as the sacrifice of renouncing your religious faith from 9 to 5.'b'Of course, people should be able to freely defend this bill without being labeled Islamophobes. Likewise, others should be able to attack it without being labeled na\xc3\xafve. There is an intermediate position to be held between oblivious relativism and institutionalized intolerance. This intermediate position has been the pride of Quebec, a province that built its own integration policy around the importance of balancing the protection of individual freedoms and the preservation of common values. The picture drawn by Mr. Lis\xc3\xa9e in no way corresponds to the majority voice of Quebec. In fact, might we remind him that his minority government does not speak for the majority, as evidenced by the massive opposition to this bill.'b''b'Pascale Fournier, Ottawa'b''b'The writer holds the University of Ottawa research chair in legal pluralism and comparative law.'b'\xc2\xa0'b'The Charter of Values has three crucial defects: It discriminates against citizens from a non-Christian background, it deepens divisions between Quebecers and sets them against each other, and it undermines democracy by using the power of the state to benefit the majority at the expense of the minority.'b'If adopted, the charter would prohibit individuals working for any organization subsidized by the government (day care, school, university, clinic or hospital) from wearing \xe2\x80\x9costentatious\xe2\x80\x9d religious symbols like a turban, hijab, kippa or oversized cross. At the same time, it would entitle the National Assembly to decide whether to maintain the presence of Catholic religious artifacts \xe2\x80\x94 the crucifix that hangs above the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s chair in the National Assembly in Quebec, the cross that stands on top of Mount Royal in Montreal \xe2\x80\x94 on the grounds that the crucifix and cross belong to the cultural heritage of Quebec.'b'In other words, it forces minority groups to remove the symbols that their religions command them to wear and allows the majority to keep their own symbols in place when they are part of public buildings or parks. Aside from infringing on a basic human right, the freedom to worship freely, the prohibition against religious symbols and dress clearly aims to limit the visual presence of non-Christian minorities. The government wants to maintain a landscape of crosses as a common cultural heritage but to erase the visibility of non-Christian faiths in the public sphere.'b'By seeking to regulate religious practice in a discriminatory way, the government has pitted Quebecers against one another; it has created strong tensions where generally there was peace. The incidence of attacks (mostly verbal) against Muslim women wearing head scarves has increased sharply. Members of minority cultures feel less at home. Will the charter, if passed, further exclude already marginalized people, in particular Muslim women, from the public sphere? Already some secular Montrealers have begun wearing hijabs or kippas to express opposition to the charter. Will the law increase adoption of religious types of dress by turning them into emblems of political dissent?'b'The charter undermines Quebec\xe2\x80\x99s values and its reputation for progressivism. In sponsoring the charter, the government is shifting attention and resources away from some very serious problems facing Quebec today, including a lagging economy and long waiting lists for hospital services. For the many residents of Quebec who lack a family doctor, being the patient of a qualified physician in a turban, hijab or kippa would be a cause for celebration, not complaint.'b'For Mr. Lis\xc3\xa9e, Montreal and its multiculturalism are a problem and the Charter of Values a solution. The opposite is true. The multicultural reality of Montreal shows the power that resides in the creative interaction of diverse people in a public sphere open to all.'b''b'Eve Sanders, Montreal'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'Mr. Lis\xc3\xa9e is being economical with the truth when he asserts that his party has reached a decision to remove the large crucifix currently hanging in the Quebec National Assembly. His Parti Qu\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa9cois first announced that the crucifix would remain because it was not a religious symbol but part of Quebec\xe2\x80\x99s cultural heritage. The current proposal in the bill before the National Assembly would leave it up to the legislature to decide. As this body will undoubtedly vote to keep the crucifix where it is, the specious claim that the Charter of Values will defend the religious neutrality of the state is revealed. Some religious symbols, it seems, are more neutral than others.'b''b'Stephen L. Black Sherbrooke, Quebec'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'It should be kept firmly in mind when reading his arguments that Mr. Lis\xc3\xa9e represents a political party that seeks to break up Canada. Thankfully, Quebec\xe2\x80\x99s population has twice voted in favor of remaining part of Canada in referendums with very high voter turnouts.'b'From coast to coast, Canada is as vast as it is diverse \xe2\x80\x94 culturally, economically and linguistically. Canada\xe2\x80\x99s federal system allows for the diversity among its provinces to thrive and make the country as a whole stronger. Most Qu\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa9cois know that while Quebec may find distinct solutions to the issues most jurisdictions face, it also finds within the Canadian federation the flexibility to develop and assert itself, as well as the political and economic stability that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to move forward, even more so during these tough economic times.'b'Indeed, Quebec\xe2\x80\x99s divergent policy positions enumerated by Mr. Lis\xc3\xa9e are made possible because of Canada\xe2\x80\x99s decentralized build. Our forebears, including the great George-\xc3\x89tienne Cartier, had the intelligence and foresight to craft a Constitution that has made the very idea of Canada powerful and resistant. It is the idea that two founding peoples can assert their distinctive religious and linguistic makeup and yet thrive as one country.'b'Not only does the Canadian Constitution leave it to the provinces to design and implement their own policies in such critical areas as health care, education, environment and civil rights, but Canada\xe2\x80\x99s economic strengths are a formidable lever for the provinces themselves. A striking and particularly recent example of this is the comprehensive free-trade agreement that Canada reached with the European Union, which will create thousands of new jobs in Quebec alone.'b'Negotiating this agreement, for which the Quebec government was fully consulted and was a constructive partner, was possible because of what Canada offers the European Union as a country \xe2\x80\x94 including the removal of roughly 99 percent of tariffs throughout Canada.'b'Further to this, Canada\xe2\x80\x99s current economic situation and its enticing prospects are more than worthy of mention. Since the worst of the 2008 global economic downturn, Canada has been leading all Group of 7 nations in job creation, economic growth and its debt-to-G.D.P. ratio. Our banking system is constantly recognized as the world\xe2\x80\x99s strongest and most robust. Our trade relationships are expanding and several of our industries are blossoming, creating jobs and growth throughout our vast country.'b'Quebec is stronger because it is part of Canada; stronger because Canada\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional framework gives it the flexibility to implement its own policies in a number of areas; and stronger still because of Canada\xe2\x80\x99s vigorous economy.'b''b'Denis Lebel, Ottawa'b''b'The writer is minister of infrastructure, communities and intergovernmental affairs, and minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec.'b'\xc2\xa0'b'Mr. Lis\xc3\xa9e misinterprets the republican ideals of Jefferson. The Jeffersonian principle of the separation of church and state was intended to prevent the establishment of a state religion or the prohibition of religious expression. Mr. Lis\xc3\xa9e confuses that ideal with his party\xe2\x80\x99s plan to strip religious minorities of their identity by preventing them from obtaining basic social services (\xe2\x80\x9cunless they have their face uncovered,\xe2\x80\x9d as the bill stipulates) or working for the government (if they do not comply \xe2\x80\x9cwith the restriction on wearing religious objects that overtly indicate a religious affiliation\xe2\x80\x9d).'b'Quebec wants to impose secularism on its workers and clients, which is a form of state-sanctioned religious coercion. Quebecers would be forced to choose between employment, essential government services and their deeply held personal beliefs. The Charter of Values would have a prejudicial effect on non-Francophones, newcomers and minorities who are currently vastly underrepresented in Quebec\xe2\x80\x99s civil service and suffer from lower employment rates and income than other Quebecers. The proposed charter would compound these issues and penalize populations that require assistance and understanding.'b'Mr. Lis\xc3\xa9e claims that Canada\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution, adopted in 1982, has \xe2\x80\x9cde facto authority over the province.\xe2\x80\x9d But \xe2\x80\x9cde facto\xe2\x80\x9d implies that an authority rules without legal foundation or basis. This is a shocking claim coming from a minister of the Crown. The Canadian Constitution is, of course, \xe2\x80\x9cde jure\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 meaning that state authority operates within the rule of law and was established upon solid legal foundations. This was ruled upon twice by the Supreme Court of Canada during constitutional negotiations.'b'While there are concerns about mass immigration and multiculturalism in Quebec and Canada, they are generally focused on ensuring the effective social and economic inclusion of newcomers in our societies, not inventing new ways to coerce them to leave their fundamental beliefs at the door. I hope all Quebecers will stand up against the Charter of Values and for equal rights, basic human rights, and freedom of religion for all Quebecers as defined under Quebec, Canadian and international law.'b''b'Colin Standish, Quebec'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'Separation of church and state refers to the state not forcing any religious views on the populace. The clothing accessories worn by government employees (this includes teachers, doctors and nurses) do not push any point of view on the recipients of services. In fact, one of the busiest hospitals in Montreal is staffed by health professionals from all walks of life, including those wearing turbans, hijabs, kippas and large crosses. The very women whom the Parti Qu\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa9cois claims to be protecting will, in fact, be hurt by this charter. Women who choose to wear the hijab will either be ghettoized, by being forced to work only within their own communities, or will be forced to not work at all.'b'Not only is Quebec risking a serious brain drain of many fine teachers, health care workers and academics, it also may come to be seen by the rest of the world as an intolerant society. Those of us in favor of inclusion can only hope that common sense will prevail and that this bill will be defeated in the spring.'b''b'Judy Glass, Montreal'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'The overwhelming majority of political analysts in Quebec and the rest of Canada have pointed out that Mr. Lis\xc3\xa9e and the Parti Qu\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa9cois are engaging in a dangerous game of mobilizing ethnic nationalism in the hopes of winning a majority in the next election. The added bonus for the current government is that the eroding social climate caused by the charter will push minority groups out of Quebec to other parts of Canada, meaning Quebec\xe2\x80\x99s independence movement will rid itself of those pesky immigrants and foreigners who have an attachment to Canada and are more likely to vote no in a future referendum.'b'In 2009 President Nicolas Sarkozy of France criticized Quebec\xe2\x80\x99s independence movement for trying to build an identity constructed on complete opposition to the province\xe2\x80\x99s linguistic and cultural minorities. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you really believe that the world, with the unprecedented crisis that it is going through, needs division, needs hatred?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Sarkozy asked.

They want you to go away. They have a million ways to stall you. You go to court and they continue with the stalling tactics.

I have refused to pay the bribes demanded by the police and the judiciary, but I doubt even a bribe would accomplish anything.'b'Kenya has human rights laws, but they are rarely enforced. No one really cares. The prisons are filled with thieves and murderers, but the police are loath to investigate and arrest rapists.

But last fall\xe2\x80\x99s designation of the old Tammany Hall headquarters on Union Square as a city landmark is a reminder of just how powerful the nation\xe2\x80\x99s most famous machine was, and why it remains a presence in political conversations.'b'Tammany Hall \xe2\x80\x94 shorthand for the faction that controlled Manhattan\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic Party for most of a 150-year period \xe2\x80\x94 has a well-deserved place in the annals of urban misgovernment in the United States. It stole elections, it intimidated political antagonists, and it shook down contractors and vendors. It produced the very face of political corruption, William M. Tweed, known to friend and foe as \xe2\x80\x9cBoss.\xe2\x80\x9d And it was at best indifferent to the grievances of African-Americans and, later, Hispanics in New York.'b'But there\xe2\x80\x99s more to the story. Tammany Hall\xe2\x80\x99s leaders delivered social services at a time when City Hall and Albany did not. They massaged justice at a time when the poor did not have access to public defenders. And they found jobs for the unemployed when the alternative was hunger and illness.'b'Barbara Porges, a Tammany district leader years before women won the right to vote, prided herself on knowing the names and predicaments of peddlers who worked on Orchard Street in the heart of her district. When one of them, an onion seller, contracted tuberculosis, Ms. Porges raised money to send him to a drier climate. Nobody saw reason to ask how this was achieved.'b'For generations of immigrants and their children in Manhattan, the face of government was the face of the local Tammany ward heeler. And it was a friendly face. This was something entirely new for Russian Jews, Southern Italians and, to be sure, the Irish who dominated the machine. Their experience with politics in the old country was not quite so amiable.'b'For Tammany, power rested on voter turnout. And turnout was a function of relentless outreach and tireless service. The legendary Tammany leader George Washington Plunkitt \xe2\x80\x94 the man who coined the phrase \xe2\x80\x9chonest graft\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 met with constituents and lesser Tammany officials in his district several times a week to find out who was happy with Tammany\xe2\x80\x99s services and who required some special attention.'b'Another notable Tammany district leader who worked his way up from poverty, Jeremiah T. Mahoney, once insisted that he and other Tammany colleagues never forgot the dire circumstances of their impoverished childhoods amid the splendor of late 19th-century Manhattan. Those memories, he argued, led Tammany to support progressive reforms like workers\xe2\x80\x99 compensation, the beginning of minimum-wage laws, the federal income tax, public pensions for widows and children, greater government regulation of the workplace and private property, and other laws that helped set the stage for the New Deal in the 1930s. The Tammany machine\xe2\x80\x99s two greatest advocates for social reform were Mahoney\xe2\x80\x99s law partner, Senator Robert F. Wagner, and the four-time governor Alfred E. Smith.'b'At the same time, Tammany resisted the reform movement\xe2\x80\x99s impulse to impose an evangelical Anglo-Protestant morality on the Catholics and Jews who made up the bulk of New York\xe2\x80\x99s poor. Many private charities in the early 20th century were obsessed with dividing the poor into those considered worthy of help and those whose personal lives disqualified them for assistance.'b'Tammany figures, many of them descended from survivors of the potato famine in the mid-19th century, made no attempt to investigate the claims of those who sought their help. One of the machine\xe2\x80\x99s legendary scoundrels, \xe2\x80\x9cBig Tim\xe2\x80\x9d Sullivan, explained how he approached those who sought a free meal in his clubhouse: \xe2\x80\x9cI never ask a hungry man about his past. I feed him not because he is good, but because he needs food.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yes, many Tammany figures, including Sullivan, were corrupt. But it\xe2\x80\x99s hard not to detect more than a little bigotry in the rhetoric of the machine\xe2\x80\x99s foes. Andrew D. White, president of Cornell University and one of the late 19th century\xe2\x80\x99s most-celebrated reformers, once complained that under Tammany and its imitators, a \xe2\x80\x9ccrowd of illiterate peasants, freshly raked from Irish bogs, or Bohemian mines, or Italian robber nests,\xe2\x80\x9d exercised \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual control\xe2\x80\x9d over New York and other cities packed with immigrants.'b'Indeed they did, thanks to Tammany\xe2\x80\x99s embrace of an early form of multiculturalism. Tammany\xe2\x80\x99s Irish leaders were quick to incorporate Jews into their clubhouses (Herbert Lehman, the first Jew elected governor of New York, was vice chairman of Tammany\xe2\x80\x99s finance committee in the mid-1920s), and while it was hardly ahead of its times on race relations, it encouraged black participation at a time when fellow Democrats in the South suppressed voting rights.'b'Tammany Hall certainly was guilty of many of the offenses arraigned against it. But those flaws should not overshadow Tammany\xe2\x80\x99s undoubted virtues. The machine succeeded not simply because it could round up votes. It succeeded because it was unafraid of the grunt work of retail politics and because it rarely lost touch with its voters.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Inequality Problem'b',\xe2\x80\x9d by David Brooks (column, Jan. 17):'b'Discussions about raising the minimum wage often focus on single motherhood, school dropouts and damaging youthful behavior to explain the lack of social mobility, but not inequality per se.

He wanted me to know that there was a decent likelihood that some of my personal information had been stolen by criminals who had \xe2\x80\x9cforced their way into our systems,\xe2\x80\x9d as Steinhafel put it, and pulled off one of the biggest data breaches in history.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not a regular Target shopper, so I had to think about this for a minute. Then I remembered: In mid-December, while marooned in Houston after missing a connecting flight to Rio de Janeiro, I went to a Target store to buy some clean clothes. I paid with my debit card, which I swiped through the little \xe2\x80\x9cpoint of sale\xe2\x80\x9d machine, and then entered my passcode \xe2\x80\x94 something I probably do a dozen times a day. The very ordinariness of the transaction is partly why it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t stood out in my memory.'b'Since receiving Steinhafel\xe2\x80\x99s letter, however, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been brushing up on data breaches, and I\xe2\x80\x99m here to say it is going to be a while before I\xe2\x80\x99m sanguine when I make that little swiping motion with my debit card. In the battle between hackers and retailers, it sure looks as though the hackers are winning.'b'If you have read anything about the Target data breach, you know that from Nov. 27 to mid-December, hackers siphoned off the credit card information of 40 million Target shoppers, including card numbers, passcodes and the three-digit security code on the back. They also took names and email addresses of tens of millions of other Target customers.'b'Target 'b'acknowledged the breach'b' on Dec. 19, but only after a reporter named Brian Krebs had broken the news on his authoritative blog, 'b'Krebs on Security'b'.'b'When I talked to Krebs, he told me that while Target was \xe2\x80\x9chardly a poster boy for how to secure data,\xe2\x80\x9d the company probably wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all that much worse than most other retailers. Its digital system undoubtedly had all the current antivirus software, none of which had detected the malicious software \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cmalware,\xe2\x80\x9d as it\xe2\x80\x99s called \xe2\x80\x94 that had infected it. Krebs was pretty convinced that the hackers were Russians. It was obvious that they were extremely sophisticated in how they went about stealing credit card data.'b'After burrowing into a Target server, he explained on his blog, the malware would then grab data from Target\xe2\x80\x99s point-of-sale terminals all across the country shortly after customers swiped their cards. At that moment, a moment of maximum vulnerability since all the data was unencrypted at that point, the magnetic stripe would yield all the information the hacker needed.'b'Another security expert, Gerhard Eschelbeck, the chief technology officer at Sophos, wrote in a recent report that \xe2\x80\x9cone trend that stands out is the growing ability of malware authors to camouflage their attacks.\xe2\x80\x9d Eschelbeck described attacks by modern hacks as \xe2\x80\x9cinnovative and diverse.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Virtually every security expert I spoke to said it is likely that a lot more retail companies have been breached than has been acknowledged. Indeed, last week, Neiman Marcus admitted that its systems had been breached. And just the other day, the Department of Homeland Security 'b'sent a report'b' to retailers and banks warning about point-of-sale malware, which it suspects has infected more systems than just Target\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'So why don\xe2\x80\x99t retailers do more to stop such attacks? Part of the reason is that nobody is forcing them to. It costs a lot of money to completely revamp their systems in ways that would make them harder to breach. However disruptive to customers, there really hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been any business consequences, not until the Target breach, anyway. (Target saw its 'b'Christmas sales decline'b' after the breach was announced.)'b'The simplest thing we could do to diminish data breaches would be to move away from magnetic stripes, which are relatively easy to copy, and go to a system in which credit and debit cards are embedded with chips. In widespread use 'b'in Europe and elsewhere'b', such cards are practically nonexistent in the United States (though a rollout is supposed to begin in the fall of 2015). In 2009, a payment company called Heartland 'b'suffered a breach'b' that was even larger than Target\xe2\x80\x99s. You would think that would have been a wake-up call, but apparently it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'The most galling part of Steinhafel\xe2\x80\x99s letter is its advice to consumers. \xe2\x80\x9cNever share information with anyone,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes. \xe2\x80\x9cBe wary of emails that ask for money.\xe2\x80\x9d None of this advice, of course, would have helped anyone who had the misfortune to shop at Target during the three weeks the malware was doing its devious work. The fault was not ours, Mr. Steinhafel; it was yours.'b'As for me, it turns out that the Russian hackers won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to use my debit card information after all. I had to get a new card \xe2\x80\x94 after I was hacked in Brazil.'b'TEL AVIV \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cNAZI\xe2\x80\x9d is a short word.

It could be a cop, a soldier or an elected official who, in their opinion, is acting like a bully.'b'Such usage is offensive and infuriating. As the son of Holocaust survivors, I find it particularly rankling. This week the Knesset gave preliminary approval to a bill that would criminalize saying \xe2\x80\x9cNazi\xe2\x80\x9d under inappropriate circumstances. The government views the word as a weapon of mass destruction no less lethal than an Iranian nuclear bomb, and so it insists on Israel\xe2\x80\x99s basic right to protect itself from the threat.'b'Many Israelis think that passing a law against a word is stupid and juvenile; others see it as fascist and anti-democratic. Incidentally, saying \xe2\x80\x9cfascist\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9canti-democratic\xe2\x80\x9d is also seen as insulting and offensive. And I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if someone tried to outlaw those words in the future, too.'b'Imagine a different state of Israel, one very much like our own: This other Israel would also be sunny, with golden beaches, roadblocks in the territories, targeted killings, and rockets hitting the southern towns.

On Friday, after seven months of increasingly uncomfortable revelations and growing public outcry, Mr. Obama gave a speech that was in large part an admission that he had been wrong.'b'The president announced important new restrictions on the collection of information about ordinary Americans, including the requirement of court approval before telephone records can be searched. He called for greater oversight of the intelligence community and acknowledged that intrusive forms of technology posed a growing threat to civil liberties.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOur system of government is built on the premise that our liberty cannot depend on the good intentions of those in power,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama said 'b'in a speech at the Justice Department'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cIt depends on the law to constrain those in power.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But even as Mr. Obama spoke eloquently of the need to balance the nation\xe2\x80\x99s security with personal privacy and civil liberties, many of his reforms were frustratingly short on specifics and vague on implementation.'b'The president\xe2\x80\x99s most significant announcement was also the hardest to parse. He ordered \xe2\x80\x9ca transition that will end\xe2\x80\x9d the bulk collection of phone metadata as it currently exists, but what exactly will end? The database will still exist, even if he said he wants it held outside the government. Mr. Obama should have called for sharp reductions in the amount of data the government collects, or at least adopted his own review panel\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation that telecommunications companies keep the data they create and let the National Security Agency request only what it needs. Instead, he gave the Justice Department and intelligence officials until late March to come up with alternate storage options, seeking a new answer when the best ones are already obvious.'b'But he added two restrictions that could significantly reduce the possibility of abuse of this information: Wherever the database resides, he said, it may be queried only \xe2\x80\x9cafter a judicial finding or in the case of a true emergency.\xe2\x80\x9d (That calls for a clear definition of \xe2\x80\x9cemergency.\xe2\x80\x9d) Agency analysts will be permitted to pursue phone calls that are two \xe2\x80\x9chops\xe2\x80\x9d removed from a number associated with a terrorist organization, instead of three. That extra hop allowed for the examination of an exponentially larger number of phone calls.'b'Mr. Obama did not address the bigger problem that the collection of all this data, no matter who ends up holding onto it, may not be making us any safer. That was the conclusion of the president\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'review panel'b' as well as a 'b'federal judge'b' in Washington who ruled that the bulk-collection program was probably unconstitutional and an 'b'extensive report'b' by the New America Foundation finding that the program \xe2\x80\x9chas had no discernible impact on preventing acts of terrorism and only the most marginal of impacts on preventing terrorist-related activity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Obama called on Congress to create a panel of independent advocates to argue in significant cases before the intelligence court, which currently hears arguments only from the government and must rely on government officials to identify and disclose their own mistakes. That would be a huge improvement to the one-sided process that often turns the court into a rubber stamp, but Congress is likely to dither over it. It would be better for the president to create the panel himself and work with the courts to find independent members. At the same time, any public advocate must be free to decide what cases to argue and not be limited to the administration\xe2\x80\x99s or the court\xe2\x80\x99s view of what is \xe2\x80\x9csignificant.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Obama wisely sought to tamp down the international furor over surveillance of foreign leaders and ordinary citizens by announcing restrictions on the collection, use and retention of that data. He said he would extend certain protections normally afforded only to Americans. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople around the world, regardless of their nationality, should know that the United States is not spying on ordinary people who don\xe2\x80\x99t threaten our national security,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama said.'b'Several of the presidential review panel\xe2\x80\x99s key recommendations were not addressed on Friday. The panel said a court order should be required to search through Americans\xe2\x80\x99 emails or calls that are incidentally intercepted; the president called only for unspecified reforms. He rejected the recommendation that judges sign off on the subpoenas used by the F.B.I. to demand business records, known as national security letters, saying only that they should be less secret. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go nearly far enough to curb these orders, which have been abused. Mr. Obama said nothing about the process of selecting intelligence-court judges, which now resides solely in the hands of one man, Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. He also failed to address the panel\xe2\x80\x99s call for the N.S.A. to stop undermining commercial efforts to create better encryption technology.'b'One of his biggest lapses was his refusal to acknowledge that his entire speech, and all of the important changes he now advocates, would never have happened without the disclosures by Mr. Snowden, who continues to live in exile and under the threat of decades in prison if he returns to this country.'b'The president was right to acknowledge that leaders can no longer say, \xe2\x80\x9cTrust us, we won\xe2\x80\x99t abuse the data we collect.\xe2\x80\x9d But to earn back that trust, he should be forthright about what led Americans to be nervous about their own intelligence agencies, and he should build stronger protections to end those fears.'b'Enrollments in health insurance plans through state and federal exchanges are rising rapidly, especially among young adults, making it likely that the Affordable Care Act will achieve a large and stabilizing mix of enrollees by the end of the open enrollment period on March 31. Some 2.2 million people signed up in the first three months, from Oct. 1 through Dec. 28.'b'The Department of Health and Human Services reported on Monday that nearly a quarter of them were between the ages of 18 and 34, a group that many experts consider critical to the success of the exchanges because, on average, they are healthier and cheaper to insure than older Americans. One-third were 55 to 64 years old; enrollment in all age groups has been surging now that start-up glitches in the exchanges have largely been fixed.'b'Some commentators think 40 percent of the enrollees in the health exchange plans need to be in the younger group to keep premiums from spiking. That is a misconception. An 'b'analysis'b' last month by the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that even if that group was roughly 25 percent of the enrollment, it would keep premium increases relatively modest (perhaps 2.4 percent in 2015).'b'Exactly how the mix of age groups will affect premiums is hard to gauge, because it depends on what insurance companies expected. If enrollees in a plan are sicker than an insurer expected, that might lead the company to raise premiums for 2015. But competition among insurers to attract customers could also keep premiums down.'b'Because people no longer have to give their medical histories when they apply for insurance, nothing is yet known about the health status of people signing up. A survey by the Commonwealth Fund in December found that 77 percent of those who had visited the exchanges were in good, very good or excellent health, which bodes well for the balance of risks in the markets.'b'Young adults were always expected to sign up at the last minute. During December, the last month for enrolling in coverage that starts in January, there was an eightfold increase in young adults signing up, compared with October and November. A similar surge is expected in March, before penalties are imposed. The new numbers show that young and healthy people are beginning to realize that they, too, need good insurance.'b'In September 2012, as Gladys Puglla was thanking everyone for coming to a community organization board meeting, she blacked out from a stroke. It felt, she recalled, as if \xe2\x80\x9cmy soul was leaving my body.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She woke up at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. After surgery and a nine-day hospital stay, Ms. Puglla owed about $138,000 \xe2\x80\x94 after her health insurance paid its share of the medical bill.'b'There was no way Ms. Puglla, a clerical worker, could pay that astronomical amount on her $37,000 annual salary. The community organization where she volunteers, Make the Road New York, assigned a staff lawyer free of charge, and with help from the Community Service Society, a New York Times Neediest Cases Fund agency, negotiated with doctors and the hospital to reduce the balance to $6,900. After the Neediest Cases Fund agreed to pay $3,450, Cornell forgave the remainder. The fund also agreed to pay an ambulance bill of $1,020.'b'Clearing that medical debt was critically important, but Ms. Puglla still struggles with co-payments for continuing therapy, doctors\xe2\x80\x99 visits and medicine. Because of those bills, she has fallen behind on her rent and is battling eviction.'b'But that is another fight, she said. For now, she is back at work and getting back on her feet.'b'Donations to The Times\xe2\x80\x99s Neediest Cases Fund go to seven charities: Brooklyn Community Services; Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York; Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens; the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Aid Society; the Community Service Society of New York; the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies; and the UJA-Federation of New York.

You missed it, right? You were focused on the football playoffs or the Oscar nominations. Speaking of the Oscars, did you notice that this year there were people debating whether anybody got stiffed in the Best Song category? Really, if we can know about Best Song, we can have an opinion about the appropriations bill.'b'Plus, it\xe2\x80\x99s $1.1 trillion. One of the rules of good citizenship is to know how you feel about everything that costs more than a trillion dollars.'b'The bill is 1,582 pages long, but do not let that dissuade you. In the House debate, one member of the Appropriations Committee assured his colleagues that \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to what they may have heard, the bill has not only been read but ... every word and every number has been scrutinized.\xe2\x80\x9d You will notice that he said it\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'been read'b'. Not \xe2\x80\x9cwe all read it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'So, to summarize:'b'1. The Omnibus Spending Bill is not perfect.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis bill is not perfect,\xe2\x80\x9d said the House Appropriations chairman, Hal Rogers, during the debate. Repeatedly. Other members offered \xe2\x80\x9cnot a perfect bill,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthere are pros and cons\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cit could have been worse.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'While one of the main goals was to protect federal programs from more of the automatic killer cuts they suffered last year, we are still going to be spending less on nonentitlements \xe2\x80\x94 education, transportation, health, environmental protection \xe2\x80\x94 than we did under George W. Bush. And about half of the money goes for defense, some of it for weapons programs that even the Pentagon wants to cut. (We are looking at you, extremely sinkable, $32 billion Littoral Combat Ship.)'b'Head Start did great in the bill, but funding for the rest of education is sort of ... eh. The National Institutes of Health, which were really whacked over the last couple of years, got a lot of money restored, but not all.'b'We want more money for research and education and less for Littoral Combat Ships! Feel free to chant this during halftime at the Broncos versus Patriots game.'b'2. Compromise ruled.'b'Here is an example of a good compromise. The Republican right was allowed to continue its crusade against a Bush-era rule on energy-efficient light bulbs. It is hard to exaggerate how strongly some lawmakers feel about this matter. We will now pause to recall Senator Rand Paul\xe2\x80\x99s memorable rant about the evils of energy efficiency laws and how water conservation rules ruined his toilets. (\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting for 20 years to talk about how bad these toilets are.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'So the Obama administration gets no money to enforce the light bulb rules, which it didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to feel needed enforcing anyway. On the other hand, negotiators beat back an attempt by House Republicans to kill off energy efficiency standards for ceiling fans. This gives us a chance to recall the impassioned words of Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee on the subject. (\xe2\x80\x9cFirst they came for our health care. Then they took away our light bulbs ... now they are coming after our ceiling fans.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'Here is an example of a less-good compromise. Republicans give up the idea of killing off the Dodd-Frank reforms of the securities industry. Democrats give up the idea of giving the administration enough money to enforce them properly.'b'3. Tea Party loses.'b'By passing this spending bill, Congress averted a government shutdown. Did you even know there was one coming? We\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten so used to this stuff it\xe2\x80\x99s like the monthly office fire drill.'b'But many people in the far right were furious. It was a total defeat for the Tea Party\xe2\x80\x99s my-way-or-the-highway approach to politics. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one wants to shut the government down. My goodness, neither side wants to do that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Republican Richard Shelby of Alabama during the Senate debate. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is no good and the American people don\xe2\x80\x99t want it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Well, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas did. But he compromised and settled for giving a speech against Obamacare and then going away.'b'4. Women rule.'b'So what do you think? I\xe2\x80\x99d go for good news. No shutdown, a boost for preschool and cancer research. Congress is doing better than it\xe2\x80\x99s done since \xe2\x80\x94 since we started to really, really hate Congress.'b'In the Senate, the two major money committees, Appropriations and Budget, are now led by women: Barbara Mikulski and Patty Murray. This is not true in the House, where, as I have noted before, the only committee led by a woman is the one in charge of housekeeping.'b'Anyhow, this is the first time in three years that Congress has actually managed to pass both budget and appropriations bills. Maybe women are just better at getting along. Or maybe the secret is that Mikulski is a former social worker and Murray used to teach preschool.'b'TRUST is a double-edged sword. Though you can accomplish more in life if you put your faith in others, doing so also leaves you vulnerable. If your friend, business partner or political ally betrays you, he benefits \xe2\x80\x94 in terms of money, power or some other resource \xe2\x80\x94 at your expense. This risk is the drawback of trust, and it leads many people to prefer self-reliance, an arrangement that seems more secure because the only person you have to count on is yourself.'b'But can you really trust yourself more than others? Recent findings suggest that the answer is no.'b'To understand why, you first need to realize that trusting yourself actually does involve two people \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s just that they\xe2\x80\x99re both you. There is a 'b'present 'b'you and a 'b'future 'b'you. And while present-you may think that resisting a trip to the casino will be fairly easy in two weeks, future-you may not feel the same way when the time comes. Future-you, like anyone else, cannot always be trusted.'b'Such misplaced trust typically occurs because of two cognitive glitches. The first, identified by the psychologists Daniel Gilbert and Timothy Wilson, is that our predictions for how much we\xe2\x80\x99ll want something in the future are often swayed by how we\xe2\x80\x99re feeling right now. In one of their experiments, participants\xe2\x80\x99 expectations of what they\xe2\x80\x99d like to eat for breakfast tomorrow were principally influenced by how hungry they were today. Those who were very hungry believed they\xe2\x80\x99d be so hungry the next morning that they\xe2\x80\x99d even enjoy eating spaghetti for breakfast. Meanwhile, those who were not hungry believed they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel much of a need to eat spaghetti even for dinner, though in general they loved spaghetti. This tendency to give too much weight to extraneous momentary feelings poses a big problem when it comes to gauging the trustworthiness of future-you.'b'The second glitch is that your mind tends to discount the value of future rewards, meaning that as the time between you and a potential reward shrinks, your desire for it grows. The new iPhone that seems only mildly enticing now can be irresistible when it\xe2\x80\x99s sitting in front of you.'b'Put these two glitches together and the effect can be calamitous. While today you feel confident that you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to honor your planned monthly contribution to your retirement savings, window shopping at the Apple Store next week may change all that. The result? A broken promise to yourself.'b'The worst part is that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it coming. Which raises the question, why do we continue to trust ourselves? The answer resides in another type of cognitive bias. People generally like to think of themselves as trustworthy, so when their actions don\xe2\x80\x99t live up to that ideal, their minds simply erase the failure.'b'The psychologist Piercarlo Valdesolo and I have demonstrated this phenomenon in several experiments. In 'b'one of them'b', we gave participants a coin to flip that would determine whether they would have to complete an enjoyable task or an onerous one. We then left them \xe2\x80\x9calone\xe2\x80\x9d to flip it (while secretly monitoring them). Ninety percent of them did not flip the coin (or they kept flipping it until they got the answer they wanted) and unfairly assigned themselves the preferable task.'b'All the participants in our sample had earlier stated that cheating on the task would be immoral. But when evaluating their actions afterward, most not only continued to view themselves as fair even when they weren\xe2\x80\x99t, but also readily condemned others for cheating in the same way. Their minds quickly whitewashed their own untrustworthy actions. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t ignore what they did; they just created a story for why it was O.K.'b'You might wonder what purpose this psychological tendency to deceive ourselves about our own trustworthiness could serve. The answer is that, while it is useful to avoid working with other people who are untrustworthy, refusing to work with yourself is problematic. If you believe future-you can\xe2\x80\x99t be trusted, you\xe2\x80\x99ll never even try to plan for the long term. Why save for retirement or eat healthfully if you think future-you will exploit the benefits you give him? To succeed, we need hope to spring eternal. We have to believe that we\xe2\x80\x99re trustworthy.'b'But this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing we can do to nudge our future selves in the right direction. Today, mobile technology is helping to effectively transport our present selves \xe2\x80\x94 or at least our present intentions \xe2\x80\x94 ahead in time to remind our future selves how we want them to behave. Exercise and diet apps allow you to bring your present goals to your future self\xe2\x80\x99s attention; drunken-dialing-prevention apps keep your future self from succumbing to inebriated judgments. Such devices won\xe2\x80\x99t always ensure that you will comply, but they will at least remind you that you had a deal with yourself that you weren\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to break.'b'THE movie 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cJack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' which opens in theaters this weekend, revolves around an American C.I.A. analyst first introduced in Tom Clancy\xe2\x80\x99s 1984 novel \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hunt for Red October.\xe2\x80\x9d The source material isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only thing that\xe2\x80\x99s a little creaky. Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s destination is Moscow, his target a Russian businessman plotting to crash the American economy through a terrorist attack. In portraying the diabolical oligarch Viktor Cherevin, Kenneth Branagh delivers his lines in the thick, menacingly slow accent that defines Eastern European baddies on screen: \xe2\x80\x9cYou think this is game, Jack?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Nearly 25 years after the Berlin Wall fell and marked the end of the Cold War, Hollywood\xe2\x80\x99s go-to villains 'b'remain Russians'b'.

The space debris that imperils the American astronauts was caused by a Russian missile.'b'Meanwhile, on television, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Americans,\xe2\x80\x9d a cable drama about Soviet spies embedded in Reagan-era America, returns for a second season next month.'b'I suspect screenwriters and studio executives have deemed Russians to be politically safe villains. No advocacy group will protest. No foreign distribution deal will be nixed. Russian moviegoers here and abroad are probably inured to seeing themselves portrayed as Boris Badenovs on screen. Why make a TV show about modern-day surveillance and wiretapping when you can do a Red-scare period piece and offend or provoke no one?'b'Still, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make for as powerful drama as it once did. \xc2\xa0'b'If you grew up during the Cold War, you viewed Russians with a potent mix of hatred and fear, and felt in your gut that a nuclear war between our countries could erupt any second, obliterating everybody and everything. That\xe2\x80\x99s why movies like \xe2\x80\x9cThe Day After\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThreads\xe2\x80\x9d were so visceral. I doubt today\xe2\x80\x99s teenage moviegoers are walking around with the same mixed-up feelings about the Russians. Ivan Drago, the Soviet-bred fighting machine who battled Rocky Balboa in 1985, may have been absurd but he was a fall guy for his time. Has our pop culture not moved beyond \xe2\x80\x9cRocky IV\xe2\x80\x9d?'b'Movie villainy did become more globalized in the final days of the Cold War and afterward. You had South Africans (\xe2\x80\x9cLethal Weapon 2\xe2\x80\x9d), Germans (\xe2\x80\x9cDie Hard\xe2\x80\x9d), Palestinians (\xe2\x80\x9cTrue Lies\xe2\x80\x9d). Recently, Albanians (\xe2\x80\x9cTaken\xe2\x80\x9d) and Somalis (\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Phillips\xe2\x80\x9d) have entered the action-film fray. And Iranians have been featured in the Showtime TV series \xe2\x80\x9cHomeland.\xe2\x80\x9d But Russians remain our tried-and-true boogeymen, regardless of current politics. In the \xe2\x80\x9990s, Bill Clinton had a friendly relationship with Boris Yeltsin, and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so long ago that George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin shared bro time at the ranch in Crawford, Tex. \xe2\x80\x94 periods that brought us the nuclear showdown flick \xe2\x80\x9cCrimson Tide,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMiracle,\xe2\x80\x9d about the United States victory over the Russian hockey team at the 1980 Olympics.'b'The Russian government hasn\xe2\x80\x99t helped to soften its bad-guy image. Recent decisions like granting Edward Snowden asylum and supporting President Bashar al-Assad of Syria are reminders that Russia still takes positions antagonistic toward the United States.

And as the world gears up for the Winter Olympics in Sochi next month, concerns surround Russia\xe2\x80\x99s political motives and human rights record.'b'Nonetheless, the Slavic bad guy has become a movie clich\xc3\xa9, and like all clich\xc3\xa9s it lacks its former power.'b'Hollywood, we\xe2\x80\x99re increasingly reminded, makes movies for a worldwide audience. Two of the greatest global threats of our time \xe2\x80\x94 terrorism and a financial Armageddon \xe2\x80\x94 are frightening, complicated subjects perfect for action thrillers. This time out, though, the filmmakers behind \xe2\x80\x9cJack Ryan: Shadow Recruit\xe2\x80\x9d may have chosen the right subject but the wrong villain. After all, the American economy did crash. But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the Russians who did it.'b'STATE COLLEGE, Pa. \xe2\x80\x94 THE overwhelming consensus among climate scientists is that human-caused climate change is happening. Yet a fringe minority of our populace clings to an irrational rejection of well-established science. This virulent strain of anti-science infects the halls of Congress, the pages of leading newspapers and what we see on TV, leading to the appearance of a debate where none should exist.'b'In fact, there is broad agreement among climate scientists not only that climate change is real (a survey and a review of the scientific literature published say about 97 percent agree), but that we must respond to the dangers of a warming planet. If one is looking for real differences among mainstream scientists, they can be found on two fronts: the precise implications of those higher temperatures, and which technologies and policies offer the best solution to reducing, on a global scale, the emission of greenhouse gases.'b'For example, should we go full-bore on nuclear power? Invest in and deploy renewable energy \xe2\x80\x94 wind, solar and geothermal \xe2\x80\x94 on a huge scale? Price carbon emissions through cap-and-trade legislation or by imposing a carbon tax? Until the public fully understands the danger of our present trajectory, those debates are likely to continue to founder.'b'This is where scientists come in. In my view, it is no longer acceptable for scientists to remain on the sidelines. I should know. I had no choice but to enter the fray. I was hounded by elected officials, threatened with violence and more \xe2\x80\x94 after a single study I co-wrote a decade and a half ago found that the Northern Hemisphere\xe2\x80\x99s average warmth had no precedent in at least the past 1,000 years. Our \xe2\x80\x9chockey stick\xe2\x80\x9d graph became a vivid centerpiece of the climate wars, and to this day, it continues to win me the enmity of those who have conflated a problem of science and society with partisan politics.'b'So what should scientists do? At one end of the spectrum, you have the distinguished former director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, James Hansen, who has turned to civil disobedience to underscore the dangers he sees. He was arrested in 2009 protesting mountaintop removal coal mining, then again in 2011 and 2013 in Washington protesting the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to the Texas Gulf. He has warned that the pipeline, which awaits approval by the State Department, would open the floodgates to dirty tar sands oil from Canada, something he says would be \xe2\x80\x9cgame over for the climate.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Dr. Hansen recently published an article in the journal PLoS One with the economist Jeffrey Sachs, director of Columbia\xe2\x80\x99s Earth Institute, and other scientists, making a compelling case that emissions from fossil fuel burning must be reduced rapidly if we are to avert catastrophic climate change. They called for the immediate introduction of a price on carbon emissions, arguing that it is our moral obligation to not leave a degraded planet behind for our children and grandchildren.'b'This activist approach has concerned some scientists, even those who have been outspoken on climate change. One of them, Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution for Science, who has argued that \xe2\x80\x9cthe only ethical path is to stop using the atmosphere as a waste dump for greenhouse gas pollution,\xe2\x80\x9d expressed concern about the \xe2\x80\x9cpresentation of such a prescriptive and value-laden work\xe2\x80\x9d in a paper not labeled opinion.'b'Are Dr. Hansen and his colleagues going too far? Should we resist commenting on the implications of our science? There was a time when I would, without hesitation, have answered \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d to this question. In 2003, when asked in a Senate hearing to comment on a matter of policy, I readily responded that \xe2\x80\x9cI am not a specialist in public policy\xe2\x80\x9d and it would not \xe2\x80\x9cbe useful for me to testify on that.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It is not an uncommon view among scientists that we potentially compromise our objectivity if we choose to wade into policy matters or the societal implications of our work. And it would be problematic if our views on policy somehow influenced the way we went about doing our science. But there is nothing inappropriate at all about drawing on our scientific knowledge to speak out about the very real implications of our research.'b'My colleague Stephen Schneider of Stanford University, who died in 2010, used to say that being a scientist-advocate is not an oxymoron. Just because we are scientists does not mean that we should check our citizenship at the door of a public meeting, he would explain. The New Republic once called him a \xe2\x80\x9cscientific pugilist\xe2\x80\x9d for advocating a forceful approach to global warming. But fighting for scientific truth and an informed debate is nothing to apologize for.'b'If scientists choose not to engage in the public debate, we leave a vacuum that will be filled by those whose agenda is one of short-term self-interest. There is a great cost to society if scientists fail to participate in the larger conversation \xe2\x80\x94 if we do not do all we can to ensure that the policy debate is informed by an honest assessment of the risks. In fact, it would be an abrogation of our responsibility to society if we remained quiet in the face of such a grave threat.'b'This is hardly a radical position. Our Department of Homeland Security has urged citizens to report anything dangerous they witness: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you see something, say something.\xe2\x80\x9d We scientists are citizens, too, and, in climate change, we see a clear and present danger.

It confirmed that the sooner we act, the less it will cost.'b'How will history judge us if we watch the threat unfold before our eyes, but fail to communicate the urgency of acting to avert potential disaster? How would I explain to the future children of my 8-year-old daughter that their grandfather saw the threat, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak up in time?'b'Those are the stakes.'b'The Middle East was much in the news these past days, with all its maddening ambiguities and conflicts on full display.'b'It began with the funeral of Ariel Sharon, at which the tributes seemed the start of his transformation from scarred veteran of military and political wars into Israeli folk hero. Yet the remarkable saga of the real \xe2\x80\x9cArik\xe2\x80\x9d Sharon was of an alternately vilified and lionized leader whose personal history was inextricably intertwined with the history of the Jewish state, and as complex.'b'Then on Tuesday and Wednesday the Egyptians were called on for yet another vote, this one a referendum on a new constitution backed by the military rulers. The result was preordained to be \xe2\x80\x9cyes,\xe2\x80\x9d but the turnout was a mere 37 percent, only slightly higher than the 33 percent the Muslim Brotherhood had corralled for its constitution 13 months earlier, before it was ousted and outlawed once again.'b'In the United States on Friday, President Obama announced important new restrictions on the collection of information about ordinary Americans. He called for more oversight of the intelligence community and acknowledged that intrusive forms of technology threaten civil liberties.'b'Two other developments of the week brought to mind the French adage, \xe2\x80\x9cplus \xc3\xa7a change, plus c\xe2\x80\x99est la m\xc3\xaame chose.\xe2\x80\x9d One was the revelation that Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande was having an affair. That put Mr. Hollande in bed with nearly every other French president since Charles de Gaulle, but Mr. Hollande\xe2\x80\x99s problem is that he also has lower popularity ratings than any of those presidents and has not put much of a dent in France\xe2\x80\x99s stubbornly high unemployment.'b'On the weather front, a new draft report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations panel of climate experts, said that time was running out to deal with climate change by reducing carbon emissions. The choice was between some economic pain now, the panel effectively said, or a whole lot more if nothing is done in the next 15 years. After that, the world will be obliged to prevent terrible consequences by developing costly ways of wringing greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere.

But such was his extraordinary life, and so closely did it parallel the birth and rise of the Jewish state, that the testimonies have not stopped flowing.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe symbolized the anguish and dilemmas of Israel,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Henry A. Kissinger, who was among many American statesmen to tangle with the Israeli \xe2\x80\x9cBulldozer.\xe2\x80\x9d Uri Avnery, an Israeli of Mr. Sharon\xe2\x80\x99s generation who parted ways with him when Mr. Avnery founded the peace movement, compared Mr. Sharon to a Roman emperor in an article distributed by email: \xe2\x80\x9cSharon was a supreme being, admired and feared, generous and cruel, genial and treacherous, hedonistic and corrupt, a victorious general and a war criminal, quick to make decisions and unwavering once he had made them, overcoming all obstacles by sheer force of personality.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Grievously wounded in the 1948 Israeli war of independence, Mr. Sharon survived to play a critical role in subsequent Israeli wars. That became the pattern of his military and political life: brilliant in his successes, he would be undone by arrogance and insubordination and would retreat until called up again. His end was fully in character: felled by a stroke in January 2006, he lay in a coma for eight years before dying.'b'I met Mr. Sharon when I interviewed him in the elegant stone house of his ranch in the northern Negev, in May 1996, shortly before national elections on which hinged the fate of the Oslo accords, signed three years earlier. Mr. Sharon, fiercely opposed to Oslo, appeared not to understand why President Bill Clinton did not see things his way. \xe2\x80\x9cI and my wife, we sleep with a gun under our bed,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Sharon declared. \xe2\x80\x9cI say with a full heart that the American president does not sleep with a gun under his bed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The security of the Jews was Mr. Sharon\xe2\x80\x99s guiding principle. \xe2\x80\x9cI understand war and peace. But for me peace means security,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t provide security for the state of Israel now and in the future, I don\xe2\x80\x99t regard it as peace.\xe2\x80\x9d Security justified ruthless measures; security justified the Israeli settlements on the West Bank that Mr. Sharon was instrumental in building; but when he believed that security was better served by pulling back, he did that, first in Sinai, then Gaza.'b'We will never know whether the Middle East would look different today if Mr. Sharon had been around the past eight years. But Secretary of State John Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to secure a \xe2\x80\x9cframework\xe2\x80\x9d for a final Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement seemed a mournful echo of the many frameworks and road maps pushed by many secretaries of state past. Moshe Yaalon, the Israeli defense minister, prompted an embarrassed round of apologies when a newspaper reported that he had said Mr. Kerry was \xe2\x80\x9cacting out of misplaced obsession and messianic fervor.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The real question was how widely that sentiment was shared in Benjamin Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s government, which, shortly after Mr. Kerry left, had announced plans for 1,400 new homes in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.'b''b'Egyptian Vote'b''b'The official subject of the Egyptian referendum was a new draft constitution, and there was little doubt that it would pass. But the vote had more to do with validating the military\xe2\x80\x99s ouster of t President Mohamed Morsi, of the Muslim Brotherhood, in July, and the likely presidential bid by the military leader, Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi. The turnout was not high, but the vote was expected to be a landslide \xe2\x80\x9cyes,\xe2\x80\x9d given that the referendum was boycotted by the Brotherhood, which has been declared a terrorist organization, and by many of the young activists involved in the original Tahrir Square protests of 2011.'b'The new constitution eliminates some of the Islamist elements of the one Mr. Morsi pushed through, but it enhances the power and autonomy of the military, the police and the judiciary, clearing the way for the kind of authoritarian system that the 2011 activists thought they had gotten rid of.'b'In another sad postscript to the Arab Spring, the United States Senate Intelligence Committee issued a report grimly critical of the State Department for the lack of security that led to the sacking of the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012, and the deaths of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The bipartisan report was broadly in line with earlier findings, but its bottom line was wrenching: \xe2\x80\x9cthe attacks were preventable.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'One of the most laudable American goals in negotiating the trade agreement known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership with 11 other countries was to strengthen environmental protections around the world. But a draft chapter of the agreement 'b'made public'b' last week 'b'by WikiLeaks'b' shows that many of the countries involved in the talks are trying to undermine that goal.'b'American negotiators have sought to make the environmental provisions in the agreement enforceable through a dispute settlement process, an idea that most of the other countries appear to oppose. That list includes countries like Canada, Australia and New Zealand that might have been expected to play a more constructive role.'b'The disagreement is a reminder that this trade agreement is more complex \xe2\x80\x94 and in many ways more ambitious \xe2\x80\x94 than most. Unlike other agreements that are concerned mainly with lowering import tariffs and quotas, these talks are also trying to set common legal and regulatory standards in areas like the environment, intellectual property, labor rights and state-owned companies.'b'If done right, agreement on these issues should ease fears that freer trade would lead to greater environmental damage and sweatshop conditions by giving businesses an incentive to ship production and jobs to countries with lower standards. But winning agreement is difficult when a large and diverse group of countries is involved. The other partners are Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei, Singapore, Mexico, Chile and Peru.'b'American negotiators began including enforceable environmental standards in trade agreements in 2007 as part of a 'b'deal'b' between the Bush administration and Senate Democrats. Since then, American trade agreements have asked trading partners 'b'not to weaken'b' their environmental laws and required them to 'b'carry out commitments'b' they had already made under treaties like the Montreal Protocol, which aims to protect the ozone layer, and a 'b'convention'b' on the trade of endangered species and wild plants and animals.'b'The Pacific nations are now pushing for a process in which nations would consult with one another about environmental disputes and come up with plans to address them. But it would not include penalties, as the American proposal would. Even as some Trans-Pacific Partnership countries are rejecting binding commitments on environmental issues, they seem perfectly willing to include such provisions in other areas, including rules governing expropriation in which a state seizes the property of private businesses.'b'The Office of the United States Trade Representative 'b'said'b' last week that it would not back down on its environmental agenda. In a statement, it said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will insist on a robust, fully enforceable environment chapter in the T.P.P. or we will not come to agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It is important that American negotiators stick to that policy. And members of Congress, who have to ratify all trade deals, should insist on it.'b'Ann Cavoukian is the information and privacy commissioner in Ontario, Canada, and a longtime advocate of default online confidentiality.

Because we have only two parties, because those parties are ideologically disciplined, and because everyone is obsessed with the other side\xe2\x80\x99s unrighteousness, there\xe2\x80\x99s a sense that if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t fully on board with an existing partisan agenda, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have any business getting mixed up in the debate.'b'There is an exception for rich people who wish Michael Bloomberg could be president: they get to have gushing articles written about their boring, implausible third-party fantasies every four years. Everyone else is out of luck. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a consistent libertarian, Naderite left-winger or social conservative who\xe2\x80\x99s also an economic populist, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to make the case for your ideas; you must perpetually explain why, in the absence of a Libertarian Party or a Socialist Party or a Mike Huckabee presidential run, anyone should even care that you exist.'b'And for the last few years, this same suspicion has attached itself to what had heretofore been a more mainstream group: conservative policy thinkers.'b'The conservative policy larder was genuinely bare by the end of the Bush presidency. But that changed, reasonably swiftly, across President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s first term. A new journal, National Affairs, edited by Yuval Levin, began incubating alternatives to a re-ascendant liberalism. The older magazines and think tanks were reinvigorated, and played host to increasingly lively policy debates. And a new generation of conservative thinkers coalesced: James Capretta and Avik Roy on health care, Brad Wilcox and Kay Hymowitz on social policy, Ramesh Ponnuru on taxes and monetary policy, James Pethokoukis on financial regulation, Reihan Salam on all of the above, and many others.'b'By 2012, it was possible to discern the outlines of a plausible right-of-center agenda on domestic polity \xe2\x80\x94 a new \xe2\x80\x9creform conservatism,\xe2\x80\x9d if you will.'b'But the Republican Party simply wasn\xe2\x80\x99t interested.'b'Reform conservatism did have one partial champion in Paul Ryan, who co-sponsored the only plausible Obamacare alternative in Congress, and whose evolving Medicare proposal drew on ideas Levin and others had proposed. But Ryan was defined (and mostly defined himself) as Mr. Austerity rather than Mr. Reform. The rest of the party, meanwhile, was consumed by a Tea Party vs. Establishment rivalry that had a policy substrate but was just as often about posturing and score-settling.'b'And then came the Romney campaign, about whose substance the less said the better.'b'So a question has hovered over the would-be 'b'conservative reformers'b': If their ideas lack Republican champions, do they actually matter? Are they even worthy of debate? Or is reform conservatism basically a curiosity, an irrelevancy, a kind of center-right Naderism?'b'Which is why the most consequential recent development for the G.O.P. might not actually be Chris Christie\xe2\x80\x99s traffic scandal. It might, instead, be the fact that reform conservatism suddenly has national politicians in its corner.'b'The first is Mike Lee, the junior Senator from Utah, who has pivoted from leading the defund-Obamacare movement to basically becoming a one-stop shop for provocative reform ideas: in the last six months, his office has proposed a new 'b'family-friendly tax reform'b', reached across the aisle to work on 'b'criminal justice'b' issues and offered significant new proposals on 'b'transportation'b' and 'b'higher education reform'b'.'b'The second is Marco Rubio, whose'b' speech'b' two weeks ago on the anniversary of the declaration of the war on poverty called for two major changes to the safety net: first, pooling federal antipoverty programs into a single fund that would allow more flexibility for state experiments; and second, replacing the earned-income tax credit with a direct wage subsidy designed to offer more help to low-income, single men.'b'Taken together, Lee\xe2\x80\x99s and Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s proposals are already more interesting and promising than almost anything Republicans campaigned on in 2012 \xe2\x80\x94 and there may be more to come, from them and perhaps from Ryan as well.'b'Of course these ideas coexist, as liberals have been quick to point out, with a congressional party that\xe2\x80\x99s still wedded to opposition, austerity and not much else. But the Republican Party\xe2\x80\x99s problems were never going to be solved from the House of Representatives, any more than House Democrats could rescue their party from its Reagan-era wilderness. The more likely solution for the G.O.P. has always required a two-step process: rising-star politicians coalesce around a new agenda; then a winning presidential candidate puts it into effect.'b'Which may not happen in this case \xe2\x80\x94 because the party\xe2\x80\x99s base may be too rejectionist, because Hillary Clinton may actually be unstoppable no matter what her rival\xe2\x80\x99s platform says, because two senators do not a reformist moment make.'b'But for conservative policy reformers, there\xe2\x80\x99s an unfamiliar feeling in the air: It\xe2\x80\x99s as if, for the first time in many years, their perspective actually exists.'b'Only seven months after the Supreme Court shattered the Voting Rights Act, a bipartisan group of lawmakers has 'b'come up with a bill'b' that would go a long way toward putting it back together. If they can persuade Republicans in Congress to set aside partisanship and allow it to pass, they would begin to restore justice to a deeply damaged electoral process. It would be an ideal way to observe the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\xe2\x80\x99s birthday this week.'b'The bill is far from perfect. In particular, it does not give enough weight to the discriminatory effect of voter ID laws. But it would make it more difficult for states and localities to take other actions that reduce minority voting rights. Jurisdictions would once again be put under Justice Department supervision if they committed multiple violations of the Constitution.'b'All states and cities would be required to make public any last-minute changes to election practices, an improvement over current law, which requires such public notice in just a few states. And the bill would make it easier to stop harmful voting changes in court before they happen.'b'The Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision last June struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, which set the formula that determined which states and localities, based on their histories of discrimination, were required to get preapproval for voting changes from the Justice Department. The court\xe2\x80\x99s majority ruled that the formula was obsolete, imposing a burden on states without proof that they still discriminate. The court invited Congress to come up with a new formula.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s what 'b'the new bill'b' does. Any state that has committed five or more election violations in a 15-year period, as determined by a court, would fall under federal supervision of voting changes. Cities and counties would be supervised if they committed three violations in 15 years, or if they committed a single violation and had persistently low minority turnout during that period. That supervision would allow the Justice Department to block newly imposed voter ID requirements.'b'Under the proposed formula, Justice Department oversight would currently apply to only four states: Georgia, Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi. It would not apply to states like North Carolina, which in addition to imposing harsh voter ID requirements has also made voting more difficult in other ways, like restricting early voting or same-day registration. Those practices have not been ruled as constitutional violations by a court, in part because getting such a ruling is a difficult legal process.'b'The bill would permit courts to require federal supervision of a jurisdiction if a voting change has a discriminatory effect on a minority group, whether or not the effect is intentional. That would be an enormously important improvement over current law. Plaintiffs now are required to show that a state or city intended to discriminate, a difficult burden even when the effect is clear, particularly when politicians create phony justifications for their actions.'b'But voter ID laws are exempted from this provision, and could not be cited in a lawsuit as a reason for a court to \xe2\x80\x9cbail in\xe2\x80\x9d a state or locality to federal supervision. This is an alarming flaw, particularly in light of the important 'b'decision'b' last Friday by a Pennsylvania judge, who ruled that the state\xe2\x80\x99s voter ID law violated Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental right to vote and had no legitimate purpose in fighting fraud.'b'The bill is sponsored by Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, and Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, among others, and several members from both parties have pledged to support it. Mr. Sensenbrenner said he was trying to persuade the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, to allow a vote on the bill, and said that he had to \xe2\x80\x9cjump through hoops\xe2\x80\x9d to garner Republican support.'b'The deletion of voter ID laws from the list of discriminatory violations is a steep price to pay for that support. This bill is a good step forward, but those who care about extending democracy to every corner of the country should not give up hope of making it even better.'b'SALT LAKE CITY \xe2\x80\x94 IT\xe2\x80\x99S hard to imagine anything more painful than going through the presidential campaign all over again with Mitt Romney.'b'Unless it\xe2\x80\x99s going through two presidential campaigns with Mitt Romney.'b'But, yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s the narrative of a new buzzed-about documentary that had its world premiere here on Friday night at the Sundance Film Festival.'b'Those who have seen \xe2\x80\x9cMitt\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 which debuts on Netflix on Friday \xe2\x80\x94 are agog that filmmaker Greg Whiteley has accomplished what Romney himself, the gleaming, ever-replicating Romney clan and the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s high-priced political strategists could not: Willard Mitt Romney seems all too human.'b'He wells up. He prays with his family, kneeling on the floor of hotel rooms, and plays with them in the snow.

He stays calm when he learns Obama is winning re-election: \xe2\x80\x9cWow, that\xe2\x80\x99s too bad,\xe2\x80\x9d he tells an aide on the phone. \xe2\x80\x9cAll those states, huh?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Drawn no doubt by word of the miraculous cinematic oil can for the Tin Man, Mitt came to see \xe2\x80\x9cMitt\xe2\x80\x9d for the first time last Friday night. Maybe Romney sees the film less as a eulogy than a prologue. There are rumors in Republican circles that he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about another run.'b'A Republican fund-raising operative even told BuzzFeed that donors are so worried about 2016 now, many tell him, \xe2\x80\x9cI think we need Mitt back.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It seems preposterous that we\xe2\x80\x99d go through a third Romney run, but with Chris Christie imploding and Barbara Bush denouncing dynasties and shooing Jeb out of the race, maybe the 66-year-old sees an opening. Maybe he no longer feels, as he tells his family in the film on election night in 2012, stoically writing his concession speech, \xe2\x80\x9cMy time on the stage is over, guys.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The movie spans from Christmastime 2006, with the family gathered to make a decision on whether Mitt should run in 2008, to after the 2012 election, when he says goodbye to his Secret Service detail and returns to his empty suburban Boston home, sadly staring out the window.'b'I dread to think what was going through Romney\xe2\x80\x99s mind as he watched a movie that made him more appealing than any of his campaign ads or his own convention, even though he paid Stuart Stevens and his other 2012 advisers ridiculously more than the winning politicos who delivered a second term for Barack Obama were paid.'b'But Whiteley, a charming 44-year-old Mormon documentarian who brought along his adorable blond kids \xe2\x80\x94 12-year-old son, Henry, and 10-year-old daughter, Scout \xe2\x80\x94 to his press interviews, was trying to reveal Mitt, while Romney\xe2\x80\x99s handlers were trying to obscure Mitt.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cStuart Stevens\xe2\x80\x99s feeling was that Mitt Romney was a fish out of water,\xe2\x80\x9d Alex Castellanos, a 2008 Romney adviser who crossed swords with Stevens in that campaign, told me. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was a Northerner in a Southern party. He was a centrist in a conservative party. He was an elite in a rural party. Stuart didn\xe2\x80\x99t think he could sell Mitt Romney in the primaries.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cStuart thought that every day spent talking about Mitt Romney was a losing day and every day spent talking about Barack Obama was a winning day. It was criminal.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Romney was able to relax around his fellow Mormon, Whiteley, enough to seem less awkward and strange, but he\xe2\x80\x99s still in the bubble of his faith and family, seemingly cloistered from the world of average Americans.'b'The film glosses over one of the turning points in the campaign, the 47 percent fiasco. \xe2\x80\x9cI was insecure about that,\xe2\x80\x9d Whiteley admitted to me, noting that Romney didn\xe2\x80\x99t give him a more lucid explanation than he gave the press.'b'It also glides over the bad symbolism of building a four-car garage elevator at his La Jolla house, which Stevens told Romney would be fine.'b'And while Romney offers a portrait of a man reluctantly drawn into politics because he thinks it is his duty to save the nation from people like Obama, who \xe2\x80\x9chave not been in a setting where you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to make it,\xe2\x80\x9d he never really explains how he would save it or gives any clue to the Vision Thing, except murmuring about high taxes on small businesses.'b'In the end, despite all the campaign artifice and the brutal process, we do get to know the candidates in some primal way.'b'The fact that Romney allowed his strategists to keep a fence around him and his faith, which is so central to his life, the fact that he basically had nothing to say about where he wanted to lead the country, the fact that the private equity leecher spoke so dismissively about the 47 percent of people he regarded as moochers, the fact that this supposedly top-notch businessman did not seem to realize his campaign was using 20th-century technology \xe2\x80\x94 all of this spoke to a certain tentativeness, obtuseness and callousness.'b'But there\xe2\x80\x99s always 2016.'b'PRESIDENT OBAMA will deliver his State of the Union address on Jan. 28, but, for my money, his secretary of education, Arne Duncan, already gave it. Just not enough people heard it.'b'So instead of Obama fishing around for contrived ideas to put in his speech \xe2\x80\x94 the usual laundry list that wins applause but no action \xe2\x80\x94 the president should steal Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s speech and claim it as his own (I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell) because it was not a laundry list and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a feel-good speech. In fact, it was a feel-bad speech, asking one big question. Are we falling behind as a country in education not just because we fail to recruit the smartest college students to become teachers or reform-resistant teachers\xe2\x80\x99 unions, but because of our culture today: too many parents and too many kids just don\xe2\x80\x99t take education seriously enough and don\xe2\x80\x99t want to put in the work needed today to really excel?'b'Is this the key cause of income inequality and persistent poverty? No. But it is surely part of their solutions, and it is a subject that Obama has not used his bully pulpit to address in any sustained way. Nothing could spark a national discussion of this more than a State of the Union address.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s speech in a moment, but, if you think he\xe2\x80\x99s exaggerating, listen to some teachers. Here are the guts of 'b'a letter published'b' recently by The Washington Post from a veteran seventh-grade language arts teacher in Frederick, Md., who explained why she no longer wants to teach. (She asked to remain anonymous.)'b'After complaining about the \xe2\x80\x9csuperficial curriculum that encouraged mindless conformity,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cI decided that if I was going to teach this nonsense, I was at least going to teach it well. I set my expectations high, I kept my classroom structured, I tutored students, I provided extra practice and I tried to make class fun. ... I quickly rose through the ranks of \xe2\x80\x98favorite teacher,\xe2\x80\x99 kept open communication channels with parents and had many students with solid A\xe2\x80\x99s. It was about this time that I was called down to the principal\xe2\x80\x99s office. ... She handed me a list of about 10 students, all of whom had D\xe2\x80\x99s or F\xe2\x80\x99s. At the time, I only had about 120 students, so I was relatively on par with a standard bell curve. As she brought up each one, I walked her through my grade sheets that showed not low scores but a failure to turn in work \xe2\x80\x94 a lack of responsibility. I showed her my tutoring logs, my letters to parents, only to be interrogated further.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEventually, the meeting came down to two quotes that I will forever remember as the defining slogans for public education: \xe2\x80\x98They are not allowed to fail.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98If they have D\xe2\x80\x99s or F\xe2\x80\x99s, there is something that you are not doing for them.\xe2\x80\x99 What am I not doing for them? I suppose I was not giving them the answers. I was not physically picking up their hands to write for them. I was not following them home each night to make sure they did their work on time. I was not excusing their lack of discipline. ... Teachers are held to impossible standards, and students are accountable for hardly any part of their own education and are incapable of failing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I got an almost identical letter last month from a high school teacher in Oregon: \xe2\x80\x9cUntil about 1992, I would have at least one kid in every class who simply wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything. \xc2\xa0A bad class might have two.\xc2\xa0Today I have 10 to 15. I recently looked back at my old exams from the \xe2\x80\x9980s.\xc2\xa0These were tough, comprehensive ones without the benefit of notes. Few would pass them today. \xc2\xa0We are dumbing down our classes. \xc2\xa0It is an inexorable downward progression in which one day all a kid will need to pass is to have a blood pressure. The kids today are\xc2\xa0not different in \xe2\x80\x98nature.\xe2\x80\x99 ... The difference is that back then, although they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to, they would do the work. Today, they won\xe2\x80\x99t. ... This is a real conversation I had with a failing student who was being quite sincere in her comments: \xe2\x80\x98I know you\xe2\x80\x99re a really good teacher, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to realize I have two hours a night of Facebook and over 4,000 text messages a month to deal with. How do you expect me to do all this work?\xe2\x80\x99 When I collect homework at the beginning of class, it is standard out of a class of 35, to receive only 8 to 10 assignments. If I didn\xe2\x80\x99t give half-credit for late work, I think most would fail.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Now you have some idea why 'b'Duncan gave this speech'b' to the National Assessment Governing Board\xe2\x80\x99s Education Summit for Parent Leaders. Here\xe2\x80\x99s an excerpt:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn 2009, President Obama met with President Lee of South Korea and asked him about his biggest challenge in education. President Lee answered without hesitation: parents in South Korea were \xe2\x80\x98too demanding.\xe2\x80\x99 Even his poorest parents demanded a world-class education for their children, and he was having to spend millions of dollars each year to teach English to students in first grade, because his parents won\xe2\x80\x99t let him wait until second grade. ... I [wish] our biggest challenge here in the U.S. was too many parents demanding excellent schools.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI want to pose one simple question to you: Does a child in South Korea deserve a better education than your child?\xe2\x80\x9d Duncan continued. \xe2\x80\x9cIf your answer is no ... then your work is cut out for you. Because right now, South Korea \xe2\x80\x94 and quite a few other countries \xe2\x80\x94 are offering students more, and demanding more, than many American districts and schools do. And the results are showing, in our kids\xe2\x80\x99 learning and in their opportunities to succeed, and in staggeringly large achievement gaps in this country. Doing something about our underperformance will mean raising your voice \xe2\x80\x94 and encouraging parents who aren\xe2\x80\x99t as engaged as you to speak up. Parents have the power to challenge educational complacency here at home. Parents have the power to ask more of their leaders \xe2\x80\x94 and to ask more of their kids.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Citing 'b'Amanda Ripley\xe2\x80\x99s new book'b' \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cThe Smartest Kids in the World, and How They Got That Way\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Duncan said, \xe2\x80\x9cAmanda points a finger at you and me, as parents \xe2\x80\x94 not because we aren\xe2\x80\x99t involved in school, but because too often, we are involved in the wrong way. Parents, she says, are happy to show up at sports events, video camera in hand, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll come to school to protest a bad grade. But she writes, and I quote: \xe2\x80\x98Parents did not tend to show up at schools demanding that their kids be assigned more challenging reading or that their kindergartners learn math while they still loved numbers.\xe2\x80\x99 ... To really help our kids, we have to do so much more as parents. We have to change expectations about how hard kids should work. And we have to work with teachers and leaders to create schools that demand more from our kids.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Now that\xe2\x80\x99s a State of the Union speech the country needs to hear \xe2\x80\x94 and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forget.'b'IN my last year on Wall Street my bonus was $3.6 million \xe2\x80\x94 and I was angry because it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t big enough. I was 30 years old, had no children to raise, no debts to pay, no philanthropic goal in mind. I wanted more money for exactly the same reason an alcoholic needs another drink: I was addicted.'b'Eight years earlier, I\xe2\x80\x99d walked onto the trading floor at Credit Suisse First Boston to begin my summer internship. I already knew I wanted to be rich, but when I started out I had a different idea about what wealth meant. I\xe2\x80\x99d come to Wall Street after reading in the book \xe2\x80\x9cLiar\xe2\x80\x99s Poker\xe2\x80\x9d how Michael Lewis earned a $225,000 bonus after just two years of work on a trading floor. That seemed like a fortune. Every January and February, I think about that time, because these are the months when bonuses are decided and distributed, when fortunes are made.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99d learned about the importance of being rich from my dad. He was a modern-day Willy Loman, a salesman with huge dreams that never seemed to materialize. \xe2\x80\x9cImagine what life will be like,\xe2\x80\x9d he\xe2\x80\x99d say, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I make a million dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d While he dreamed of selling a screenplay, in reality he sold kitchen cabinets. And not that well. We sometimes lived paycheck to paycheck off my mom\xe2\x80\x99s nurse-practitioner salary.'b'Dad believed money would solve all his problems. At 22, so did I. When I walked onto that trading floor for the first time and saw the glowing flat-screen TVs, high-tech computer monitors and phone turrets with enough dials, knobs and buttons to make it seem like the cockpit of a fighter plane, I knew exactly what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. It looked as if the traders were playing a video game inside a spaceship; if you won this video game, you became what I most wanted to be \xe2\x80\x94 rich.'b'IT was a miracle I\xe2\x80\x99d made it to Wall Street at all. While I was competitive and ambitious \xe2\x80\x94 a wrestler at Columbia University \xe2\x80\x94 I was also a daily drinker and pot smoker and a regular user of cocaine, Ritalin and ecstasy. I had a propensity for self-destruction that had resulted in my getting suspended from Columbia for burglary, arrested twice and fired from an Internet company for fistfighting. I learned about rage from my dad, too. I can still see his red, contorted face as he charged toward me. I\xe2\x80\x99d lied my way into the C.S.F.B. internship by omitting my transgressions from my r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 and was determined not to blow what seemed a final chance. The only thing as important to me as that internship was my girlfriend, a starter on the Columbia volleyball team. But even though I was in love with her, when I got drunk I\xe2\x80\x99d sometimes end up with other women.'b'Three weeks into my internship she wisely dumped me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like who you\xe2\x80\x99ve become, she said. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t blame her, but I was so devastated that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get out of bed. In desperation, I called a counselor whom I had reluctantly seen a few times before and asked for help.'b'She helped me see that I was using alcohol and drugs to blunt the powerlessness I felt as a kid and suggested I give them up. That began some of the hardest months of my life. Without the alcohol and drugs in my system, I felt like my chest had been cracked open, exposing my heart to air. The counselor said that my abuse of drugs and alcohol was a symptom of an underlying problem \xe2\x80\x94 a \xe2\x80\x9cspiritual malady,\xe2\x80\x9d she called it. C.S.F.B. didn\xe2\x80\x99t offer me a full-time job, and I returned, distraught, to Columbia for senior year.'b'After graduation, I got a job at Bank of America, by the grace of a managing director willing to take a chance on a kid who had called him every day for three weeks. With a year of sobriety under my belt, I was sharp, cleareyed and hard-working. At the end of my first year I was thrilled to receive a $40,000 bonus. For the first time in my life, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to check my balance before I withdrew money. But a week later, a trader who was only four years my senior got hired away by C.S.F.B. for $900,000. After my initial envious shock \xe2\x80\x94 his haul was 22 times the size of my bonus \xe2\x80\x94 I grew excited at how much money was available.'b'Over the next few years I worked like a maniac and began to move up the Wall Street ladder. I became a bond and credit default swap trader, one of the more lucrative roles in the business. Just four years after I started at Bank of America, Citibank offered me a \xe2\x80\x9c1.75 by 2\xe2\x80\x9d which means $1.75 million per year for two years, and I used it to get a promotion. I started dating a pretty blonde and rented a loft apartment on Bond Street for $6,000 a month.'b'I felt so important. At 25, I could go to any restaurant in Manhattan \xe2\x80\x94 Per Se, Le Bernardin \xe2\x80\x94 just by picking up the phone and calling one of my brokers, who ingratiate themselves to traders by entertaining with unlimited expense accounts. I could be second row at the Knicks-Lakers game just by hinting to a broker I might be interested in going. The satisfaction wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just about the money. It was about the power. Because of how smart and successful I was, it was someone else\xe2\x80\x99s job to make me happy.'b'Still, I was nagged by envy. On a trading desk everyone sits together, from interns to managing directors. When the guy next to you makes $10 million, $1 million or $2 million doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look so sweet. Nonetheless, I was thrilled with my progress.'b'My counselor didn\xe2\x80\x99t share my elation. She said I might be using money the same way I\xe2\x80\x99d used drugs and alcohol \xe2\x80\x94 to make myself feel powerful \xe2\x80\x94 and that maybe it would benefit me to stop focusing on accumulating more and instead focus on healing my inner wound. \xe2\x80\x9cInner wound\xe2\x80\x9d? I thought that was going a little far and went to work for a hedge fund.'b'Now, working elbow to elbow with billionaires, I was a giant fireball of greed. I\xe2\x80\x99d think about how my colleagues could buy Micronesia if they wanted to, or become mayor of New York City. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t just have money; they had power \xe2\x80\x94 power beyond getting a table at Le Bernardin. Senators came to their offices. They were royalty.'b'I wanted a billion dollars. It\xe2\x80\x99s staggering to think that in the course of five years, I\xe2\x80\x99d gone from being thrilled at my first bonus \xe2\x80\x94 $40,000 \xe2\x80\x94 to being disappointed when, my second year at the hedge fund, I was paid \xe2\x80\x9conly\xe2\x80\x9d $1.5 million.'b'But in the end, it was actually my absurdly wealthy bosses who helped me see the limitations of unlimited wealth. I was in a meeting with one of them, and a few other traders, and they were talking about the new hedge-fund regulations. Most everyone on Wall Street thought they were a bad idea. \xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t it better for the system as a whole?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. The room went quiet, and my boss shot me a withering look. I remember his saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have the brain capacity to think about the system as a whole. All I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned with is how this affects our company.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I felt as if I\xe2\x80\x99d been punched in the gut. He was afraid of losing money, despite all that he had.'b'From that moment on, I started to see Wall Street with new eyes. I noticed the vitriol that traders directed at the government for limiting bonuses after the crash. I heard the fury in their voices at the mention of higher taxes. These traders despised anything or anyone that threatened their bonuses. Ever see what a drug addict is like when he\xe2\x80\x99s used up his junk? He\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything \xe2\x80\x94 walk 20 miles in the snow, rob a grandma \xe2\x80\x94 to get a fix. Wall Street was like that. In the months before bonuses were handed out, the trading floor started to feel like a neighborhood in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wire\xe2\x80\x9d when the heroin runs out.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99d always looked enviously at the people who earned more than I did; now, for the first time, I was embarrassed for them, and for me. I made in a single year more than my mom made her whole life. I knew that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fair; that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t right. Yes, I was sharp, good with numbers. I had marketable talents. But in the end I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really do anything. I was a derivatives trader, and it occurred to me the world would hardly change at all if credit derivatives ceased to exist. Not so nurse practitioners. What had seemed normal now seemed deeply distorted.'b'I had recently finished Taylor Branch\xe2\x80\x99s three-volume series on the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement, and the image of the Freedom Riders stepping out of their bus into an infuriated mob had seared itself into my mind. I\xe2\x80\x99d told myself that if I\xe2\x80\x99d been alive in the \xe2\x80\x9860s, I would have been on that bus.'b'But I was lying to myself. There were plenty of injustices out there \xe2\x80\x94 rampant poverty, swelling prison populations, a sexual-assault epidemic, an obesity crisis. Not only was I not helping to fix any problems in the world, but I was profiting from them. During the market crash in 2008, I\xe2\x80\x99d made a ton of money by shorting the derivatives of risky companies. As the world crumbled, I profited. I\xe2\x80\x99d seen the crash coming, but instead of trying to help the people it would hurt the most \xe2\x80\x94 people who didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a million dollars in the bank \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99d made money off it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like who you\xe2\x80\x99ve become, my girlfriend had said years earlier. She was right then, and she was still right. Only now, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like who I\xe2\x80\x99d become either.'b'Wealth addiction was described by the late sociologist and playwright Philip Slater in a 1980 book, but addiction researchers have paid the concept little attention. Like alcoholics driving drunk, wealth addiction imperils everyone. Wealth addicts are, more than anybody, specifically responsible for the ever widening rift that is tearing apart our once great country. Wealth addicts are responsible for the vast and toxic disparity between the rich and the poor and the annihilation of the middle class. Only a wealth addict would feel justified in receiving $14 million in compensation \xe2\x80\x94 including an $8.5 million bonus \xe2\x80\x94 as the McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s C.E.O., Don Thompson, did in 2012, while his company then published a brochure for its work force on how to survive on their low wages. Only a wealth addict would earn hundreds of millions as a hedge-fund manager, and then lobby to maintain a tax loophole that gave him a lower tax rate than his secretary.'b'DESPITE my realizations, it was incredibly difficult to leave. I was terrified of running out of money and of forgoing future bonuses. More than anything, I was afraid that five or 10 years down the road, I\xe2\x80\x99d feel like an idiot for walking away from my one chance to be really important. What made it harder was that people thought I was crazy for thinking about leaving. In 2010, in a final paroxysm of my withering addiction, I demanded $8 million instead of $3.6 million. My bosses said they\xe2\x80\x99d raise my bonus if I agreed to stay several more years. Instead, I walked away.'b'The first year was really hard. I went through what I can only describe as withdrawal \xe2\x80\x94 waking up at nights panicked about running out of money, scouring the headlines to see which of my old co-workers had gotten promoted. Over time it got easier \xe2\x80\x94 I started to realize that I had enough money, and if I needed to make more, I could. But my wealth addiction still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone completely away. Sometimes I still buy lottery tickets.'b'In the three years since I left, I\xe2\x80\x99ve married, spoken in jails and juvenile detention centers about getting sober, taught a writing class to girls in the foster system, and started a nonprofit called Groceryships to help poor families struggling with obesity and food addiction. I am much happier. I feel as if I\xe2\x80\x99m making a real contribution. And as time passes, the distortion lessens. I see Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s mantra \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re smarter and work harder than everyone else, so we deserve all this money\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 for what it is: the rationalization of addicts. From a distance I can see what I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see then \xe2\x80\x94 that Wall Street is a toxic culture that encourages the grandiosity of people who are desperately trying to feel powerful.'b'I was lucky. My experience with drugs and alcohol allowed me to recognize my pursuit of wealth as an addiction. The years of work I did with my counselor helped me heal the parts of myself that felt damaged and inadequate, so that I had enough of a core sense of self to walk away.'b"Dozens of different types of 12-step support groups \xe2\x80\x94 including Clutterers Anonymous and On-Line Gamers Anonymous \xe2\x80\x94 exist to help addicts of various types, yet there is no Wealth Addicts Anonymous. Why not? Because our culture supports and even lauds the addiction. Look at the magazine covers in any newsstand, plastered with the faces of celebrities and C.E.O.'s; the superrich are our cultural gods. I hope we all confront our part in enabling wealth addicts to exert so much influence over our country."b'I generally think that if one is rich and believes they have \xe2\x80\x9cenough,\xe2\x80\x9d they are not a wealth addict. On Wall Street, in my experience, that sense of \xe2\x80\x9cenough\xe2\x80\x9d is rare. The money guy doing a job he complains about for yet another year so he can add $2 million to his $20 million bank account seems like an addict.'b'I recently got an email from a hedge-fund trader who said that though he was making millions every year, he felt trapped and empty, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t summon the courage to leave. I believe there are others out there. Maybe we can form a group and confront our addiction together. And if you identify with what I\xe2\x80\x99ve written, but are reticent to leave, then take a small step in the right direction. Let\xe2\x80\x99s create a fund, where everyone agrees to put, say, 25 percent of their annual bonuses into it, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll use that to help some of the people who actually need the money that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been so rabidly chasing. Together, maybe we can make a real contribution to the world.'b'HERE\xe2\x80\x99S a scary fact about America: We\xe2\x80\x99re much more likely to believe that there are signs that aliens have visited Earth (77 percent) than that humans are causing climate change (44 percent).'b'That comes to mind because a couple of weeks ago, 'b'I asked readers for suggestions'b' of \xe2\x80\x9cneglected topics\xe2\x80\x9d that we in the news business should cover more aggressively in 2014. 'b'Some 1,300 readers recommended'b' a broad range of issues, which I look forward to pilfering (with credit!) \xe2\x80\x94 and many made a particularly compelling case for climate change.'b'A reader from Virginia quoted James Hansen, the outspoken climate scientist: \xe2\x80\x9cImagine a giant asteroid on a direct collision course with Earth. That is the equivalent of what we face now.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Another reader, Daria, acknowledged that the topic isn\xe2\x80\x99t sexy but added: \xe2\x80\x9cWhether we \xe2\x80\x98believe in it\xe2\x80\x99 or not, all species on Earth are being subject to frightening disruptions in our weather, food supply, land.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'You would think that we would be more attentive, with the federal government a few days ago declaring parts of 11 states disaster areas because of long-term drought. More than 60 percent of California is now in extreme drought.'b'Yet we in the news media manage to cover weather very aggressively, while we\xe2\x80\x99re reticent on climate. Astonishingly, 'b'coverage of climate'b' has actually declined in mainstream news organizations since peaking in 2007, according to the count of researchers at the University of Colorado. (Coverage did increase last year after a low in 2012.)'b'The proportion of Americans who say they believe that global warming is real has fallen since 2007 as well, and climate beliefs have fallen victim to political polarization. In 1997, there was no significant gap between Republicans and Democrats in thinking about climate change. 'b'These days'b', 66 percent of Democrats say human activity is the main cause of global warming; 24 percent of Republicans say so.'b'My take is that when Democrats, led by Al Gore, championed climate change, Republicans instinctively grew suspicious. Yet the scientific consensus is stronger than ever. 'b'The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in September raised its confidence'b' that human activity is the main cause of warming from 90 percent probability to 95 percent or higher.'b'When we have this disjunction between scientific consensus and popular perception \xe2\x80\x94 well, that should light a fire under those of us in the news media.'b'An excellent basis for discussion is the new book \xe2\x80\x9cThe Climate Casino\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'by William Nordhaus'b', a Yale University economist. Professor Nordhaus is a moderate whose work has been cited by climate deniers, yet he concludes: \xe2\x80\x9cGlobal warming is a major threat to humans.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Nordhaus acknowledges uncertainty but sees that as a problem: \xe2\x80\x9cThe outcome will produce surprises, and some of them are likely to be perilous.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For all the uncertainty, Nordhaus cites several areas of strong agreement among experts: Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere exceed those observed for at least the last 650,000 years; hurricanes will grow more intense; the Arctic will become ice free in summer; oceans will rise up to 23 inches by 2100 (more if there were major melting of ice sheets); and the global temperature will likely be 3.5 degrees to 7.5 degrees Fahrenheit higher in 2100 than in 1900.'b''b'A 7.5 degree difference in average temperature'b' may not sound like much. But it\xe2\x80\x99s about the differential by which Arizona is warmer than New Jersey.'b'Nordhaus warns that \xe2\x80\x9cthe pace of global warming will quicken over the decades to come and climate conditions will quickly pass beyond the range of recent historical experience.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Perhaps the greatest risk is various discontinuities and feedback loops that are difficult for climate models to account for. Melting of the Greenland ice sheet is typically predicted to add only a few inches to sea level rise by 2100, Nordhaus says. But ice dynamics are still poorly understood, and that matters a great deal. If the whole Greenland ice sheet disintegrated, that would raise sea level by 24 feet.'b'Climate change is hugely exacerbated by 'b'changing patterns of how we choose to live'b', often in danger zones such as extremely vulnerable coastal zones \xe2\x80\x94 from New Jersey to the Philippines. This enormously increases the economic and human costs of hurricanes, rising seas and changing weather patterns.'b'In politics and the military, we routinely deal with uncertainty. We\xe2\x80\x99re not sure that Iran is trying to build a nuclear weapon, but we still invest in technologies and policies to reduce the risks. We can\xe2\x80\x99t be sure that someone is going to hijack a plane, but we still screen passengers.'b'So, readers, you\xe2\x80\x99re right! This is a neglected topic. We need to focus more on climate change, and perhaps that can help nudge our political system out of paralysis to take protective action to reduce the threat to the only planet we have.'b'Readers respond to a Jan. 15 letter in which Robert L. Bryant, a lifelong Republican, decried \xe2\x80\x9cthe choices my party has presented to me.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xc2\xa0'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'I am a lifelong registered Republican who is angry about the choices my party has presented to me.'b'In 2008, I had to choose whether to help place Sarah Palin a heartbeat away from the presidency.

I see no simple solution for my problem, but Mr. Bryant has a clear path to a happier political stance. He could become a Democrat.'b'I would welcome him, because even though I would disagree with him on many issues (as I already disagree with many of my Democratic colleagues), he seems to be the kind of person I could work with.

BRYANT'b' Hockessin, Del., Jan. 17, 2014'b''b'The latest 'b'surgeon general\xe2\x80\x99s report'b' on the health effects of smoking \xe2\x80\x94 issued at the 50th anniversary of the pathbreaking 1964 report \xe2\x80\x94 offers astonishing new evidence of just how much harm tobacco is causing. Despite the many gains in reducing risks over the past half-century, researchers keep finding new and insidious ways in which smoking is harming the smokers themselves and nonsmokers who breathe in toxic fumes.'b'The report, issued last Friday, finds that cigarette smoking kills even more Americans than previously estimated (about 480,000 a year, up from 443,000), and is a cause, though not necessarily the major cause, of even more diseases than previously recognized, including liver and colorectal cancers. These add to the long list of other cancers caused by smoking, as well as rheumatoid arthritis and other ailments. The report newly identifies exposure to secondhand smoke as a cause of strokes.'b'The report estimates that smoking costs the United States between $289 billion and $333 billion a year for medical care and lost productivity, well above the previous estimate of $193 billion.'b'Most shocking, the report finds that today\xe2\x80\x99s smokers have a much higher risk for lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease than smokers in 1964, despite smoking fewer cigarettes.'b'It reports that the risk of developing adenocarcinoma of the lung, the most common type of lung cancer, has increased substantially over the past several decades because of changes in the design and composition of cigarettes. These include ventilated filters that lead to more puffing of noxious materials and blended tobaccos that contain carcinogenic nitrosamines.'b'There is no doubt who is to blame for this mess, the report says. It is the tobacco industry, which \xe2\x80\x9caggressively markets and promotes lethal and addictive products,\xe2\x80\x9d continues to recruit youth and young adults as new customers, and has \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately misled the public on the risks of smoking cigarettes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The new report rightly calls for more vigorous tobacco-control efforts, including an increase in cigarette taxes to drive up the average price of cigarettes to at least $10 a pack to prevent young people from starting to smoke; an antismoking mass media campaign by government agencies that would run year-round; and new rules extending smoke-free indoor protection to the entire population, double the current level. The goal is to reduce the smoking rate from the current 18 percent to less than 10 percent in 10 years.'b'There is an additional weapon that can be brought to bear. In mid-2009, Congress 'b'passed a law'b' that gave the Food and Drug Administration authority for the first time to regulate tobacco products. It should use those powers to reduce the addictiveness and harmfulness of smoking and reverse the design changes that have made cigarettes even more dangerous than they were in previous decades.'b'MORE than a decade into the 21st century, we would like to think that American parents have similar standards and similar dreams for their sons and daughters. But my study of anonymous, aggregate data from Google searches suggests that contemporary American parents are far more likely to want their boys smart and their girls skinny.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not that parents don\xe2\x80\x99t want their daughters to be bright or their sons to be in shape, but they are much more focused on the braininess of their sons and the waistlines of their daughters.'b'Start with intelligence. It\xe2\x80\x99s hardly surprising that parents of young children are often excited at the thought that their child may be gifted. In fact, of all Google searches starting \xe2\x80\x9cIs my 2-year-old,\xe2\x80\x9d the most common next word is \xe2\x80\x9cgifted.\xe2\x80\x9d But this question is not asked equally about young boys and young girls. Parents are two and a half times more likely to ask \xe2\x80\x9cIs my son gifted?\xe2\x80\x9d than \xe2\x80\x9cIs my daughter gifted?\xe2\x80\x9d Parents show a similar bias when using other phrases related to intelligence that they may shy away from saying aloud, like, \xe2\x80\x9cIs my son a genius?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Are parents picking up on legitimate differences between young girls and boys? Perhaps young boys are more likely than young girls to use big words or otherwise show objective signs of giftedness? Nope. If anything, it\xe2\x80\x99s the opposite. At young ages, when parents most often search about possible giftedness, girls have 'b'consistently been shown'b' to have larger vocabularies and use more complex sentences. In American schools, girls are 11 percent more likely than boys to be in gifted programs. Despite all this, parents looking around the dinner table appear to see more gifted boys than girls.'b'Parents were more likely to ask about sons rather than daughters on every matter that I tested related to intelligence, including its absence. There are more searches for \xe2\x80\x9cis my son behind\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cstupid\xe2\x80\x9d than comparable searches for daughters. Searches with negative words like \xe2\x80\x9cstupid\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbehind,\xe2\x80\x9d however, are less skewed toward sons than searches with positive words.'b'What concerns do parents disproportionately have for their daughters? Primarily, anything related to appearance. Consider questions about a child\xe2\x80\x99s weight. Parents Google \xe2\x80\x9cIs my daughter overweight?\xe2\x80\x9d roughly twice as frequently as they Google \xe2\x80\x9cIs my son overweight?\xe2\x80\x9d Just as with giftedness, this gender bias is not grounded in reality. About 30 percent of girls are 'b'overweight'b', while 33 percent of boys are. Even though scales measure more overweight boys than girls, parents see \xe2\x80\x94 or worry about \xe2\x80\x94 overweight girls much more often than overweight boys.'b'Parents are about twice as likely to ask how to get their daughters to lose weight as they are to ask how to get their sons to do the same. Google search data also tell us that mothers and fathers are more likely to wonder whether their daughter is \xe2\x80\x9cbeautiful\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cugly.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Parents are one and a half times more likely to ask whether their daughter is beautiful than whether their son is, but they are nearly three times more likely to ask whether their daughter is ugly than whether their son is ugly. How Google is expected to know whether a child is beautiful or ugly is hard to say.'b'In general, parents seem more likely to use positive words in questions about sons. There is a larger bias toward asking whether sons are \xe2\x80\x9ctall\xe2\x80\x9d than \xe2\x80\x9cshort.\xe2\x80\x9d Parents are more likely to ask whether a son is \xe2\x80\x9chappy\xe2\x80\x9d and slightly more likely to ask whether a daughter is \xe2\x80\x9cdepressed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Liberal readers may imagine that these biases are more common in conservative parts of the country. Not so. I did not find a significant relationship between any of the biases mentioned and the political or cultural makeup of a state. These biases appear to cut across ideological divisions. In fact, I was unable to find any demographics that significantly reduced the biases. Nor is there evidence that these biases have decreased since 2004, the year for which Google search data is first available.'b'This methodology can also be used to study gender preference before birth. Every year, Americans make hundreds of thousands of searches asking how to conceive a child of a particular sex. In searches with the words \xe2\x80\x9chow to conceive,\xe2\x80\x9d Americans are slightly more likely to include the word \xe2\x80\x9cboy\xe2\x80\x9d than \xe2\x80\x9cgirl.\xe2\x80\x9d Among the subset of Americans Googling for specific gender conception strategies, there is about a 10 percent preference for boys compared with girls.'b'This boy preference is surprising for two reasons. First, the top websites returned for these queries are overwhelmingly geared toward women, suggesting that women are most often making gender conception searches. Yet in surveys, women express a slight preference for having girls, not boys; men say they prefer sons. Second, many Americans are willing to admit a gender preference to even out a family. About 5 percent more boys are born than girls in the United States, so evening out a family would more often require having a girl, not a boy. Are men searching for conception advice in large numbers? Are women searching on their husbands\xe2\x80\x99 behalf? Or do some American women have a son preference that they are not comfortable admitting to surveys?'b'Other countries exhibit very large preferences in favor of boys. In India, for each search asking how to conceive a girl, there are three-and-a-half asking how to conceive a boy. With such an overwhelming preference for boys, it is not surprising that there are millions fewer women in India than population scientists would predict.'b'Clearly there is more to learn. Because this data make it easy to compare different countries over time, for example, we might examine whether these gender preferences change after a woman is elected to run a country.'b'The disturbing results outlined here leave us with many open questions, but the most poignant may be this one: How would American girls\xe2\x80\x99 lives be different if parents were half as concerned with their bodies and twice as intrigued by their minds?'b'WHAT would Marlise Munoz have made of all of this?'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ll never know. She can no longer form words. Can no longer form 'b'thoughts'b'. It\xe2\x80\x99s arguable that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even be referring to a \xe2\x80\x9cshe,\xe2\x80\x9d to a \xe2\x80\x9cher,\xe2\x80\x9d because if she\xe2\x80\x99s brain-dead, as her family has consistently said, then she meets the legal criteria for death in all 50 states, and what\xe2\x80\x99s been tethered to machines in a hospital in Fort Worth for the last seven weeks isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly a mother. It\xe2\x80\x99s an artificially maintained ecosystem, an incubator for a fetus that has somehow been given precedence over all other concerns: the pain of Marlise\xe2\x80\x99s husband and parents; their wishes to put an end to this; their best guess about what her desires would have been; her transformation, without any possibility of her consent, into a mere vessel.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA host,\xe2\x80\x9d her father, Ernest Machado, called her in an interview 'b'with Manny Fernandez of The Times'b'. He used equally chilling language to describe her stillness and the rubbery feel of her skin, saying that she reminded him of \xe2\x80\x9ca mannequin.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Is her fate really what we mean when we speak of \xe2\x80\x9cvaluing life\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthe sanctity of life,\xe2\x80\x9d to summon two phrases tossed around too quickly and simplistically? It seems to me that several lives are being devalued in the process, and that while there are no happy outcomes here, there\xe2\x80\x99s also no sense or dignity on the chilling road that this Texas hospital is taking us down.'b'In late November, Marlise, 33, was found unconscious on the kitchen floor by her husband, Erick. She had apparently suffered a pulmonary embolism. At the hospital, according to Erick\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent statements, it was determined that she was brain-dead, and he requested that she be disconnected from the machines that keep her vital organs functioning. He and she had both worked as paramedics and had discussed such end-of-life decisions, he said, and so he knew that she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have wanted any extraordinary measures taken. The woman he loved was gone. It was time to come to bitter terms with that, and to say goodbye.'b'Hospital officials, supposedly acting on behalf of the state, won\xe2\x80\x99t let him. They went ahead with extraordinary measures, because Marlise was 14 weeks pregnant, and while that fell well within the window when abortion is legal, a Texas law compels hospitals to provide life support for terminally ill patients with fetuses developing inside them.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s considerable dispute about whether this law in fact covers Marlise\xe2\x80\x99s situation: about whether someone brain-dead qualifies as a patient and can be said to be receiving 'b'life'b' support. Hospital officials have not formally confirmed that she\xe2\x80\x99s brain-dead, explaining that her husband hasn\xe2\x80\x99t granted them dispensation to discuss specifics of her condition. Lawyers representing him 'b'told CNN'b' on Friday that her medical records indeed document brain death.'b'But regardless of the law and whether it applies to Marlise\xe2\x80\x99s case, the treatment of her and her family isn\xe2\x80\x99t just or right, for many reasons.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not at all clear, for starters, that the fetus has a good chance of surviving inside the womb or of flourishing outside of it. 'b'In a study'b' of a few dozen cases of continued pregnancies inside brain-dead women, only one of the five fetuses that were between 13 and 15 weeks at the time of the mother\xe2\x80\x99s brain death was successfully delivered \xe2\x80\x94 by cesarean section \xe2\x80\x94 and kept alive, though the study tracked the boy only until 11 months after his birth.'b'I talked last week with two prominent obstetricians, both of whom said that it was impossible, until relatively late in a pregnancy, to get any real sense of how much neurological damage a fetus may have already suffered as a result of a maternal embolism and of any oxygen deprivation that occurred. They also said that a pregnancy dependent on artificial organ maintenance entails an array of dangers to the fetus beyond ordinary ones, including the mother\xe2\x80\x99s susceptibility to infections.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s extremely risky for fetal development,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary D\xe2\x80\x99Alton, the head of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University Medical Center and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. But, she added, \xe2\x80\x9cIf the family is willing and it\xe2\x80\x99s something they want, it\xe2\x80\x99s something I would attempt \xe2\x80\x94 and have attempted.\xe2\x80\x9d She said that she was involved in two such pregnancies. In one, the fetus died in utero at 27 weeks. In the other, a child was born, but with problems.'b'She dwelt on the part about the family\xe2\x80\x99s will, focusing on a simple truth that the Texas situation sweeps to the side. \xe2\x80\x9cThey will live with the impact,\xe2\x80\x9d D\xe2\x80\x99Alton said.'b'From what\xe2\x80\x99s been reported about Marlise\xe2\x80\x99s case, the hospital, executing the will of the state, has been making all of the calls about the care of the fetus, now about 21 weeks along. (The threshold for viability is generally considered to be 24 weeks.) But if there\xe2\x80\x99s a premature birth and quick death, Marlise\xe2\x80\x99s husband and parents will presumably be expected to deal with that.'b'And if a baby is born with severe and enduring ailments, Marlise\xe2\x80\x99s husband and parents will presumably inherit the effort to give that child a decent quality of life, which is a concept that goes strangely missing in too many disputes over the unborn.'b'In other words they\xe2\x80\x99ll possibly confront a slew of decisions \xe2\x80\x9cdownstream from a decision that they already made and that got overruled,\xe2\x80\x9d the one to remove her from machines, said Hyagriv Simhan, the chief of maternal-fetal medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite complex.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s one word for it. Cruel is another.'b'Marlise apparently didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave any advance medical directive covering the particular scenario of artificial organ maintenance for a fetus well shy of viability. How many women do? In the absence of such instructions, her physicians should have done what they would have if there\xe2\x80\x99d been no fetus \xe2\x80\x94 looked to, and heeded, her obvious surrogates, her next of kin. In her instance there\xe2\x80\x99s a husband and two parents all certain of what to do and all on the same page. Still it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, because of a Texas statute that\xe2\x80\x99s too far-reaching, too ambiguous and at strange odds with the state\xe2\x80\x99s abortion laws.'b'While Texas, like other states, has been trying to make it 'b'harder and harder to obtain abortions'b', it cannot ultimately prevent a woman who is still able to speak for herself from ending a pregnancy in the early stages. How, then, can it prevent a family who speaks legitimately for her from taking that same step? Especially in a circumstance like this, so riddled with risks, questions and heartbreak? Marlise\xe2\x80\x99s husband and parents may not be able to ask her what she\xe2\x80\x99d make of it. But they\xe2\x80\x99re the ones left to behold and grieve over what\xe2\x80\x99s been made of her.'b'WHAT is happening in retirement communities, assisted living facilities and nursing homes? You might imagine quiet reading, crossword puzzles, bingo, maybe some shuffleboard. Think again. Think about sex \xe2\x80\x94 unsafe sex.'b'The Department of Health and Human Services released a little-noticed report on Medicare a few months ago that had this startling statistic: In 2011 and 2012, 2.2 million beneficiaries received free sexually transmitted disease screenings and counseling sessions. And more than 66,000 received free H.I.V. tests.'b'The number of Medicare enrollees who took advantage of free S.T.D. tests is about the same as the number who received free colonoscopies to screen for colon cancer, amounting to about 5 percent of all those on Medicare.'b'Numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show rapid increases in S.T.D.\xe2\x80\x99s among older people. Between 2007 and 2011, chlamydia infections among Americans 65 and over increased by 31 percent, and syphilis by 52 percent. Those numbers are similar to S.T.D. trends in the 20- to 24-year-old age group, where chlamydia increased by 35 percent and syphilis by 64 percent. Experts suggest there are four main factors contributing to the rise in S.T.D.\xe2\x80\x99s among older Americans.'b'First, retirement communities and assisted living facilities are becoming like college campuses. They cram a lot of similarly aged people together, and when they do, things naturally happen. I mentioned these numbers to a friend, and she was not surprised. When her father moved into an assisted-living facility, she said, three women came by to introduce themselves within 30 minutes. And it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to compare Medicare pharmacy plans and premiums.'b'Second, older people are living longer and are in better health. As a result, they are remaining sexually active much later into life. Several major surveys, including the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project and the National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior, report that among people age 60 and older, more than half of men and 40 percent of women are sexually active.'b'But while they are having a lot of sex, seniors didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to get the safe sex memo, or when it came through they ignored it because they did not think it applied to them. They obviously don\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about pregnancy. And they grew up before the safe sex era. So seniors might think they have no reason to use condoms. According to the 2010 National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior, among college-age Americans, condoms are used in about 40 percent of sexual encounters, but only in about 6 percent of sexual encounters among those 61 and older. A study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine showed that older men who use Viagra and similar drugs are six times less likely to use condoms compared with men in their 20s.'b'Combine retirement communities, longer life, unfamiliarity with condoms and Viagra \xe2\x80\x94 and what do you get? You get an S.T.D. epidemic among the Social Security generation that rivals what we imagine is happening in those \xe2\x80\x9cAnimal House\xe2\x80\x9d fraternities.'b'These S.T.D. numbers demand that seniors take responsibility for their actions.'b'Clinicians must be aware of these trends and not overlook S.T.D. screenings when treating older patients. As you might expect, though, doctors are not very good at talking about sex in general and protected sex in particular \xe2\x80\x94 especially to the elderly. If doctors aren\xe2\x80\x99t having \xe2\x80\x9cthe talk,\xe2\x80\x9d we have to get safe sex counselors more involved at retirement communities and assisted living facilities. These facilities could also consider making condoms readily available, as they often are on college campuses.'b'We also need a big public health campaign on safe sex aimed not just at college students but at older people who are living independently. Maybe the AARP can push its constituents to be sexually responsible. Social Security could include some information on S.T.D.\xe2\x80\x99s and how to use a condom when it sends out checks. Come to think of it, these data mean there is an untapped market: over 40 million Americans who are unfamiliar with latex protection. Maybe Durex and Trojan can mail free condoms to every Social Security recipient?'b'IN 2009, shortly after Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s successful campaign for the White House, the McNally Jackson bookstore in Manhattan organized a display of about 50 books that Mr. Obama had read as a young man. The titles were eclectic, with a good number by African-American authors, including Ralph Ellison, James Baldwin and Toni Morrison.'b'As a candidate, Mr. Obama demonstrated a remarkable rhetorical ability to present himself as both inhabiting and escaping from the worlds created by these writers. He even modeled his much praised memoir, \xe2\x80\x9cDreams From My Father,\xe2\x80\x9d on Ellison\xe2\x80\x99s 1952 novel, \xe2\x80\x9cInvisible Man.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet where Ellison\xe2\x80\x99s young, idealistic black protagonist remains anonymous \xe2\x80\x94 the book ends with him alone in his underground apartment \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Obama won the White House, inaugurating what many at the time hoped was a new, \xe2\x80\x9cpostracial\xe2\x80\x9d America.'b'That optimism turned out to be premature. Today, anti-Obama signs with racist language accompany Tea Party rallies; a Confederate flag is unfurled in front of the White House to protest the government shutdown.'b'Looking back, there was one book in the McNally Jackson display, overlooked at the time, that could have helped us anticipate all this. That book was \xe2\x80\x9cBenito Cereno,\xe2\x80\x9d a largely forgotten masterpiece by Herman Melville. In today\xe2\x80\x99s charged political environment, the message of Melville\xe2\x80\x99s story bears rehearing.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBenito Cereno\xe2\x80\x9d tells the story of Amasa Delano, a New England sea captain who, in the South Pacific, spends all day on a distressed Spanish ship carrying scores of West Africans who he thinks are slaves. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t. Unbeknown to Delano, they had earlier risen up, slaughtered most of the crew and demanded that the captain, Benito Cereno, return them home to Senegal. After Delano boards the ship (to offer his assistance), the West Africans keep their rebellion a secret by acting as if they are still slaves. Their leader, a man named Babo, pretends to be Cereno\xe2\x80\x99s loyal servant, while actually keeping a close eye on him.'b'Melville narrates the events from the perspective of the clueless Delano, who for most of the novella thinks Cereno is in charge. As the day progresses, Delano grows increasingly obsessed with Babo and the seeming affection with which the West African cares for the Spanish captain. The New Englander, liberal in his sentiments and opposed to slavery as a matter of course, fantasizes about being waited on by such a devoted and cheerful body servant.'b'Delano believes himself a free man, and he defines his freedom in opposition to the smiling, open-faced Babo, who he presumes has no interior life, no ideas or interests of his own. Delano sees what he wants to see. But when Delano ultimately discovers the truth \xe2\x80\x94 that Babo, in fact, is the one exercising masterly discipline over his inner thoughts, and that it is Delano who is enslaved to his illusions \xe2\x80\x94 he responds with savage violence.'b'Barack Obama may have avoided the fate of the protagonist of \xe2\x80\x9cInvisible Man,\xe2\x80\x9d but he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to escape the shadow of Babo. He is Babo, or at least he is to a significant part of the American population \xe2\x80\x94 including many of the white rank and file of the Republican Party and the Tea Party politicians they help elect.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBenito Cereno\xe2\x80\x9d is based on a true historical incident, which I started researching around the time Mr. Obama announced his first bid for the presidency. Since then, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been struck by the persistence of fears, which began even before his election, that Mr. Obama isn\xe2\x80\x99t what he seems: that instead of being a faithful public servant he is carrying out a leftist plot hatched decades ago to destroy America; or if not that, then he is a secret Muslim intent on supplanting the Constitution with Islamic law; or a Kenyan-born anti-colonialist out to avenge his native Africa.'b'No other American president has had to face, before even taking office, an opposition convinced of not just his political but his existential illegitimacy. In order to succeed as a politician, Mr. Obama had to cultivate what many have described as an almost preternatural dominion over his inner self. He had to become a \xe2\x80\x9cblank screen,\xe2\x80\x9d as Mr. Obama himself has put it, on which others could project their ideals \xe2\x80\x94 just as Babo is for Delano. Yet this intense self-control seems to be what drives the president\xe2\x80\x99s more feverish detractors into a frenzy; they fill that screen with hatreds drawn deep from America\xe2\x80\x99s historical subconscious.'b'Published in late 1855, as the United States moved toward the Civil War, \xe2\x80\x9cBenito Cereno\xe2\x80\x9d is one of the most despairing stories in American literature. Amasa Delano represents a new kind of racism, based not on theological or philosophical doctrine but rather on the emotional need to measure one\xe2\x80\x99s absolute freedom in inverse relation to another\xe2\x80\x99s absolute slavishness. This was a racism that was born in chattel slavery but didn\xe2\x80\x99t die with chattel slavery, instead evolving into today\xe2\x80\x99s cult of individual supremacy, which, try as it might, can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to shake off its white supremacist roots.'b'THIS helps explain those Confederate flags that appear at conservative rallies, as well as why Tea Party-backed politicians like Sarah Palin and Rand Paul insist on equating federal policies they don\xe2\x80\x99t like with chattel bondage. Believing in the \xe2\x80\x9cright to health care,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Paul once said, is \xe2\x80\x9cbasically saying you believe in slavery.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As for Mr. Obama, he continues to invoke fantasies that seem drawn straight from Melville\xe2\x80\x99s imagination. One Republican councilman, in Michigan, attended a protest carrying an image of Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s decapitated head on a pike, which happens to be the very fate that befalls Babo once his ruse unravels. Another Republican ran for Congress in Florida with a commercial featuring Mr. Obama as the captain of a slave ship.'b'Over 60 years ago, Ralph Ellison began \xe2\x80\x9cInvisible Man\xe2\x80\x9d with an epigraph drawn from \xe2\x80\x9cBenito Cereno.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s a pleading question that Delano asks Cereno after the revolt is put down and Babo is executed: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are saved: what has cast such a shadow upon you?\xe2\x80\x9d Though Ellison purposefully omitted it from his epigraph, in today\xe2\x80\x99s America it is still worth recalling Cereno\xe2\x80\x99s answer: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Negro.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'FOR most of my 20s I played in the indie rock band Sleater-Kinney. We wrote songs, we recorded them, we toured. In my 30s, though, things changed. I started spending most of my time writing or working on the TV show \xe2\x80\x9cPortlandia.\xe2\x80\x9d I haven\xe2\x80\x99t played many live shows in the past decade, but somehow I feel as if I\xe2\x80\x99m still on tour \xe2\x80\x94 not just with my bandmates, but with everyone. So I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d try writing a song again, so I\xe2\x80\x99d have something to play.'b'My song is prosaic. It tries to sound tossed-off, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not. It\xe2\x80\x99s overly considered. But soon I hit the sweet spot and \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s pithy. Whack. Thump. Head meets heart. My tune tells you where I am and what I\xe2\x80\x99m doing. It\xe2\x80\x99s report and rapport. Truth meets the unreliability of feeling. Fact meets friction. I play it all day long. Here\xe2\x80\x99s how it goes.'b'First verse: 'b'I texted to let you know that I woke up this morning. Otherwise I worried you might think, No word from her yet today \xe2\x80\x94 she must have died in her sleep.'b''b'We\xe2\x80\x99re living on a million tiny stages. Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Facebook, YouTube. Dinner plates are showcases for our food, beds become venues for our slumber, selfies are curtain calls for our faces. We put our activities on display, our feelings, our families, our skies. We\xe2\x80\x99re not quite sure if there is a point in doing anything anymore if it can\xe2\x80\x99t be documented, if no one is there to observe it. We long for favorites and likes and reposts, compulsively monitor these new forms of applause. The marquees of our lives say, special guest: ME! We play an encore, and then another. The quotidian one-man show never quite ends.'b'Second verse: same as the first. Except it\xe2\x80\x99s lunch. 'b'P'b''b'lease don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I\xe2\x80\x99m eating. Here\xe2\x80\x99s proof. #nofilter.'b''b'All of these stages mean there is very little quiet. How can there be with so many exclamation points!!!?

If you want to elicit concern from a loved one, type a period at the end of a text message; it indicates a malaise, or worse, apathy. Apathy about that new sweater, apathy about 6 o\xe2\x80\x99clock.

(Note to friends reading this: Please let me know if you\xe2\x80\x99ve recently died or had a birthday because I now have no way of knowing.) Seeing how many friends cared about my quitting Facebook was like getting to observe my own funeral. I think Facebook should advertise itself as a memorial service for the living. It makes the present feel as if it is instantaneously collecting dust. We\xe2\x80\x99ve become our own estate sales. But how can I put a price on my life if I\xe2\x80\x99m not really living it?'b'Fifth verse: Five verses and not a chorus in sight?

Births, deaths, celebrity mug shots, piano-playing kittens, children we don\xe2\x80\x99t know engaging in wackiness, war, poverty, photos of salt shakers and table sets, tales of the mundane, puns: This is all funneled and flattened, much to our delight and convenience, of course.

But occasionally we join together to make a constellation that feels like a mass, something sturdy and important. Like maybe, right now. My song meets your song. Then piles upon piles of the mundane start to feel like days, like stories, like shapes, like songs, like lives.'b'Chorus: 'b'All together now. I\xe2\x80\x99ll listen if you will.'b''b'IN his opinion last month regarding the constitutionality of the National Security Agency\xe2\x80\x99s phone-data collection program, Judge Richard Leon wrote that \xe2\x80\x9cJames Madison, who cautioned us to beware of \xe2\x80\x98the abridgment of freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments by those in power,\xe2\x80\x99 would be aghast.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Judge Leon isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only legal mind these days to view Madison as a libertarian icon. Justice Antonin Scalia invoked Madison last spring in his memorable dissent from a Supreme Court opinion upholding the government\xe2\x80\x99s right to collect DNA swabs from suspects.'b'Expect to hear a lot more about Madison in the coming year, as the issues surrounding the N.S.A. move toward what Justice Scalia has said will be a likely review by the Supreme Court. For that reason, it is important to explore what Madison does and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t offer to this debate.'b'The apotheosis of Madison as an emblem for opposition to mass surveillance is welcome. But the reasoning behind his beliefs has been misunderstood. He believed that the preservation of people\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent and unequal faculties of acquiring property\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cthe first object of government,\xe2\x80\x9d but that a too-powerful government could undermine that goal. He was, therefore, more concerned with abuses of legislative and executive power than of unregulated commercial power.'b'As a result, the Bill of Rights, which he came to champion, constrains only government actors, not private ones. It applies to the government, not Google. Now that Google and AT&amp;T can track us more closely than any N.S.A. agent, it appears that the Madisonian Constitution may be inadequate to defend our privacy and dignity in the 21st century.'b'Soon after Judge Leon issued his ruling, Judge William H. Pauley III, a federal district judge in New York, reached the opposite conclusion, upholding the N.S.A. spying program in part by noting that the founders approved of secrecy.'b'The debate between Judge Leon and Judge Pauley echoes the one between Federalists and Anti-Federalists about the proper scope of government, one Madison, a moderate for his time, so effectively straddled.'b'In the revolutionary period, the galvanizing examples of government overreach were the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral warrants\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwrits of assistance\xe2\x80\x9d that allowed the king\xe2\x80\x99s agents \xe2\x80\x9cto break open Doors, Chests, Trunks, and other Packages,\xe2\x80\x9d without specifying either the goods to be seized or the houses to be searched.'b'In a famous attack on such writs in 1761, the lawyer James Otis said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a power that places the liberty of every man in the hands of every petty officer.\xe2\x80\x9d To avoid the dangers of an overreaching central government, in 1777 the Continental Congress created a weak union governed by the Articles of Confederation.'b'Madison, a moderate Federalist, lamented the inability of the newly created government to curb the occasional excesses of economic populism, such as Shays\xe2\x80\x99 Rebellion in western Massachusetts, where debtors attempted to take over the local government.'b'Madison and others gathered in Philadelphia in 1787 to create a stronger, but still limited, federal government. In response to demands by Anti-Federalists for amendments that protect individual liberty against the government, Madison introduced the Bill of Rights in 1789.'b'Unable to foresee the Leviathan national security state, Madison, in his Bill of Rights, was more concerned with abuses by Congress than the executive branch. But he had an even greater blind spot for abuses by the private sector, because he was focused on protecting the property rights of the few against the tyranny of the many.'b'For example, economically populist Anti-Federalists, including Thomas Jefferson, backed an amendment to prohibit Congress from granting monopolies or setting up \xe2\x80\x9cany company with exclusive advantages of commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d Madison, who also mistrusted monopolies, was less convinced that they should be \xe2\x80\x9cwholly renounced.\xe2\x80\x9d He responded to Jefferson that \xe2\x80\x9cmonopolies are sacrifices of the many to the few,\xe2\x80\x9d and in America, where the power rested with the people, \xe2\x80\x9cit is much more to be dreaded that the few will be unnecessarily sacrificed to the many.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There is, therefore, a tension in modern libertarian appreciations of Madison. They exaggerate his opposition to abuse of federal power and ignore his failure to anticipate abuse of corporate power.'b'Today, the foes of corporate monopoly power include those on the Tea Party Right and the Occupy Wall Street left. But on the right, the Madisonian devotion to property rights, and Jeffersonian suspicion of regulation, are so strong that the same principled libertarians who oppose N.S.A. data collection shrink from efforts to regulate Google or AT&amp;T.'b'In his speech on intelligence reform on Friday, President Obama called on Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to develop options for how the bulk telephone data collection program could continue without the metadata being held by the government itself. But telecom companies have resisted being the repository for the data, and an anti-regulatory Congress is unlikely to require them to do so or to impose meaningful limits on what they can do with the data they hold.'b'As a result, Internet service providers and telecoms are constrained neither by the Constitution nor, in meaningful ways, by federal privacy statutes. And they are free to engage in just the kind of intrusive surveillance that Judge Leon insisted was an unreasonable search and seizure when conducted by the N.S.A.'b'In practice, the neo-Madisonian distinction between surveillance by the government and surveillance by Google makes little sense. It is true that, as Judge Pauley concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cPeople voluntarily surrender personal and seemingly private information to trans-national corporations which exploit that data for profit. Few think twice about it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But why? Why is it O.K. for AT&amp;T to know about our political, religious and sexual associations, but not the government?'b'You might say there is a difference between political and cultural information. If the government knows you attended a Rand Paul rally, it could punish you by auditing your tax returns. But if AT&amp;T knows, it might send you an ad for a Tea Party Tax Day protest.'b'That distinction is unconvincing. Once data is collected by private parties, the government will inevitably demand access.'b'More fundamentally, continuously tracking my location, whether by the government or AT&amp;T, is an affront to my dignity. When every step I take on- and off-line is recorded, so an algorithm can predict if I am a potential terrorist or a potential customer, I am being objectified and stereotyped, rather than treated as an individual, worthy of equal concern and respect.'b'Justice Louis Brandeis, the greatest defender of privacy in the 20th century, recognized this when he equated \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to be let alone\xe2\x80\x9d with offenses against honor and dignity.'b'But he also lamented that American law, unlike European law, was not historically concerned with offenses against what the Romans called honor and what in more modern terms we call dignity. European laws constrain private companies from sharing and collecting personal data far more than American laws do, largely because of the legacy of Madisonian ideas of individual freedom, which focus on liberty rather than dignity.'b'What Americans may now need is a constitutional amendment to prohibit unreasonable searches and seizures of our persons and electronic effects, whether by the government or by private corporations like Google and AT&amp;T.'b'Perhaps even Madison, who unsuccessfully proposed a preamble to the Constitution declaring \xe2\x80\x9cthat all power is originally rested in, and consequently derived from the people,\xe2\x80\x9d and that all people have basic natural rights, including \xe2\x80\x9cthe enjoyment of life and liberty\xe2\x80\x9d and the right of \xe2\x80\x9cpursuing and obtaining happiness and safety,\xe2\x80\x9d might have realized that our rights to enjoy liberty, and to obtain happiness and safety at the same time, are threatened as much by corporate as government surveillance.'b'In any event, it is clear that, to keep us secure against the 21st-century version of the general warrants that so alarmed Madison and the other founders, America needs a robust debate about amending the Constitution to meet the exigencies of our electronic age.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s face it: For the world\xe2\x80\x99s media, nothing beats a good story about a French politician\xe2\x80\x99s love life. Forget Bill Clinton, Jacob Zuma and Silvio Berlusconi. For some reason, it\xe2\x80\x99s always more fun in Paris. Reporters from around the globe descend on the City of Light, baffled by the same old question: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t the French care about their politicians\xe2\x80\x99 affairs? Across the Channel, by contrast, anything goes. Even The Financial Times got carried away with this story and, to make up for it, then printed a letter from a reader scolding it for putting \xe2\x80\x9ca photo of an attractive woman\xe2\x80\x9d on half of its front page.'b'The attractive woman is, of course, the actress Julie Gayet, with whom, according to reports in the gossip magazine Closer, President Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande has been secretly meeting in a private apartment not far from the \xc3\x89lys\xc3\xa9e. Upon learning from the president about the magazine\xe2\x80\x99s disclosures, Val\xc3\xa9rie Trierweiler, the first lady and his partner, broke down and had to be admitted to the hospital for \xe2\x80\x9ctests and rest.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'While the world\xe2\x80\x99s media have been concentrating on the collective \xe2\x80\x9cFrench shrug\xe2\x80\x9d over all this, the French themselves are trying to understand the president they elected 20 months ago. Sure enough, a poll showed that 77 percent of voters consider the alleged affair as part of his right to privacy. But this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean they don\xe2\x80\x99t care about it; it\xe2\x80\x99s just that the French are more concerned about other statistics: the unemployment rate which, at 10.9 percent, is twice as high as Germany\xe2\x80\x99s, or the government\xe2\x80\x99s abysmal approval ratings, stuck below 30 percent. Never before has a French president been so unpopular so early in his first term. Trust in political institutions is at an all-time low, and pessimism rules: 72 percent of the French fear their children will be worse off.'b'Which makes the lightness of Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande even more puzzling. The president who, as a candidate, promised that his behavior would be \xe2\x80\x9cexemplary\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 unlike that of his predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy \xe2\x80\x94 in fact never intended his behavior to be perfect. In Mr. Hollande\xe2\x80\x99s mind, we now know, \xe2\x80\x9cexemplary\xe2\x80\x9d meant discreet; he merely assumed that he could resume the old tradition of President Fran\xc3\xa7ois Mitterrand\xe2\x80\x99s secret double life. He just forgot that in the age of Twitter and WikiLeaks, secrets can\xe2\x80\x99t be kept for 20 years, let alone 20 months.'b'Perplexed by their president\xe2\x80\x99s economic indecisiveness since he took office, the French now learn that he is equally indecisive in his private life. And they have found out at the worst moment. After hesitating to address squarely the issue of radical economic reforms, after avoiding to cut public spending to reduce the fiscal deficit, after procrastinating on measures needed to restore the competitiveness of French companies, the president, having lost 20 months, finally decided that it was time to do all of the above.'b'This was the message he started to deliver to the nation in his traditional New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve address. Desperately aware of the sorry state of the economy \xe2\x80\x94 which, to be fair, this government inherited from the Sarkozy administration \xe2\x80\x94 the voters seemed to approve. One poll showed that three-quarters of the electorate was ready to go along with the proposal to cut taxes for companies if that would create more jobs.'b'The details of this major economic initiative were slated to be presented by the president at a press conference last Tuesday. Four days earlier, Closer struck. So what would Mr. Hollande do? At a packed press conference in the Salle des F\xc3\xaates at the \xc3\x89lys\xc3\xa9e, he switched from \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Normal\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Solemn,\xe2\x80\x9d acknowledged \xe2\x80\x9cpainful\xe2\x80\x9d moments in his private life but managed to elude six mild questions about it, and focused firmly on his plans for an economic turnaround.

Last year he chose to send troops to Mali when radical Islamists threatened to take over the capital, Bamako. And in December he again decided to intervene, under a United Nations mandate, to halt massacres in the Central African Republic.'b'People who have known Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande for a long time are amazed by his self-confidence and resilience. He is a man, they say, who even when in deep trouble always thinks that there is a way out. It is quite possible that he will again find a way out of this very public private crisis. There is no doubt that his image and personal credibility have suffered, but so far reactions to his press conference show that people have chosen not to be distracted from the work to be done on the economy.'b'I was Le Monde\xe2\x80\x99s correspondent in the United States during the Monica Lewinsky affair.

It was 'b'one of the first of its kind 'b' \xe2\x80\x93 and there are now 'b'hundreds 'b' of treatment programs throughout China and 'b'South Korea'b'. (The first inpatient Internet addiction program in the United States recently 'b'opened in Pennsylvania'b'.)'b'The program featured in this video admits teenagers, usually male, whose parents typically take them there against their will. Once inside, the children are kept behind bars and guarded by soldiers. Treatment, which often lasts three to four months, includes medication and therapy, and sometimes includes parents. Patients undergo military-inspired physical training, and their sleep and diet are carefully regulated. These techniques (some of which are also used in China 'b'to treat other behavioral disorders'b') are intended to help the patients reconnect with reality.'b'Yet after four months of filming in this center (for our documentary \xe2\x80\x9cWeb Junkie\xe2\x80\x9d), some vital questions remained: Are the children being accurately evaluated? And is the treatment effective? In many cases, it seemed parents were blaming the Internet for complex social and behavioral issues that may defy such interventions. (For example, we noticed that some patients experienced difficult family relationships, social introversion and a lack of friends in the physical world.) Tao Ran, the center\xe2\x80\x99s director, claims a 70 percent success rate. If that\xe2\x80\x99s true, perhaps China\xe2\x80\x99s treatment model is something other nations should embrace, however disturbing it may seem to outsiders. There is still no real global consensus among experts about what constitutes addiction to the Internet, and whether the concept even exists, particularly in a strict medical sense.'b'What is clear is that this issue is not confined to China. With millions (if not billions) glued to screens and electronic devices, the overuse of technology is becoming a universal, transnational concern.

According to an indictment unsealed last week by the Manhattan district attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office, post-9/11 phobias of airplanes and skyscrapers were among the fictitious ailments described by retired New York City police officers and firefighters who, in a scheme involving as many as 1,000 people, are accused of ripping off the Social Security disability system by filing false claims.'b'As an administrative law judge responsible for hearing Social Security disability cases, I\xe2\x80\x99m more familiar than most people with the system. But everyone has a right to be outraged by the recent charges. Officials estimate that the fraud cost the federal government $400 million. If true, it is the largest theft in the history of Social Security.'b'According to court papers, the fraudsters claimed to be so ill that they could not leave their homes to work, but many posted photographs on Facebook of themselves on motorcycles and water scooters, fishing and playing sports. How did they expect to get away with it?'b'Well, here\xe2\x80\x99s a little-known fact. Neither the staff members of the Social Security Administration, who review initial claims, nor judges like myself, who hear disputed cases, are allowed to look at Facebook in the context of a case. Even if something in the case file suggests a claimant is not telling the whole truth, Social Security Administration policy prevents us from looking at social media, for fear that we cannot be trusted to properly assess the information gathered there. No Facebook, no Pinterest, no Twitter, no Tumblr. None of the sources that most employers routinely use to check the credibility of potential employees are available to us.'b'It gets worse. When a disputed case comes before an administrative law judge, a vast majority of claimants bring an attorney. After all, the average claim, if successful, will yield a payout of some $300,000 in lifetime benefits. With so much at stake, it\xe2\x80\x99s only reasonable that a person who believes that he has wrongly been denied benefits would hire a lawyer. But isn\xe2\x80\x99t it equally reasonable that the taxpayers should have an attorney present to challenge a claim that might be false?'b'Sorry, no luck. When I conduct a hearing (which occurs with no members of the press or public present, because of privacy concerns), the claimant can bring an attorney, but the system does not provide the government with one. The taxpayers have no advocate on their behalf to ask questions, challenge medical evidence or review the 500 to 700 pages of materials that make up a typical case file. Not only that, but because of Social Security Administration policy, I am no longer allowed to order independent psychological testing to help determine whether a claimant is telling the truth.'b'Social Security disability courts have millions of claimants and constitute one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest judicial systems. But the system is not run by anyone with real judicial experience. Instead, we are at the mercy of unelected bureaucrats whose only concern is how many cases each judge can churn out and how fast we can do it. The Social Security Administration is currently run by an acting commissioner; President Obama should appoint a permanent leader with recognized professional experience in the field of social insurance.'b'The Association of Administrative Law Judges, for which I serve as president, favors modernizing disability hearings so that we can give claimants a fair hearing while also protecting taxpayers. Our courtrooms ought to look more like what you see on \xe2\x80\x9cLaw and Order\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cThe Good Wife.\xe2\x80\x9d Each side should have an advocate, allowing judges to narrow the facts in dispute and apply the law in a neutral manner. And judges and their staff members should be able to use social media, including Facebook.'b'Though it is not clear from the Manhattan district attorney\xe2\x80\x99s indictment if any of the claims in question ever wound up before an administrative law judge, it is clear than the current antiquated system handicaps the effective review of cases and encourages brazen behavior.'b'The system needs to be made more trustworthy and fully transparent. The actions of a few crooks must not be allowed to threaten the disability payments of millions of people who are genuinely disabled, many of whom paid into the disability insurance fund during their working lives. An adversarial system with both sides represented and all evidence on the table is the best way to root out fraud and ensure that legitimate claims are paid.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWHEN an American asks me this question, it\xe2\x80\x99s like a wall of ice crashing down between us.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The question my Moscow-born friend Galina was referring to had nothing to do with Putin, or Pussy Riot, or the culinary ethics of adding ketchup to your pirogi.

I have endured many painful minutes of elevator silence after my grandmother (who lived in the Soviet Union until moving to the United States in her 60s) delivered her stock response: \xe2\x80\x9cTerrible,\xe2\x80\x9d to which she might add, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Because being old is terrible.\xe2\x80\x9d Beat. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am very old.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Cue desperate thumbing of the \xe2\x80\x9cdoor open\xe2\x80\x9d button.'b'It feels as if I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent half my life trying to smooth over the bafflement of my American friends and the hurt feelings of my Russian expat family as a result of this innocuous inquiry. \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Fine\xe2\x80\x99 makes Russians think that Americans have no soul,\xe2\x80\x9d I explained recently to an American-born friend. \xe2\x80\x9cThat they just want to go home, eat a frozen dinner in front of the TV, and wait out the hours before going to work to make money again.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He laughed, then quickly sobered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, there\xe2\x80\x99s something to that.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But if the American \xe2\x80\x9cfine\xe2\x80\x9d can come off as plastic and insincere, the speed with which Russians unload intimate details is just as disturbing. I was born in Ukraine to Russian parents, but I grew up in the United States, and I get it. It\xe2\x80\x99s like, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know you, Random Russian Lady, so why are you showing me your rash?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The thing most Russians don\xe2\x80\x99t realize is that, in English, \xe2\x80\x9cHow are you?\xe2\x80\x9d isn\xe2\x80\x99t a question at all, but a form of \xe2\x80\x9chi,\xe2\x80\x9d like the Russian \xe2\x80\x9cprivyet!\xe2\x80\x9d The Americans weren\xe2\x80\x99t responsible for its transformation; that honor goes to the British. The Oxford English Dictionary defines the phrase\xe2\x80\x99s precursor, \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d as a common phrase \xe2\x80\x9coften used as a mere greeting or salutation.\xe2\x80\x9d The anodyne exchange dates at least as far back as 1604, to Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s Othello, where Desdemona asks her husband, \xe2\x80\x9cHow is\xe2\x80\x99t with you, my lord?\xe2\x80\x9d and Othello replies \xe2\x80\x9cWell, my good lady.\xe2\x80\x9d Even though he is half-mad with jealousy and only five scenes away from murdering her.'b'Whereas it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to read a particularly American optimism into the easy embrace of the auto-fine, Russians seem almost congenitally unable to fake fineness.'b'The Russian food critic and cultural historian Anya von Bremzen recently offered me an intriguing hypothesis as to why this might be the case. In Soviet days, proclamations of joy, enthusiasm and optimism were associated with state propaganda and officialese. As a citizen of a Communist utopia, you were pretty much supposed to feel fine all the time (never mind the time you spent squabbling over the communal stove or waiting in a two-hour line to buy toilet paper). So, Ms. von Bremzen explained, a moan or a complaint would be considered a more authentic, non-state-sanctioned response to \xe2\x80\x9chow are you.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I liked this theory, but my father scoffed when I suggested it was the Soviets who devalued \xe2\x80\x9cfine.\xe2\x80\x9d By way of explanation, a quote from Dostoyevsky arrived in my inbox: \xe2\x80\x9cThe most basic, most rudimentary spiritual need of the Russian people is the need for suffering, ever-present and unquenchable, everywhere and in everything.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s not such a bad thing. Psychologists at the University of Michigan have shown that, while Russians are, indeed, more prone to brooding than Americans, their open embrace of negative experiences might ultimately be healthier, resulting in fewer symptoms of depression.'b'Recently, when I looked through a few American guides on traveling to Russia, I was disappointed to find that they all suggested that tourists adopt the American approach to \xe2\x80\x9cHow are you\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9ckak dela\xe2\x80\x9d in Russian) and lob back a hearty \xe2\x80\x9cKhorosho!\xe2\x80\x9d My advice? Don\xe2\x80\x99t let \xe2\x80\x9cHow are you\xe2\x80\x9d be your Waterloo. Instead, take a vacation from fineness.'b'If you lack the Russian vocabulary to fully express your unquenchable suffering, fear not \xe2\x80\x94 a lot of angst and ambivalence can be packed into just a word or two. Try \xe2\x80\x9ctak-sebe\xe2\x80\x9d (so-so) or \xe2\x80\x9cnormalno\xe2\x80\x9d (the usual) or \xe2\x80\x9ceh\xe2\x80\x9d (eh). Even \xe2\x80\x9cfine\xe2\x80\x9d is fine. Injecting a world-weary sigh before your \xe2\x80\x9ckhorosho\xe2\x80\x9d can neatly reverse its meaning, or render it shorthand for that other, more satisfyingly nuanced, response: It\xe2\x80\x99s complicated.'b'The reality of rising American inequality is stark. Since the late 1970s real wages for the bottom half of the work force have 'b'stagnated or fallen'b', while the incomes of the top 1 percent have 'b'nearly quadrupled'b' (and the incomes of the top 0.1 percent have risen even more). While we can and should have a serious debate about what to do about this situation, the simple fact \xe2\x80\x94 American capitalism as currently constituted is undermining the foundations of middle-class society \xe2\x80\x94 shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be up for argument.'b'But it is, of course. Partly this reflects Upton Sinclair\xe2\x80\x99s famous dictum: It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it. But it also, I think, reflects distaste for the implications of the numbers, which seem almost like an open invitation to class warfare \xe2\x80\x94 or, if you prefer, a demonstration that class warfare is already underway, with the plutocrats on offense.'b'The result has been a determined campaign of statistical obfuscation. At its cruder end this campaign comes close to outright falsification; at its more sophisticated end it involves using fancy footwork to propagate what I think of as the myth of the deserving rich.'b'For an example of de facto falsification, one need look no further than a recent 'b'column'b' by Bret Stephens of The Wall Street Journal, which first accused President Obama (wrongly) of making a factual error, then proceeded to assert that rising inequality was no big deal, because everyone has been making big gains. Why, incomes for the bottom fifth of the U.S. population have risen 186 percent since 1979!'b'If this sounds wrong to you, it should: that\xe2\x80\x99s a nominal number, not corrected for inflation. You can find the inflation-corrected number in the same Census Bureau table; it shows incomes for the bottom fifth actually falling. Oh, and for the record, at the time of writing this elementary error had not been corrected on The Journal\xe2\x80\x99s website.'b'O.K., that\xe2\x80\x99s what crude obfuscation looks like. What about the fancier version?'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve noted before that conservatives seem fixated on the notion that poverty is basically'b' the result of character problems'b' among the poor. This may once have had a grain of truth to it, but for the past three decades and more the main obstacle facing the poor has been the lack of jobs paying decent wages. But the myth of the undeserving poor persists, and so does a counterpart myth, that of the deserving rich.'b'The story goes like this: America\xe2\x80\x99s affluent are affluent because they made the right lifestyle choices. They got themselves good educations, they got and stayed married, and so on. Basically, affluence is a reward for adhering to the Victorian virtues.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with this story? Even on its own terms, it postulates opportunities that don\xe2\x80\x99t exist. For example, how are children of the poor, or even the working class, supposed to get a good education in an era of declining support for and sharply rising tuition at public universities? Even social indicators like family stability are, to an important extent, economic phenomena: nothing takes a toll on family values like lack of employment opportunities.'b'But the main thing about this myth is that it misidentifies the winners from growing inequality. White-collar professionals, even if married to each other, are only doing O.K. The big winners are a much smaller group. The Occupy movement popularized the concept of the \xe2\x80\x9c1 percent,\xe2\x80\x9d which is a good shorthand for the rising elite, but if anything includes too many people: most of the gains of the top 1 percent have in fact gone to an even tinier elite, the top 0.1 percent.'b'And 'b'who are these lucky few'b'? Mainly they\xe2\x80\x99re executives of some kind, especially, although not only, in finance. You can argue about whether these people deserve to be paid so well, but one thing is clear: They didn\xe2\x80\x99t get where they are simply by being prudent, clean and sober.'b'So how can the myth of the deserving rich be sustained? Mainly through a strategy of distortion by dilution. You almost never see apologists for inequality willing to talk about the 1 percent, let alone the really big winners. Instead, they talk about the top 20 percent, or at best the top 5 percent. These may sound like innocent choices, but they\xe2\x80\x99re not, because they involve lumping in married lawyers with the wolves of Wall Street. The DiCaprio movie of that name, by the way, is 'b'wildly popular with finance types'b', who cheer on the title character \xe2\x80\x94 another clue to the realities of our new Gilded Age.'b'Again, I know that these realities make some people, not all of them hired guns for the plutocracy, uncomfortable, and they\xe2\x80\x99d prefer to paint a different picture. But even if the facts have a well-known populist bias, they\xe2\x80\x99re still the facts \xe2\x80\x94 and they must be faced.'b'New York is one of two states, the other being North Carolina, in which 16-year-olds are automatically tried as adults. This is the case despite overwhelming evidence that sending children into adult courts, rather than the juvenile justice system, needlessly destroys lives and further endangers the public by turning nonviolent youngsters into hardened criminals.'b'It is past time for New York to bring itself in line with the rest of the country. Gov. Andrew Cuomo took the first step in that direction this month when he announced that he would name a commission and order it to develop a plan by the end of the year for raising the age for adult criminal prosecution. The commission does not need to reinvent the wheel. But it will need to recommend changes in laws and procedures, and in this it can profit from studying 'b'Connecticut'b', which recently carried out raise-the-age legislation of its own.'b'The New York law came about in 1962, when the state created the juvenile justice system under the Family Court Act. At the time, lawmakers were unable to agree on the age at which offenders should be declared adults; they set it temporarily at 16, pending further hearings. But as often happens with public policy, inertia set in and \xe2\x80\x9ctemporary\xe2\x80\x9d became permanent.'b'The result is that New York channels nearly 40,000 adolescents a year into the criminal courts \xe2\x80\x94 most of them charged with nonviolent crimes like fare-beating in the subways, marijuana possession and shoplifting. The consequences have been especially disastrous for black and Latino young people, who are overrepresented among those arrested and disproportionately at risk of having their lives ruined by encounters with the criminal justice system.'b'Much has been learned since the 1960s. Federally financed studies, for instance, have shown that minors prosecuted as adults commit more violent crimes later on and are more likely to become career criminals than those sent through juvenile courts, where they receive counseling and family support. Beyond that, neurological science has shown that adolescents are less able to assess risks and make the kinds of mature decisions that would keep them out of trouble.'b'Connecticut wisely adopted a strategy based on rehabilitation, not lockups, reducing arrests and saving the state money. It raised the age of adult criminal prosecution from 16 to 18 in 2007; the change was phased in, taking full effect in 2012. As preparation, the Legislature created a council of experts from law enforcement, mental health and other fields to coordinate policy changes. The courts stopped taking cases involving nonthreatening adolescent misbehavior, like possession of tobacco. The state invested in counseling and intervention programs that allow young people to make amends for minor misdeeds without going to court.'b'Some good ideas are already in circulation in New York, the result of an earlier commission study. Some of them have been incorporated into a bill submitted to the Legislature by New York State\xe2\x80\x99s chief judge, Jonathan Lippman, calling for a special court for 16- and 17-year-olds charged with nonviolent crimes. The new commission may end up supporting a more comprehensive approach in which all but the most serious offenses by anyone under the age of 18 would be handled in juvenile court. In any case, New York is way overdue for change.'b'For all its signature dysfunction, the Federal Election Commission has a staff of professionals working to track big money and shady behavior in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s congressional and presidential campaigns.'b'A dramatic \xe2\x80\x94 and until now overlooked \xe2\x80\x94 example of good staff work surfaced this month in a finding that Crossroads GPS, the shadowy, money-raising monolith of Karl Rove and other Republican strategists, probably broke the election law in 2010 when it claimed that much of its blatantly partisan campaign activities were \xe2\x80\x9csocial welfare\xe2\x80\x9d initiatives.'b'The staff report properly recommended an in-depth investigation of the Rove operation, suggesting it should be registered as a political committee that would have to disclose its donors, instead of concealing them under the guise of social beneficence. The investigation never happened. The six commissioners split 3 to 3, along party lines, a familiar standoff engineered in recent years by Republicans to stifle the F.E.C.\xe2\x80\x99s role as the enforcer of fair election campaigning.'b'Voters should see this outcome for what it is \xe2\x80\x94 further evidence of the power of machine politicians to mock election law as they raise and spend vast amounts of money to the tune of \xe2\x80\x9cAnything Goes.\xe2\x80\x9d The power of the Rove machine (and, of course, its big-money Democratic imitators) grows exponentially with each election.'b'The F.E.C. should be scrapped in favor of a nonpartisan and independent board capable of decisive action, not the contrived deadlock that compounds the risk of big-money campaign corruption.'b'Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez took testosterone lozenges before games. He applied testosterone cream every evening and injected H.G.H. regularly. And yet he never failed a drug test. Evidence that he broke antidoping rules surfaced through other channels. In January 2013, 'b'The Miami New Times'b' linked a \xe2\x80\x9crejuvenation\xe2\x80\x9d clinic \xe2\x80\x94 Biogenesis of America \xe2\x80\x94 to Rodriguez and other players, putting in motion an investigation by Major League Baseball, which culminated in a 162-game suspension for Rodriguez and an official report, released last week, 'b'detailing his regimen'b'.'b'Nor was he the only player to use drugs and evade detection. A majority of the players suspended in the current scandal pulled off the same feat. This might seem like an indictment of M.L.B.\xe2\x80\x99s testing process, which Biogenesis-founder Anthony Bosch called \xe2\x80\x9calmost a cakewalk\xe2\x80\x9d in a recent 'b'interview'b' with \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But in fairness to the league, the tests weren\xe2\x80\x99t a cakewalk for everyone. Melky Cabrera and Bartolo Colon, among other players, failed. And league officials have adapted quickly to doping innovations. Through 2012, the league flagged tests for further review if a player\xe2\x80\x99s testosterone-to-epitestosterone ratio exceeded four to one. Players like Rodriguez apparently found it possible to stay within acceptable levels by using fast-acting synthetic testosterone. Once the league recognized this fact, in early 2013, it switched to a \xe2\x80\x9cbiological passport\xe2\x80\x9d system. Now it tracks ratios over time, and flags fluctuations.'b'It is hard to say whether the new protocol could have caught Mr. Rodriguez and other Biogenesis clients. 'b'No major-league player'b' tested positive for steroids in 2013, which might mean that the process is a deterrent, or that some players have already found a loophole. There is always more the league could do to root out steroid use, like more routine use of the highly sensitive carbon isotope test. But realistically, it may be that testing alone will never be enough, and that other methods, like investigations by journalists or the league, will always play a role.'b'If the Air Force cheating scandal disclosed last week were a singular event, it would be easier to accept Pentagon assurances that America\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear deterrence and military readiness have not been compromised. But it is the latest in a series of breaches that have raised alarms about discipline and competency in the Air Force.'b'On Wednesday, the 'b'Air Force said'b' that 34 officers responsible for launching land-based nuclear missiles were pulled off the job and their security clearances suspended for cheating, or failing to report cheating, on tests that assess their knowledge of how to operate and launch nuclear weapons. They are based at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, home to 150 Minuteman 3 intercontinental ballistic missiles. The cheating was discovered during an investigation into illegal drug possession in which 11 officers, including two accused in the cheating scandal, were under suspicion.'b'Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James called the behavior \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely unacceptable\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 as is the continuing pattern of misconduct. Last month, an Air Force inquiry revealed that the general who oversaw some of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear weapons was dismissed for drunken antics during an official trip to Moscow last summer.'b'Last year, the service removed 17 officers assigned to stand watch over the missiles in Minot, N.D., after finding safety violations, potential violations in protecting codes and other problems. The setbacks for the nuclear mission go back to 2008, when there was an inadvertent cross-country transport of six nuclear-tipped missiles on a B-52 bomber whose pilot did not know they were aboard. Then Defense Secretary Robert Gates fired the top two Air Force officials, but problems have persisted.'b'A RAND Corporation study, reported by The A.P. in November, found \xe2\x80\x9cburnout\xe2\x80\x9d among launch officers and broader behavioral issues, like sexual assaults and domestic violence. It said that in 2011 and 2012, court-martial rates in the nuclear missile force were more than twice as high as in the overall Air Force; written reprimands for rule violations and other misbehavior were also higher.'b'The nuclear force is afflicted by morale problems because its mission has lost cachet in an era when the nation\xe2\x80\x99s focus is on terrorism and cyber threats. Experts say the Air Force has made it hard for missile operators to transfer into cyber, drone or space operations, which have more potential for promotion.'b'Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is willing to consider additional incentives to bolster these troops. The scandals should force America to think more broadly about the purpose of its vast and increasingly obsolete nuclear arsenal, and how the nation could be safer with far fewer weapons.'b'This year America will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, a candidate for the greatest legislative accomplishment of the last century. We will recall the presidents who launched (J.F.K.) and landed (L.B.J.) this profound if incomplete attempt to repair the damage racism had done to our democracy and our humanity. We will esteem the leaders and martyrs of the movement that forced the issue onto our national conscience, including the man we honor on this holiday. We will recall, too, the Southern Democrats who stood \xe2\x80\x94 and stalled \xe2\x80\x94 in defense of segregation, and the Republicans who later capitalized on the outcome with a cynical appeal to white resentment. We will lament the current attempts by several states, with the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s blessing, to roll back the basic franchise promised in the Civil Rights Act (and reinforced by the Voting Rights Act the following year). And we will probably invoke the legacy of this great law many times as we debate the status of millions of undocumented residents and the rights of gay Americans.'b'Somewhere in all this worthy commemoration we should pause to pay homage to a conservative white Republican named William Moore McCulloch. Never heard of him? Neither had I. But there is a good case to be made that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 would not have become law without him. And there is a very good case to be made that Washington desperately needs his example today.'b'McCulloch was a congressman from a rural, conservative district in west central Ohio. He was frugal with the taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 money, favored allowing prayer in schools and keeping the federal government out of them, voted against foreign aid and gun control. These views were sufficiently in sync with his constituents that voters re-elected him 12 times.'b'With a district that was 2.7 percent black, he had no political incentive to stick his neck out on something as contentious as civil rights. But McCulloch was descended from abolitionists, and had been appalled by his exposure to Jim Crow when he worked as a young lawyer in Florida. This fortified in him a strong belief that the blessings of the Constitution were not meant exclusively for white men, and that it was the highest duty of the federal government to secure those blessings for all.'b'Moreover \xe2\x80\x94 quaint as this may seem today \xe2\x80\x94 he believed that principles were not things to be surrendered to polls and lobbyists and that clamorous mob called \xe2\x80\x9cthe base.\xe2\x80\x9d On the wall of his district office in Piqua, Ohio, McCulloch displayed a framed excerpt from Edmund Burke\xe2\x80\x99s message to the electors of Bristol: \xe2\x80\x9cYour representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Kennedy and Johnson administrations knew they would need a large contingent of Republicans to get the civil rights bill past the segregationist Southern Democrats who held the commanding heights on Capitol Hill. And so they sent an emissary to McCulloch, who was the senior Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, and enlisted him as a partner. He agreed to an active collaboration with the Democratic White House, an alliance hard to imagine today and even then viewed by some in his party as bordering on treason. He had two conditions. First, if McCulloch helped get a strong bill through the House, he insisted the president would not allow it to be weakened in the Senate, where the oligarchy of Southern Democrats had successfully filibustered past civil rights measures until they were rendered toothless. Second, McCulloch wanted assurances that Republicans would share the credit for passage.'b'McCulloch\xe2\x80\x99s story is rescued from obscurity in Todd Purdum\xe2\x80\x99s forthcoming account of the great battle, \xe2\x80\x9cAn Idea Whose Time Has Come: Two Presidents, Two Parties, and the Battle for the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\xe2\x80\x9d Purdum, a former New York Times colleague who now writes for Vanity Fair and Politico, has composed a suspenseful legislative procedural that is a synthesis of history and fresh reporting. His account of the Civil Rights Act is rich in characters, including other Republicans instrumental in passing the landmark bill, like Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois and Representative Charles Halleck of Indiana, the Republican leader in the House. (Those were the days when \xe2\x80\x9cparty of Lincoln\xe2\x80\x9d actually meant something.) But Purdum has a particular affection for Bill McCulloch, who became, as one legislative aide put it, \xe2\x80\x9cthe conscience of the bill.\xe2\x80\x9d McCulloch assured the bill was the toughest and most enforceable that could muster a majority, and he stiffened the spines of President Johnson and his attorney general, Robert Kennedy, when the opposition got tough. The Southerners\xe2\x80\x99 filibuster dragged on for 57 days but was ended without major concessions, the first time supporters had ever broken a filibuster on a civil rights bill.'b'The final version outlawed discrimination in hotels, restaurants and other public accommodations. It empowered the attorney general to bring suit to desegregate public schools. It prohibited discrimination in hiring, and let victims of such discrimination seek redress in the courts. And it expanded protection of the right to vote, which would be greatly strengthened the following year. (Yes, McCulloch was a champion of the Voting Rights Act, too.) In the end, the Civil Rights Act passed with a larger percentage of Republicans in support than Democrats.'b'Among the documents found in McCulloch\xe2\x80\x99s papers years after his death was a handwritten and unusually heartfelt letter from the former first lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, who wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cYour integrity under such pressures is what makes our political system worth fighting for and dying for. Please forgive the emotional tone of this letter \xe2\x80\x94 but I want you to know how much your example means to me. It is a light of hope in an often dark world, and one I shall raise my children on as they grow older.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It is political writ in today\xe2\x80\x99s Washington that you can be a person of conviction or a compromiser, but not both. McCulloch believed that principles and pragmatism were not only compatible, but that the combination was the bedrock of representative democracy.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe function of Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, in a farewell speech to House colleagues on his retirement, \xe2\x80\x9cis not to convert the will of the majority of the people into law; rather its function is to hammer out on the anvil of public debate a compromise between polar positions acceptable to a majority.\xe2\x80\x9d In contrast to the direct democracy of a town meeting, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is less clear that there is a losing side.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnyone, of course, can introduce grandiose legislative schemes,\xe2\x80\x9d he noted on another occasion. \xe2\x80\x9cBut reaching for the sky, rather than aiming for the possible, is a form of showmanship we don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to engage in. Reality is what we live by and accomplishment is what we seek. For only in compromise, moderation and understanding are we able to fashion our society into a cohesive and durable structure.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'You would be hard pressed to find a McCulloch in today\xe2\x80\x99s Congress of zero-sum partisans and base-whipped invertebrates. Lawmakers now, as President Kennedy said of purists who favored a civil rights bill that was maximalist but unwinnable, \xe2\x80\x9cwould rather have an issue than a bill.\xe2\x80\x9d The handful of surviving legislators in the McCulloch mold seem to be retiring. There are members of the ruling House majority who occasionally show signs of wanting to make law rather than make bumper-sticker slogans, but they are too often beaten back into line. In that category we can count the man who now represents McCulloch\xe2\x80\x99s hometown of Piqua, Ohio: John Andrew Boehner.'b'In the House of Representatives there is an imposing two-story amphitheater called the National Statuary Hall, to which each state may contribute two marble or bronze likenesses of favorite historical figures. Ohio is represented by President James A. Garfield and William Allen, a former senator and governor known as a champion of westward expansion. Allen was also, as it happens, a champion of slavery, and a few years ago the state began a campaign to replace him. The names of 10 Ohioans were put to voters in a statewide ballot. Bill McCulloch came in fourth, after Thomas Edison, the Wright Brothers and Jesse Owens. I can\xe2\x80\x99t argue with the result, but in this year when our commitment to equality is both remembered and tested, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it nice to imagine the message a statue of Bill McCulloch would have sent?'b'NAIROBI, Kenya \xe2\x80\x94  African leaders are often asked to look to countries like Singapore and Taiwan for examples of the transformative impact that clean, effective government can have in turning around a nation\xe2\x80\x99s economy. But they might do better to look closer to home.'b'Those models are certainly valid: The \xe2\x80\x9cAsian Tigers\xe2\x80\x9d lifted millions of people out of poverty by relying on an efficient public sector based on rigid meritocracy and little tolerance for corruption. But, oddly enough, it was the reverse of these very conditions in Kenya \xe2\x80\x94 the realities of corruption, nepotism and sheer inefficiency of the state telecommunications monopoly \xe2\x80\x94 that helped inspire a banking and finance revolution that is spreading from sub-Saharan Africa to India, Afghanistan and beyond.'b'There are few more stunning success stories in the developing world than the explosion in the use of mobile phone money transfers. The service has brought millions of people into the formal financial system, hobbled crime by substituting cash for pin-secured virtual accounts, and created tens of thousands of jobs. It is important to bear in mind that these achievements were spurred in no small way by the inefficiency of what came before. Africans took to mobile phones with such great enthusiasm because the alternatives were so dire. In Kenya, the land lines maintained by the state monopoly were more regularly out of use than in service. Telephone booths were legendary for gobbling shillings to no purpose.'b'The Kenya Posts &amp; Telecommunications Corporation was a model of the ills of political patronage. A 2005 audit of one of its successors, Telkom Kenya, found the company had hundreds of idle employees whose major qualification was their political connections. Eighty percent of the recurrent expenditures went to labor costs, including the salaries of over 2,000 messengers and porters with job descriptions that \xe2\x80\x94 in a company with far more drivers than vehicles \xe2\x80\x94 were vague at best. Overall, the corporation had one employee for every 28 customers; the industry\xe2\x80\x99s international standard is 1 for every 400. Its revenue per employee was $14 against an international average of $120.'b'The Kenyan mobile giant Safaricom was spun off this sprawling morass of inefficiency. Because it was largely given the room to operate using rational management practices, it grew to become the biggest company in East Africa by revenue and Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s largest taxpayer. In partnership with Vodafone, it went on to form M-Pesa (Pesa is a Swahili word for money), which allows subscribers to use a pin-secured virtual bank account on their mobile phones. Each account can hold a maximum of just over $1,000 at any time. This transforms the phone into a mobile wallet. Using a text message, one can send money to a friend, buy goods in a supermarket, settle utility bills or pay for a cab without using cash.'b'Launched in 2007, there are now 18 million active subscribers to the service. In 2012 M-Pesa processed transactions amounting to 31 percent of the country\xe2\x80\x99s G.D.P. of about $37 billion.'b'Similar money transfer platforms have been adopted in many other countries where many people don\xe2\x80\x99t have formal bank accounts. The leading mobile money firm in India counts 75 million subscribers on its network, and other such services have taken off from Qatar to Tanzania to Afghanistan.'b'It would be superficial to argue that the mobile phone industry\xe2\x80\x99s success in sub-Saharan Africa proves the merits of privatization in every instance. There also have been failures, including a botched privatization of railroad services in East Africa. The question of less-versus-more government involvement leads to a cul-de-sac of ideological debate. The past 50 years have shown that both approaches can work.'b'Freed from Soviet domination, for example, the Czech Republic and Estonia followed the free market path with notable success. On the other hand, Singapore and Taiwan opted for significant state involvement. Much depends upon the circumstances, but what matters most is the quality of leadership. The impact of efficient management on the lives of ordinary people and on job growth is undeniable. There were approximately 65,000 M-Pesa agents in Kenya at the end of 2013 \xe2\x80\x94 each employing one or two cashiers.'b'Can this success be replicated in other sectors, like Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s inefficient power, transportation and health services? Evidently so. A recent report by the International Budget Partnership, a Washington-based nonprofit organization that campaigns for transparency in how governments manage public funds, pointed out that while the Kenyan national health insurance fund spent 45 percent of its budget on administration expenses in 2010, the administration costs for its Estonian equivalent were less than 1 percent.'b'Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s government leaders would do well to ask which industrial sectors can be run like Safaricom. This is not a call for blanket privatization. We Africans should drop the ideological debates over whether we need less or more government and heed the pragmatic advice of the great Ghanaian Pan-Africanist Kwame Nkrumah: \xe2\x80\x9cWe face neither East nor West; We face forward.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'\n'b'Murithi Mutiga 'b'is an editor at the Nation Media Group in Kenya.'b''b'LONDON \xe2\x80\x94  We live in the age of the Twitter-bashing bore. It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy, being of a certain generation, to avoid the dinner conversation that veers into a lament about the short attention spans, constant device distraction, sad superficiality and online exhibitionism of a younger generation geared to life in 140 characters or less.'b'You have to duck under the table or at least bite your lip as yet another jeremiad about the depredations of social media unfurls. How the screen has taken over. How flirting is not what it used to be. How genuine experience is being lost. It is as if baby boomers had all fallen prey to some collective amnesia about the fact that our parents, equally, understood nothing about how we communicated, how we interacted, how we dated and how we mated.'b'They had no idea. We have no idea, either.'b'More things do not change than do. In the unchanging category falls the curmudgeonly tendencies of the aging, however open-minded they like to believe they are. Seduced by all the 60-is-the-new-40 babble, they fail to see that their irritation about Twitter, Snapchat and the rest is in essence irritation at the new, and that in their grumbling the most potent factors are incomprehension and sheer incapacity.'b'The onset of printing and the advent of the book certainly left monks seething in the seclusion of their cells, grumbling about how nothing could replace the experience of the illuminated manuscript for depth and seriousness, and how the vulgar masses would succumb to the ephemeral thrill of the printed page.'b'It was not so very long ago that the French poet St\xc3\xa9phane Mallarm\xc3\xa9 penned these words about uncut pages: \xe2\x80\x9cThe uncut folding of the book still invites the kind of sacrifice that made the red edges of ancient tomes bleed; the introduction of a weapon or paper-knife, confirming appropriation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Well, we have survived printing, books and even uncut pages in them. We will survive Kindle, too, even if appropriation is now bloodless, no more than pressure on a button or a page-turning movement applied to a screen, the simulacra of physical gestures for a digital age.'b'The whole 140-character thing is, of course, a canard anyway. Worse, it is a betrayal of ignorance. The genius of Twitter is instantaneousness and compression. It is solipsistic, a form of narcissism, at the same time as being the ne plus ultra of outreach. Its essence is the link. Through links, tweets are in fact very long, so long that Twitter is a great way to waste time; in fact I hardly recall any longer how I wasted time before Twitter. It is also a great scattershot way to stumble on the unexpected or the enriching.'b'Repeat after me: Thou shalt not complain about social media or judge the habits of a generation you do not understand.'b'Remember, boomers, born, say, in the mid-1950s, that you were lucky, arriving midway between the atomic bomb and the release of the Beatles\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cRubber Soul,\xe2\x80\x9d at the start of a postwar boom that would endure for decades, on the free side of the Iron Curtain, in a Europe embarking on the \xe2\x80\x9cever closer union\xe2\x80\x9d that stopped the self-destruction of the first half of the 20th century, safe from the Nazi death factories, too late for the trenches, not too late for flower power, in time for the hippie trail to Kabul, and in line for the sexual sweet spot between the arrival of the Pill and the onset of AIDS. As Philip Larkin noted, \xe2\x80\x9cSexual intercourse began/ In nineteen sixty-three.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Such luck could not but build forms of amnesia. Weren\xe2\x80\x99t things always this good and love always this free? The distance between our parents\xe2\x80\x99 generation that had known the war and our own insouciant band was not easy to bridge. We should not fall prey to new forms of amnesia when it comes to the Facebook generation.'b'Sure, screen addiction can be disconcerting. Philip Roth may well have been right when he told Le Monde last year that, \xe2\x80\x9cMy prediction is that in 30 years, if not sooner, there will be just as many people reading serious fiction in America as now read Latin poetry. A percentage do. But the number of people who find in literature a highly desirable source of sustaining pleasure and mental stimulation is sadly diminished.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But equally, I suspect, we have little notion of what the new forms of \xe2\x80\x9csustaining pleasure\xe2\x80\x9d are and what unexpected fruit they will yield.'b'And we can always fall back on the unchanging truths, like these lines from Walter Benjamin I stumbled on the other day: \xe2\x80\x9cWork on a good piece of writing proceeds on three levels: a musical one, where it is composed; an architectural one, where it is constructed; and finally, a textile one, where it is woven.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'They, too, in time will discover this. And if they don\xe2\x80\x99t, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine too.'b'As the Winter Olympic Games approach next month in Russia, it is hard to tell whether President Vladimir Putin wants to play the role of genial host or homophobic scold. In remarks Friday to workers preparing the Games, the autocratic Russian leader sought to reassure visitors to Sochi. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can feel relaxed and calm,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He then added: \xe2\x80\x9cBut please, leave the children alone.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Putin could not resist restirring the controversy he created in having his obeisant legislature, the Duma, approve a misbegotten law that bans subjecting children to \xe2\x80\x9chomosexual propaganda.\xe2\x80\x9d Somehow Mr. Putin imagines this to be a major threat to Russian society. Now, apparently, he seeks to protect them from visitors to the Games.'b'To anyone who accuses him of being patently antigay, Mr. Putin draws an elaborate distinction. \xe2\x80\x9cWe do not have a ban on nontraditional sexual relationships,\xe2\x80\x9d he said Friday. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a ban on the propaganda of homosexuality and pedophilia.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s steely enthusiasm for the topic might be dismissed as just a personal derangement but for the fact that it has prompted hateful new state laws encouraging the persecution of gays and supporters of gay tolerance.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t arrest anyone,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Putin sought to reassure the world. But of course laws like the child propaganda statute are so irresponsible and vague that they can be left to individual judgment by the throngs of local police, soldiers and state intelligence agents charged with protecting the Games.'b'Mr. Putin should keep in mind his own nation\xe2\x80\x99s history of easy Kremlin hatefulness toward all manner of dissidents. His repeated and clumsy references to what are essentially his own prejudices, since glorified by the state, only make Sochi more political and less inviting to world visitors.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s stipulate up front that there is no great sport in hunting a black rhinoceros, especially not in Namibia\xe2\x80\x99s open countryside. The first morning we went out tracking in the northern desert there, we nosed around in vehicles for several hours until our guides spotted a rhino a half mile off. Then we hiked quietly up into a high valley. There, a rhino mom with two huge horns stood calmly in front of us next to her calf, as if triceratops had come back to life, at a distance of 200 yards. We shot them, relentlessly, with our cameras.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s also accept, nolo contendere, that trophy hunters are \xe2\x80\x9ccoldhearted, soulless zombies.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s how protesters put it following the recent $350,000 winning bid for the right to trophy hunt a black rhino in Namibia. Let\xe2\x80\x99s acknowledge, finally, that we are in the middle of a horrific global war on rhinos, managed by criminal gangs and driven by a perverse consumer appetite for rhino horn in Southeast Asia.'b'Even so, auctioning the right to kill a black rhino in Namibia is an entirely sound idea, good for conservation and good for rhinos in particular.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s why: Namibia is just about the only place on earth to have gotten conservation right for rhinos and, incidentally, a lot of other wildlife. Over the past 20 years, it has methodically repopulated one area after another as its rhino population has steadily increased. As a result, it is now home to 1,750 of the roughly 5,000 black rhinos surviving in the wild. (The worldwide population of Africa\xe2\x80\x99s two rhino species, black and the more numerous white, plus three species in Asia, is about 28,000.) In neighboring South Africa, government officials stood by haplessly as poachers slaughtered almost a thousand rhinos last year alone. Namibia lost just two.'b'To be fair, Namibia has the advantage of being home to only 2.1 million people in an area twice the size of California \xe2\x80\x94 about seven per square mile, versus about 100 in South Africa. But Namibia\xe2\x80\x99s success is also the product of a bold political decision in the 1990s to turn over ownership of the wildlife to communal conservancies \xe2\x80\x94 run not by white do-gooders, but by black ranchers and herders, some of whom had, until then, also been poachers.'b'The idea was to encourage villagers living side by side with wildlife to manage and profit from it by opening up their conservation lands to wealthy big-game hunters and tourists armed with cameras. The hunters come first, because the conservancies don\xe2\x80\x99t need to make any investment to attract them. Tourist lodges are costly, so they tend to come later, or prove impractical in some areas. The Ministry of Environment and Tourism sets limits on all hunting, and because rhino horn is such a precious commodity, rhinos remain under strict national control.'b'The theory behind the conservancy idea was that tolerance for wildlife would increase and poaching would dwindle, because community ownership made the illegal killing feel like stealing from the neighbors. And it has worked. Community conservancies now control almost 20 percent of Namibia \xe2\x80\x94 44 percent of the country enjoys some form of conservation protection \xe2\x80\x94 and wildlife numbers have soared. The mountain zebra population, for instance, has increased to 27,000 from 1,000 in 1982. Elephants, gunned down elsewhere for their ivory, have gone to 20,000, up from 15,000 in 1995. Lions, on the brink of extinction from Senegal to Kenya, are increasing in Namibia.'b'Under an international agreement on trade in endangered species, Namibia can sell hunting rights for as many as five black rhinos per year, though it generally stops at three. The entire trophy fee, in this case $350,000, goes into a trust fund that supports rhino conservation efforts. The fund pays, for instance, to capture rhinos and implant transmitters in their horns, as an anti-poaching measure. Trophy hunting one rhino may thus save many others from being butchered.'b'Many wildlife groups also support the program because Namibia manages it so carefully. It chooses which individual will be hunted, and wildlife officials go along to make sure the hunter gets the right one. (So much for the romance of the Great White Hunter.) The program targets older males past their breeding prime. They\xe2\x80\x99re typically belligerent individuals that have a territorial tendency to kill females and calves.'b'So why the uproar this time? Namibia made the mistake of allowing the auction to take place in the United States rather than on its own turf. The outraged response started with a kind of Stephen Colbert bump in October. (\xe2\x80\x9cIf you love something, set it free,\xe2\x80\x9d the comedian declared. \xe2\x80\x9cThen, when it has a bit of a head start, open fire.\xe2\x80\x9d) And it culminated last week in death threats, including one to the auction-sponsoring Dallas Safari Club promising, \xe2\x80\x9cFor every rhino you kill, we will kill a member of the club.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Protecting wildlife is a complicated, expensive and morally imperfect enterprise, often facing insuperable odds. The risk with trophy hunting is twofold: Commodifying an endangered species creates a gray zone in which bad behaviors can seem acceptable, and the public relations disaster this time could hurt Namibia\xe2\x80\x99s entire conservation effort. But so far nothing else matches trophy hunting for paying the bills. For people outraged by this hunt, here\xe2\x80\x99s a better way to deal with it: Go to Namibia. Visit the conservancies, spend your money and have one of the great wildlife experiences of your life. You will see that this country is doing grand, ambitious things for conservation. And you may come away wondering whether Americans, who struggle to live with species as treacherous as, say, the prairie dog, should really be telling Namibians how to run their wildlife.'b''b'\n'b'Richard Conniff 'b' is the author of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Species Seekers: Heroes, Fools, and the Mad Pursuit of Life on Earth.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b''b''b' 'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Twinned Cities Now Following Different Paths'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cOne-Party Rule\xe2\x80\x9d series, front page, Jan. 13):'b'The differing experiences of Superior, Wis., and Duluth, Minn., can be summed up briefly: In Superior, employers feel bullied and robbed, and vote Republican, while in Duluth, it\xe2\x80\x99s employees who feel that way, and who vote Democratic.'b'Speaking as an employee myself, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather live in Minnesota.

The hobby was new, but some underlying affinity for it must have always been there.'b'My colleague Peter Baker, the author of 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDays of Fire: Bush and Cheney in the White House,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' recalled a particular aspect of the two-hour bike rides that Bush took during his years in office.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe would tell people that he was happy to have them bike along with him but that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want anyone biking in front of him, because he wanted the illusion of being alone,\xe2\x80\x9d Baker told me.'b'Remnick writes that during the 2008 presidential campaign, Obama \xe2\x80\x9ctook a vow of \xe2\x80\x98no new friends.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d When he now goes to fund-raisers, \xe2\x80\x9che would rather eat privately with a couple of aides before going out to perform.\xe2\x80\x9d He watches sports in privacy; tries not to miss his nightly dinner with Michelle and the girls; shoots hoops with an established crew; golfs with the usual suspects.'b'Remnick mentions that since 2009, one aide has golfed with Obama more than 100 times, while John Boehner has done so just once.'b'Commentators and even members of Congress upbraid Obama for this routinely. And rightly. One senator, telling me about the outsize elation of a fellow lawmaker who had finally been permitted to putt with the leader of the free world, theorized that Obama doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fully appreciate the dazzle of presidential proximity and the favor that it can win him.'b'Maybe. Or maybe he just can\xe2\x80\x99t give up that much of himself and his down time \xe2\x80\x94 as a matter of pacing, as a matter of sanity. Maybe the surest way for him to keep his eye on the ball and his spirits out of the sand traps is to compartmentalize the glad-handing, cordon off the hubbub. Maybe insufficient outreach is inextricable from perseverance.'b'For Obama and Bush, poise and detachment go hand in hand. Their campaigns succeeded in large measure because of steadiness \xe2\x80\x94 the trumpeted \xe2\x80\x9cmessage discipline\xe2\x80\x9d of the Bush troops, the famed \xe2\x80\x9cno drama\xe2\x80\x9d of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s operation \xe2\x80\x94 and this approach required candidates who could tune out and float above the ever-changing highs, lows, mock outrages and invented scandals of the modern news cycle, with its amplified noise, its extra distractions, its exhausting velocity. This required candidates good at building walls around themselves, and at constructing and sticking to comfort zones in which they could recharge.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cStylistically, the two presidents had much more in common than I expected,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Robert Gates, the former defense secretary, in his new memoir, \xe2\x80\x9cDuty.\xe2\x80\x9d He reports that neither had much zest for wooing Congress or cultivated all that many friends. \xe2\x80\x9cBoth presidents, in short, seemed to me to be very aloof.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That description applied to many previous presidents, too. But the snugness of its fit for Obama and Bush makes me wonder if, when we talk about how isolating the presidency is, we neglect to consider how deft at isolation some of the people who attain it already are \xe2\x80\x94 and, going forward, may have to be.'b'Not long after I got back from my recent trip to Brazil, I called some economists to gain a better understanding of where the country stood economically. To me, Rio de Janeiro felt a little like Shanghai: there was plenty of high-end shopping in neighborhoods like Ipanema \xe2\x80\x94 and plenty of poverty in the favelas, or slums. There was also a lot in between. What is most striking to a visitor is how many middle-class citizens there seem to be. Cars were everywhere; traffic jams, I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to believe, are a sign of a growing middle class. It means people have enough money to buy automobiles.'b'What I saw was no illusion. Though its starting point was quite extreme, Brazil is a country that has seen 'b'income inequality drop over the last decade'b'. 'b'Unemployment is at near record lows'b'. And the growth of the middle class is quite stunning. By most estimates, upward of 'b'40 million people have been pulled out of poverty'b' in the last decade; extreme poverty, says the government, has been reduced by 89 percent. Per capita income has continued to grow even as G.D.P. growth has slowed.'b'Nevertheless, the economists I spoke to were uniformly bearish about the short-term future of the Brazilian economy. They pointed, for starters, to that slowdown in G.D.P., which they didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect to pick up anytime soon. Despite the country\xe2\x80\x99s enormous economic gains since the beginning of this century, there has been very little accompanying productivity gains. Indeed, several economists told me that the main reason unemployment was so low was that the economy was terribly inefficient. Too much of the economy was in the hands of the state, I was told, and, what\xe2\x80\x99s more, it was a consumption-based economy that lacked necessary investment. And on and on. I got the sense that many economists believe that Brazil had been more lucky than good, and now its luck was running out. In a recent article about the Brazilian economy, The Economist put it starkly: \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Deterioration'b',\xe2\x80\x9d read its headline.'b'As I listened to the economists, though, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking about our own economy. Our 'b'G.D.P. growth was more than 4 percent'b' in the third quarter of 2013, and, of course, our productivity has risen relentlessly. But, despite the growth, unemployment only recently dropped below 7 percent. And the middle class is slowly but surely being eviscerated \xe2\x80\x94 thanks, at least in part, to those productivity gains. Income inequality has become a fact of life in the United States, and while politicians decry that fact, they seem incapable of doing anything about it. Which made me wonder: Whose economy runs better, really?'b'A few years ago, Nicholas Lemann of The New Yorker wrote 'b'a lengthy article about Brazil'b' in which he quoted from an email he received from Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s president, Dilma Rousseff. \xe2\x80\x9cThe main aim of economic development must always be the improvement of living conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d she told him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot separate the two concepts.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In other words, Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s admittedly leftist government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t spend a lot of time worrying about growth for its own sake, but rather connects it with alleviating poverty and growing the middle class. Thus, 'b'it has a high minimum wage'b', for instance. It has laws making it exceedingly difficult to fire a laggard employee. It controls the price of gasoline, helping to make driving affordable.'b'And most striking of all \xe2\x80\x94 at least from the point of view of an American \xe2\x80\x94 for the last 10 years, Brazil has had a'b' program called Bolsa Fam\xc3\xadlia'b', which essentially hands money to mothers living in poverty. In return, they have to ensure that their children go to school and avail themselves of health care services. There is no question that Bolsa Fam\xc3\xadlia has been enormously effective in reducing poverty.'b'By contrast here in the United States, Congress just refused to extend unemployment insurance. The farm bill envisions 'b'cutting back on food stamps'b'. Various other programs to help the poor or the unemployed have been reduced. Even those who oppose such heartless cuts assume that once the economy comes back, all will be well again. Growth will take care of everything. Thus in America, we tend to view economic growth less as a means to an end than an end in itself.'b'It is, of course, possible that Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s economy could hit the wall and some of the gains made could be reversed. A new emphasis on investment and entrepreneurship could probably help it. The spontaneous protests last summer were the results of the new middle class wanting the sorts of things that the middle class always wants: better services, higher quality schools, less corruption. Still, the Brazil example gives rise to a question we don\xe2\x80\x99t ask enough in this country:'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s the point of economic growth if nobody has a job?'b'Mayor Bill de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s plan to offer full-day preschool 'b'to every New York City 4-year-old'b' hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet rounded the corner from election slogan to classroom reality. But it\xe2\x80\x99s moving: a public-relations campaign on Friday started blitzing the city with leaflets and emails to drum up support for the tax to pay for it.'b'The mayor has assembled early-education experts to design the program and has been seeking support from legislators. He\xe2\x80\x99s even won a (backhanded) endorsement from Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who said in his 'b'State of the State address'b' that he wants universal preschool for the entire state. While Mr. Cuomo seems content with an applause line in a wish list, Mr. de Blasio is on the hook with a deeper commitment. He has said how he will pay for it, how much it will cost and that it will begin late this year.'b'His preschool plan (and a separate after-school program for middle-schoolers) relies on the State Legislature raising income taxes on city residents making $500,000 and above. He calls this a negligible sacrifice for a transformative social good. Even so, its prospects are unclear, given Mr. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s recent fervor for cutting taxes.'b'Leaving aside the financing uncertainties, the mayor is on solid pedagogical ground. Full-day prekindergarten is a smart investment in growing minds, preparing children to be skilled learners at a moment when they are primed for it. It\xe2\x80\x99s better to reach them at age 4 rather than fixing their learning problems later. Across the country, lawmakers and educators have embraced the universal preschool movement. President Obama has made a similar case. Mr. de Blasio is making a mainstream argument, though on a bigger scale than anyone else.'b'The city has about 100,000 4-year-olds. Mr. de Blasio wants to reach 68,000 of them: 48,000 new students on top of the 20,000 who have full-day public preschool now. Children in private programs would be able to attend the city\xe2\x80\x99s free classes if they wish. This will be expensive: $340 million a year, plus $190 million for the after-school program. But if the plan is executed halfheartedly, as an underfinanced form of babysitting, it\xe2\x80\x99s not worth doing. (This is why Mr. de Blasio argues for a dedicated tax, saying yearly appropriations battles would leave too much uncertainty about financing, discouraging a full commitment from teachers and staff needed to make the program work.)'b'One challenge will be finding the physical space to teach all these 4-year-olds, either by expanding existing programs or building new ones. This may require Mr. de Blasio to put aside his antipathy to charter schools, many of which would be well-positioned to add preschools, though state law would have to be changed to allow this.'b'Then the city will have to persuade parents to sign up, make sure there is a qualified teaching corps with classes small enough to be effective, and tightly integrate the program with kindergarten through third grade so that 4-year-olds do not lose their momentum. It will have to prepare children well for the rigorous Common Core learning standards that promise to bring their math, science and literacy skills up to international norms.'b'The key, Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s aides say, is creating a meaningful, high-quality learning experience as they build to scale. Skeptics may say that the benefits of preschool tend not to last, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be true, if done right and sustained by good schooling in later years.'b'A proposed merger between two of the largest suppliers of food to restaurants, hotels and school cafeterias could significantly reduce competition and drive up prices of the meals Americans eat outside their homes. Of all the money consumers spend on food, 'b'nearly half'b' is spent at restaurants.'b'Sysco, the country\xe2\x80\x99s largest distributor of food, last month 'b'offered to buy'b' its biggest competitor, US Foods, in a deal valued at $8.2 billion. The combined business would have $65 billion in annual revenue and would be five times 'b'bigger'b' than its next biggest competitor, which would give it power in a fragmented business known for having thousands of small firms. The merged company would control about 25 percent of the total food distribution business in the country.'b'By reducing meaningful competition, the new company would be able to demand higher prices to deliver food to restaurants and cafeterias, forcing them to charge their customers and users more. Sysco and US Foods have argued that the merged company would be able to offer customers more products in more parts of the country.'b'That would mean little to restaurant owners who depend on the competition between the companies to keep costs down. When one supplier raises prices or cannot fill an order, they turn to the other. The merger would be particularly damaging to independent restaurants that do not have the buying power that chains have to negotiate lower prices and guaranteed supplies in long-term contracts.'b'The harm would be greatest where the companies\xe2\x80\x99 operations overlap significantly. In states like Nevada and North Carolina, the combined company would own more than half of big distribution centers that serve food-service establishments, according to an 'b'analysis'b' by Food &amp; Water Watch, a Washington-based research group. There is another potential problem. Some restaurants and government agencies have 'b'accused'b' food distributors of fraudulently inflating invoices. Such practices could be harder to detect if the industry became more concentrated.'b'The Federal Trade Commission or the antitrust division of the Department of Justice 'b'will review'b' the merger. If they find that it would hurt competition by giving the combined company greater market power then they should consider blocking the deal or requiring the companies to first divest parts of their distribution networks.'b'Tragedy has twice visited the Woodiwiss family. In 2008, Anna Woodiwiss, then 27, was working for a service organization in Afghanistan. On April 1, she went horseback riding and was thrown, dying from her injuries. In 2013, her younger sister Catherine, then 26, was biking to work from her home in Washington. She was hit by a car and her face was severely smashed up. She has endured and will continue to endure a series of operations. For a time, she breathed and ate through a tube, unable to speak. The recovery is slow.'b'The victims of trauma, 'b'she writes in a remarkable blog post for Sojourners'b', experience days \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you feel like a quivering, cowardly shell of yourself, when despair yawns as a terrible chasm, when fear paralyzes any chance for pleasure. This is just a fight that has to be won, over and over and over again.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Her mother, Mary, talks about the deep organic grief that a parent feels when they have lost one child and seen another badly injured, a pain felt in bones and fiber.'b'But suffering is a teacher. And, among other things, the Woodiwisses drew a few lessons, which at least apply to their own experience, about how those of us outside the zone of trauma might better communicate with those inside the zone. There are no uniformly right responses, but their collective wisdom, some of it contained in Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s Sojourners piece, is quite useful:'b''b'Do be there.'b' Some people think that those who experience trauma need space to sort things through. Assume the opposite. Most people need presence. The Woodiwisses say they were awed after each tragedy by the number of people, many of whom had been mere acquaintances, who showed up and offered love, from across the nation and the continents. They were also disoriented by a number of close friends who simply weren\xe2\x80\x99t there, who were afraid or too busy.'b'Anna and Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s father, Ashley, says he could detect no pattern to help predict who would step up and provide the ministry of presence and who would fumble. Neither age, experience nor personal belief correlated with sensitivity and love.'b''b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t compare, ever.'b' Don\xe2\x80\x99t say, \xe2\x80\x9cI understand what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to lose a child. My dog died, and that was hard, too.\xe2\x80\x9d Even if the comparison seems more germane, don\xe2\x80\x99t make it. Each trauma should be respected in its uniqueness. Each story should be heard attentively as its own thing. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the inside,\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine writes, comparisons \xe2\x80\x9csting as clueless, careless, or just plain false.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Do bring soup.'b' The non-verbal expressions of love are as healing as eloquence. When Mary was living with Catherine during her recovery, some young friend noticed she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a bathmat. He went to Target and got a bathmat. Mary says she will never forget that.'b''b'Do not say \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll get over it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b' \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no such thing as \xe2\x80\x98getting over it,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Catherine writes, \xe2\x80\x9cA major disruption leaves a new normal in its wake. There is no \xe2\x80\x98back to the old me.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Do be a builder.'b' The Woodiwisses distinguish between firefighters and builders. Firefighters drop everything and arrive at the moment of crisis. Builders are there for years and years, walking alongside as the victims live out in the world. Very few people are capable of performing both roles.'b''b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t say it\xe2\x80\x99s all for the best or try to make sense out of what has happened.'b' Catherine and her parents speak with astonishing gentleness and quiet thoughtfulness, but it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty obvious that these tragedies have stripped away their tolerance for pretense and unrooted optimism.'b'Ashley also warned against those who would overinterpret, and try to make sense of the inexplicable. Even devout Christians, as the Woodiwisses are, should worry about taking theology beyond its limits. Theology is a grounding in ultimate hope, not a formula book to explain away each individual event.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99d say that what these experiences call for is a sort of passive activism. We have a tendency, especially in an achievement-oriented culture, to want to solve problems and repair brokenness \xe2\x80\x94 to propose, plan, fix, interpret, explain and solve. But what seems to be needed here is the art of presence \xe2\x80\x94 to perform tasks without trying to control or alter the elemental situation. Allow nature to take its course. Grant the sufferers the dignity of their own process. Let them define meaning. Sit simply through moments of pain and uncomfortable darkness. Be practical, mundane, simple and direct.'b'Ashley and Mary went to Afghanistan a few months after Anna\xe2\x80\x99s death. They remember that as a time out of time. They wept together with Afghan villagers and felt touched by grace. \xe2\x80\x9cThat period changed me and opened my imagination,\xe2\x80\x9d Ashley recalls. \xe2\x80\x9cThis thing called presence and love is more available than I had thought. It is more ready to be let loose than I ever imagined.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Millions of Americans can\xe2\x80\x99t find work and have lost their unemployment benefits because Congressional Republicans insist the government can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to help them. But there is no shortage of money when it comes to hunting down unauthorized immigrants.'b'The House on Wednesday passed a trillion-dollar appropriations bill that includes $39 billion for the Department of Homeland Security, $16 billion of which is for immigration enforcement, a sum that House Republicans 'b'boast'b' \xe2\x80\x9cwill allow for the highest operational force levels in history\xe2\x80\x9d for Customs and Border Protection, among other things. The bill adds 2,000 agents at border ports and mandates that Immigration and Customs Enforcement \xe2\x80\x9cmaintain a level of not less than 34,000 detention beds through September 30, 2014.\xe2\x80\x9d This represents, at a cost of $2.8 billion, \xe2\x80\x9cthe highest detention capacity in history.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It is mindless to keep throwing billions at border enforcement and detention at a time when illegal immigration is at historic lows, when other, more pressing government functions are being starved and when none of the money spent actually goes toward solving the problem.'b'Take the irrational obligation to fill all those detention beds, at a cost of about $122 a day. Why make the people who run a vast and expensive law-enforcement apparatus responsible for keeping prison beds warm rather than communities safe \xe2\x80\x94 especially when there are low-cost alternatives to detention that don\xe2\x80\x99t involve fattening the bottom lines of for-profit prison corporations?'b'Congress\xe2\x80\x99s arbitrary detention mandates and the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s aggressive use of its enforcement powers have pushed deportations to record levels of 400,000 a year. This has had no discernible effect on the overall problem, but it has caused abundant anguish in immigrant families and their communities.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s most disheartening about the spending splurge is that it attacks only the symptoms of the ailing immigration system. It reflects a government cynically resigned to chipping away at the presence of millions of unauthorized immigrants, most of them noncriminals, instead of one willing to create a way for millions to come forward and get right with the law, freeing up taxpayer dollars to go after real threats.'b'Early this summer, New Yorkers can expect to see 'b'proposals for four new casinos upstate'b'. Some communities in the Catskills and Western New York are ready to welcome these gambling meccas, especially if they come with good jobs, as promised.'b'But at least one historic town does not want a mini-Las Vegas nearby. That is Saratoga Springs, home of the famous racetrack, the thermal springs, the Saratoga Performing Arts Center that houses the New York City Ballet in the summer, Skidmore College and other attractions.'b'The problem is that Saratoga Springs residents 'b'can\xe2\x80\x99t say no if the state decides to place a casino in their area'b'. In Massachusetts, for instance, local residents can vote to reject a casino development in their community. New York State law offers no community veto. It will be up to a new gaming commission and its appointees to choose where and what the new casinos will be.'b'Having no real say in the matter is simply unfair to the communities that are often saddled with the downsides of these gambling operations. The police often have to cope with more traffic, more crime. Local businesses often see fewer customers, not more. These casino resorts draw busloads of people, but they are designed to keep visitors on the grounds with restaurants and shops. Most people have no need to venture into the surrounding area.'b'Even real estate prices can suffer. Agents are already hearing that some Saratoga Springs residents are looking for \xe2\x80\x9can exit strategy\xe2\x80\x9d if a big casino comes to town.'b'Even though Saratoga Springs already has some gambling connected to its racetracks, many residents say that is enough. Though 'b'state voters approved a constitutional amendment allowing casinos'b' in November, more than 57 percent of Saratoga Springs voters said no. And they should have the right to say no to a casino.'b'RAMALLAH, West Bank \xe2\x80\x94 Since Ariel Sharon\xe2\x80\x99s death, the Israeli media have been grumbling about the lack of an official Palestinian response \xe2\x80\x94 and in particular from the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas.'b'But what can Israelis possibly expect a Palestinian president \xe2\x80\x94 or any Palestinian for that matter \xe2\x80\x94 to feel toward Mr. Sharon? Are they supposed to celebrate his sponsorship of violence and bloodshed against them throughout his long military career? Or laud his expansionist colonialist policies against them during his long political career?'b'Only out of respect for the stature of death itself was the official Palestinian response of silence appropriate. Many believe that a full accounting for Mr. Sharon\xe2\x80\x99s violent and bloody history was warranted \xe2\x80\x94 nothing less than what Human Rights Watch did 'b'when it issued a statement'b' expressing regret that he had died without facing justice for his crimes against Palestinians.'b'Mr. Sharon didn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to lie to his superiors and colleagues in order to attain his goals. When he disagreed with fellow members of Likud, the party that he helped establish, he resigned and formed a new party, Kadima (Forward). Mr. Sharon believed moving forward was his life\xe2\x80\x99s mission.'b'His enmity toward Palestinians was unbridled, and he used the most violent means against them. Throughout his career he did not take a single positive step toward reaching a political settlement with them to bring about peace. The motivation behind every one of his policies was to force them to surrender.'b'As a young officer in the Haganah in 1948, under Yitzhak Rabin\xe2\x80\x99s command, Mr. Sharon participated in the mass displacement of Palestinians from their homes. In 1953, while responsible for Unit 101 in the Israeli Army, he oversaw the massacre in Qibya. In the early 1970s, while head of the Israel Defense Forces\xe2\x80\x99 Southern Command, he led attacks in the Gaza refugee camps. And in 1982, he broadened the I.D.F.\xe2\x80\x99s attacks against Lebanon into a full-scale war, leading eventually to the massacres of Palestinian civilians in Sabra and Shatila, for which an Israeli commission found him indirectly responsible. As a result, he was forced to resign from his position as defense minister in early 1983.'b'In 2000, he entered the contested religious complex known by some as the Temple Mount, which triggered the second intifada. To crown this career, in 2002 Mr. Sharon reoccupied Palestinian-controlled areas in the West Bank and destroyed then-Palestinian President Yasir Arafat\xe2\x80\x99s compound in Ramallah. Mr. Sharon publicly expressed his regret that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t killed Mr. Arafat himself.'b'Mr. Sharon\xe2\x80\x99s violent trajectory was not separate from his ideological beliefs, but rather a manifestation of them. He never really believed in achieving peace, but in imposing his own version of it. He opposed the 1979 peace treaty with Egypt, the Israeli retreat from Lebanon in 1985 and the Oslo Accords in 1993. He abstained from the Knesset vote on peace with Jordan in 1994, and opposed the Hebron agreement in 1997 and the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000. He was consistently extreme in both his ideology and actions throughout his life.'b'Some say that Mr. Sharon changed after becoming prime minister in 2001, and that his transformation became obvious in 2005, when he withdrew the Israeli Army from Gaza and dismantled settlements there. But this is na\xc3\xafve. Neither Mr. Sharon\xe2\x80\x99s ideology nor his convictions changed; only his tactics did.'b'Mr. Sharon wanted an ethnically pure Jewish state from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, and the prospect of an eventual Palestinian demographic majority troubled him. He\xe2\x80\x99d always encouraged the development of Israeli settlements. Throughout his career, he stimulated rampant settler colonialism in occupied Jerusalem and the West Bank.'b'His other pet project was the concept of \xe2\x80\x9ctransfer\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the resettling of Palestinians outside Palestine. In the 1980s, he claimed that \xe2\x80\x9cJordan is Palestine,\xe2\x80\x9d arguing that the Palestinian state should be established there, and that the Palestinians should relocate to live in their nation east of the Jordan River.'b'But, after being overtaken by the Oslo Accords in 1993 and the peace treaty with Jordan in 1994, Mr. Sharon had to modify his plan. He then became obsessed with securing the largest possible amount of Palestinian land, squeezing Palestinians into the smallest cantons possible and diminishing their legal status while preserving a Jewish majority.'b'Unable to expel the Palestinians, Mr. Sharon began his plan to \xe2\x80\x9cmove\xe2\x80\x9d them internally by building the separation wall in 2002, which swallowed up approximately 11 percent of the West Bank\xe2\x80\x99s land area. He also intensified settlement in Jerusalem and the West Bank: During his time as prime minister, the settler population there increased by 70,000 to reach a total of about 460,000.'b'When he decided to withdraw from Gaza, Mr. Sharon was able to retain absolute Israeli control over the terrestrial, aerial and maritime borders of the Gaza Strip while relinquishing responsibility for one-third of the Palestinian population of Israel and the Occupied Territories. All he had to do was remove 8,000 settlers from the Gaza Strip.'b'His goal was never maintaining Israeli control over the Gaza Strip; it was to control Jerusalem and the West Bank, and eventually annex as much land as possible to Israel. And his policies and vision have borne fruit.

That\xe2\x80\x99s the message from a draft United Nations report on climate change issued last month. It\xe2\x80\x99s a message the European Commission, which is debating whether to temper its clean energy goals, would do well to heed.'b'The commission is considering making renewable-energy targets nonbinding on individual nations, opting for less-onerous Europe-wide targets. It will announce its plan for Europe\xe2\x80\x99s renewable energy targets on Jan. 22.'b'Last October, the chief executives of 10 European energy companies urged the European Union to end subsidies for wind and solar power, claiming these have distorted the market, led to higher energy costs and put Europe\xe2\x80\x99s electricity grid at risk of a blackout. This was dreadful advice. Economic decisions have already caused a decline in investment in renewable energy in Europe. Investment fell in Spain, France, Italy and Germany in 2013, and only Britain managed to come close to matching 2012 investment levels in 2013. Worldwide, clean-energy investment fell 12 percent last year.'b'Binding targets have helped Europe become a global leader in reducing greenhouse gases. It is already nearing its target of reducing 1990-level greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020. The European Commission is likely now to propose reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by 35 percent to 40 percent by 2030, and increasing the share of renewable energy to up to 27 percent. But these ambitious goals will not be met without continued incentives for renewable energy, the strongest of which are binding targets that individual countries cannot evade.'b'The United Nations report is clear: However hard it may be to move to renewable energy, it pales in comparison with the cost of not moving aggressively to reduce emissions. At current rates, carbon dioxide levels, now over 400 parts per million, will surpass 500 parts per million in a few decades, with devastating climate-change consequences.'b'The European Commission must not allow economic arguments from utility companies or individual governments to deter it from giving Europe the clearest possible blueprint for a renewable-energy future. The world cannot afford to have Europe abdicate its leading role on climate change now.'b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 DESPITE the last-minute diplomatic row over the cancellation of the United Nations\xe2\x80\x99 invitation to Iran, the \xe2\x80\x9cGeneva II\xe2\x80\x9d peace talks between the government of Bashar al-Assad and the Syrian opposition are scheduled to start today, with support from NATO members and Russia. But the process faces daunting challenges.'b'What is the likelihood of the Assad regime\xe2\x80\x99s negotiating its own departure, given its improved military position? And to what extent can opposition representatives act for the fragmented, even rival, forces fighting in Syria?'b'Since the beginning of the Syrian civil war, many observers have drawn parallels between Syria and Bosnia. The Geneva II talks echo efforts to resolve the conflict in the Balkans 20 years ago.'b'What are the lessons? If there is a general one from Bosnia for the parties meeting in Switzerland, it is the need for humility. As determined as the international community may be to resolve conflict, civil war is extraordinarily resistant to outside intervention. This has three important implications.'b'The first is that peace initiatives are often an unreliable lens through which to view a conflict. There is a tendency to assume that facts on the ground in places like Bosnia or Syria are primarily controlled by strategies and timetables devised by foreigners. They are not.'b'Conflict is embedded in the environment; peace plans come and go. The Dayton Accords that ended fighting in Bosnia in 1995 were preceded by four fruitless peace initiatives; the conflict in Syria has already generated its share.'b'Equally crucial is that we ask how our own efforts may interfere with conflict. In Bosnia in 1993, the effect of the unsuccessful Vance-Owen Peace Plan, which proposed new political entities divided along ethnic lines, was to intensify campaigns of ethnic cleansing as warring groups tried to strengthen their positions ahead of partition. We should expect plans discussed in Switzerland to have a similar impact in Syria. This may be unavoidable, but we may be able to predict how the pattern of violence will evolve and allocate resources better to meet humanitarian needs.'b'A second implication is the need to grasp the larger regional picture \xe2\x80\x94 as the American envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke, showed during the diplomatic surge that led to Dayton. He secured the support of his European partners and Russia, and he brought the leaders of Bosnia\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors, Croatia and Yugoslavia (now Serbia), into the process.'b'The Dayton agreement was far from perfect, as Bosnia\xe2\x80\x99s current problems reveal, but Mr. Holbrooke\xe2\x80\x99s strategy did succeed in creating the conditions required to enforce a settlement. Russia, together with both the European Union and individual member states, played crucial roles in implementing Dayton, and the international community was able to rely on cooperation from Croatia and Serbia to help manage developments in Bosnia. This suggests that the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s effort to support the Geneva talks as part of a broad coalition that includes Russia is the right strategy \xe2\x80\x94 even if Iran\xe2\x80\x99s absence from the table proves a limiting factor.'b'Finally, Bosnia teaches us that war does not end when the weapons are put down. As the military theorist Carl von Clausewitz noted: \xe2\x80\x9cThe ultimate outcome of a war is not always to be regarded as final. The defeated state often considers the outcome merely as a transitory evil, for which a remedy may still be found in political conditions at some later date.\xe2\x80\x9d The experience of Bosnia is that wartime elites continue to pursue belligerent objectives even after the cessation of hostilities.'b'Instead of focusing exclusively on ending violence in the near term, negotiators should see any peace deal for Syria as a moment of transition when parties define the institutional and legal parameters under which they will pursue a conflict no longer under arms. Factions will not abandon their larger aspirations at the negotiating table. Diplomacy\xe2\x80\x99s power to steer conflict lies largely in its ability to shape future behavior through electoral and constitutional engineering.'b'The international community\xe2\x80\x99s undertaking to end Syria\xe2\x80\x99s civil war is highly ambitious. Even if Geneva II is successful in ending violence, foreign powers must expect that, as in Bosnia, some factions will seek to undermine the fragile settlement by other means. Insurgency is not a purely military phenomenon.'b'Our diplomacy must therefore be resilient, patient and humble as it guides the warring parties away from open strife. Winning the peace is never a short-term endeavor.'b''b'WHO\xe2\x80\x99s role in the Syrian crisis 'b''b'Regarding \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Syria\xe2\x80\x99s raging health crisis'b'\xe2\x80\x9d by Adam P.

Fouad (Jan. 2): Although this opinion column spelled out the World Health Organization\xe2\x80\x99s apparent willingness to go along with the Assad government\xe2\x80\x99s obstruction of vaccination coverage in Deir al-Zour Province, there is nothing new in the acquiescent role that the World Health Organization seems to have played there. WHO representatives typically sit in a country\xe2\x80\x99s Health Ministry and are to a large extent a creature of the government; they are not prone to rocking the boat over health coverage issues. Over 20 years in dozens of countries, I saw WHO representatives sit tight and say nothing about cholera outbreaks and abysmal vaccination levels, fearful that the host government would be angered.'b'Contrary to what this article suggests, not all United Nations agencies are timid about risking the wrath of the host government if the facts justify it.

I am old enough to recall the years prior to the Salk and Sabin vaccines, when parents dreaded the possibility of epidemics of this disease, with its risk of severe and permanent paralysis. In my professional life I have also treated hundreds of such patients. The new outbreaks of this infection, which was close to being totally eradicated, are a reflection of local political instability in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia. The poliomyelitis virus does not distinguish between tribes, religious affiliations or political parties, and in order to prevent its further spread the involved nations need to rise above their differences. Polio should, like smallpox, become a part of mankind\xe2\x80\x99s past history.'b''b'Stanley F. Wainapel, New York 'b''b'The writer is Clinical Director of the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at the Montefiore Medical Center.'b'The outstanding success of India\xe2\x80\x99s polio eradication stems from the untiring efforts of a committed government. These include the running of extensive awareness campaigns throughout the country, especially in rural areas where more than half of the target group lives, and the implementation of a nationwide program through which every child below the age of 5 receives two drops of the vaccine on a scheduled date right at their doorstep or at a nearby facility. Maintaining an unbroken cold-chain for the heat-sensitive vaccine is a daunting task in India; specially designed ice-lined refrigerators have been used to maintain the potency of the vaccine.

Many of these bases operate in the middle of heavily populated cities, and Okinawans are subjected to difficult living conditions: extraordinary noise pollution and a constant fear of military-related accidents, among other things.'b'The construction of the new base comes amid a raft of yet-unfulfilled promises over the years by Japanese and American governments to reduce the burden on Okinawans. Mr. Nakaima\xe2\x80\x99s approval of the landfill permit is seen by many in Okinawa as a betrayal of the prefecture, given his election promises to advocate that the new base be relocated outside the islands. The prefectural assembly has called on him to resign.'b'The construction of the new base may make sense for American strategic interests in East Asia, but many Okinawans see it very differently.'b''b'Tze M.

But this is only part of the picture. Basic thinking on international relations has changed dramatically in a century. While some nations still practice realpolitik, for many governments the personal well-being of the citizen is now the foundation of foreign policy. In Europe, we had a revolution in foreign affairs that replaced power politics with welfare thinking; a logic of war with a logic of values; a foreign policy based on the power of the state to serve the citizen.'b'After the terrible suffering of both world wars, the drive to build a welfare state, pioneered in Europe, is now the basis for legitimacy in international relations. While sovereignty remains important in relations between nations, ensuring the personal welfare of the individual citizen is the primary goal. The venues for this welfare-oriented foreign policy include international conferences, involving new classes of players, stakeholders like NGOs, the media and multinational companies. This has led to the globalization of the concept of human security and pushed a new social model onto the world stage.'b'The United Nations best embodies this transformation, with its special mandates in development, trade, the environment and the welfare of children. And since 1949 the Council of Europe has worked to help build a new international order; for the first time in history, citizens of the council\xe2\x80\x99s member states were granted the legal basis for pursuing their rights before an international body, the European Court of Human Rights. This is perhaps the most striking example of how the welfare of the citizen has superseded the power of the state.'b'War, in this context, has been rendered unthinkable to Europeans. For most of us in the West, when we discuss security, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about social security and pension funds. While America may take an independent, traditional view on security issues, and go to war to defend its national interests, Europeans participate in military operations as international peacekeepers, in which the mission of the soldier is not about his country\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy. American elections are won or lost by the promise to \xe2\x80\x9cmake America strong again\xe2\x80\x9d; in Austria and other European countries, elections are won by those who promise to develop the welfare state even further.'b'To be sure, with the United States the only remaining superpower, able to conduct its foreign policy in the classical sense, waging war and concluding peace at its discretion, power politics has not disappeared. Arms spending, the international weapons trade and the various current wars suggest that many countries remain determined to follow the realpolitik course to national glory. So we live in a very divided world.'b'Many countries still wage war at will. But many others live in a post-Westphalian world, dominated by the aspirations of millions to improve their daily lives. For these citizens, going to war again like in 1914 is simply not possible.'b''b'Wendelin Ettmayer, Vienna'b''b'The writer is a former Austrian ambassador to Finland, Canada and the Council of Europe.'b'ITHACA, N.Y. \xe2\x80\x94 Will China achieve technological dominance over the United States, surpassing us in scientific and engineering innovation?'b'A lot of people seem to think so. China\xe2\x80\x99s recent landing of an unmanned spacecraft on the Moon, its advances in renewable energies and high-speed rail, its increasing number of patent filings and its vast spending on research and development have contributed to a perception \xe2\x80\x94 held across much of the world, according to a Pew Research Center poll conducted last summer \xe2\x80\x94 that China is poised to overtake America as the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading power, if it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t already done so.'b'Concern that China \xe2\x80\x94 home of landmark innovations like printing and gunpowder \xe2\x80\x94 might reclaim its legacy as a land of invention is voiced at even the highest levels of the American government. In 2011, Steven Chu, the energy secretary at the time and a Nobel-winning physicist, remarked on China\xe2\x80\x99s dominance in the production of low-cost solar-energy cells, urging, \xe2\x80\x9cWe really can and should take back this technology lead.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Americans shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so worried. Yes, China has demonstrated skill in moving to higher-value manufacturing, and excelled at improving existing technologies, while producing them more cheaply. But it has not excelled in true innovation. (The first modern solar cell was invented in the United States.)'b'No one knows this better than the Chinese themselves. Before he stepped down as president in 2012, Hu Jintao directed that vast sums be spent on supporting scientific innovation to \xe2\x80\x9cachieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But as a scientist who has taught in China, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that China will lead in innovation anytime soon \xe2\x80\x94 or at least not until it moves its institutional culture away from suppression of dissent and toward freedom of expression and encouragement of critical thought.'b'Almost all the paradigm-shifting innovations over the past few hundred years \xe2\x80\x94 from Michael Faraday\xe2\x80\x99s generating electricity by moving a copper wire through a magnetic field in London in 1831 to the invention of the transistor at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey in the 1940s \xe2\x80\x94 have emerged in countries with relatively high levels of political and intellectual liberty. Why is this?'b'A first reason is cultural: Free societies encourage people to be skeptical and ask critical questions. When I was teaching at a university in Beijing in 2009, my students acknowledged that I frequently asked if they had any questions \xe2\x80\x94 and that they rarely did. After my last lecture, at their insistence, we discussed the reasons for their reticence.'b'Several students pointed out that, from childhood, they were not encouraged to ask questions. I knew that the Cultural Revolution had upturned higher education \xe2\x80\x94 and intellectual inquiry generally \xe2\x80\x94 during their parents\xe2\x80\x99 lifetimes, but as a guest I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into a political discussion. Instead, I gently pointed out to my students that they were planning to be scientists, and that skepticism and critical questioning were essential for separating the wheat from the chaff in all scholarly endeavors.'b'A second reason is institutional: Much of American innovation started with the bright ideas of a few individuals, working in an industrial, government or university laboratory, or perhaps a garage in Silicon Valley. While government support for R&amp;D is essential, innovation is typically the product of a bottom-up approach. A classic example is the letter Albert Einstein wrote to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1939, arguing that nuclear fission could be the basis of a powerful bomb, which led to the Manhattan Project.'b'In 2006, I led a group of scientists from Cornell to discuss possible collaborations on nanotechnology with colleagues at Tsinghua University in Beijing and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Over meals, Chinese colleagues told me that scientific research was initiated in a top-down manner.'b'A third reason is political. Free societies attract foreign talent. England gave birth to the steam engine in the 18th century in part because of Denis Papin, a Huguenot who had fled France for greater religious tolerance in England. His idea of using steam and atmospheric pressure to do work, taken up by Thomas Newcomen and James Watt, powered the first Industrial Revolution.'b'During a trip to China last fall, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but notice not only the lack of access to several Western news sources, but also the cynicism about the news in general. Those \xe2\x80\x9cin the know\xe2\x80\x9d distrusted what they were told by state news agencies like Xinhua and CCTV.'b'The case of Xia Yeliang, an associate professor of economics at Peking University, who was dismissed, supposedly for speaking out against one party rule, does not inspire confidence in academic freedom.'b'While in Beijing, my wife and I visited the 798 art district in the city\xe2\x80\x99s northeast. During our stroll of galleries and studios, I asked about the artist and dissident Ai Weiwei, whom we had met in Berkeley, Calif., in 2008. The woman I spoke with said that it was too dangerous to try to visit him, because there were so many police around his compound.'b'The significance of China\xe2\x80\x99s vast spending on R&amp;D cannot be overstated, particularly at a time when the United States has made short-sighted cuts to the budgets of the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and other agencies that finance research.'b'Perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong that political freedom is critical for scientific innovation. As a scientist, I have to be skeptical of my own conclusions. But sometime in this still-new century, we will see the results of this unfolding experiment.

Now I hurt all over just thinking about my next visit to a doctor. Thanks a bunch for messing up my day.'b'KIRK NEVIN'b'\nCorvallis, Ore., Jan. 19, 2014'b''b'The relatively new notion that around a third or more of the world\xe2\x80\x99s population is badly (\xe2\x80\x9cmal\xe2\x80\x9d) nourished conflates hunger and diet-spawned illnesses like diabetes, both of which are preventable.'b'Both result from a lack of access to quality food, which in turn can result from a lack of money. No one with money starves, and the obesity-diabetes epidemic afflicts predominantly people on the low end of the income scale. With money comes good food, food that creates health and not \xe2\x80\x9cillth,\xe2\x80\x9d to use John Ruskin\xe2\x80\x99s word. With a lack of money comes either not enough food or so-called empty calories, calories that put on pounds but do not nourish.'b'This is made very clear in Oxfam\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGood Enough to Eat\xe2\x80\x9d'b' index, a snapshot of the state of eating in 125 countries released last week. The index attempts to determine the best and worst countries in which to eat, by measuring levels of undernourishment and underweight in children; asking \xe2\x80\x9cdo people have enough to eat?\xe2\x80\x9d; measuring costs of food versus other goods and services, to see whether food is affordable; looking at the diversity of people\xe2\x80\x99s diets and the availability of safe water; and monitoring diabetes and obesity levels to learn whether the diets are healthy.'b'The results for the United States make a fine case for American exceptionalism, though not in the way chauvinists will find pleasing.'b'We rank first in food affordability; food is cheap compared with other things we buy, and prices are relatively stable. We also rank highly (4th) in food \xe2\x80\x9cquality,\xe2\x80\x9d which is measured by (potential) diversity of diet, though access to good water is shockingly low (tied for 41st, about a third of the way down the list).'b'Then the hammer falls: When it comes to healthy eating as measured by diabetes and obesity rates, we\xe2\x80\x99re 120th: sixth from the bottom, better off only than Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan, Fiji and our unlucky neighbor Mexico. (Canada fares a little better; it\xe2\x80\x99s 18th worst.) We\xe2\x80\x99re also in a tie (with Belarus and other powerhouses) for 35th in \xe2\x80\x9cenough to eat.\xe2\x80\x9d Really.'b'In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine having a food supply as abundant as ours and doing a worse job with it. There are reasons for this:'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 Much of what\xe2\x80\x99s grown with the potential to become \xe2\x80\x9cfood\xe2\x80\x9d is actually turned into (as Michael Pollan dubbed them) 'b'edible foodlike substances'b' \xe2\x80\x94 in short, junk food \xe2\x80\x94 that produces the opposite of health. (About this there can barely be an argument any longer.) Some of what we grow is also turned into fuel for automobiles, doing no one but corn farmers any good. And much of it is fed to animals, in itself not a terrible thing, although the way we do it is damaging on many fronts.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 While we generally manage to keep the neediest quarter of our population from actually starving, we do not reach everyone who could use help; for example, only half of those Californians eligible for food stamps (officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) actually get them, according to 'b'Roots of Change'b', a California nonprofit that focuses on food. And, of course, food stamps can be and often are used 'b'to buy junk'b', a pattern that causes as many problems as it alleviates.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 The budget for food education in the United States pales compared with the marketing budget for junk food, and much of that education is either unconvincing or ignored in the face of the barrage of \xe2\x80\x9cfun to eat\xe2\x80\x9d ads for the food that is worst for us. (These 'b'three charts,'b' gathered in one place by Tom Philpott, pretty much tell the story.) There is, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve complained before, no concerted effort to teach people how to cook, which cannot happen without simultaneously teaching people how to shop for real food.'b'There are also issues of economic justice and education, and all their complications, which is why talking about food and eating inevitably leads to talking about the structure of society.'b'Part of the problem lies in oversight. Although we have a first lady who cares about these issues (and presumably has the support of the president), we do not have an official government policy or agency responsible for coordinating and assuring that the nation\xe2\x80\x99s investment in food and agriculture is for a nourishing and healthful food supply. The Department of Agriculture partly fills that role, but it also has a clear conflict of interest, since its primary goal is to support what has become a system of industrial agriculture that cares more about production and marketing supports than about what happens to soil, water and air, or the health of consumers who buy its products. (One need look only at budgets to determine what any individual or agency cares about most.)'b'In the long run, what\xe2\x80\x99s needed is not a Farm Bill \xe2\x80\x94 that tangled mess that\xe2\x80\x99s been stalled in Congress since its expiration in 2012 \xe2\x80\x94 but a national food and health policy, one that sets goals 'b'first 'b'for healthful eating and only then determines how best to produce the food that will allow us to meet those goals. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense to tell people to eat vegetables and then produce junk; that leads only to bad health in the face of evident abundance. What\xe2\x80\x99s so great about that?'b'In the 1970s, I got both my bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s and master\xe2\x80\x99s degrees in modern Middle East studies, and I can assure you that at no time did environmental or climate issues appear anywhere in the syllabi of my courses. Today, you can\xe2\x80\x99t understand the Arab awakenings \xe2\x80\x94 or their solutions \xe2\x80\x94 without considering climate, environment and population stresses.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve been reporting on the connection between the Syrian drought and the uprising there for a Showtime documentary that will air in April, but recently our researchers came across a WikiLeaks cable that brilliantly foreshadowed how environmental stresses would fuel the uprising. Sent on Nov. 8, 2008, from the U.S. Embassy in Damascus to the State Department, the cable details how, in light of what was a devastating Syrian drought \xe2\x80\x94 it lasted from 2006-10 \xe2\x80\x94 Syria\xe2\x80\x99s U.N. food and agriculture representative, Abdullah bin Yehia, was seeking drought assistance from the U.N. and wanted the U.S. to contribute. Here are some key lines:'b'\xe2\x96\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cThe U.N. Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs launched an appeal on September 29 requesting roughly $20.23 million to\xc2\xa0assist an estimated\xc2\xa0one million people impacted by what the U.N. describes\xc2\xa0as\xc2\xa0the country\xe2\x80\x99s worst drought in four decades.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x96\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cYehia proposes to use money from the appeal to provide seed\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0technical assistance to 15,000 small-holding farmers in northeast Syria in an effort to preserve the\xc2\xa0social\xc2\xa0and economic\xc2\xa0fabric of this rural, agricultural community. If UNFAO efforts fail, Yehia predicts mass migration from the northeast, which could act as a multiplier on social and economic pressures already at play and undermine stability.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x96\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cYehia does not believe that the [government of Bashar al-Assad] will allow any Syrian citizen to starve. ... However, Yehia told us that the Syrian minister of agriculture ... stated publicly that economic\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0social\xc2\xa0fallout from the drought was \xe2\x80\x98beyond our capacity as\xc2\xa0a country to deal with.\xe2\x80\x99 What the U.N. is trying to combat through this appeal, Yehia says, is the potential for \xe2\x80\x98social destruction\xe2\x80\x99 that would accompany erosion of the agricultural industry in rural Syria. This\xc2\xa0social\xc2\xa0destruction would lead to political instability.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x96\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWithout direct assistance, Yehia predicts that most of these 15,000 small-holding farmers would be forced to depart Al Hasakah Province to seek work in larger cities in western Syria. Approximately 100,000 dependents \xe2\x80\x94 women, children\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0the elderly or infirm \xe2\x80\x94 would be left behind to live in poverty, he said. Children would be likely to be pulled from school, he warned, in order to seek a source of income for families left behind. In addition, the migration of 15,000 unskilled laborers would add to the\xc2\xa0social\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0economic pressures presently at play in major Syrian cities. A system already burdened by a large Iraqi refugee population may not be able to absorb another influx of displaced persons, Yehia explained, particularly at this time of rising costs, growing dissatisfaction of the middle class,\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0a perceived weakening of the\xc2\xa0social fabric and\xc2\xa0security structures\xc2\xa0that Syrians have come to expect\xc2\xa0and \xe2\x80\x94 in some cases \xe2\x80\x94 rely\xc2\xa0on.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yehia was prophetic. By 2010, roughly one million Syrian farmers, herders and their families were forced off the land into already overpopulated and underserved cities. These climate refugees were crowded together with one million Iraqi war refugees. The Assad regime failed to effectively help any of them, so when the Arab awakenings erupted in Tunisia and Egypt, Syrian democrats followed suit and quickly found many willing recruits from all those dislocated by the drought.'b'But also consider this: Last May 9, The Times of Israel quoted Israeli geographer Arnon Soffer as observing that in the past 60 years, the population in the Middle East has twice doubled. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no example of this anywhere else on earth.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And this: Last March, the International Journal of Climatology published a study, \xe2\x80\x9cChanges in extreme temperature and precipitation in the Arab region,\xe2\x80\x9d that found \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent warming trends since the middle of the 20th century across the region,\xe2\x80\x9d manifested in \xe2\x80\x9cincreasing frequencies of warm nights, fewer cool days and cool nights.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And then consider this: Syria\xe2\x80\x99s government couldn\xe2\x80\x99t respond to a prolonged drought 'b'when there was a Syrian government'b'. So imagine what could happen if Syria is faced by another drought after much of its infrastructure has been ravaged by civil war.'b'And, finally, consider this: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the future, who will help a country like Syria when it gets devastated by its next drought if we are in a world where everyone is dealing with something like a Superstorm Sandy,\xe2\x80\x9d which alone cost the U.S. $60 billion to clean up? asks Joe Romm, founder of 'b'ClimateProgress.org'b'.'b'So to Iran and Saudi Arabia, who are funding the proxy war in Syria between Sunnis and Shiites/Alawites, all I can say is that you\xe2\x80\x99re fighting for control of a potential human/ecological disaster zone. You need to be working together to rebuild Syria\xe2\x80\x99s resiliency, and its commons, not destroying it. I know that in saying this I am shouting into a dust storm. But there is nothing else worth saying.'b'Sarah, the subject of this Op-Doc video, lives in a rural town in western Missouri. She is in 10th grade. For generations almost no one in Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s family has finished high school. Sarah vows that she does not want to follow in those footsteps. But how will her life be different? She became pregnant at 15. Her son will be born in February.'b'Sarah has six siblings. Her father is estranged from the family and does not contribute financially. Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Dena Jewell Simental, is often away from home, cleaning houses and caring for the disabled. Supporting her seven children is Dena\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctop priority,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. It\xe2\x80\x99s never easy -- when the family has received food stamps, they often haven\xe2\x80\x99t lasted till the end of the month. Sometimes, when bills go unpaid, the electricity and water are shut off or Dena\xe2\x80\x99s phone service is interrupted. But Dena is proud to say, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are a good family.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There is a myth in America: if you have a strong moral compass, work hard and make good choices, you will have equal opportunity. But after two years of listening to and documenting low-income families in rural America (for our forthcoming feature-length documentary \xe2\x80\x9cRich Hill\xe2\x80\x9d), we have witnessed a starkly unequal playing field.'b'Often, there is no social safety net. When a low-income family experiences a hardship or makes a misstep, the results can be devastating. Dena\xe2\x80\x99s family is uninsured, so when Sarah and her siblings need medical care, even for something as simple as a rash, it often means a trip to the emergency room.'b'Before Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s son is even born, so much is already stacked against him. What will it take for Sarah and her son to break out of this cycle of poverty?'b''b'This video is part of a series produced by independent filmmakers who have received support from the nonprofit Sundance Institute.'b''b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 AMID the coverage of the Christie controversy and the latest budget deal, it was easy to miss the news about last week\xe2\x80\x99s oral arguments before the Supreme Court in the case of National Labor Relations Board v. 'b'Noel Canning'b'. And yet the Canning case represents the biggest threat to presidential power in decades, and the stakes in the decision are extremely high.'b'The case grew from a challenge by the Noel Canning Corporation to President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s recess appointment of several nominees to the N.L.R.B., along with the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Recess appointments are not unusual, but in this case, the Senate was away but still convening pro forma sessions \xe2\x80\x94 just five minutes or so at a time \xe2\x80\x94 because the House had not given permission to adjourn.'b'The challenge began narrowly, centered on the question of whether a president or the Senate gets to decide when the legislative body is in recess. But it was broadened dramatically last year by a panel of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which ruled that virtually all recess appointments violated the direct language of the Constitution: Only those vacancies occurring during the recess between the two sessions of Congress, and only those filled during that recess, would be allowed. Because such recesses are very brief, the odds of a significant vacancy opening up during them are near zero.'b'The tenor of the oral argument suggested widespread skepticism by the justices about recess appointments in general, despite their frequent use by presidents for 200 years. The court might rule narrowly, simply outlawing the kinds of recess appointments made by Mr. Obama, leaving intact the accepted practices, and usual tugs of war, that have characterized nomination battles for many decades. But there is a strong chance that the Supreme Court will agree with the D.C. Circuit opinion, in essence erasing the recess appointment authority and capability of the president.'b'In the short run, this outcome would mean little. In recent years, presidents have used recess appointments to avoid Senate filibusters. But the Senate recently changed its filibuster rules, lowering the threshold for cloture on nominations from 60 to 50 (both the N.L.R.B. and C.F.P.B. slots in question were filled by Senate confirmation). With the new cloture rules, and a Democratic Senate, the president will have little difficulty filling executive and judicial vacancies.'b'But what happens when we have a president from one party and a Senate majority from the other? The justices, in the oral argument, focused on the \xe2\x80\x9coriginalist\xe2\x80\x9d fact that at the beginning of the republic, recess appointments were intended not to deal with political disputes between president and Senate but to enable presidents to fill positions when there were, as a practical matter, lengthy stretches without a Senate in session to confirm them.'b'But it is also true that at the beginning of the republic, there were no filibusters, and the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s framers believed that senators would use the \xe2\x80\x9cadvise and consent\xe2\x80\x9d power only rarely to block nominees, and even then only when senators judged them lacking in qualifications, temperament or ethical standards.'b'For most of American history, recess appointments were a safety valve for presidents when there were individual disputes over nominees, a modest weapon of the executive in the continuing struggle between the political branches.'b'The last decade or so, though, has been different. The party not holding the presidency has used the confirmation power not simply to vet presidential nominees but to veto them as a whole, regardless of qualifications, for partisan reasons, or has refused to confirm them in order to nullify laws by nullifying the agencies designated to enforce them.'b'That could be a disaster if that party controlled the Senate, where it could use its power to block nominees from even coming to a vote. In fact, the only thing that would keep a tribal party from acting to utterly foil a president from fulfilling his executive responsibilities would be the awareness that the other party would take its revenge later on.'b'Our contemporary politics make that kind of restraint unlikely. Without the possibility of a president being able to fall back on recess appointments, the temptation to foil the executive branch\xe2\x80\x99s entire agenda would be too great.'b'A president takes an oath to faithfully execute the laws; that requires having an executive branch led by presidential appointees. The inability to confirm those nominees would leave any president hamstrung to fill the most basic and core responsibilities of a chief executive.'b'To be sure, recess appointments are a limited tool, a modest safety valve to ameliorate the worst abuses of Senate power. But they are a necessary one to keep some check and balance in place. There is reason to fear that the Supreme Court will take that tool completely away \xe2\x80\x94 and make our dysfunctional politics and policy making much worse.'b'THERE\xe2\x80\x99S an old Italian saying, \xe2\x80\x9cA tavola non si invecchia,\xe2\x80\x9d which means: At the table, you don\xe2\x80\x99t grow old. All of us, of whatever age, need to socialize in public places to feel connected and alive.'b'That sense of shared conviviality was notably absent recently when 'b'police officers removed loiterers'b', many of them elderly Korean-Americans, from a McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s restaurant in Queens. The slew of comments that followed a report of the dispute were unsympathetic to those who whiled away their hours there.'b'One New York Times reader commented, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is only in the inner city that McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s and Starbucks are the gathering places for the unwashed, elderly, incompetent and infirm. I suppose this is the price for being a city dweller. These people ruin everything!\xe2\x80\x9d Others offered proposals to \xe2\x80\x9csolve\xe2\x80\x9d the problem by making the seating uncomfortable or removing it altogether, suing the elderly customers or playing blaring rap music to drive them away.'b'Older patrons may test the limits of public dawdling, but this phenomenon \xe2\x80\x94 call it loitering or community building \xe2\x80\x94 is essential for the survival of many people 65 and older. According to the last census, seniors constitute 12 percent of New York City\xe2\x80\x99s population. Many of them are single, sometimes far from family, and have lived in their localities for decades, their entire lives even. For the past four years, I have studied how neighborhood public places help older Manhattan residents avoid isolation and develop social ties that offer support, ranging from a sympathetic ear to a small emergency loan.'b'Like the teenagers who linger over sticky tabletops at Burger King and McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s, these older people have reached a time when their lives do not revolve around work and family. In the absence of those, these public places can anchor routines and provide a sense of structure and belonging.'b'A Manhattan bakery I observed had served as a de facto senior center for decades. The owner allowed customers to linger; many stopped in more than once a day. The bakery hummed with conversation: It felt more like a social club than a business, with a cup of coffee being the modest price of admission.'b'Yet the elderly are often now hindered by the loss of neighborhood places that have closed because of gentrification and rising retail rents. When that West Side bakery was shuttered, its patrons were forced to regroup in other neighborhood locales, including a nearby McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'For retirees on fixed incomes who may have difficulty walking more than a few blocks, McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s restaurants remain among the most democratic, freely accessible spaces. Much of the appeal lies in the fact that, as an elderly patron said to me, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can sit all day and nobody bothers you.\xe2\x80\x9d At the branch I observed, the tolerance for older New Yorkers also extended to the homeless, people who appeared mentally unstable and teenagers who congregated after school \xe2\x80\x94 even when they occasionally flung ice cubes at one another.'b'An afternoon at McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s opens up a world of people-watching opportunities. One elderly regular I observed sat an entire day and greeted a changing cast of passers-by, acquaintances and friends \xe2\x80\x94 a welcome alternative to sitting alone in her apartment with worsening dementia.'b'Ray Oldenburg, a professor emeritus of sociology at the University of West Florida, calls these gathering spots \xe2\x80\x9cthird places,\xe2\x80\x9d in contrast to the institutions of work and family that organize \xe2\x80\x9cfirst\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csecond\xe2\x80\x9d places. He sees bookstores, cafes and fast food joints as necessary yet endangered meeting points that foster community, often among diverse people. The Yale sociologist Elijah Anderson likens public settings such as Reading Terminal Market in Philadelphia to a \xe2\x80\x9ccosmopolitan canopy,\xe2\x80\x9d where people act with civility and converse with others to whom they might never otherwise speak.'b'The care-taking performed by such places extends to all kinds of groups. A professor of sociology at Princeton, Mitchell Duneier, has found a Chicago cafeteria that supports older working-class African-American men in this way. I have interviewed people who tell me they don\xe2\x80\x99t like senior centers because \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re depressing\xe2\x80\x9d; in these cafes, they can form emotional attachments with a wider mix of people.'b'Centers offer vital services, but McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s offers an alternative that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t segregate people from intergenerational contact. \xe2\x80\x9cI hate old people,\xe2\x80\x9d one 89-year-old man told me.'b'We should praise companies that allow loitering and devise public-private partnerships that benefit both older adults and business owners: I can imagine tax breaks for franchises that serve a high proportion of older adults and discounts to encourage patronage at off-peak hours. And we could replicate the 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCaf\xc3\xa9 Plus\xe2\x80\x9d'b' model of the Chicago nonprofit group Mather LifeWays in 30 American cities. These attractive coffee shops not only offer older customers who dislike traditional senior centers a 75-cent bottomless cup of coffee, but also welcome customers of all ages.'b'The 'b'Queens dispute has been settled'b', for now, by a compromise that allows the elderly Korean-American customers to linger, provided they vacate during the lunchtime rush. Battles over public space are as old as the city itself, but we have an opportunity to reimagine overlooked resources like McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s as new generations of older people find themselves needing places to hang out.'b'Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, in 'b'his second inaugural address'b' on Tuesday, promised to avoid what he called the \xe2\x80\x9cattitude of Washington, D.C.\xe2\x80\x9d Those in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s government, he said, believe that \xe2\x80\x9cI am always right and you are always wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But his gauzy message of bipartisanship, long one of his favorite themes, had a hollow ring to it this time around. After growing questions about the abuse of power by the governor and his colleagues, it will take more than talk of political harmony to wipe away the mounting evidence and accusations of aggressive bullying by his administration.'b'In fact, Mr. Christie\xe2\x80\x99s credibility is so low that there is only one way for him to dig out. He and his inner circle need to cooperate fully with the latest federal and state 'b'investigations looking into a four-day traffic jam'b' in Fort Lee, N.J., on the approach to the George Washington Bridge, apparently engineered by his staff and officials of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. As much as he declares himself ready to move forward, that can\xe2\x80\x99t happen until the public has real answers about the Fort Lee mess and, more broadly, about how Mr. Christie\xe2\x80\x99s government operates.'b'Already, state legislative committees have issued 20 subpoenas concerning the traffic jam, which may have been aimed at Fort Lee Democrats who declined to support the governor\xe2\x80\x99s re-election. Over the weekend, the mayor of Hoboken, Dawn Zimmer, added more questions for the governor and his team. Ms. Zimmer accused the governor\xe2\x80\x99s representatives 'b'of threatening to cut the city\xe2\x80\x99s federal aid for Hurricane Sandy damage'b' if she failed to support a major development in her town. Ms. Zimmer said that New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, warned her last year that without her support of the project, federal relief funds could slow to a trickle.'b'Ms. Guadagno issued 'b'a strongly worded denial'b' on Monday, and the governor\xe2\x80\x99s office has argued that Hoboken has received $70 million so far and \xe2\x80\x9cin no way lost out\xe2\x80\x9d in relief money. Still, this matter bears more investigation. Ms. Zimmer and Ms. Guadagno should be among those testifying under oath about the development and Hoboken\xe2\x80\x99s Sandy relief.'b'At his marathon news conference earlier this month, the governor apologized for the traffic fiasco and promised to cooperate with investigators. Since then, he has hired Randy Mastro, a longtime associate of former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, to conduct an internal review and assist the governor with \xe2\x80\x9cother appropriate inquiries.\xe2\x80\x9d That sounds like 'b'a lawyerly prelude to avoiding cooperation'b' with investigative committees in the State Legislature. He will have to become much more open about his actions if, as he said in his speech, he wants to avoid \xe2\x80\x9cthe attitude that puts political wins ahead of policy agreements.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Public trials are a cornerstone of a democratic society. But in the looking-glass world of legal challenges to the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s terror watch lists, even people who succeed in showing that they were mistakenly included on such a list have no easy path around the walls of official secrecy and obstruction.'b'On Jan. 14, following a trial 'b'frequently conducted behind closed doors'b', a federal judge in San Francisco ruled that the Department of Homeland Security had to correct its erroneous inclusion of a Malaysian academic on the no-fly list. At the same time, however, United States District Judge William Alsup, at the government\xe2\x80\x99s request, kept his actual ruling under seal until the court of appeals can weigh in.'b'The case involved Rahinah Ibrahim, a professor of architecture and design who had been a doctoral student at Stanford University. She sued the government after she was 'b'stopped from boarding a flight'b' to Hawaii in 2005, handcuffed and detained in a holding cell for two hours.'b'Officials later released her and said she had been mistakenly placed on the no-fly list, apparently because a professional group she was affiliated with had a name similar to that of a terrorist organization. Ms. Ibrahim flew to Hawaii and then on to Malaysia, but when she tried to return to the United States she found that her student visa had been revoked on unspecified terror-related grounds. She has not been able to return to the United States since.'b'In a 'b'three-page summary'b' of his ruling, Judge Alsup found that Ms. Ibrahim\xe2\x80\x99s due process rights had been violated. He ordered the government to correct its mistake and to certify under oath that it had done so. He also ordered officials to reveal to Ms. Ibrahim the specific grounds on which they denied her visa.'b'The ruling is a significant victory for government accountability, and it could be one for transparency, too, depending on how the appeals process plays out. Judge Alsup frequently showed his frustration at the government\xe2\x80\x99s demands that the courtroom be closed and that many of the trial documents be heavily redacted or kept from the public record.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTrials are important. Trials are supposed to be public,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'he told the government\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers'b' after they tried to classify evidence that was already public. Still, Judge Alsup reluctantly agreed to seal his full verdict until April 15 in order to give the federal appeals court time to address the ruling.'b'Meanwhile, the government continues to resist the release of the judge\xe2\x80\x99s verdict, even though it has admitted that Ms. Ibrahim\xe2\x80\x99s inclusion on the no-fly list was a \xe2\x80\x9c'b'regrettable mistake'b'\xe2\x80\x9d and has conceded that she \xe2\x80\x9cis not a threat to our national security.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And Ms. Ibrahim is far from alone. Terror watch lists remain pointlessly overbroad, with 'b'more than 875,000'b' names scattered among about a dozen lists. (The no-fly list, which consisted of 16 names before Sept. 11, 2001, had 'b'approximately 21,000 names'b' as of early 2012.)'b'After more than eight years and countless court proceedings, none of which Ms. Ibrahim was allowed to attend, she has won a measure of justice. But it should not have been this difficult.'b'Few peace conferences have been set up amid the unrelenting pessimism that surrounds the talks involving Syria that open Wednesday in Switzerland. But while a peace agreement is unlikely to be reached anytime soon, the meeting can still produce useful results. That has to be the approach of the conveners, including the United States, Russia and the United Nations. Crucial early goals should include a cease-fire and the delivery of humanitarian assistance to millions of desperate civilians.'b'There were some shaky moments before the conference, which has taken months to arrange, even got started, not least when the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, issued a last-minute invitation for Iran to attend, 'b'then rescinded it after strong objections'b' from America; from Saudi Arabia, Iran\xe2\x80\x99s regional rival; and from the Syrian opposition. The United States has said that Iran could not participate without publicly accepting a 2012 communiqu\xc3\xa9 that is the basis of the conference and stipulates that the goal is a transitional administration by \xe2\x80\x9cmutual consent\xe2\x80\x9d of the Assad government and the opposition.'b'In the view of the United States, this means that President Bashar al-Assad would be replaced, although Assad government officials and his Alawite sect could be part of the new structure. Iran has refused to accept any preconditions.'b'Just how the invitation from the United Nations was fumbled is unclear, but it is unfortunate that some diplomatic solution could not have been found to include Iran, which along with Russia is Syria\xe2\x80\x99s main ally, providing President Assad with arms and other military support. In an interview with The New York Times and Time magazine last month, the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said Iran would not be an impediment to a political settlement. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have every interest in helping the process in a peaceful direction,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are satisfied, totally satisfied,\xc2\xa0convinced that there is no military solution in Syria and that there is a need to find a political solution in Syria.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The deaths of thousands of civilians have not persuaded Russia and Iran to break with Mr. Assad or at least pressure him to end the slaughter and cruelty against civilians. Iran might have ensured itself a seat at the peace conference if it had promised to suspend arms deliveries while negotiations were underway or persuaded Mr. Assad to call a cease-fire. And there are good reasons for Russia and Iran to play a constructive role. The civil war has drawn affiliates of Al Qaeda and other Sunni extremists to the Syrian battlefield, and these could eventually be a threat to Shiite-led Iran as well as Russia, which is fighting extremists in the Caucasus and worrying about attacks during the Winter Olympics in Sochi next month.'b'Mr. Zarif acknowledged this problem generally, asserting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe continuation of this tragedy in Syria can only provide the best breeding ground for extremists who use this basically as a justification, as a recruiting climate, in order to wage the same type of activity in other parts of this region.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The peace conference is already providing a service by refocusing attention on the savagery of the war, now in its third year. On Monday, 'b'a team of legal and forensic experts'b' commissioned by the government of Qatar, a main sponsor of the Syrian opposition, said that thousands of photographs \xe2\x80\x94 apparently smuggled out of\xc2\xa0Syria\xc2\xa0by a defecting military police photographer \xe2\x80\x94 showed scarred, emaciated corpses that offered \xe2\x80\x9cdirect evidence\xe2\x80\x9d of mass torture by Syrian government forces.'b''b'Human Rights Watch'b'\xc2\xa0and Amnesty International have also accused opposition forces, as well as the government, of\xc2\xa0'b'human rights abuses'b'. In all, more than 100,000 Syrians are believed to have been killed in the war, many by government forces that have bombed cities and deprived civilians of food and other essential needs. It is well past time to say \xe2\x80\x9cenough\xe2\x80\x9d to more civilian deaths \xe2\x80\x94 and exactly the right time for a cease-fire and secure deliveries of humanitarian supplies.'b'It is hard to imagine a country more miserable than the Central African Republic, a potentially wealthy land that for much of its short history has been looted by its presidents, emperor and warlords and battered by rebellions and sectarian wars, the latest of which has been raging since March. A million people \xe2\x80\x94 nearly a quarter of the population \xe2\x80\x94 have fled their homes, and more than 1,000 have been killed in the past six weeks alone. So, to the degree to which they can offer any hope for this broken-down state, the announcement of a new interim president, a decision by the European Union to send a peacekeeping force and a pledge of half-a-billion dollars in humanitarian aid are all good news.'b'The interim president selected on Monday at a raucous, five-hour session of a \xe2\x80\x9cnational transition council\xe2\x80\x9d of rebels, rivals and politicians was Catherine Samba-Panza, a French-educated lawyer with a reputation for integrity and no ties either to the Muslim rebels or the Christian militia. Her selection was greeted with cheers in the assembly hall and dancing outside. That she is a woman \xe2\x80\x94 the third female head of state in post-colonial Africa \xe2\x80\x94 was especially welcomed by many people who felt that men had done nothing but lead the country on its vicious downward spiral.'b'On the same day as Ms. Samba-Panza\xe2\x80\x99s selection, the European Union agreed to send a force of several hundred soldiers to assist the 1,600 French troops and 4,400 African Union soldiers already in the Central African Republic. The European force is expected to remain for six months, by which time the African Union force is to have a strength of 6,000. The European Union force is sorely needed, especially to secure the airport so that humanitarian aid can start arriving.'b'But Europe also demonstrated that it remains far from enthusiastic about international peacekeeping operations. Some major European military powers \xe2\x80\x94 Britain, Germany and Italy \xe2\x80\x94 declined to participate, and tiny Estonia took the lead by committing 55 soldiers to the force. At another meeting in Brussels, the European Union pledged nearly $500 million in humanitarian aid, while the United States announced that it would be providing nearly $30 million in additional help, on top of $15 million previously pledged.'b'Whether the money and the troops are enough to restore order in a country in \xe2\x80\x9cfree fall,\xe2\x80\x9d as the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, described it, is far from certain. So far, the foreign peacekeepers have been largely clustered in Bangui, while the far reaches of the country have been racked with violence, which has continued unabated. But at least the suffering country now has a head of state who is not part of the problem, as all her predecessors were, and the financial and military aid should at least give Ms. Samba-Panza some means and time to show that there is an alternative to chaos and violence.'b'The plight of migrant Roma squatters, harshly scapegoated and ostracized, is only getting worse in France, despite the election promises of President Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande to break with the strict policies of the past with a more humane approach. French government raids and evictions doubled last year at squatter camps, which are cobbled together out of necessity by the hard-pressed Roma, or Gypsies. Their nomadic search across Europe for economic and social opportunity worsened during the recession as local politicians stereotyped them as undeserving interlopers.'b'In France, nearly 20,000 Roma were evicted from camps last year and told to move on, most of them in the Paris region, according to investigators for the Human Rights League and the European Roma Rights Center. \xe2\x80\x9cForced evictions continued almost everywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d their report said.'b'Some nations, including Germany, Hungary and Serbia have announced special programs to help the Roma. But, so far, nothing progressive has been seen from the government of President Hollande as it maintains a hard-line policy of evictions and repatriations to Romania and Bulgaria. Mr. Hollande\xe2\x80\x99s tone was unyielding when he commented on the eviction report: \xe2\x80\x9cDo we have to be ashamed of what we have done? No.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'His Socialist government\xe2\x80\x99s popular interior minister, Manuel Valls, has played to the nativist crowd in contending the Roma have little talent for adaptation in France and should be expelled. This prompted warnings from European Union officials that France must uphold its treaty commitments on human rights. But the approach from Mr. Valls, unfortunately, may play well in the French municipal elections this spring. It would be shameful for the Hollande government to pander to localized intolerance of the Roma.'b'BEIJING \xe2\x80\x94  In July 2013, two female traffic police officers in Tangshan in Hebei Province got into a fistfight and video footage of the scene went viral. The Tangshan public security bureau brushed off the incident, saying that the women were \xe2\x80\x9ctemporary traffic police officers.\xe2\x80\x9d The response was typical: Scandals in China are often blamed on lin shi gong, or \xe2\x80\x9ctemporary workers.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In a much more disturbing case last July, officers of the urban management enforcement bureau beat an unlicensed watermelon vendor to death on a busy street in Linwu in Hunan Province. Following the attack, which was photographed by onlookers who circulated their pictures online, some of the assailants were dismissed by the local authorities as \xe2\x80\x9cauxiliary\xe2\x80\x9d urban management officers. Auxiliary officer is another name for a temporary worker.'b'Blaming'b' lin shi gong'b' has become so widespread in recent years that the practice has even been criticized by the government\xe2\x80\x99s own newspapers.'b'China Daily, a party newspaper, published an article in December 2010 under the headline \xe2\x80\x9cBlaming Temporary Workers?\xe2\x80\x9d declaring that \xe2\x80\x9cemployers, especially some government departments, should stop using temporary workers as an excuse to shirk their responsibilities in scandals such as forced demolition, and the government should expedite the process of improving the system of accountability to stop the abuse of power.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This temporary-worker ploy begs several questions: Who hired the workers? Whose orders were they following? Who was in charge? Did they receive adequate training before they began work?'b'Chinese businesses and government use temporary workers like much of the rest of the world to cut costs or to avoid red tape: Many are given jobs with lower pay and fewer benefits than regular staff. But whether the scapegoats are, in fact, temporary workers, or full-time staff members who are called temporary for political expediency, the logic of the situation is simple: Temporary workers are not formal government employees, so whatever goes wrong, the government need not assume responsibility.'b'In the past, the government would deny or write off its errors with outrageous lies. It claimed, for example, that the Great Famine of 1959-62 was caused by \xe2\x80\x9cthree years of natural disasters.\xe2\x80\x9d But in the Information Age, when the malfeasance of government agents is often caught on cellphone cameras and distributed online, denial is rarely an option. The government has had to find scapegoats.'b'The obsession with temporary workers is indicative of a larger failure: temporary governance.'b'In China, grandiose concepts like \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental national policies,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cgoverning strategies\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cFive-Year Plan\xe2\x80\x9d appear constantly in the official media, but the government actually lacks long-term strategies or plans. Many policies, regulations and laws are shortsighted and the products of a knee-jerk approach to governance.'b'Perhaps the most damning effect of the government\xe2\x80\x99s temporary approach to governance is in the legal sphere. Mao once said, \xe2\x80\x9cAn editorial in the People\xe2\x80\x99s Daily can be carried out nationwide \xe2\x80\x94 what\xe2\x80\x99s the need for laws?\xe2\x80\x9d In the post-Mao era, the government promulgated a huge number of laws and regulations, in an effort to integrate with the rest of the world. But many of them have an obvious temporary flavor.'b'In 2007, a man in Sichuan Province was hit by a train and died. Acting in accordance with \xe2\x80\x9ctemporary regulations on handling railway accidents that involve other vehicles, as well as deaths and injury,\xe2\x80\x9d the Railways Ministry awarded his family a payment of 700 yuan (about $100), according to the Xinhua news agency. The temporary regulations were issued in 1979.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cRe-education through labor,\xe2\x80\x9d the notorious system for incarcerating people without court proceedings, is perhaps the best example. What in 1957 was supposed to be a temporary measure for punishing offenders for minor crimes stood as the law of the land for 56 years, until it was abandoned last year.'b'Three years ago a publisher used an article of mine without permission. Later I was sent a payment of 30 yuan, for 2,700 words. That payment was in accordance with the 1990 \xe2\x80\x9ctemporary regulations governing payment for authors,\xe2\x80\x9d which stipulates payment of 10 to 30 yuan per 1,000 characters. Two and a half decades after this regulation was issued, 30 yuan does not cover a taxi ride across Beijing.'b'Not only are personnel and laws often ephemeral, even government agencies are set up on a temporary basis. There are innumerable temporary \xe2\x80\x9coffices,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cleading groups\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccommittees\xe2\x80\x9d in China that have ill-defined powers, with no legal basis for operating.  Netizens have poured ridicule on peculiar government organizations like the \xe2\x80\x9cOffice for Prohibiting the Consumption of Alcohol During Lunchtime\xe2\x80\x9d in Henan Province and the \xe2\x80\x9cOffice for Immediate Action,\xe2\x80\x9d which is supposed to improve government efficiency, in Shangdong Province. The \xe2\x80\x9cOffice for Steamed-Bun Manufacturing and Marketing Management,\xe2\x80\x9d ostensibly started to regulate steamed-bun quality, was closed in 2001 after public complaints over its absurdity.'b'How effective is China\xe2\x80\x99s temporary governance? Some observers can point to the economic growth over the past 30 years as proof of Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s great achievements. But success is more than economic indicators. I am more concerned about the degrading quality of air, water and food, and about what the country\xe2\x80\x99s shaky political foundation means for the future of the country.'b'Over the past three decades, a once-blue sky has become a toxic smog, and political power has become a tool to make money and a weapon to kill. I have witnessed numerous preventable disasters, and the loss of countless lives.'b'This is the consequence of temporary governance, and the damage will be permanent. Yet no one takes responsibility for the country\xe2\x80\x99s failures because, after all, it is governed by temporary workers.'b''b'\n'b'Murong Xuecun 'b' is a novelist and blogger and the author of \xe2\x80\x9cLeave Me Alone: A Novel of Chengdu.\xe2\x80\x9d This article was translated by Jane Weizhen Pan and Martin Merz from the Chinese.'b''b'LAGOS, Nigeria \xe2\x80\x94  Growing up in my village in Nigeria, my friends and I had a favorite game. We called it Asesebhor \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cAre we there yet?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It was a game of trust. You picked a playmate to lead you to an undisclosed spot.

When your guide stopped moving, you had arrived.'b'Often, you would open your eyes and be amused to find that you were in another part of the village. But sometimes, a rogue playmate would lead you into a bush of thorns or brush of poison ivy. So you learned to be on your guard. If your guide was in the habit of such tricks, you learned to slyly take a peek during the game. Though this ruined the fun of surprise, it kept you from getting hurt.'b'I cannot help but think that this is precisely the situation that the president of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan, has placed himself in now \xe2\x80\x94 playing a game of Asesebhor with the untrustworthy associates in his cabinet and in other positions of influence and power.'b'To a close observer of his administration, it is obvious that most of the ministers, special advisers, special assistants and a host of others are in his government only to bleed the country dry. And from all public indications, it would appear that our president is oblivious to their deceitful games.'b'That is the kindest interpretation I can put on Mr. Jonathan\xe2\x80\x99s inattention to the blatant corruption all around him. The alternative is that he is complicit in the corrupt actions that are clogging the wheels of progress in the country.'b'One thing is sure: Whatever trust the president stubbornly continues to hold in his cronies and kingmakers, whatever political debts they are collecting, whatever benefit he stands to reap by ignoring the deadwoods in his administration, it only hurts the ordinary Nigerians who voted him into power in 2011.'b'And whatever game he is playing with the voters\xe2\x80\x99 trust, he should stop now and systematically clean up his administration.'b'Mr. Jonathan is not incapable of making tough decisions. He recently fired five military commanders in one fell swoop, partly because of their failures in combating the Boko Haram insurgency and partly to consolidate his power in advance of next year\xe2\x80\x99s elections.'b'But in the area of corruption, the president has turned a blind eye.'b'In one recent scandal, Stella Oduah, the minister of aviation, was accused of spending 255 million naira \xe2\x80\x94 about $1.6 million \xe2\x80\x94 on the purchase of two armored cars that were worth perhaps one-quarter as much, as well as of falsifying an academic credential from an American college.'b'But the president has not yet acted against this minister. She continues in office while a report by a committee that was set up to investigate this case is gathering dust somewhere in the presidential offices, without having been made public.'b'The president\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to take action against her only lends credence to the widely held suspicion that some members of his administration are untouchable. No matter their offense, the president treats them as if he trusts them blindly, while he and his cronies engage in diversionary tactics.'b'A few weeks ago, for example, the president asked Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, to resign from his post, a demand Mr. Sanusi has resisted. Mr. Sanusi had written a letter asking the president to look into a case of $49.8 billion in receipts from the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation that are now unaccounted for.'b'Whereas a minister accused of misappropriating public funds is allowed to remain in office, a central bank governor has been hounded for seeking the president\xe2\x80\x99s intervention in a case that strongly suggests corrupt practices in a government-owned corporation.'b'When the president acts \xe2\x80\x94 or fails to act \xe2\x80\x94 in this manner, ordinary Nigerians wonder where just exactly he is  going, or where his advisers are leading him.'b'Recently, Mr. Jonathan signed into law a ban on same-sex marriage, even as another bill, which many Nigerians believe would curb corrupt practices in the oil and gas industry, suffered setback after setback in the Parliament.'b'The result: Nothing has been done to end corruption involving the single most important source of funds for the Nigerian government, but horror stories of gay-bashing by law enforcement officers have already become rife.'b'And gross failures in vital services like power supply, health care and education continue to get almost no effective attention.'b'In Nigeria, corrupt elected and appointed government officials typically do not resign from office unless they are forced out. So it is the duty of the commander in chief to clean a corrupt house.'b'Even Mr. Jonathan\xe2\x80\x99s mentor, former President Olusegun Obasanjo, who was behind Mr. Jonathan\xe2\x80\x99s rise to power, criticized him for tolerating corruption in the oil industry and other sectors and mismanaging the fight against Boko Haram. Mr. Jonathan rejected Mr. Obasanjo\xe2\x80\x99s attack in an open letter.'b'It is time for Mr. Jonathan to open his eyes, stop the dangerous game he is playing, and fire his corrupt playmates before the voters take the matter out of his hands in the general elections scheduled for next year.'b''b'\n'b'Victor Ehikhamenor, 'b' a Nigerian-American writer and artist, is the author of an essay collection, \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse Me! One Nigerian\xe2\x80\x99s Funny Outsized Reality.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b''b'MADRID \xe2\x80\x94  You know a monarchy is in trouble when the queen is jeered at the Royal Theater, of all places, and by a classical music audience. This happened to Queen Sof\xc3\xada of 'b'Spain'b' last year in Madrid \xe2\x80\x94 a scene then repeated elsewhere with other members of the royal family.'b'A recent poll put support for the Spanish monarchy at a historic low: More than 60 percent of Spaniards want 'b'King Juan Carlos'b' to step down. And all this is happening amid a series of scandals involving the royal household, the most serious of which are corruption charges against the king\xe2\x80\x99s son-in-law, also involving the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, Princess Cristina.'b'What is astonishing about this turn of events is that the Spanish monarchy was once deemed rock-solid. King Juan Carlos was praised both inside and outside Spain as a model monarch; the man who in the 1970s steered the country\xe2\x80\x99s complicated transition from the military rule of Gen. Francisco Franco to parliamentary democracy; the king who stood up to an attempted military coup in 1981. He was said to be loved by his people, who were grateful for what he had done \xe2\x80\x94 and it was true.'b'What has changed? Not the king, but the country. Popular opinion has changed so fast and so dramatically that it is perhaps not surprising the monarchy has failed to keep pace.'b'Two things transform a people more than any other: war and economic hardship. War was what shaped the Spain that loved King Juan Carlos. It was the haunting memories of the 1936-39 civil war that won people over to the monarchy after Franco\xe2\x80\x99s death in 1975: Few were monarchists at heart, but the institution seemed to offer a safe path to stability.'b'Nearly four decades later, economic privation is creating a new Spain. The financial crisis hit the country hard, leaving a trail of home repossessions, draconian cutbacks to public services and low wages. Last year, there were fears of a complete meltdown of Spain\xe2\x80\x99s banking system, avoided only at the taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 expense. The unemployment rate stands at a staggering 27 percent.'b'All this has made Spaniards angry at the establishment and hypersensitive to the misuse of public money. That\xe2\x80\x99s why, after they heard that the king\xe2\x80\x99s son-in-law was being investigated for fraud on a grand scale, their blood boiled. Public esteem for the monarchy started to decline.'b'The real disaster came in April 2012. The country learned that the king had broken his hip while hunting elephants in Botswana, reportedly as the guest of a Syrian-born Saudi magnate. He was also \xe2\x80\x94 unusually, for a private trip \xe2\x80\x94 unaccompanied by the queen. The affair opened a Pandora\xe2\x80\x99s box of awkward questions \xe2\x80\x94 from the state of the royal marriage to the nature of the king\xe2\x80\x99s business dealings.'b'Above all, people were livid at the insensitivity of his shooting of pachyderms while the country was reeling under harsh austerity. The fact that the king was also a patron of the World Wildlife Fund did not help. (Soon after, the conservation group unceremoniously sacked the monarch.) To this day, the mere mention of an elephant in Spain sends people into an uproar over the king.'b'The irony is that Juan Carlos had been hunting and doing business around the world all his life. Most people simply didn\xe2\x80\x99t know. The king and his family were shielded from criticism by an informal media covenant, their sources of income kept secret in part.'b'With hindsight, this proved to have been a mistake. The sudden contrast between image and reality only made disclosure all the more embarrassing. Now, thanks to the scandal, there is more transparency in the royal household, but probably not enough. Its official budget approved by Parliament is known to be around 8 million euros, but this is widely believed to represent a small part of the family\xe2\x80\x99s total worth.'b'To his credit, the king apologized for his ill-fated safari. Yet he lacked experience in apologizing \xe2\x80\x94 and his people, in forgiving. It was simply awkward, and it\xe2\x80\x99s become increasingly awkward as the king seeks to regain the favor of his subjects by multiplying his public appearances in spite of a series of surgeries from which he has not fully recovered.'b'As to the future, many believe that the appearance in court of Princess Cristina, regardless of the outcome, could be a cathartic moment that would allow a reset. That seems na\xc3\xafve. The king\xe2\x80\x99s men pin their hopes on an early end to the economic hardship and a shift in the general mood that would bring back the Spain of yore, more tolerant of housing bubbles and royal blunders.'b'That could well occur: Spaniards who change their minds are not unheard of. But others speak openly of Juan Carlos\xe2\x80\x99s abdication. They note that polls also show there is a chance that Crown Prince Felipe, young and untainted, could restore the monarchy\xe2\x80\x99s lost prestige.'b'Juan Carlos has made it clear he will not even consider stepping aside, but even on this, ill luck dogs him: The abdication last year of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, soon followed by King Albert II of Belgium renouncing the crown, renewed the pressure. Rather cruelly, even the pope stepped down. And yet, Juan Carlos remains adamant: He wants to be the king he was.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s not the problem: He is the king he was.

Nevertheless, according to a 'b'recent investigation'b' by Verizon, 60 percent of successful hacks were not detected until months after the attacks began. In the wake of recent high-profile hacker attacks against Target, Neiman Marcus and other retailers, the obvious question is: Why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t all that money done any good?'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not for lack of trying. Much of the money is well spent, paying for armies of technical engineers and state-of-the-art security applications.'b'The problem is not the resources, or the personnel, or the data. It\xe2\x80\x99s that many organizations simply don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to arrange the data to identify suspicious patterns and weaknesses, at least not fast enough. There\xe2\x80\x99s too much data, and not enough perspective.'b'What we need, then, is not necessarily more money or information, but a better way of knowing what it means \xe2\x80\x94 of interpreting the data to discover an unknown attack as it happens or, even better, anticipate the next attack.'b'The amount of security-related data that the typical enterprise manages today is staggering. A Fortune 500-size company could have over an exabyte (a billion gigabytes) of data scattered across thousands of servers and hundreds of thousands of software applications. All told, a detailed investigation of a complex, stealthy attack could involve trillions of discrete data points.'b'Most of those data points, even security-related points, are noise. Warnings are generated each time an easily blocked virus tries to gain access, or an employee enters the wrong password. Across a large company, that could mean thousands of warnings a day, all of which must be investigated. This noise makes the job of rapidly identifying serious attacks an overwhelming task.'b'The solution lies in finding a way to examine the data so that analysts can quickly identify suspicious patterns. Instead of programs to generate more data, we need different tools to understand them. And it turns out that the best tools are right in our heads: our eyes.'b'The fast-growing field of graph analytics involves the creation of a visual representation of \xe2\x80\x9cobjects\xe2\x80\x9d within an organization: people, devices, computers, applications. The relationships are displayed as lines linking objects. (My company, YarcData, develops graph-analytic platforms for a variety of applications.)'b'With this type of analysis, objects and their relationships uncover connections that are hidden in the numbers but obvious to the eye. It allows a user to see, immediately, the object\xe2\x80\x99s broader context. A failed attack on one computer might not raise a flag on its own \xe2\x80\x94 but it could if an analyst saw, simultaneously, that the target was connected to other critical targets, or that the attack was a modification of a recent failed attack.'b'Our brains conduct such contextual assessments every day, albeit on a much simpler, smaller scale. Think about when one hears a strange noise. Within a split second our mind connects the noise with its context. And we can ask creative questions, drawing on seemingly unrelated correlations that a computer program could never be robust enough to handle. Was it late at night? Is the family dog in that room? If it was in the middle of the day and the dog was in that room, we would react differently than if it was a strange noise late at night, with the dog asleep at our feet and no one else in the house.'b'Consider another example: My phone has just mysteriously connected to a website I have never visited, or intended to visit. Our minds ask the same sorts of contextual questions: Am I using the phone? What time of day is it? How many websites have I visited in the last five minutes? The last 30 minutes? Could a new app be connecting to sites to bump ad revenues?'b'All this information is already present in a company\xe2\x80\x99s data network. Graph analytics facilitates presentation in a visual fashion to allow our eyes, and brains, to do the top-level processing, enabling rapid understanding of all these events, then identifying the difference that would explain whether it was a malicious application or just a harmless bit of spam. Someone, somewhere, has to decide on a fast, accurate response.'b'Why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t this been done already? The industry has tried. But the speed and scope in computing power were not available until recently. And of course, with so much invested in traditional cybersecurity methods, many companies have been loath to try something new.'b'That must change soon. Target has pledged to make \xe2\x80\x9csignificant changes,\xe2\x80\x9d and it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that name-brand retailers around the globe will be undertaking security audits and taking measures to harden themselves against attacks and protect customer data.'b'Winning at cybersecurity today isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily about collecting more data. It is about unleashing the information in the data that\xe2\x80\x99s already there \xe2\x80\x94 and doing so not in weeks, days and hours, but in minutes and seconds.'b'A generation ago, the Supreme Court was faced with deciding whether the police needed a warrant before installing a newfangled device at a telephone company switching office that could record the numbers dialed from a particular telephone. The answer the court gave was no.'b'After all, Justice Harry A. Blackmun explained in his 'b'majority opinion,'b' people know that the telephone company keeps track of the numbers they call -- they see their long-distance calls listed on their monthly bill. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is too much to believe,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat telephone subscribers, under these circumstances, harbor any general expectation that the numbers they dial will remain secret.\xe2\x80\x9d The absence of a \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate expectation of privacy\xe2\x80\x9d in information voluntarily conveyed to the phone company, the court concluded, meant that the use of the device, a \xe2\x80\x9cpen register,\xe2\x80\x9d was not even a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of unreasonable searches. Hence, no warrant was required.'b'This case, Smith v. Maryland, was no big deal in its day. (And the defendant in the garden-variety case that led to the decision was no criminal mastermind -- he was making harassing calls from his home phone.) The majority opinion was only 11 pages long. There were three dissenting votes, but the dissenting opinions lacked passion. After Justice Blackmun circulated his final draft in June 1979, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger responded by agreeing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe urge for privacy does not rise to the level of a constitutionally protected right.\xe2\x80\x9d The chief justice added that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress could require a warrant but the Constitution does not.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He ended his note with a lighthearted P.S.: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to use a public phone for my calls to my bookie.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Thirty-five years later, telephones and their users\xe2\x80\x99 privacy concerns are obviously no joking matter. They are the question of the hour. Constitutional challenges to the National Security Agency\xe2\x80\x99s bulk telephone data collection 'b'produced'b' 'b'opposing'b' Federal District Court rulings last month, and the issue appears destined for the Supreme Court.'b'Meanwhile, the justices last week 'b'accepted two cases'b' with less obvious national security implications but much greater relevance to many Americans: whether the police need a warrant in order to search the contents of a cellphone of a person they have just arrested. These cases, United States v. Wurie and Riley v. California, will probably be argued in April and decided in June.'b'All the cases will be dissected in minute detail in the coming months, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not my goal here. I\xe2\x80\x99m interested in the ultimate answers, of course, but what I find most intriguing at the moment is watching how judges respond to the challenge of figuring out how old precedents fit with new realities.'b'The fit is awkward at best; the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s description of a pen register -- \xe2\x80\x9ca mechanical device that records\xe2\x80\x9d on a paper tape \xe2\x80\x9cthe numbers dialed on a telephone by monitoring the electrical impulses caused when the dial on the telephone is released\xe2\x80\x9d -- reads like something from Alexander Graham Bell\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory. Differing conclusions about whether the old cases are even relevant, let alone controlling, have divided the lower courts, state as well as federal. For anyone interested in how the law develops in a system ostensibly governed by precedent, the progress of these cases promises to be the best show in town.'b'Take the N.S.A. cases. The government\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional defense relies heavily on the pen-register decision for the argument that anyone who voluntarily uses a phone yields up any reasonable privacy interest in the \xe2\x80\x9cbulk telephony metadata,\xe2\x80\x9d consisting of the numbers from which calls were made and received.'b'Judge Richard J. Leon of the Federal District Court in Washington was 'b'having none of it'b'. In the Smith case, he said, the Supreme Court \xe2\x80\x9cconsidered a one-time, targeted request for data regarding an individual suspect in a criminal investigation.\xe2\x80\x9d He suggested that the court that issued that decision would agree that it was of \xe2\x80\x9clittle value\xe2\x80\x9d in assessing the N.S.A. program: \xe2\x80\x9cThe notion that the government could collect similar data on hundreds of millions of people and retain that data for a five-year period, updating it with new data every day in perpetuity, was at best, in 1979, the stuff of science fiction.\xe2\x80\x9d Judge Leon ordered the government to stop collecting telephone data on the two plaintiffs in the case, Klayman v. Obama. He then granted a stay to permit the government to appeal.'b'But barely a week later, another federal district judge, William H. Pauley III of the Federal District Court in Manhattan, gave a 'b'very different reading'b" to Smith v. Maryland. He suggested that the pen register, aimed at a known individual, entailed a more direct invasion of personal privacy than does the N.S.A.'s collection of anonymous data: \xe2\x80\x9cSmith involved the investigation of a single crime and the collection of telephone call detail records collected by the telephone company at its central office, examined by the police, and related to the target of their investigation, a person identified previously by law enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d If that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, Judge Pauley concluded, then neither was the N.S.A.'s program. \xe2\x80\x9cClear precedent applies because Smith held that a subscriber has no legitimate expectation of privacy in telephony metadata created by third parties.\xe2\x80\x9d"b'In his opinion in A.C.L.U. v. Clapper, Judge Pauley took note of the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s own worries about adapting old cases to new technologies. Two years ago this week, in 'b'United States v. Jones,'b' the court ruled 9 to 0 that the placement by the police of a GPS device on a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s car in order to monitor his whereabouts over a period of weeks was a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.'b'Justice Antonin Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s majority opinion decided the case the old-fashioned way: that by attaching the device to the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s car, the police had committed a physical trespass. But five justices, in concurring opinions, warned that the deeper doctrinal implications of the case couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so easily avoided. For one thing, many cars come already equipped with GPS systems, Justice Samuel A. Alito observed.'b'And Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in perhaps the best-known opinion of her tenure so far, wrote that \xe2\x80\x9cit may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties.\xe2\x80\x9d Citing Maryland v. Smith, she added, \xe2\x80\x9cThis approach is ill suited to the digital age, in which people reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Still, as Judge Pauley noted in his opinion in the New York case, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Supreme Court did not overrule Smith.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The cellphone cases the court accepted last week challenge the applicability of another Fourth Amendment precedent from the 1970s. 'b'United States v. Robinson'b' applied a doctrine known as \xe2\x80\x9csearch incident to arrest\xe2\x80\x9d to uphold the warrantless search of a cigarette pack in the coat pocket of a man they had just arrested for driving without a license. Inside the pack were 14 capsules filled with heroin. Writing for the court, then-Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist said that as long as there was probable cause to make an arrest in the first place, \xe2\x80\x9ca full search of the person is not only an exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment, but is also a \xe2\x80\x98reasonable\xe2\x80\x99 search under that Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But a cellphone is much more revealing than a pack of cigarettes, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston, said last May in one of the cases the Supreme Court has agreed to review. By a vote of 2 to 1, the appeals court suppressed the evidence -- drugs, a gun and ammunition -- the police found when they tracked the address of \xe2\x80\x9cmy house\xe2\x80\x9d from the call log of a cellphone belonging to a man they had just arrested after witnessing his involvement in an apparent drug sale.'b'Writing for the appeals court, Judge Norman H. Stahl 'b'criticized the government'b' for having \xe2\x80\x9chewed to a formalistic interpretation of the case law,\xe2\x80\x9d namely the \xe2\x80\x9csearch incident to arrest\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine of the Robinson case. \xe2\x80\x9cThe court, more than 35 years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d Judge Stahl wrote, \xe2\x80\x9ccould not have envisioned a world in which the vast majority of arrestees would be carrying on their person an item containing not physical evidence but a vast store of intangible data -- data that is not immediately destructible and poses no threat to the arresting officers.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'On the other hand, the California Supreme Court in 2011 adopted the Robinson decision as part of its own interpretation of the Fourth Amendment, meaning that the police in California can routinely search the cellphones of the people they arrest. The California case the justices accepted is an appeal by a man who was arrested for having loaded weapons in his car and whose cellphone contained text and photographs suggesting involvement in a gang shooting.'b'Three years ago, the California Legislature passed a bill to require the police to obtain a warrant before searching a cellphone. But Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed the bill, saying that \xe2\x80\x9ccourts are better suited to resolve the complex and case-specific issues relating to constitutional search-and-seizure protections.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not every day that an elected official invites judges to legislate from the bench. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the Supreme Court will do. But the justices surely know that they can\xe2\x80\x99t put the future on hold. It\xe2\x80\x99s here.'b'The first thing I can remember buying for myself, aside from candy, of course, was not a toy. It was a book.'b'It was a religious picture book about Job from the Bible, bought at Kmart.'b'It was on one of the rare occasions when my mother had enough money to give my brothers and me each a few dollars so that we could buy whatever we wanted.'b'We all made a beeline for the toy aisle, but that path led through the section of greeting cards and books. As I raced past the children\xe2\x80\x99s books, they stopped me. Books to me were things most special. Magical. Ideas eternalized.'b'Books were the things my brothers brought home from school before I was old enough to attend, the things that engrossed them late into the night as they did their homework. They were the things my mother brought home from her evening classes, which she attended after work, to earn her degree and teaching certificate.'b'Books, to me, were powerful and transformational.'b'So there, in the greeting card section of the store, I flipped through children\xe2\x80\x99s books until I found the one that I wanted, the one about Job. I thought the book fascinating in part because it was a tale of hardship, to which I could closely relate, and in part because it contained the first drawing I\xe2\x80\x99d even seen of God, who in those pages was a white man with a white beard and a long robe that looked like one of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s nightgowns.'b'I picked up the book, held it close to my chest and walked proudly to the checkout. I never made it to the toy aisle.'b'That was the beginning of a lifelong journey in which books would shape and change me, making me who I was to become.'b'We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford many books. We had a small collection. They were kept on a homemade, rough-hewn bookcase about three feet tall with three shelves. One shelf held the encyclopedia, a gift from our uncle, books that provided my brothers and me a chance to see the world without leaving home.'b'The other shelves held a hodgepodge of books, most of which were giveaways my mother picked when school librarians thinned their collections at the end of the year. I read what we had and cherished the days that our class at school was allowed to go to the library \xe2\x80\x94 a space I approached the way most people approach religious buildings \xe2\x80\x94 and the days when the bookmobile came to our school from the regional library.'b'It is no exaggeration to say that those books saved me: from a life of poverty, stress, depression and isolation.'b'James Baldwin, one of the authors who most spoke to my spirit, once put it this way:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me the most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, who had ever been alive.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That is the inimitable power of literature, to give context and meaning to the trials and triumphs of living. That is why it was particularly distressing that The Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s Jordan Weissmann 'b'pointed out Tuesday'b' that:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Pew Research Center 'b'reported'b' last week that nearly a quarter of American adults had not read a single book in the past year. As in, they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t cracked a paperback, fired up a Kindle, or even hit play on an audiobook while in the car. The number of non-book-readers has 'b'nearly tripled since 1978'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The details of the Pew report are quite interesting and somewhat counterintuitive. Among American adults, women were more likely to have read at least one book in the last 12 months than men. Blacks were more likely to have read a book than whites or Hispanics. People aged 18-29 were more likely to have read a book than those in any other age group. And there was little difference in readership among urban, suburban and rural population.'b'I understand that we are now inundated with information, and people\xe2\x80\x99s reading habits have become fragmented to some degree by bite-size nuggets of text messages and social media, and that takes up much of the time that could otherwise be devoted to long-form reading.

He\xe2\x80\x99s been to the Vatican before, but not with 'b'this'b' pope, who is perhaps the only person in the world almost everybody likes.'b'Except Rush Limbaugh, which sort of makes it even better.'b'The president\xe2\x80\x99s visit, which is scheduled for March, comes at an interesting intersection in the two men\xe2\x80\x99s careers. Pope Francis can currently do no wrong, and Barack Obama can do no right. Recently, his administration decided to move its Vatican Embassy into a more secure building, and the outcry was so intense that you\xe2\x80\x99d think Obama had ordered a re-creation of the Sack of Rome.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA slap in the face to the 78 million Catholics in the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d one congressman screeched.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy would our president close our Embassy to the Vatican?\xe2\x80\x9d twittered Jeb Bush. \xe2\x80\x9cHopefully, it is not retribution for Catholic organizations opposing Obamacare.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As political tweets go, this is a keeper on two counts. First, we can once again marvel at Republican politicians\xe2\x80\x99 ability to insert the Affordable Care Act into everything. (Coming soon: How the individual mandate robbed Oprah Winfrey of an Oscar nomination.)'b'Second, we can mark the official end of the former governor of Florida\xe2\x80\x99s career as the safe, sane fallback option in 2016.'b'But about the Vatican Embassy: the State Department has been trying to move it into a compound that includes the American Embassy to Italy. This will save money and improve security. Instantly, certain parties detected a plot.'b'Two former ambassadors to the Vatican, Ray Flynn (Clinton) and Jim Nicholson (Bush), penned a blistering op-ed for The Wall Street Journal in which they called the move \xe2\x80\x9ca colossal mistake\xe2\x80\x9d that would squish the Holy See\xe2\x80\x99s separate identity. Diplomatically, they attributed more intense feelings to others. (\xe2\x80\x9c... many have seen the move as a deliberate slap at the Catholic Church and the pope; some may even detect veiled anti-Catholicism.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'Fast-forward to many variations on the headline \xe2\x80\x9cObama Insults Catholics.\xe2\x80\x9d The State Department pointed out that the new quarters would be in an entirely different building, with an entirely different entrance than the Italian Embassy. And that while the new embassy will not be in the Vatican, neither is the current one. Or that of any other country. The Vatican is only two-tenths of a square mile, and more than half of that is gardens.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn fact, our new location is a tenth of a mile closer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Under Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a clear diminishment of the importance of the Holy See post,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholson.'b'Cynics might wonder why we have an embassy for the Vatican in the first place. The total population is about 800 people, which is approximately one-eighth the seating capacity of Radio City Music Hall. It has virtually none of the attributes you find in an actual country. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even have a cuisine.'b'But, obviously, nobody is going to disrespect the Vatican while Pope Francis is around. He won the world\xe2\x80\x99s heart by quickly doing a few things that were so obvious, it\xe2\x80\x99s amazing no previous pontiff figured them out. Such as: if you are going to talk about the poor all the time, you should try to avoid gold furniture.'b'Without changing any of the Church\xe2\x80\x99s reactionary rules on contraception, homosexuality or abortion, Francis changed the tone just by saying that Catholics should stop obsessing about sex. I cannot imagine what the nuns who ran my old high school would have thought about that theory. Really, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to overestimate what an incredible time-saver this is.'b'And instead of just pleading for greater charity toward the poor, Francis decreed that the world needed to drop the idea that when the rich got richer, everybody eventually benefited. Trickle-down economics amounted to a \xe2\x80\x9ccrude and na\xc3\xafve trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power.\xe2\x80\x9d This would have been where he lost Rush Limbaugh.'b'Ken Langone, the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot, told Cardinal Timothy Dolan that a rich benefactor to a rebuilding project at St. Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s Cathedral in New York might hesitate to cough up his promised million-dollar donation because of the pope\xe2\x80\x99s attitude. Cardinal Dolan said he assured Langone that while the pope loves the poor, \xe2\x80\x9che also loves rich people.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Republican budget guru Representative Paul Ryan said the pope\xe2\x80\x99s apparent lack of enthusiasm for the capitalist system was due to an unfortunate upbringing. \xe2\x80\x9cThe guy is from Argentina. They haven\xe2\x80\x99t had real capitalism in Argentina,\xe2\x80\x9d he told The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Even if Francis was down on capitalism, no capitalists wanted to sound down on Francis. Meanwhile, President Obama has spent the last five years dodging calls for new taxes and protecting the insurance industry from health care reform. Stocks have been at an all-time high, and Wall Street hates him.'b'The moral is: It\xe2\x80\x99s way easier to be pope.'b'When I asked readers for \xe2\x80\x9cneglected topics\xe2\x80\x9d that journalists should cover more in 2014, one of the suggestions was a delicate but vital topic: family breakdown and the rise of single-parent households.'b'This is an issue that, frustratingly, the right has hijacked and the left has been reluctant to confront. Yet it\xe2\x80\x99s intimately related to poverty in our country.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t politically correct to call attention to the effects of the increase in single women giving birth,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'wrote Colton'b', one reader who suggested the topic. \xe2\x80\x9cThree important effects are the greatly increased incidence of long-term poverty, poor development outcomes and poor educational achievement among the children.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOur hesitancy to face the problem may result from fear of accusations of being moralists, racists, anti-woman, anti-freedom, supporting government decisions into personal decisions,\xe2\x80\x9d Lucinda noted.'b'Conservatives are, I think, correct to highlight family stability as a fundamental issue that goes to the welfare of children as much as food stamps or anything else. Children raised by a single parent are more than three times as likely to live in poverty as those raised by two parents, according to census data.'b'After Daniel Patrick Moynihan raised the issue in 1965 in the context of black families, he was condemned in liberal circles as intolerant if not racist. Over time, though, there has been a growing appreciation that he was ahead of his time, and 'b'as the Urban Institute notes'b', the percentage of white babies born to unwed mothers is now the same as it was for black babies when he sounded his alarm.'b'Yet if the issue is critical, it often emerges as part of a narrative that hectors the poor for their poverty. Republicans focus on \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal irresponsibility\xe2\x80\x9d or suggest that there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be done about poverty until \xe2\x80\x9cthose people\xe2\x80\x9d stop having kids outside of marriage.'b'As I see it, conservatives are right in their diagnosis that the issue is critical in addressing poverty, but they are wrong in their prescriptions, while liberals are often too politically correct to address the issue at all.'b'First, the backdrop. At last count in the United States, 'b'almost 36 percent of births were to unmarried women'b', according to census data. The birthrate for unmarried women is up 80 percent since 1980.'b'Furthermore, census data show that a majority of high school dropouts having babies are unmarried; only 9 percent of college graduates are. Two-thirds of black women giving birth are unmarried; just over a quarter of white women are.'b'Of course, what matters isn\xe2\x80\x99t whether the parents have a marriage certificate but whether they are partners who are both committed to raising children they want and love. An Australian study 'b'found gay parenting had better outcomes'b' on average, apparently because gay couples don\xe2\x80\x99t have kids by accident.'b'Conservatives blame war-on-poverty welfare programs for undermining marriage. Academic studies indicate that this effect, while real, is small. The percentage of births to single mothers has been rising steadily in the United States (and other countries) since the 1940s.'b'Republicans tried \xe2\x80\x9cmarriage promotion\xe2\x80\x9d initiatives during the administration of George W. Bush, and these are worth testing, but, so far, 'b'they have failed the litmus test'b'. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t work. However, there are several steps that we could take:'b'\xe2\x96\xa0 First is to expand family planning so that teenagers and young adults don\xe2\x80\x99t have babies they don\xe2\x80\x99t want and are ill-prepared to care for. Four out of five teenage pregnancies are unintended, 'b'according to the Guttmacher Institute'b'. It\xe2\x80\x99s promising that a randomized trial found that the Carrera pregnancy prevention curriculum in low-income schools reduced teen births by half. Family-planning initiatives save taxpayer money now spent on health care and the safety net, yet, after inflation, 'b'America\xe2\x80\x99s investment in Title X family planning has fallen'b' some 70 percent since 1980. That\xe2\x80\x99s crazy.'b'\xe2\x96\xa0 Second is to end America\xe2\x80\x99s disastrous experiment in mass incarceration. We quintupled incarceration rates since the 1970s, 'b'according to the Pew Center on the States'b', and, thus condemned millions of men \xe2\x80\x94 often men of color or with low incomes \xe2\x80\x94 to life at the margins and made them much less attractive as husbands. If the family has broken down, we helped break it.'b'\xe2\x96\xa0 Third is to back outreach efforts and job programs that give young people a lift and a stake in the future. Programs like 'b'Nurse-Family Partnership'b' that work with low-income mothers have a proven track record of keeping families together. Likewise, 'b'an evaluation'b' found that of young mothers in an Illinois outreach effort called Options for Youth, 97 percent delayed a subsequent pregnancy.'b'Talk about personal responsibility! It\xe2\x80\x99s irresponsible on our part to fail to take these steps.'b'So, readers, thanks for raising this issue. And let\xe2\x80\x99s address it not with platitudes but with proven policies that don\xe2\x80\x99t just hail the family but also strengthen it.'b'The standoff in Kiev, Ukraine, is now two months old, and it has 'b'claimed its first fatalities'b': two men who died of bullet wounds and a third who fell to his death. With tensions at a dangerous level, and Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s citizens inflamed by both economic policy and new laws against public assembly, President Viktor Yanukovich met with the three most prominent opposition leaders: the popular boxer Vitali Klitschko, the former economics minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, and the far-right nationalist Oleg Tyagnibok.'b'The meeting was a positive development, but it was difficult to see what agreement could end the standoff peacefully and properly. Neither bitter winter, nor Mr. Yanukovich\xe2\x80\x99s deal with Moscow for lower gas prices and a $15 billion loan, nor threatening laws and actions have deterred the protesters on Independence Square, known as the Maidan, and Mr. Yanukovich has shown no inclination to fire any members of his government or to resign.'b'The protesters, on their side, are divided, and the most radical nationalists among them have defied calls by Mr. Klitschko and other more moderate leaders to shun violence. An attempt by the government to clear the Maidan by force remains a strong possibility.'b'The United States and the European Union have made no secret that their sympathies are with the protesters, who poured out into Independence Square after Mr. Yanukovich abruptly announced in November that 'b'he would not sign a pact aligning Ukraine more closely'b' with the European Union. Western diplomats have visited the Maidan, and Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland of the United States even handed out bread on the square in December. Russia, which was strongly opposed to the European pact, has predictably accused the West of egging on the demonstrators.'b'At this stage, however, the United States and Europe need to do more than hand out treats. They must make clear their opposition to violence, as the State Department did 'b'on Wednesday'b' when it urged everyone to calm down, faulted the government for not engaging in serious dialogue and for approving anti-democratic laws, and criticized the extreme-right group Pravy Sektor for aggression.'b'Now that blood has been shed, there is a real risk that the clashes could spread beyond central Kiev, rendering a peaceful solution less viable. But the West must also make abundantly clear to Mr. Yanukovich and his lieutenants that they will pay a price if they try to use the talks simply to gain time, or if they order a bloody crackdown.'b'The State Department\xe2\x80\x99s warning \xe2\x80\x94 plus 'b'an announcement'b' by the American Embassy in Kiev that it was revoking the visas of several unnamed officials responsible for actions taken against protesters in November and December \xe2\x80\x94 was a good start. It also must be prepared to follow through on its promise to consider \xe2\x80\x9cadditional steps in response to the use of violence by any actors.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A 'b'superb report released Wednesday by the Presidential Commission on Election Administration'b' can be summarized in one quick sentence: There are many ways to make voting easier in America. There shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the slightest whiff of controversy or partisanship about that concept, or the important suggestions made in the report. But, of course, there is, and that makes the commission\xe2\x80\x99s persuasive logic and research all the more valuable.'b'President Obama appointed the commission last year 'b'to address the problem of long lines at the polls in 2012'b'. At a time when states were deliberately keeping people from voting with draconian ID requirements, that seemed a narrow goal, but members of the commission did far better than expected in showing the many ways that the nation\xe2\x80\x99s patchwork of state and local election laws has contributed to low turnouts.'b'Led by two election-law experts from opposing parties \xe2\x80\x94 Robert Bauer, a Democrat, and Benjamin Ginsberg, a Republican \xe2\x80\x94 the commission didn\xe2\x80\x99t get into politicized voter ID issues, though it did note that fraud is rare. It agreed, however, on a set of a principles that ought to be considered fundamental: No one should have to wait more than 30 minutes to vote. Ballots should be simple; registration efficient. Polling places should be well-organized and workers properly trained.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s an ideal experienced by few voters, who often stand in long lines caused by broken machines, confusing ballots, and useless poll workers. To fix the problems, the report makes several recommendations:'b''b'EARLY VOTING 'b'The report said early voting is one of the best ways to involve more people in the political process, allowing them to cast a ballot at their convenience and reducing Election Day congestion. Only 32 states allow some form of in-person early voting, and many Republican lawmakers have tried to cut back on it in the belief that it favors Democrats. The commission said every state should adopt the idea in some form, citing a bipartisan consensus of election administrators.'b''b'ONLINE REGISTRATION'b' The report says every state should move to online registration, which reduces the chances of errors, makes registration easy, and is far less expensive than paper systems. Registration has gone up significantly in states that have adopted these systems.'b''b'BETTER TECHNOLOGY 'b'The electronic and optical machines purchased with federal funds after the 2000 balloting disaster are wearing out, and there is no new money to replace them. The commission said the federal government needs to set clear national standards for new machines and certify the ones that work, replacing the federal Election Assistance Commission, which currently has no members thanks to Republican-led skirmishing in Congress. One suggestion made by the report is that voters be allowed to print out a ballot at home and fill it in before bringing it to the polling place for scanning.'b''b'POLL WORKERS 'b'States and cities should bring in more students and private-sector workers, and use fewer retirees. Colleges and employers should be encouraged to let students and workers volunteer. States should require far more training than the 2 to 4 hours that the average poll worker currently receives.'b'The most important idea in the report, endorsed by members of both parties on the panel, is that these are national problems requiring a national solution. It is no longer tenable for voting to be difficult in one state but easy next door. Republicans may continue to fight to keep large groups of minorities, low-income people and students from participating in the democratic process, but after the commission\xe2\x80\x99s report, there can no longer be any doubt that there are no legitimate reasons for their resistance.'b'Leave it to New York\xe2\x80\x99s top two political alpha males: Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio are locked in 'b'a contest over something they both agree on'b'. Mr. de Blasio 'b'wants to offer'b' free, full-day prekindergarten to every 4-year-old in New York City and pay for it by raising taxes on wealthy residents. Mr. Cuomo 'b'is promising'b' to pay for full-day prekindergarten across the entire state, without any tax increase.'b'They are both right in purely pedagogical terms: expanding education for toddlers could make a real difference for thousands of New York\xe2\x80\x99s disadvantaged children, no matter how it\xe2\x80\x99s paid for. The question is whether they can come up with a way to turn this worthy goal into reality.'b'Mr. Cuomo told The Times on Wednesday that he would be willing to write what amounts to a blank check to Mr. de Blasio and other mayors in the state who wish to improve and expand their preschool programs. \xe2\x80\x9cAs fast as he can come up to speed, we will fund it,\xe2\x80\x9d the governor said.'b'Since prekindergarten was a major plank in Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s campaign platform last year, the governor\xe2\x80\x99s offer could be a big victory for him, even though it would not be financed in the way he had envisaged. He can, and undoubtedly will, continue to press for the tax increase. In the meantime, the smart thing is to accept the offer and declare political victory. Then he and his experts should quickly devise a prekindergarten program, one that could serve as a model for the state and the rest of the nation.'b'To make all this work, the governor must be generous. His promise of $1.5 billion over five years for universal, statewide preschool \xe2\x80\x94 $100 million in the first year, $200 million the next and then $400 million for the next three \xe2\x80\x94 is not enough. Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s price tag for the city alone is closer to $340 million a year. The mayor has also said that statewide financing could make the city vulnerable to year-to-year spending cuts, which is why he wants a dedicated revenue stream from the tax increase on residents making $500,000 a year or more.'b'Questions remain, too, about the strength of the governor\xe2\x80\x99s commitment. Mr. Cuomo says he has long supported universal preschool, but this did not become a full-blown priority until after the de Blasio election. He told The Times that he now considers it \xe2\x80\x9cthe greatest single educational reform that we can make.\xe2\x80\x9d If he means it, he can also dramatically improve prekindergartens that now serve about 100,000 children around the state.'b'In addition, his administration will have to develop and require the highest educational standards so that preschool programs provide more than babysitting or day care. He must also help find the space and the talented teachers to make these programs really work.'b'These costs are one reason Mr. de Blasio wants what he calls his \xe2\x80\x9csmall soy latte tax\xe2\x80\x9d on the rich. But that tax has little chance of making it through the Legislature this election year, while the governor\xe2\x80\x99s new $135 billion budget would actually cut property, business and estate taxes in ways that would help more prosperous New Yorkers. How the governor can cut taxes by $2 billion and provide adequate services \xe2\x80\x94 including a new preschool program \xe2\x80\x94 is a mystery.'b'Mr. de Blasio is scheduled to testify at legislative budget hearings on Monday in Albany. He can use the occasion to defend his proposed tax increase. What he must also do is hold the governor to his promise to financing preschools, and to find enough money to do it right.'b'LONDON \xe2\x80\x94  \xe2\x80\x9cShakespeare,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote the American philosopher Allan Bloom, \xe2\x80\x9cwas an eminently political author.\xe2\x80\x9d On this matter, at least, the great controversialist was correct: As Mr. Bloom wrote 50 years ago in \xe2\x80\x9cShakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s Politics,\xe2\x80\x9d there was a time when \xe2\x80\x9cthe political man seemed to be the most interesting theme of poetry.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A new \xe2\x80\x9cKing Lear,\xe2\x80\x9d which opened at London\xe2\x80\x99s National Theater this month, restores this forgotten sense of priority. Already \xe2\x80\x94 deservedly \xe2\x80\x94 the hottest ticket in town, the director Sam Mendes\xe2\x80\x99s production presents the downfall of the aging monarch as much more than a study in human implosion, familial collapse and lyrical introspection. This \xe2\x80\x9cLear\xe2\x80\x9d deserves a Broadway transfer, and as wide a digital audience as the National Theater can muster.'b'Simon Russell Beale, shrunken, shriveled and broken, shows as convincingly as any actor I have ever seen what it is to lose everything (mind, children, kingdom). Yet his astonishing performance as Lear owes as much to an understanding of political dynamics as it does to the pathos of dementia. When we first meet him, he is a robust, impatient soldier-king, surrounded by an entourage of muscle. He divides his kingdom while seated \xe2\x80\x94 his back to the audience, oozing disdain through his very posture.'b'What is striking is the contemporary resonance of this production, the way in which it nags at the political subconscious and stirs our present anxieties. This is not the leaden \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical theater\xe2\x80\x9d of didacticism and finger-wagging. Rather, it uses the text of the early 17th century to illuminate the night terrors of the 21st, speaking directly to the pathologies of our time.'b'Mr. Mendes is right to claim that \xe2\x80\x9cit feels like a national play.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cKing Lear\xe2\x80\x9d was written in the infancy of what became the United Kingdom: Performed at Whitehall, London, in 1606 for King James I, who was also James VI of Scotland, it explores the fears of fragmentation and civil war that marked the declining years of the childless Queen Elizabeth I.'b'Now it returns to the stage only eight months before a referendum on Scotland\xe2\x80\x99s future. The polls suggest that independence will be rejected by the Scots on Sept. 18, but referendums are notoriously unpredictable.'b'Whatever the outcome, the fact that the question is being asked at all is unsettling for a union of nations such as the United Kingdom. Lear divides his kingdom to keep the peace; the outcome is precisely the opposite.'b'At a less literal level, there is an even stronger correspondence between \xe2\x80\x9cLear\xe2\x80\x9d and the spirit of the age. More than any other play in the language, it navigates the terrain between the personal and the political, the threads that connect decisions of state to the vulnerable individual. By stages, Lear is reduced from a mighty ruler to a naked vagrant, no better than a \xe2\x80\x9cpoor, bare, forked animal,\xe2\x80\x9d as he puts it to Poor Tom (the loyal Edgar, son of Gloucester, who is disguised and feigning madness).'b'This symbolic landscape is precisely where political battle is being waged in 2014. While the British economy is recovering, its resurgence has yet to translate into a sense of well-being. The fear of personal indigence remains deep. Austerity, insecurity and the cluster of social problems that Prime Minister David Cameron calls the \xe2\x80\x9cbroken society\xe2\x80\x9d continue to define the times.'b'No politician is more vulnerable than one who is not believed when he claims that things are getting better. Every regime is obsessed by what Lear calls \xe2\x80\x9ccourt news\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cWho loses and who wins, who\xe2\x80\x99s in, who\xe2\x80\x99s out.\xe2\x80\x9d But a coalition such as the Conservative-Liberal Democrat government headed by Mr. Cameron is conspicuously vulnerable to the charge of introspection and detachment.'b'The next general election, scheduled for May 2015, will be won by the party that persuasively connects the economic recovery to voters\xe2\x80\x99 personal circumstances. In one of the play\xe2\x80\x99s great moments of self-discovery, Lear considers the \xe2\x80\x9cpoor naked wretches\xe2\x80\x9d of his realm, helpless before \xe2\x80\x9cthe pelting of this pitiless storm.\xe2\x80\x9d He reproaches himself for his failure to help them when he could: \xe2\x80\x9cO, I have ta\xe2\x80\x99en / Too little care of this.\xe2\x80\x9d He tells \xe2\x80\x9cpomp\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 his own \xe2\x80\x94 to \xe2\x80\x9cExpose thyself to feel what wretches feel.\xe2\x80\x9d Never has the need for political empathy been so exquisitely expressed.'b'Herein lies the timeless demand made of those who govern on behalf of those with no apparent hope. As Conservative leader, Mr. Cameron has intermittently presented himself as the champion of the vulnerable. But his party is still associated in the eyes of the electorate with \xe2\x80\x9cpomp\xe2\x80\x9d and indifference to the \xe2\x80\x9cwretches\xe2\x80\x9d of our own time.'b'The twist is that, just as Lear was hailed for his strong kingship, so, too, the present prime minister is applauded when he is tough on welfare. Even as they reproach his party for its lack of compassion, voters demand crackdowns on benefit \xe2\x80\x9cscroungers\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 such is the great knotted dilemma at the heart of modern governance.'b'As Shakespeare knew, the practice of politics is governed not by straightforward rules but by a clutch of paradoxes. His plays are not manuals but mirrors held up to humanity. This is why Nelson Mandela and his fellow prisoners read and reread \xe2\x80\x9cJulius Caesar\xe2\x80\x9d on Robben Island, and why Abraham Lincoln turned to \xe2\x80\x9cMacbeth\xe2\x80\x9d as the truest portrait of tyranny and warning against it.'b'Every generation has its defining \xe2\x80\x9cKing Lear,\xe2\x80\x9d and I am sure this is ours. Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s greatest play is an invitation to stare into the abyss and contemplate the fragility of power and decency. As Edgar says to his father, Gloucester, \xe2\x80\x9chow fearful / And dizzy \xe2\x80\x99tis to cast one\xe2\x80\x99s eyes so low.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed, but how much worse is the politics of delusion.'b''b'\n'b'Matthew d\xe2\x80\x99Ancona 'b' is a political columnist for The Sunday Telegraph and The Evening Standard. 'b''b'BERLIN \xe2\x80\x94 From the bland figure of Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande, who rose to the pinnacle as Monsieur Normal, have cascaded of late some startling revelations, as if the French president had abruptly decided he was boring even himself.'b'First there was his love affair with the actress Julie Gayet. No real surprise there, but the images published by the tabloid Closer did seem to reduce the lofty presidency \xe2\x80\x94 De Gaulle\xe2\x80\x99s seat of French glory \xe2\x80\x94 to the level of a motorcycle courier service. A suitable caption for the helmeted gentleman en route to a tryst might have been: \xe2\x80\x9cI am more normal than you think.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When I asked Christine Ockrent, an acute observer of France, what she thought of the \xe2\x80\x9caffaire,\xe2\x80\x9d her immediate response was: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a man. It\xe2\x80\x99s normal.\xe2\x80\x9d It would not damage Hollande for now, his popularity being so low anyway.'b'In matters of the heart the French shrug holds sway. This is healthy. \xe2\x80\x9cBof, c\xe2\x80\x99est normal,\xe2\x80\x9d a ubiquitous phrase, is the shrugging expression of a fierce realism about life in general and sex in particular. As Saul Bellow observes in his novel Ravelstein, \xe2\x80\x9cThe French were genuinely educated \xe2\x80\x94 or had been so once. They had taken a bad beating in this century. However, they had a real feeling for beautiful objects still, for leisure, for reading and conversation; they didn\xe2\x80\x99t despise creaturely needs \xe2\x80\x94 the human basics.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The French are indeed at home with creaturely needs. They do not squirm. They do not preach. It is safe enough to predict that Val\xc3\xa9rie Trierweiler, the first lady spurned, will not be at the White House with Hollande next month. She has been badly treated. Beyond that it is likely that the only consequence of Monsieur Normal\xe2\x80\x99s late-night forays will be the further demystification of the Fifth Republic\xe2\x80\x99s highest office, a process underway since Fran\xc3\xa7ois Mitterrand\xe2\x80\x99s death in 1996.'b'Bof, c\xe2\x80\x99est normal.'b'The second revelation about Hollande may be of greater consequence. It came at a recent press conference but, because of the affair, was scarcely noted. In the midst of a performance that was a tour de force he let drop a confession that was brave. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I a Social Democrat?\xe2\x80\x9d Hollande said. \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This may not seem a radical statement in the second decade of the 21st century, but it still is in France. Hollande, adhering to French socialist principle, had never previously ventured this far. To do so was to concede that his goal is to soften the harsh edges of capitalism rather than overturn it; to pursue social cohesion through compromise between capital and labor rather than class struggle; to suggest (heresy of heresies) that wealth must first be accumulated before it can be distributed; and to abandon the heady glory of the Popular Front for staid old German social democracy.'b'But, you may say, all this happened long ago \xe2\x80\x94 and you would be right. That, however, is not the point. The lexicon of political ideology is more important in France than anywhere. Hollande crossed a doctrinal line. This, in Paris, constitutes an event.'b'Hollande went further, proposing big business tax and budget cuts, even suggesting he was a supply-sider. A name doing the rounds in Paris is suddenly that of the last Social Democrat to lead Germany, Gerhard Schr\xc3\xb6der. During his time in office, a decade ago, reforms were passed that cut social benefits and changed the rules for receiving them in ways that meant it no longer made economic sense to remain unemployed rather than take a low-paying job. The German left partially dismantled the welfare state built by the German left. Unemployment fell, the economy boomed. Germany today is Germany and France is France.'b'This brings us to another troubled couple that once held hands, did big things and had big dreams \xe2\x80\x94 only to fall into a sulk. That would be France and Germany.'b'Because the war generation is gone, because the balance in the relationship was lost to German dominance, and because ever-closer union in Europe has withered as a political idea, the nations have been looking past each other. But there are stirrings. The return of the Social Democrats in a German grand coalition and Hollande\xe2\x80\x99s ideological pivot has led to talk of what Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, recently called \xe2\x80\x9ca new impulse to Franco-German cooperation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'With Britain consumed by anti-European rumblings, nothing is more important for the future of Europe than a reinvigorated French-German couple focused on political and budgetary integration, reignited growth, renewed democratic legitimacy and a revived European idea. Social democracy may be old but, as Germany shows, it is needed.'b'A German car rental company, Sixt, has been mocking Hollande with an ad that says: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. President, next time avoid the scooter. Sixt rents cars with tinted windows.\xe2\x80\x9d Bof. Who cares? Step into the light, Monsieur le Pr\xc3\xa9sident, and lead an old couple back.'b'PARIS \xe2\x80\x94 Sixteen years ago, the leader of the far-right National Front, Jean-Marie Le Pen, deemed the Holocaust a \xe2\x80\x9cdetail in the history of the Second World War.\xe2\x80\x9d Today, a popular comic known as Dieudonn\xc3\xa9 M\xe2\x80\x99Bala M\xe2\x80\x99Bala (his stage name is simply Dieudonn\xc3\xa9) claims \xe2\x80\x9cnot to know, between the Jews and Germans,\xe2\x80\x9d who\xe2\x80\x99s telling the truth \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have my own little ideas on the subject.\xe2\x80\x9d We know what those ideas are: Dieudonn\xc3\xa9 invited onstage at one of his shows Robert Faurisson, a \xe2\x80\x9ctheorist\xe2\x80\x9d of Holocaust denial, who argues that the extermination of the European Jews is a Jewish invention.'b'Dieudonn\xc3\xa9, who revels in stoking controversy while hiding behind ambiguity, recently came up with a rallying gesture for his supporters. He calls it the \xe2\x80\x9cquenelle\xe2\x80\x9d (literally, a dumpling, a French version of gefilte fish). The move consists of the right arm pointed straight down, which the left hand keeps from lifting \xe2\x80\x94 very like the repressed Nazi salute of Peter Sellers in \xe2\x80\x9cDr. Strangelove.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. M\xe2\x80\x99Bala M\xe2\x80\x99Bala claims this is not anti-Semitic but \xe2\x80\x9cantisystem,\xe2\x80\x9d a defiance of authority, but his true disciples have caught on, pulling quenelles in front of synagogues.'b'On grounds that \xe2\x80\x9cinciting racial hatred\xe2\x80\x9d is illegal in 'b'France'b', the interior minister, Manuel Valls, decided to ban the comic\xe2\x80\x99s shows, creating a furor. Canceling Mr. M\xe2\x80\x99Bala M\xe2\x80\x99Bala\xe2\x80\x99s tour not only gave him free publicity, but it has also risked making him a victim of censorship.'b'At first glance, the Dieudonn\xc3\xa9 affair seems a new form of anti-Jewish expression. Of course, it is. But it would be wrong to say that\xe2\x80\x99s all that it is.'b'French society has suffered from an economic and social crisis for three decades. Whichever party has been in power, the unemployment rate has hardly dipped below 8 percent since the 1980s; more than one in four young people are out of work.'b'I recently returned to France, after six years working in the United States, to discover some unpleasant surprises. In \xe2\x80\x9cla France profonde,\xe2\x80\x9d a diffuse populism is stirring. Reminiscent of America\xe2\x80\x99s Tea Party, this movement combines a nostalgic mind-set that everything \xe2\x80\x9cwas better before\xe2\x80\x9d with a radical aversion to taxes and a hostility toward the detested European bureaucracy.'b'According to a recent study, only 8 percent of French people espouse racial inequality, yet there is a palpable conviction that everything bad comes from outside: Brussels, globalization, immigration. Whatever the law says, the \xe2\x80\x9cfreedom\xe2\x80\x9d to express racist, xenophobic and anti-immigrant views has reached new levels. Mr. Le Pen used to claim to \xe2\x80\x9csay out loud what the people think in private.\xe2\x80\x9d Lately, many have begun thinking out loud.'b'The Dieudonn\xc3\xa9 affair is symptomatic of an insidious slide toward intolerance, but anti-Semitism is the least of it; racism and xenophobia manifest themselves more often as anti-Arab, anti-Muslim or anti-black. Last year, in Carpentras, a town notorious in 1990 for the desecration of Jewish graves there, swastikas were spray-painted on the headstones of French Muslim soldiers. Late in 2013, the minister of justice, Christiane Taubira, a black woman originally from French Guiana, was called a \xe2\x80\x9cmonkey\xe2\x80\x9d by a National Front candidate in municipal elections; the same slur was repeated by a representative of the conservative Union for a Popular Movement, the mainstream opposition party.'b'Urban neighborhoods where poor African, Asian or Caribbean populations live have become increasingly ghettoized. In French political parlance, this is called a \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to integrate,\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9crise in communitarianism.\xe2\x80\x9d France has become a hotbed of tensions that has seen a steep rise in \xe2\x80\x9cethnicist\xe2\x80\x9d views of society. It is not just Mr. M\xe2\x80\x99Bala M\xe2\x80\x99Bala who has flourished in this atmosphere; other comedians trot out the most hackneyed racial clich\xc3\xa9s.'b'The phenomenon cuts across social class. Take Alain Finkielkraut, a professor of philosophy at the elite \xc3\x89cole Polytechnique: He recently published \xe2\x80\x9cL\xe2\x80\x99identit\xc3\xa9 malheureuse,\xe2\x80\x9d a book bemoaning the dilution of an eternal France about to be defiled by swarthy barbarians threatening to plunge \xe2\x80\x9cEuropean civilization\xe2\x80\x9d into a multicultural bouillabaisse. Among the objects of his disgust: \xe2\x80\x9cHalal butcher shops and fast food.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Finkielkraut\xe2\x80\x99s sentiments echo those of Renaud Camus, a writer (not related to Albert Camus) who has denounced the \xe2\x80\x9cgreat replacement\xe2\x80\x9d of populations, which imposes on \xe2\x80\x9cthe true rooted French\xe2\x80\x9d those who are not. Mr. Camus makes no secret of his admiration for Marine Le Pen, daughter of Jean-Marie and current leader of the National Front. Such ideas have even found resonance in the media, thanks to commentators like the political journalist \xc3\x89ric Zemmour, who laments the fate of the \xe2\x80\x9cwhite proletariat,\xe2\x80\x9d helpless before the \xe2\x80\x9costentatious virility of their black and Arab competitors seducing numerous young white women.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The worst came last fall with a campaign against France\xe2\x80\x99s Roma people. The previous president, Nicolas Sarkozy, had already singled out this vulnerable population of 20,000 as a dangerous nuisance \xe2\x80\x94 despite the fact that the Roma constitute just 0.03 percent of the population. The interior minister, Mr. Valls, has now called for their expulsion. Well might we wonder about the integrity of a politician who defends Jews from Dieudonn\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s quenelle while deporting Gypsies.'b'The son of a white mother and a black father, Mr. M\xe2\x80\x99Bala M\xe2\x80\x99Bala will continue to surf a wave created by the \xe2\x80\x9ccompetition of victims\xe2\x80\x9d in a country that is historically \xe2\x80\x9cguilty\xe2\x80\x9d twice over: toward the Jews, for its participation in the collaborationist Vichy regime, and toward its black and Arab citizens, for its colonial past. By calling Jews \xe2\x80\x9cslave traders,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. M\xe2\x80\x99Bala M\xe2\x80\x99Bala plays a game of provoking the authorities\xe2\x80\x99 squeamishness about anti-Semitism, even as other expressions of racism get a pass. When Dieudonn\xc3\xa9 described Ms. Taubira as a \xe2\x80\x9ccheetah,\xe2\x80\x9d there was scarcely a stir.'b'Unless things change, this deplorable clown has a bright future.'b''b' 'b'Sylvain Cypel,'b' a former correspondent for Le Monde, is the author of \xe2\x80\x9cWalled: Israeli Society at an Impasse.\xe2\x80\x9d This essay was translated by Edward Gauvin from the French. 'b''b'CALGARY, Alberta \xe2\x80\x94  New coils of razor wire top the fence around Melilla, one of two Spanish territories on North Africa\xe2\x80\x99s Mediterranean coast. Along with Ceuta, the enclaves share the European Union\xe2\x80\x99s only land borders with Africa and are targets for would-be migrants desperate to reach Europe. Spain has long maintained high-tech fencing systems around the enclaves in an attempt to keep the migrants out, but they had removed barbed wire from the top of Melilla\xe2\x80\x99s fence in 2007 after it inflicted serious injuries on those who dared to climb over.'b'Last November, though, in response to an increase of migrant assaults on the fence, the Spanish authorities restored the wire. The move angered human rights activists and religious leaders across Europe. In a letter to the Spanish interior minister, Bishop Santiago Agrelo Martinez wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cBarbed wire with blades on fences in Ceuta and Melilla is an attack on the physical integrity of immigrants: those blades cut, injure, [and] maim ... \xe2\x80\x9d The bishop appreciated the Spanish government\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to secure the nation\xe2\x80\x99s borders, but he laid bare the fact that the \xe2\x80\x9cblades cause only pain and death.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The reinforcement of the fence around Melilla echoes the current building boom of border walls. According to Reece Jones, a University of Hawaii geographer, nearly 30 new border barriers have risen worldwide since 1998. There are new fences on America\xe2\x80\x99s border with Mexico and along Greece\xe2\x80\x99s border with Turkey. India erected barriers on its frontiers with both Pakistan and Bangladesh. Israel built a wall around Palestine and recently completed a fence along its Egyptian border.'b'Through technology, barriers to trade, travel and communication keep falling, and yet our world has never been more physically divided by the geometries of bricks, barbed wire and steel.'b'The political and economic ramifications of the walls are oft-discussed and well understood. So, too, is the psychological trauma suffered by those living in the shadow of the walls. In 1973,  an East German psychiatrist even coined a term for the disorder: Mauerkrankheit, or Wall Disease.'b'But Bishop Santiago\xe2\x80\x99s objections to Melilla\xe2\x80\x99s freshened barbed wire reveals something even more horribly intimate: In an attempt to control our borders, we\xe2\x80\x99ve designed systems to physically hurt those who defy them. The walls act upon the flesh.'b'In January 2011, the fencing along the India-Bangladesh border acted upon the flesh of Felani Khatun, 15. Felani\xe2\x80\x99s father, Nurul Islam, had arranged for her to be married to her Bangladeshi cousin. On the morning of her wedding, Nurul paid a pair of cattle smugglers to help him and Felani scale the fence into Bangladesh so they could walk to the village where the groom was waiting. Felani climbed the fence with a bamboo ladder the smugglers provided, but when the barbed wire snagged her blue skirt she panicked and started to scream. The noise alerted Indian border soldiers, who fired their rifles in the direction of the fence.'b'A single bullet pierced Felani\xe2\x80\x99s chest and she sagged, mortally wounded, on the wire. She begged for water for a half-hour before finally bleeding to death. Felani hung upside down, a memento mori fixed into place by the barbs, until morning sun burned away the fog and the border soldiers pulled her down. They tied her hands and feet to a bamboo pole and carried her away like a butchered animal.'b'Barbed wire also spins cruel calligraphy along the United States-Mexico frontier, but crossers have more to fear than just the violence of the barbs. Doctors at the University of Arizona Medical Center treat about 40 migrants each year for broken bones and spinal injuries suffered from falls off the border walls.'b'There are bullet wounds, too. According to a 2013 investigation by The Arizona Republic newspaper, American border patrol agents have killed 42 people since 2005. Some, like the teenager Jos\xc3\xa9 Antonio Elena Rodr\xc3\xadguez, were killed on the south side of the border by American agents shooting through the wall into Mexico.'b'Female migrants risk an even more intimate violence. Border activists speak about \xe2\x80\x9crape trees\xe2\x80\x9d in the borderlands of Arizona and California where human smugglers, many connected with Mexican drug cartels, pause their journey to rape their female charges. When they finish, the rapists hang their victims\xe2\x80\x99 bras and panties on the branches as a morbid accounting of their conquests.'b'Those granted passage through the walls must offer up their flesh in some way or another, too. Palestinian laborers press their bodies through steel chutes and turnstiles each morning to reach jobs in Israel. Elsewhere in the West Bank, farmers lift their shirts in front of young Israeli soldiers before receiving permission to work their own fields \xe2\x80\x94 their exposed midriffs proof they are not wired to explode.'b'Even when the walls don\xe2\x80\x99t cause the body pain, they demand, at least, some brief physical humiliation.'b'In 1876, a barbed wire salesman, John Gates, enclosed a few head of ferocious bulls within a barbed wire pen in San Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s central plaza. Reviel Netz writes about the scene in his book \xe2\x80\x9cBarbed Wire: An Ecology of Modernity.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Gates deliberately provoked the longhorns who then charged the fence, only to be repulsed by the barbs that tore into their flesh. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir wounds exacerbate their rage,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Netz writes. The bulls continued to throw themselves against the wire until their agony led to an instinctive withdrawal and resignation. Finally, they stopped trying to breach the fence.'b'The bloody spectacle proved that through the application of pain, even the fiercest beast can learn to respect a border. \xe2\x80\x9cOur skins,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Netz writes, \xe2\x80\x9cjust a little beneath the surface, are endowed with special nerves activated by pressure rising above rather low thresholds. You can use those nerves against us. By cutting through the boundary of our skins, you can act to protect the boundaries of your property, your prison, your border.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is also what our walls do. They exploit our bodies\xe2\x80\x99 low threshold for pain. Beneath the high-minded ideals of security and sovereignty lies the grim truth that we\xe2\x80\x99ve designed the walls to hurt people. We opt to control movement across sensitive geography by inflicting agony upon the flesh. We need to confront the inhumanity of how we choose to defend our lines and, like Bishop Santiago, see the barbarism in the barbed wire we uncoil.'b''b'\n'b'Marcello Di Cintio 'b' is the author, most recently, of \xe2\x80\x9cWalls: Travels Along the Barricades.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Singapore\xe2\x80\x99s tourism receipts doubled to $18 billion within two years of opening the Marina Bay Sands and Sentosa casino resorts in 2010, and visitor arrivals jumped nearly 50 percent. Lured by Singapore\xe2\x80\x99s success, the Taiwan Legislature could soon allow the opening of casinos. And Japan, with an official goal of tripling the number of foreign tourists in 20 years, is considering building casinos. Analysts believe that gambling in Japan could generate gross revenue of $15 billion annually.'b'But these countries should also pay attention to another aspect of Singapore\xe2\x80\x99s experience apart from revenue. Singapore has gone to considerable lengths to shield some of its most vulnerable people from the negative social consequences of gambling. Promoters naturally emphasize the positives of gambling, mainly how casinos attract foreigners and their money. But they say little about the negatives: addiction, broken families and criminal activities like loan-sharking, all of which fall heavily on local communities and on low-income groups. To dampen these effects, Singapore levies an $80 casino entrance fee on local residents, while foreigners enter free. After a 2011 survey showed an increasing proportion of low-income gamblers playing with ever-larger sums, the state decided to prohibit entry by the unemployed, people on welfare and people who have filed for bankruptcy protection.'b'As South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s experience shows, local residents generate lots of money. Of the country\xe2\x80\x99s 17 licensed casinos, only one, Kangwon Land Resort, in a remote mountain area more than 100 miles from Seoul, is open to locals. But its revenue, about $1 billion annually, exceeds that of the other 16 foreigners-only casinos combined.'b'Casino investments under consideration in Taiwan and Japan could total several billion dollars. The promoters, of course, advertise gambling as a revenue-producing leisure activity. But if these investments go forward, both countries need to consider the downside and, at the very least, seek ways to curb addictive and self-destructive behavior.'b''b' 'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The \xe2\x80\x98How Are You?\xe2\x80\x99 Culture Clash'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Jan. 20):'b'Alina Simone illustrates a universal of cross-cultural communication: the tendency to take literally expressions that members of another culture use idiomatically.

This week, a boast by a man with number 25 on his chest turned all eyes to Seattle. But it should have been the claim by the city\xe2\x80\x99s most famous billionaire that got more attention.'b'The first gasconade was uttered by Richard Sherman, the Seattle Seahawks all-pro cornerback, who let his adrenaline speak for him after making a play that sent my hometown boys to the Super Bowl. Sherman is not just the best corner in the game \xe2\x80\x94 as he let the world know \xe2\x80\x94 but a thoughtful, generous, bright guy from Stanford by way of Compton\xe2\x80\x99s Dominguez High, where he ranked second in his class.'b'His postgame rant, one-part early Muhammad Ali and one-part pro-wrestling swagger, brought out a torrent of overt racism on the Internet \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cporch monkey\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthug\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgangster\xe2\x80\x9d were the printable epithets.

His boast, more of a prediction, was that \xe2\x80\x9cby 2035, there will be almost no poor countries left in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBy almost any measure, the world is better off than it has ever been,\xe2\x80\x9d Gates wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople are living longer, healthier lives. Many nations that were aid recipients are now self-sufficient.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Like Sherman, Gates backed up his claim. And in his own monotonic, muss-haired way, the billionaire threw out a provocation on the eve of the Super Bowl of his class \xe2\x80\x94 the annual scrum of Big Picture Thinkers at Davos, Switzerland. His assertion arrived on the heels of an Oxfam report that just 85 billionaires controlled as much wealth as the world\xe2\x80\x99s poorest 3.5 billion people.'b'The idea that half the world\xe2\x80\x99s population is worth only as much as a gathering in a large Swiss chalet was designed to shock. But it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be misinterpreted. Oxfam suggested closing tax loopholes and raising wages as solutions. These are fine ideas, but they aren\xe2\x80\x99t nearly as effective as the remedies outlined by Gates.'b'The Microsoft billionaire\xe2\x80\x99s prescriptions \xe2\x80\x94 titled \xe2\x80\x9cThree myths that block progress for the poor\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 were contained in 'b'the latest newsletter'b' of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, started 14 years ago with the intent of giving away the family fortune.'b'First, he debunks the notion that poor countries are doomed to stay poor. In the year that Gates was born, 1955, most countries in the world were poor. Since then, more than one billion people have risen out of extreme poverty. As he points out, that still leaves at least another billion at the very bottom. But progress has been so swift, he says, that within 21 years, there will be no poor nations left on earth except those held back by war, politics or geography (a big bunch of asterisks, to be sure).'b'Second, he takes on the hardened myth that foreign aid is a big waste. The United States spends less than 1 percent of its budget helping other countries. For that, we get a big bang for the buck. Since 2000, for example, a global effort by governments and philanthropies to eliminate malaria has saved 3.3 million lives.'b'The third point knocks down an old excuse used by the callous: that saving lives leads to overpopulation. The Malthusian myth is just that. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is that a laissez-faire approach to development \xe2\x80\x94 letting children die now so they won\xe2\x80\x99t starve later \xe2\x80\x94 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually work,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Melinda Gates. As people become better off and better educated, they have fewer children, and population stabilizes.'b"Money spent on relatively small, specific things can make the difference between life and death. The leading causes of mortality for children under 3, by far, are preventable diseases. Yes, preventable \xe2\x80\x94 with vaccines, early diagnoses, water purification. That\xe2\x80\x99s one reason the Gates Foundation has targeted disparities in health care. \xe2\x80\x9cA child\xe2\x80\x99s fate,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill Gates writes, \xe2\x80\x9cshould not be left to what Warren Buffett calls \xe2\x80\x98the ovarian lottery.'\xe2\x80\x9d"b'All of this is backed by the experience of Gates and like-minded rich people. Along with Mark Zuckerberg, T. Boone Pickens, Buffett and others, these billionaires have taken the Giving Pledge: a commitment to dedicate a majority of their wealth to philanthropy. (Conspicuously missing: the Koch Brothers, Charles and David, listed as the fourth wealthiest Americans by Forbes.) You can see the full list of giving pledgers 'b'here'b'.'b'If the 85 richest people on the planet took the pledge, it would hasten the audacious prediction of Bill Gates, whose life story is an example of how quickly things can change. Less than 20 years ago, Gates was called a high-tech robber baron, a predator, heartless. Few predicted that thousands of people would be alive today because Gates put his money to work in the right places.'b'Richard Sherman regularly goes back to Dominguez High with a message for kids trying to survive in a very tough neighborhood. Yes, football made him a star. But education got him out of Compton. His life story, like the prediction that Gates made this week, sends the same message: nothing is intractable.'b'OBSERVERS of our polarized democracy often blame party primaries for producing some of our most extreme politicians. It\xe2\x80\x99s well known that the most vociferous and partisan activists have a disproportionate influence in primaries.'b'Less well known is this: 44 states have \xe2\x80\x9csore loser\xe2\x80\x9d laws of one form or another. These laws effectively block a candidate who fails to win a party primary from appearing on the general election ballot, as either an independent or as the nominee of another party.'b'These laws deprive voters of a full array of choices. They are arguably even more insidious than partisan redistricting, which affects House races but not Senate ones.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s an example. In the 2012 Republican Senate primary in Texas, David Dewhurst, the relatively moderate lieutenant governor, won 46 percent of the vote, while the Tea Party favorite Ted Cruz, running an aggressively conservative campaign, won only 33 percent. In the primary runoff, Mr. Cruz beat Mr. Dewhurst \xe2\x80\x94 but with just 630,000 Republican votes, in a state of 26 million people.'b'Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the popular Mr. Dewhurst, a proven vote-getter, simply challenge Mr. Cruz in the general election, when all Texans could vote? Under Texas\xe2\x80\x99 sore loser law, once Mr. Dewhurst lost the primary, he was no longer eligible to have his name on the ballot in November. Given that Texas is virtually a one-party state, Mr. Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s relatively small vote total, combined with the sore-loser law, was all he needed to go to Washington and then orchestrate a shutdown of the federal government.'b'And Mr. Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s victory was a model of pure democracy compared to what happened in Utah two years earlier.'b'There, Republicans begin the nominating process with a convention of party activists. In the first round of voting for a Senate nominee, in 2010, the incumbent, Robert Bennett, finished third, about a hundred votes behind a conservative activist, Mike Lee. The top three finishers then went to a second round; again, Mr. Bennett came in third, this time trailing Mr. Lee by 320 votes. Mr. Bennett was eliminated and was not eligible to participate in the subsequent runoff primary, which Mr. Lee won.'b'There were a mere 3,500 people at this convention. Mr. Bennett would almost certainly have won a vote in which all Utah voters had been able to participate: the state\xe2\x80\x99s sore-loser law meant that 320 party activists effectively made a decision on behalf of the three million people of Utah.'b'Of course, sometimes victory by extremists backfires in the general election, particularly in states that are not dominated by one party (as Texas and Utah are). In 2010, Representative Michael N. Castle of Delaware, a respected moderate, 'b'lost'b' a low-turnout Republican primary to Christine O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell, who in turn went down in defeat in the general election over questions about her educational credentials, her ignorance of the Constitution and her fondness for witchcraft.'b'There is a better way. In 2006, liberal Democrats were determined to end the career of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman (their party\xe2\x80\x99s vice-presidential nominee in 2000) over his support for the Iraq war. He lost to Ned Lamont in a primary. But Connecticut is one of three states that have partisan primaries or caucuses, but no sore-loser law (Iowa and New York are the others). Mr. Lieberman was thus able to run \xe2\x80\x94 and win \xe2\x80\x94 in the general election, as an independent.'b'And in California, Louisiana and Washington, the primary election is open to candidates of any party, and the top two finishers advance to the general election, so parties cannot use election law to winnow the field.'b'Advocates of open primaries argue that letting all voters choose among all the candidates, regardless of party, forces candidates to make a broader appeal, resulting in more moderate or centrist candidates. The political scientists Barry C. Burden, Bradley Jones and Michael S. Kang 'b'found'b' that in states with sore-loser laws, congressional candidates were more ideologically distant from one another \xe2\x80\x94 that is, more polarized \xe2\x80\x94 than in states without them.'b'That may well be a sufficient reason for reformers to seek the repeal of sore-loser laws, but in my view, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the most important reason. For one thing, the political \xe2\x80\x9ccenter\xe2\x80\x9d is not always the right place to be (it certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the pursuit of civil rights and women\xe2\x80\x99s rights, or on issues like slavery and child labor). Compassion toward candidates who find their political prospects cut short is also of little interest to me.'b'What matters is the restoration of American democracy: giving voters the fullest range of choices when it comes to selecting their leaders. Under sore-loser laws, the real loser is the voters.'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe outstanding faults of the economic society in which we live are its failure to provide for full employment and its arbitrary and inequitable distribution of wealth and incomes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'John Maynard Keynes wrote that in 1936, but it applies to our own time, too. And, in a better world, our leaders would be doing all they could to address both faults.'b'Unfortunately, the world we actually live in falls far short of that ideal. In fact, we should count ourselves lucky when leaders confront even one of our two great economic failures. If, as has been widely reported, President Obama devotes much of his State of the Union address to inequality, everyone should be cheering him on.'b'They won\xe2\x80\x99t, of course. Instead, he will face two kinds of sniping. The usual suspects on the right will, as always when questions of income distribution comes up, shriek \xe2\x80\x9cClass warfare!\xe2\x80\x9d But there will also be seemingly more sober voices arguing that he has picked the wrong target, that jobs, not inequality, should be at the top of his agenda.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s why they\xe2\x80\x99re wrong.'b'First of all, jobs and inequality are closely linked if not identical issues. There\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good although not ironclad case that 'b'soaring inequality helped set the stage for our economic crisis'b', and that the highly unequal distribution of income since the crisis has perpetuated the slump, especially by making it hard for families in debt to work their way out.'b'Moreover, there\xe2\x80\x99s an even stronger case to be made that high unemployment \xe2\x80\x94 by destroying workers\xe2\x80\x99 bargaining power \xe2\x80\x94 has become 'b'a major source of rising inequality and stagnating incomes'b' even for those lucky enough to have jobs.'b'Beyond that, as a political matter, inequality and macroeconomic policy are already inseparably linked. It has been obvious for a long time that the deficit obsession that has exerted such a destructive effect on policy these past few years isn\xe2\x80\x99t really driven by worries about the federal debt. It is, instead, mainly an effort to use debt fears to scare and bully the nation into slashing social programs \xe2\x80\x94 especially programs that help the poor. For example, 'b'two-thirds of the spending cuts proposed last year by Representative Paul Ryan'b', the chairman of the House Budget Committee, would have come at the expense of lower-income families.'b'The flip side of this attempt to use fiscal scare tactics to worsen inequality is that highlighting concerns about inequality can translate into pushback against job-destroying austerity, too.'b'But the most important reason for Mr. Obama to focus on inequality is political realism. Like it or not, the simple fact is that Americans \xe2\x80\x9cget\xe2\x80\x9d inequality; macroeconomics, not so much.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s an enduring myth among the punditocracy that populism doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sell, that Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t care about the gap between the rich and everyone else. It\xe2\x80\x99s not true. Yes, we\xe2\x80\x99re a nation that admires rather than resents success, but most people are nonetheless disturbed by the extreme disparities of our Second Gilded Age. 'b'A new Pew poll finds'b' an overwhelming majority of Americans \xe2\x80\x94 and 45 percent of Republicans! \xe2\x80\x94 supporting government action to reduce inequality, with a smaller but still substantial majority favoring taxing the rich to aid the poor. And this is true even though 'b'most Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t realize just how unequally wealth really is distributed'b'.'b'By contrast, it\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to communicate even the most basic truths of macroeconomics, like the need to run deficits to support employment in bad times. You can argue that Mr. Obama should have tried harder to get these ideas across; many economists cringed when he began echoing Republican rhetoric about the need for 'b'the federal government to tighten its belt along with America\xe2\x80\x99s families'b'. But, even if he had tried, it\xe2\x80\x99s doubtful that he would have succeeded.'b''b'Consider what happened in 1936'b'. F.D.R. had just won a smashing re-election victory, largely because of the success of his deficit-spending policies. It\xe2\x80\x99s often forgotten now, but his first term was marked by rapid economic recovery and sharply falling unemployment. But the public remained wedded to economic orthodoxy: by a more than 2-to-1 majority, voters surveyed by Gallup just after the election called for a balanced budget. And F.D.R., unfortunately, listened; his attempt to balance the budget soon plunged America back into recession.'b'The point is that of the two great problems facing the U.S. economy, inequality is the one on which Mr. Obama is most likely to connect with voters. And he should seek that connection with a clear conscience: There\xe2\x80\x99s no shame is acknowledging political reality, as long as you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do the right thing.'b'So I hope we\xe2\x80\x99ll hear something about jobs Tuesday night, and some pushback against deficit hysteria. But if we mainly hear about inequality and social justice, that\xe2\x80\x99s O.K.'b'Rules issued in November to stop banks from emulating predatory payday lenders have yielded promising results. The rules, issued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, have led several banks to discontinue \xe2\x80\x9cdeposit advance\xe2\x80\x9d loans that are specifically designed to trap people in debt. But consumers will remain vulnerable to versions of the debt trap until another agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, issues rules of its own to protect consumers of small loans from excessive and unaffordable costs.'b'Payday lenders attract customers by promising small loans that can easily be repaid on the borrower\xe2\x80\x99s next payday \xe2\x80\x94 customarily in two weeks. Unfortunately, most borrowers are unable to repay on the agreed date and end up borrowing again and again, at ruinously high interest rates. Deposit advance loans work the same way, except the bank repays itself from an electronic deposit that comes into the borrowers account.'b'The rules from the F.D.I.C. and the O.C.C. attacked this vicious cycle by requiring the banks to determine if the borrowers could pay their debts, limited them to one loan per monthly statement cycle and said they could not grant a new loan until the previous one was paid off. Several big banks have since 'b'announced'b' that they are getting out of the deposit advance business.'b'But new forms of exploitation will invariably arise unless the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau writes broad affordability rules of its own. These rules, 'b'suggested by'b' The Pew Charitable Trusts\xe2\x80\x99 Safe Small-Dollar Loans Research Project, would limit monthly loan payments to 5 percent of the borrowers\xe2\x80\x99 pretax income, spread the costs of fees and interest over the life of the loan and require clear disclosure of all costs. Rules like these will give unsuspecting borrowers even more protection from being ambushed by debt.'b'It was a shock to learn from the latest surgeon general\xe2\x80\x99s report that, because of changes in the design and composition of cigarettes, smokers today face a higher risk of lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease than smokers in 1964, despite smoking fewer cigarettes. It is equally shocking to learn now that some of today\xe2\x80\x99s cigarettes may be more addictive than those smoked in past years, most likely because the manufacturers are designing them to deliver more nicotine to the lungs to induce and sustain addiction. That devious tactic requires a strong response by regulators.'b'A 'b'report'b' published last week in the journal Nicotine and Tobacco Research found that while the nicotine content of cigarettes has remained relatively stable for more than a decade, the amount of that nicotine delivered to the machines researchers use as surrogates for smokers has been rising. The researchers, from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the University of Massachusetts Medical School, analyzed data from four manufacturers as required by state law. The findings varied among the companies and brands, but the overall trend led the researchers to conclude that changes in cigarette design have increased the efficiency of delivering nicotine to a smoker\xe2\x80\x99s lungs. Young people who experiment with smoking may thus become addicted more easily and existing smokers may find it harder to quit.'b'Those provocative findings will need to be verified by other experts but are consistent with the 'b'surgeon general\xe2\x80\x99s report'b'. That report, issued on Jan. 17, found that some of today\xe2\x80\x99s cigarettes are more addictive than those from earlier decades, based on the findings of a Federal District Court judge in 2006 who had access to industry documents spelling out how cigarettes were designed to make them more addictive. The industry\xe2\x80\x99s tactics included designing filters and selecting cigarette paper to maximize the ingestion of nicotine and adding chemicals to make cigarettes taste less harsh and easier to inhale deeply.'b'Nicotine itself, in addition to its addictive qualities, has harmful effects on the human body. The surgeon general\xe2\x80\x99s report concluded that nicotine activates biological pathways that increase the risk for disease, adversely affects maternal and fetal health during pregnancy, and can have lasting adverse consequences for brain development in fetuses and adolescents. At high doses, nicotine is toxic and sometimes lethal. A rapid increase in nicotine blood levels can also raise heart rate and blood pressure and narrow arteries around the heart.'b'Still, the main problem is that nicotine addicts people to smoking, which exposes them to a host of toxic ingredients. Regulators will need to find ways to block the designs, ingredients and marketing strategies that increase the amount of nicotine taken in by smokers.'b'Mayor Bill de Blasio, swiftly delivering on a campaign promise, joined the City Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, last week in 'b'offering a bill'b' to revise New York City\xe2\x80\x99s law on paid sick leave. Their bill is broader than one that passed last year after much delay and political spatting. It\xe2\x80\x99s also better.'b'The existing law, set to take effect in April, requires companies with 20 or more workers to provide at least five paid sick days a year, eventually lowering the threshold to 15 workers. The new bill applies to companies with five or more workers, protecting an estimated 360,000 more people than the existing law. It eliminates the current law\xe2\x80\x99s 18-month phase-in period and a trigger to delay implementation if the economy lags.'b'Mr. de Blasio and Ms. Mark-Viverito unveiled the bill with a rally in Brooklyn, emphatically sending the message that the city\xe2\x80\x99s political center of gravity has shifted toward working families and the poor. A more cautious mayor might have been content to let the existing law take effect in April, wait to see how enforcement and compliance worked out and consult with the Council and business community on improving it. But the impatience of Mr. de Blasio and his allies is understandable after more than a decade of Republican mayors and sometimes tooth-and-nail battles over sensible laws like paid sick leave.'b'Mayor de Blasio, who essentially installed Ms. Mark-Viverito as his partner in progressivism, shares with her a mission to pursue an unabashedly liberal agenda in areas like jobs, health care and housing. It\xe2\x80\x99s clearly in his interest to show that the change he promised is on its way. Helping workers, especially single parents, to avoid that awful choice \xe2\x80\x94 dragging themselves to a job from a sickbed or losing a day\xe2\x80\x99s pay \xe2\x80\x94 is not just a potent symbolic gesture, but also good policy.'b'Once again, a thorough and independent analysis of the government\xe2\x80\x99s dragnet surveillance of Americans\xe2\x80\x99 phone records 'b'has found'b' the bulk data collection to be illegal and probably unconstitutional. Just as troubling, the program was found to be virtually useless at stopping terrorism, raising the obvious question: Why does President Obama insist on continuing a costly, legally dubious program when his own appointees repeatedly find that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work?'b'In a 238-page report issued Thursday afternoon, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, a five-member independent agency, called on the White House to end the phone-data collection program, for both constitutional and practical reasons. The board\xe2\x80\x99s report follows a 'b'Dec. 16 ruling'b' by Federal District Judge Richard Leon that 'b'the program'b' was \xe2\x80\x9calmost certainly\xe2\x80\x9d unconstitutional and that the government had not identified \xe2\x80\x9ca single instance\xe2\x80\x9d in which it \xe2\x80\x9cactually stopped an imminent attack.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Two days later, a panel of legal and intelligence experts convened by Mr. Obama after the disclosures by Edward Snowden 'b'echoed those conclusions'b' in its own comprehensive 'b'report'b', which said the data sweep \xe2\x80\x9cwas not essential to preventing attacks\xe2\x80\x9d and called for its end.'b'The growing agreement among those who have studied the program closely makes it imperative that the administration, along with the program\xe2\x80\x99s defenders in Congress, explain why such intrusive mass surveillance is necessary at all. If Mr. Obama knows something that contradicts what he has now been told by two panels, a federal judge and multiple members of Congress, he should tell the American people now. Otherwise, he is in essence asking for their blind faith, which is precisely what he warned against 'b'during his speech last week'b' on the future of government surveillance.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGiven the unique power of the state,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama said, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not enough for leaders to say: trust us, we won\xe2\x80\x99t abuse the data we collect. For history has too many examples when that trust has been breached.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The more likely reality is that the multiple analyses of recent weeks are correct, and that the phone-data sweeps have simply been ineffective. If they had assisted in the prevention of any terrorist attacks, it is safe to assume that we would know by now. Instead, despite 'b'repeated claims'b' that the bulk-data collection programs had a hand in thwarting 54 terrorist plots, the privacy board members write, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have not identified a single instance involving a threat to the United States in which the telephone records program made a concrete difference in the outcome of a counterterrorism investigation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That reiterates the findings of Judge Leon \xe2\x80\x94 who noted that even behind closed doors, the government provided \xe2\x80\x9cno proof\xe2\x80\x9d of the program\xe2\x80\x99s efficacy \xe2\x80\x94 as well as the conclusion of a 'b'report released this month by the New America Foundation'b' that the metadata program \xe2\x80\x9chad no discernible impact on preventing acts of terrorism and only the most marginal of impacts on preventing terrorist-related activity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'No one disputes that the threat of terrorism is real and unrelenting, or that our intelligence techniques must adapt to a rapidly changing world. It is equally clear that the dragnet collection of Americans\xe2\x80\x99 phone calls is not the answer.'b'Over the past decade we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a rich debate on how to expand opportunity for underprivileged children. But we\xe2\x80\x99ve probably made two mistakes.'b'First, we\xe2\x80\x99ve probably placed too much emphasis on early education. Don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong. What happens in the early years is crucial. But human capital development takes a generation. If you really want to make an impact, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have a developmental strategy for all the learning stages, ages 0 to 25.'b'Second, we\xe2\x80\x99ve probably put too much weight on school reform. Again, reforming education is important. But getting the academics right is not going to get you far if millions of students can\xe2\x80\x99t control their impulses, can\xe2\x80\x99t form attachments, don\xe2\x80\x99t possess resilience and lack social and emotional skills.'b'So when President Obama talks about expanding opportunity in his State of the Union address on Tuesday, I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping he\xe2\x80\x99ll widen the debate. I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping he\xe2\x80\x99ll sketch out a stage-by-stage developmental agenda to help poor children move from birth to the middle class.'b'Such an agenda would start before birth. First, children need parents who are ready to care for them. But right now roughly half-a-million children are born each year as a result of unintended pregnancies, often to unmarried women who are not on contraception or are trying to use contraceptives like condoms or the pill. As the University of Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s Rebecca Maynard and Isabel Sawhill and Quentin Karpilow of the Brookings Institution have argued, if these women had free access to long-acting reversible contraceptives like I.U.D.\xe2\x80\x99s, then the number of unintended births might decline and the number of children with unready parents might fall, too.'b'Once born, children are generally better off if they grow up within a loving two-parent marriage. It would be great if we knew how to boost marriage rates, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'For the time being, we probably should spend less time thinking about marriage and more time thinking about parenting skills. As Richard Reeves, also of Brookings, points out, if we could teach the weakest parents to behave like average parents \xe2\x80\x94 by reading more to their kids, speaking more, using consistent, encouraging discipline \xe2\x80\x94 then millions of children might have more secure attachments, more structure and better shots at upwardly mobile careers. Programs like Nurse-Family Partnerships and the Baby College in the Harlem Children\xe2\x80\x99s Zone seem to be able to teach these parenting skills.'b'Once they get to elementary school, children need to learn how to read and write. But that can\xe2\x80\x99t happen in schools where 15 percent of the students are disruptive, where large numbers of students live with so much stress that it has stunted the development of the prefrontal cortexes, sent their cortisol levels surging, heightened their anxiety responses and generally made it hard for them to control themselves.'b'Therefore, we probably need more programs like Pamela Cantor\xe2\x80\x99s Turnaround for Children, which works in schools to help teachers and administrators create \xe2\x80\x9cfortified environments,\xe2\x80\x9d in which overstressed children can receive counseling and treatment, in which the psychic traumas that go with poverty are recognized and addressed.'b'According to work done by Sawhill and others, a significant number of kids stay on track through the early years, but then fall off the rails as teenagers. Sawhill set a pretty low bar for having a successful adolescence: graduate from high school with a 2.5 G.P.A., don\xe2\x80\x99t get convicted of a crime, don\xe2\x80\x99t get pregnant. Yet only 57 percent of American 19-year-olds get over that bar. Only one-third of children in the bottom fifth of family income do so.'b'Over the next few years, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to spend a lot more time and money figuring out how to help people from poorer families chart a course through the teenage years. There\xe2\x80\x99s evidence that Career Academies help adolescents navigate the teenage rapids. There\xe2\x80\x99s some evidence that New York\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csmall schools of choice\xe2\x80\x9d yield measurable results. We as a nation have made awesome progress in reducing teenage pregnancies, so it is possible to change teenage behavior, even in the face of raging hormones.'b'But it is harder to find successful programs geared toward teenagers than it is to find successful programs geared toward younger children. It feels like less money has been raised to help teenagers, fewer innovative programs have been initiated.'b'Robert Putnam of Harvard argues that when we design early education programs, they need to be \xe2\x80\x9cwrap-around.\xe2\x80\x9d They need to have formal and informal programs that bring parents in and instill communal skills. With teenagers, we need more guidance counselors to help them become savvy, so they know how to work the system, and to respond when their needs aren\xe2\x80\x99t being met.'b'Putnam is emphasizing skills \xe2\x80\x94 for toddlers or teenagers \xe2\x80\x94 that are hard to see and measure. But that\xe2\x80\x99s the next frontier of human capital development: Building lifelong social and emotional development strategies from age 0 to 25. I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping President Obama goes there.'b'Regarding \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Bosnia\xe2\x80\x99s lessons for Syria'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Opinion, Jan. 22) by Philippe Leroux-Martin: There are certainly lessons to be learned from Bosnia for Syria.

Holbrooke\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdiplomatic surge\xe2\x80\x9d that led to the Dayton peace talks: a NATO bombing campaign and a combined Bosnian-Croatian Army offensive were instrumental in creating the right frame of mind for the Bosnian Serbs and Serbia. For the first time, the Bosnian Serbs were losing \xe2\x80\x94 posing a threat to Slobodan Milosevic\xe2\x80\x99s rule should their lines break and forcing a wave of refugees toward Serbia, which occurred in August 1995 during Croatia\xe2\x80\x99s Operation Storm. This is no knock on diplomacy, but it contextualizes the environment in which it could succeed.'b'There is no parallel to the Geneva II talks. As recently as a year ago, Western military intervention \xe2\x80\x94 specifically striking Bashar al-Assad\xe2\x80\x99s air force and columns of ground forces on the major roads between fronts \xe2\x80\x94 could have created a parallel dynamic by limiting the overstretched Syrian Army\xe2\x80\x99s mobility and fighting effectiveness. Now, due to the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s unwillingness to act, the correlation of forces has shifted, making such an application of force less likely to achieve the desired result of forcing Mr. Assad from power or into negotiations from a position of weakness. Less savory opposition actors have also proliferated in the intervening year, also as a result of nonintervention.'b'Mr. Leroux-Martin mentions the Serbian and Croatian roles at Dayton. Yet Mr. Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman represented Bosnia\xe2\x80\x99s Serbs and Croats at the negotiations because they were effectively co-belligerents who could literally call the shots with their local allies. No external power exerts a parallel weight in Syria, though there is no doubt that Russia, Iran and the Gulf states have influence in the war.'b'I agree completely that diplomacy is effective in shaping \xe2\x80\x9cfuture behavior through electoral and constitutional engineering.\xe2\x80\x9d This is why I pray that the Syrians don\xe2\x80\x99t get saddled with a power-sharing deal anything like Dayton, which has preserved oligarchical warlord politics in Bosnia, albeit with a democratic veneer. Yet absent the willingness to affect the dynamic on the ground in Syria through direct application of force, that is probably the best Syrians can hope for.'b''b'Kurt Bassuener Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina'b''b'The writer is a senior associate at the Democratization Policy Council.'b'\xc2\xa0'b''b'Devoted diplomat\xe2\x80\x99s murder in Kabul'b''b'Regarding \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Kabul attack may alter foreigners\xe2\x80\x99 view'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (News, Jan. 20): Most Western diplomats serve in Afghanistan for a one-year tour.

That generally beneficial trade has also generated huge emissions of pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides that are swiftly transported elsewhere by global winds \xe2\x80\x94 in addition, of course, to adding significantly to carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas.'b'According to the study, which was published\xc2\xa0in\xc2\xa0The Proceedings of the\xc2\xa0National Academy of Sciences, emissions linked to China\xe2\x80\x99s exports\xc2\xa0caused increases in surface sulfate concentrations (a combination of sulfur dioxide and other gases) of between 3 percent and 10 percent in the Western United States in 2006, as well as a smaller increase in ozone-producing pollutants. In Los Angeles, that increased pollution was responsible for causing at least one extra day of smog per year that exceeded federal ozone limits. The report also estimated that the outsourcing of production to China resulted in less pollution in the Eastern United States, because there were fewer emissions from upwind factories in the East and Midwest.'b'The study provides further evidence that Beijing could and should do more to reduce pollution, which ultimately hurts people in that country much more than it does Americans.\xc2\xa0The study, which was written by a team of American and Chinese researchers, estimates that China could cut its emissions of sulfur dioxide by up to 62 percent and nitrogen oxides by up to 22 percent by requiring factories to install energy-efficiency and emission-control technologies as effective as those used in the United States.'b'More broadly speaking, the report\xe2\x80\x99s findings demonstrate that trade and global pollution patterns inextricably link countries to one another. That means that world leaders must coordinate their efforts to successfully reduce harmful emissions of all kinds. Not nearly enough has been done to rein in carbon dioxide and other greenhouses gases, largely because of fundamental disagreements between rich and developing nations over who should be required to do more.'b'But the technology to control windblown pollutants like sulfur dioxide is readily available. What\xe2\x80\x99s needed is robust investment and political will on the local and regional levels.'b'The French National Assembly\xe2\x80\x99s approval on Jan. 22 of an amendment that frees women seeking an abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy from having to justify their decision is a refreshing step forward for reproductive rights.

The bill seeks to give women parity with men by improving wages, strengthening laws against domestic violence and providing for equal representation in politics.'b'The bill also encourages fathers to seek parental leave to care for a new baby by offering six additional months of paid leave if taken by the second parent. In addition, it bans beauty pageants for girls under 13 and expands support for single mothers.

Ms. Vanderbilt, who was transgender but in the closet \xe2\x80\x94 and also probably a con artist \xe2\x80\x94 didn\xe2\x80\x99t like Mr. Hannan\xe2\x80\x99s digging into the details of her personal and professional life. In the final few paragraphs of the story, Mr. Hannan revealed some shocking news: Ms. Vanderbilt had killed herself.'b'The piece was initially met with praise from across the Internet. (\xe2\x80\x9cGreat read,\xe2\x80\x9d raved a typical Tweet. \xe2\x80\x9cFascinating, bizarre,\xe2\x80\x9d read another.) Then the criticism started. Mr. Hannan was accused of everything from being grossly insensitive to Ms. Vanderbilt\xe2\x80\x99s privacy to having played a role in her suicide. The controversy soon grew so intense that the editor of the site, Bill Simmons, felt compelled to address it in an apologetic, if defensive, 2,700-word post of his own. Mr. Simmons stressed that the decision to publish the piece had not been taken lightly and that somewhere between 13 and 15 people had read it before it was posted and had all been \xe2\x80\x9cblown away.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Well, institutions make mistakes. Even a group of smart people is capable of doing something dumb. The fact that Ms. Vanderbilt had killed herself \xe2\x80\x94 and that the writer may have been involved in her decision to do so \xe2\x80\x94 obviously could not be relegated to the status of a footnote. But to chalk up \xe2\x80\x9cDr. V\xe2\x80\x99s Magical Putter\xe2\x80\x9d simply to shoddy editing and bad judgment is to miss the bigger picture. Grantland\xe2\x80\x99s decision to publish the piece, like the initial burst of enthusiasm that greeted it, is also a product of the journalistic environment we\xe2\x80\x99re living in. Specifically, the power of the cult of long-form.'b'It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so many years ago that people assumed the Internet would make long magazine-style stories obsolete. Paradoxically, it now seems to have revived this once threatened medium. Magazines may be disappearing, but that\xe2\x80\x99s O.K.; we still have \xe2\x80\x9clong-form.\xe2\x80\x9d What started as a Twitter signifier (#longreads or #longform), a way to get the attention of people who might be looking for a substantive read, has morphed into its own genre. In the process, a long magazine story went from being one part of a steady diet of journalistic consumption to something artisanal, a treat for connoisseurs.'b'Not only are there websites like Longreads and Longform devoted to curating the best \xe2\x80\x9clong-form\xe2\x80\x9d writing from around the Internet, but even high-metabolism sites like BuzzFeed and Politico are producing their own long-form content. The term confers respectability and connotes something special, something 'b'literary'b'. And sometimes, with the right headline and some breathless re-tweets, long-form can even drive traffic. (See the magazine Pacific Standard\xe2\x80\x99s recent and wildly popular 4,000-word feature on San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s craze for high-end toast.)'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s behind this revival? Nostalgia, partly, for what only recently had seemed to be a dying art. And technology: High-resolution screens make it much more pleasant to read a long piece online than it was even a few years ago. Also the simple and honorable intention to preserve a particular kind of story, one that\xe2\x80\x99s much different from even a long newspaper feature, with scenes and characters and a narrative arc.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of excellent magazine-length journalism being done now, and Grantland publishes plenty of it. The problem is that long-form stories are too often celebrated simply because they exist. And are long. \xe2\x80\x9cLong-form, on the web, is in danger of meaning \xe2\x80\x98a lot of words,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as James Bennet wrote recently in The Atlantic, the magazine he edits.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a familiar phenomenon: When you fetishize \xe2\x80\x94 as opposed to value \xe2\x80\x94 something, you wind up celebrating the idea of the thing rather than the thing itself. How many of those people who initially praised \xe2\x80\x9cDr. V\xe2\x80\x99s Magical Putter,\xe2\x80\x9d I wonder, even made it down to those final few paragraphs before taking to Twitter to associate themselves with this great journalistic achievement?'b'When we fetishize \xe2\x80\x9clong-form,\xe2\x80\x9d we are fetishizing the form and losing sight of its function. That\xe2\x80\x99s how a story with a troubled woman who commits suicide at its center gets told as a writer\xe2\x80\x99s quixotic quest to learn everything he can about the maker of a golf club that he stumbled across during a late-night Internet search for tips for his short game. There\xe2\x80\x99s a place for writers in their magazine stories, and there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing inherently wrong with offering readers a glimpse into the reporting process. The trouble starts when the subject becomes secondary, and the writer becomes not just observer but participant, the hero of his story.'b'What, then, is the function \xe2\x80\x94 the purpose \xe2\x80\x94 of \xe2\x80\x9clong-form\xe2\x80\x9d? To allow a writer to delve into the true complexities of a story, and also to bring readers closer to the experience of other people. Whether a long-form story is published in a magazine or on the web, its goal should be to understand and illuminate its subject, and maybe even use that subject to (subtly) explore some larger, more universal truths. Above all, that requires empathy, the real hallmark of great immersive journalism.'b'In the end, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if one is writing about a huckster or a fraud. The best work still enables readers to experience their subjects as human beings, not as mere objects of curiosity.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not often we think about Mike Huckabee. True, he has a talk show. But so does half the world. Kelly Ripa has a talk show. Geraldo Rivera has a talk show. How often do they come up in conversation?'b'Now, Huckabee is suddenly in the news, thanks to a speech he made at a Republican Party gathering in Washington, in which he dismissed the idea that the G.O.P. has a \xe2\x80\x9cwar on women\xe2\x80\x9d by ...'b'Actually, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty hard to encapsulate what he said. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the most dramatic part:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf the Democrats want to insult the women of America by making them believe that they are helpless without Uncle Sugar coming in and providing for them a prescription each month for birth control because they cannot control their libido or their reproductive system without the help of the government, then so be it. Let us take that discussion all across America.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Say what? Basically, Huckabee seems to be telling us that the Republican Party will not insult women by suggesting the federal government should require health insurance policies to include birth control pills in the prescription drug coverage.'b'He appears confident that women will find that an attractive proposition.'b'Huckabee was at a meeting of the Republican National Committee that was supposed to be pondering ways to close the gender gap. Instead, he laid bare a fact that the party has always tried desperately to hide \xe2\x80\x94 that its anti-abortion agenda is also frequently anti-contraception.'b'Once upon a time, Republicans took the lead when it came to helping women get access to birth control. Now, the whole party is hostage to an anti-abortion movement that harbors a wide-ranging contempt for sex outside of marriage, combined with a strong streak of opposition to any form of artificial birth control, even for married couples.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that make her? It makes her a slut, right?\xe2\x80\x9d Rush Limbaugh said of Sandra Fluke, the law student who was lobbying for inclusion of contraceptives in health care plans. However garbled his language, Huckabee\xe2\x80\x99s control-their-libido harks back to the same mind-set.'b'This is a super political strategy. Let\xe2\x80\x99s target all the voters who waited until they were married and then practiced the rhythm method.'b'The Huckabee speech also raises the question of what happened to Mike Huckabee. Remember him in the old days? Like Bill Clinton, he was a popular governor of Arkansas.'b'Unlike Bill Clinton, he used to fry squirrels in a popcorn popper when he was in college. That has absolutely nothing to do with this story, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t resist bringing it up.'b'Huckabee was always a social conservative \xe2\x80\x94 as governor he once tried to stop a mentally retarded girl who had been raped by her stepfather from getting an abortion. But he also signed a law requiring Arkansas employers to cover contraceptives under their insurance plans.'b'Yes!'b'This version of Mike Huckabee ran for president in 2008, and he was a front-runner for a while, because he was 'b'the most likable candidate'b'. Huckabee was the one who smiled and wanted everybody to get along. He also calmly accepted flak from his opponents for having supported the idea of allowing the children of illegal immigrants to qualify for state scholarships in Arkansas. (\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re a better country than to punish children for what their parents did.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'That Mike Huckabee was the author of a book \xe2\x80\x94 well, actually he is the author of an entire library of books. But the precampaign book for 2008 was \xe2\x80\x9cFrom Hope to Higher Ground\xe2\x80\x9d in which he suggested that the best solution to illegal immigrants was a path to citizenship. (In his to-do lists for readers, he suggested attending a naturalization ceremony \xe2\x80\x94 along with buying Girl Scout cookies and always saying \xe2\x80\x9cthank you.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'Well, the lovable Mike lost and went on to a career as a radio commentator and a Fox TV host. Perhaps he wanted to juice ratings. Perhaps he wanted a new path to the presidency in 2016. But over the past five years, as his party got raw and angry and mean, Huckabee got raw and angry and mean.'b'In his 2011 book \xe2\x80\x9cA Simple Government,\xe2\x80\x9d he railed about everything from giving illegal immigrants a path to citizenship (Amnesty!) to subsidized school breakfasts. He compared President Obama to \xe2\x80\x9can arrogant nerd.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Last summer, he said that when Muslims go to a mosque to pray \xe2\x80\x9cthey come out of there like uncorked animals \xe2\x80\x94 throwing rocks and burning cars.\xe2\x80\x9d After the school massacre at Sandy Hook, Huckabee asked why Americans should be surprised since \xe2\x80\x9cwe have systematically removed God from our schools.\xe2\x80\x9d He later tried to roll that one back a bit.'b'And there was no backtracking after the \xe2\x80\x9cUncle Sugar\xe2\x80\x9d speech. In fact, Huckabee sent an email to his supporters replaying his remarks. Then he asked for a donation.'b'President Hassan Rouhani of Iran made his debut this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he expanded on his government\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'charm offensive'b' by wooing investors and reassuring political leaders of his determination to complete a comprehensive nuclear deal with the major powers. But his benign image and deft political skills could not erase or excuse the ugly fact that Iran remains the main ally of Syria\xe2\x80\x99s president, Bashar al-Assad, in the destruction of Syria and its people.'b'Mr. Rouhani, who took office in August, is eager to fulfill his promises of improving Iran\xe2\x80\x99s relations with the world and reviving an economy devastated by international sanctions and his predecessor\xe2\x80\x99s mismanagement. He quickly reached an interim deal with the major powers that curbs significant aspects of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.'b'When 'b'the deal took effect'b' on Monday, United Nations inspectors confirmed that Iran had begun suspending most advanced uranium-fuel enrichment and taken other agreed-upon steps. In exchange, Iran received what the United States called \xe2\x80\x9climited, targeted and reversible sanctions relief for a six-month period.\xe2\x80\x9d At Davos, Mr. Rouhani clearly was looking to speed the day when all sanctions are lifted and Iran can achieve the economic growth and international acceptance that has been lost since the 1979 Islamic revolution. At a meeting with top oil executives, he and his oil minister 'b'promised to have a new, attractive investment model for oil contracts'b' by September that could help win back business from Western interests.'b'For now, it is essential that broad sanctions, including restrictions on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s access to the international financial system, remain in place until a comprehensive nuclear agreement is reached. The United States insists that they will remain in place, though it may not be easy to prevent an erosion of the penalties. Investors are eager to jump back into the Iranian market, as are many governments.'b'Over the long term, Iran\xe2\x80\x99s full reintegration into the international system will depend on more than just adherence to the interim nuclear deal and completion of a final agreement. It must also be seen as contributing to stability in other ways, including ending the hostility toward Israel. Mr. Rouhani said he sought \xe2\x80\x9cconstructive engagement\xe2\x80\x9d with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors. But that goal is belied by Iran\xe2\x80\x99s support for the Syrian government, a government that has bombed civilians and obstructed humanitarian aid. Iran, which uses Syria as a buffer between it and Israel, has encouraged Hezbollah to fight on his behalf.'b'Iran\xe2\x80\x99s support of Mr. Assad is all the more unsettling because Mr. Rouhani was rubbing shoulders with the world\xe2\x80\x99s elite just as a stormy peace conference on Syria was playing out elsewhere in Switzerland. Instead of just bemoaning the civil war as a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor catastrophe\xe2\x80\x9d and dismissing all the anti-Assad forces as \xe2\x80\x9cterrorists,\xe2\x80\x9d he could have given credibility to his \xe2\x80\x9cconstructive engagement\xe2\x80\x9d policy by temporarily suspending arms to Syria while peace talks are underway and negotiating a face-saving way for Mr. Assad to leave power.'b'The United States has tried to keep the nuclear and Syria issues separate, and there is logic to that. If the nuclear deal were the vehicle to resolve every dispute the West has with Iran, it would likely fail. But the Syrian civil war is a major catastrophe, and Iran has considerable leverage to help bring it to an end.'b'Gov. Andrew Cuomo has deservedly lost Round 1 of the unnecessary fight he picked recently with the New York State attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, over the distribution of proceeds from a bank settlement. To persist in his pique could hurt all New Yorkers.'b'At issue is $613 million, the sum negotiated by Mr. Schneiderman as New York\xe2\x80\x99s share of the recent $13 billion deal between JPMorgan Chase and government officials over the bank\xe2\x80\x99s mortgage practices.'b'The settlement terms call for the attorney general to use most of the proceeds to help hard-pressed homeowners and communities fight foreclosures and to bolster efforts to fight financial fraud. As such, the terms were similar to those of a settlement in 2012 with several big banks, in which Mr. Schneiderman garnered $136 million to use for foreclosure relief. That money is currently being spent \xe2\x80\x94 transparently and effectively, and without pushback from the governor \xe2\x80\x94 for just that purpose.'b'This time around, however, Mr. Cuomo, who is seeking to balance the state budget while also cutting taxes, 'b'wanted'b' all $613 million to flow into the state treasury. To that end, his staff members suggested that Mr. Schneiderman was on dubious legal ground to take control of the settlement proceeds and that the money could become, in the words of one official, \xe2\x80\x9ca pretty big slush fund.\xe2\x80\x9d In a 'b'letter this month'b', Mr. Schneiderman persuasively rebutted the legal and ethical claims, and this week 'b'a truce was arranged'b'. Mr. Schneiderman agreed to allocate to the state $81.5 million, half of the $163 million that is to be spent in the settlement\xe2\x80\x99s first year. At the same time, and importantly, he won assurance that the money would be used only for housing-related purposes.'b'But it remains to be seen how the deal will play out. To truly honor the settlement\xe2\x80\x99s terms, Mr. Cuomo needs to ensure that the money is used for housing-related purposes on top of amounts already budgeted for housing \xe2\x80\x94 and not as a substitute.'b'Mr. Schneiderman has fought for and won new resources for hard-pressed homeowners. Mr. Cuomo should reward that effort, and stick to his pledge, by using the state\xe2\x80\x99s share for housing aid above and beyond what otherwise would have been spent.'b'The mammoth farm bill is reportedly near a conference compromise in Congress, bristling with more tragic cuts in the food stamp program for the needy and a revision of lucrative commodity subsidies for mostly big farmers. Running below the radar is a dangerous, broadly written amendment that would threaten states\xe2\x80\x99 current powers to enact their own agricultural standards \xe2\x80\x94 standards that can extend far beyond farmyards to consumer, worker and environmental safety.'b'The amendment amounts to a federal fiat that states cannot set mandatory standards on agricultural products that block competition from farmers in other states where standards are looser. The amendment was approved by the Republican-dominated House at the instigation of Representative Steve King, the Iowa Republican and Tea Party champion. He is determined to protect his state\xe2\x80\x99s egg producers from a new California 'b'requirement'b' that hens thrive in more humane conditions \xe2\x80\x94 basically, a bit more room to move around in their cages.'b'Mr. King, a notorious mocker of animal protection reform, 'b'insists'b' his amendment is \xe2\x80\x9cseverely limited in scope\xe2\x80\x9d to stop \xe2\x80\x9cradical\xe2\x80\x9d protectionist advantages for California egg producers that he feels violate interstate commerce. But it is far from that specific and is so sweeping and vaguely worded that it threatens all manner of current state prerogatives. This from an avowed opponent of clumsy federal intrusion into local life.'b'The National Conference of State Legislatures has properly 'b'urged rejection'b' of the amendment because it would pre-empt assorted local agricultural policies vital in protecting \xe2\x80\x9cour farmland, waterways, forests and most importantly, the health and welfare of our constituents.\xe2\x80\x9d The group warned that existing laws on invasive pests and livestock disease and standards of seed and food protection would be open to challenge, abrogating states\xe2\x80\x99 rights guaranteed under the Constitution. States vary, with some requiring the labeling of farm-raised fish, the banning of specific pesticides, and cross-border protections against Dutch elm disease and other threats.'b'Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack warns that the King amendment can only lead to years of litigation, marketplace confusion and unintended consequences. But Mr. King, with support from livestock and poultry interests fearing higher production costs, is fighting hard. His wayward amendment should be spiked emphatically by the conference committee.'b'Mayor Bill de Blasio wants to bring the number of traffic deaths in New York City from just short of 300 a year to zero, or close to zero, in 10 years. That\xe2\x80\x99s a laudable and ambitious goal, and he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to 'b'change lots of things'b' to get there: lower speed limits, more rigorous enforcement of existing laws, better street engineering to slow traffic.'b'However, one reasonable proposal \xe2\x80\x94 deploying speed cameras that clock speeding cars and record license plates \xe2\x80\x94 must navigate the State Legislature. That\xe2\x80\x99s crazy, but true.'b'State law governs traffic matters, but legislators can grant exceptions for New York City. Assemblyman David Gantt, whose home in Rochester is more than 300 miles away from New York City, is chairman of the Assembly\xe2\x80\x99s transportation committee, and thus has a big say on whether traffic cameras can be installed on Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn or, to name one notoriously hazardous Manhattan location, the intersection of Park Avenue and 33rd Street.'b'Last year, after the number of traffic fatalities jumped from 249 in 2011 to 277 in 2012, the Bloomberg administration begged Albany for more speed cameras to catch drivers jumping red lights or speeding on city streets. (There were an estimated 286 traffic deaths last year.) The state agreed to a measly 20 of these speed enforcement tools.'b'Mr. de Blasio wants many more cameras, and Albany should allow them. But the best solution would be for Albany\xe2\x80\x99s roadblocking lawmakers to grant the city open-ended permission to use all the speed cameras it needs. So far this year, there have been 15 New Yorkers killed in traffic, nine of them pedestrians. That is not a good start.'b'This week Glenn Beck said something I agree with. (Now, there\xe2\x80\x99s a line I never thought I\xe2\x80\x99d write.) During an 'b'interview'b' on Tuesday with Megyn Kelly of Fox News, Beck reflected on his time at Fox this way:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI remember it as an awful lot of fun, and that I made an awful lot of mistakes, and I wish I could go back and be more uniting in my language. Because I think I played a role unfortunately in helping tear the country apart. And it\xe2\x80\x99s not who we are. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize how really fragile the people were. I thought we were kind of a little more in it together. And now I look back and I realize if we could have talked about the uniting principles a little more, instead of just the problems, I think I would look back on it a little more fondly. But that\xe2\x80\x99s only my role.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a Damascus Road conversion, but it is a meaningful confession.'b'And I applaud Beck for his candid assessment. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t undo the damage \xe2\x80\x94 Beck\xe2\x80\x99s list of sins is long, and some of those sins are beyond absolution \xe2\x80\x94 but admitting a mistake is always an admirable act.'b'I hope Beck\xe2\x80\x99s confession shines a light on the underbelly of punditry.'b'Many media personalities are far from noble. As in any field, there are those consumed by ambition and possessed of dubious ethical bearings.'b'And in an arena where influence is measured by ratings, views and followers, the pressure to increase those metrics can get the better even of men and women with weather vane convictions.'b'It simply becomes an issue of wealth and power, two of the oldest corrupters in the human experience. Part of the job of opinion makers is to be provocative. One could express it this way: illuminate, elucidate and agitate.'b'But chasing provocation is a dangerous thing. It often leads you further out on a limb than is wise or safe. Columnists aren\xe2\x80\x99t immune to this problem, either.'b''b'In his farewell column'b', my former colleague Frank Rich lamented the pressures of the pacing of column writing, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThat routine can push you to have stronger opinions than you actually have, or contrived opinions about subjects you may not care deeply about, or to run roughshod over nuance to reach an unambiguous conclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I agree with his assessment, and most of us try diligently to steer clear of the hazards.'b'But few columnists, least of all the masterly Rich, have ever or could ever come close to the willful recklessness exhibited by Beck.'b'Among Beck\xe2\x80\x99s greatest hits was his 'b'assertion'b' that President Obama is a \xe2\x80\x9cracist\xe2\x80\x9d who has \xe2\x80\x9ca deep-seated hatred for white people or the white culture.\xe2\x80\x9d This is the same Obama who was born to a white mother and raised in part by his white grandparents.'b'Beck also 'b'joked'b' about wanting to kill Michael Moore, said he had started \xe2\x80\x9chating the 9/11 victims\xe2\x80\x99 families\xe2\x80\x9d and 'b'called'b' some victims of Hurricane Katrina \xe2\x80\x9cscumbags.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Beck is in a class all his own.'b'He built a career out of trolling for attention. It was the media equivalent of twerking with a giant foam finger. There seemed to be nothing too outrageous or spurious. And it worked for him.'b'The problem is that viewers and readers don\xe2\x80\x99t always know that they\xe2\x80\x99re being hustled.'b'Beck and his colleagues at Fox did their viewers and the country a tremendous disservice, not only riling folks up but outrightly misinforming them.'b'In 2012, the year after Beck left his Fox show (which at the time was one of the highest-rated shows in all of cable news), a Fairleigh Dickinson PublicMind poll 'b'found'b' that people who watched or listened to no news were better informed than those who watched Fox. According to the report, \xe2\x80\x9cThe largest effect\xe2\x80\x9d of a news source \xe2\x80\x9cis that of Fox News: all else being equal, someone who watched only Fox News would be expected to answer just 1.04 domestic questions correctly \xe2\x80\x94 a figure which is significantly worse than if they had reported watching no media at all.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'(It should be noted that watching MSNBC also had a \xe2\x80\x9cnegative impact on people\xe2\x80\x99s current events knowledge,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the poll, although it was not as large as the effect of watching Fox.) This study is 'b'not the only study'b' that has pointed out that misinformation is consumed by Fox News viewers.'b'Beck practiced a particular brand of dangerous \xe2\x80\x9cinfo-tainment\xe2\x80\x9d that reduced complexity and facts to a smelly chum of hyperbole and invectives that did immeasurable damage. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope he and his fans understand that now.'b'Last week, one of the landmark nonfiction books of the last 50 years was reissued by Vintage Books. \xe2\x80\x9cIs There No Place on Earth for Me?\xe2\x80\x9d by Susan Sheehan began in 1981 as a four-part series in The New Yorker; in 1982, it came out as a book, winning the Pulitzer Prize.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIs There No Place on Earth for Me?\xe2\x80\x9d is about a woman who suffers from severe schizophrenia. In the book, Sheehan calls her \xe2\x80\x9cSylvia Frumkin,\xe2\x80\x9d a pseudonym meant to protect her privacy; her real name was Maxine Mason, which Sheehan divulged after 'b'Mason died, at the age of 46, in 1994'b'. She was overweight and overbearing, a difficult person even in the best of times, but also, Sheehan told me recently, \xe2\x80\x9cbright and articulate\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 when she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t delusional. The book\xe2\x80\x99s title was a question Mason \xe2\x80\x9chad first asked her mother in an ambulance transporting her from one hospital to another in 1964,\xe2\x80\x9d as Sheehan wrote in an essay published after Mason\xe2\x80\x99s death. (It is included as a postscript to the new edition.) Mason was 16 at the time.'b'I have no idea what moved Vintage Books to republish \xe2\x80\x9cIs There No Place on Earth for Me?\xe2\x80\x9d but I\xe2\x80\x99m glad it did. The story Sheehan tells is a terribly sad one, and not just because of the flashes Mason shows of what she might have become if she had not suffered from mental illness. It is also appalling to see what she goes through as a mental patient: the hospitals that overmedicate; the misdiagnoses by doctors after the briefest of examinations; the lack of any kind of safety net when she is not hospitalized. But here\xe2\x80\x99s the worst part: Even though the story Sheehan tells is more than 30 years old, there is only one real difference between then and now for the mentally ill. It\xe2\x80\x99s worse today.'b'The deinstitutionalization movement was 'b'well underway'b' when Sheehan was doing her reporting. In the 1960s, during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, the federal government passed a series of laws designed to liberate the mentally ill from the acknowledged horrors of mental hospitals, where they were often confined for decades. The idea was that with the introduction of powerful new antipsychotic drugs, people with schizophrenia could live outside a mental hospital \xe2\x80\x94 and that hospital stays would be much shorter. The federal government gave money to communities to set up local mental health centers as well as housing for the mentally ill.'b'In 1975, this trend was affirmed by the Supreme Court, 'b'which ruled'b' that the mentally ill had a right \xe2\x80\x9cto live in the least restrictive setting necessary for their well-being,\xe2\x80\x9d as Sheehan writes. By the time Sheehan met Mason, in 1978, the average stay at Creedmoor \xe2\x80\x94 the New York psychiatric hospital where much of the book takes place \xe2\x80\x94 was 38 days. Some 67 percent of the admissions were people who had had previous stays at Creedmoor.'b'On the one hand, many mentally ill people were able to lead fuller, richer lives thanks to the deinstitutionalization movement. But as Sheehan\xe2\x80\x99s book illustrates, there were also many people for whom the drugs did not have a pronounced effect \xe2\x80\x94 or who stopped taking the drugs as soon as they left the hospital. Yet there were no longer enough hospital beds for them, hence the need for hospitals to drug them up and move them out.'b'E. Fuller Torrey, perhaps the most vocal critic of the current mental health system, says that before deinstitutionalization there were 312 public psychiatric beds for every 100,000 people. That was clearly too many. But today there are a paltry 14 beds for every 100,000. Torrey estimates that we need at least 50 beds per 100,000.'b'Meanwhile, what happened to patients once they left the hospital was often horrendous. State mental hospitals would release patients with little idea where they were going. They often ended up on the streets, or in prison, which have become today\xe2\x80\x99s de facto mental hospitals.'b'In one sense, Maxine Mason was lucky. Though she had enormous difficulties with her parents, they clearly loved her and tried, as best they could, to help her. Her sister Trudy did the same after her parents had died, pulling strings to get her into the kind of outpatient housing that was envisioned when the deinstitutionalization movement began. The problem was that Mason was simply too sick to last long in such an environment. She needed to be in a hospital \xe2\x80\x94 a humane hospital where she could get the care she needed. It never happened.'b'I remember thinking when Sheehan\xe2\x80\x99s articles first came out in The New Yorker that someday we would look back in horror at the way our society treated the mentally ill. Thirty three years later, that day still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come. But it will.'b'AS soon as the CT scan was done, I began reviewing the images. The diagnosis was immediate: Masses matting the lungs and deforming the spine. Cancer. In my neurosurgical training, I had reviewed hundreds of scans for fellow doctors to see if surgery offered any hope. I\xe2\x80\x99d scribble in the chart \xe2\x80\x9cWidely metastatic disease \xe2\x80\x94 no role for surgery,\xe2\x80\x9d and move on. But this scan was different: It was my own.'b'I have sat with countless patients and families to discuss grim prognoses: It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the most important jobs physicians have. It\xe2\x80\x99s easier when the patient is 94, in the last stages of dementia and has a severe brain bleed. For young people like me \xe2\x80\x94 I am 36 \xe2\x80\x94 given a diagnosis of cancer, there aren\xe2\x80\x99t many words. My standard pieces include \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a marathon, not a sprint, so get your daily rest\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cillness can drive a family apart or bring it together \xe2\x80\x94 be aware of each other\xe2\x80\x99s needs and find extra support.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I learned a few basic rules. Be honest about the prognosis but always leave some room for hope. Be vague but accurate: \xe2\x80\x9cdays to a few weeks,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cweeks to a few months,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmonths to a few years,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca few years to a decade or more.\xe2\x80\x9d We never cite detailed statistics, and usually advise against Googling survival numbers, assuming the average patient doesn\xe2\x80\x99t possess a nuanced understanding of statistics.'b'People react differently to hearing \xe2\x80\x9cProcedure X has a 70 percent chance of survival\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cProcedure Y has a 30 percent chance of death.\xe2\x80\x9d Phrased that way, people flock to Procedure X, even though the numbers are the same. When a close friend developed pancreatic cancer, I became the medical maven to a group of people who were sophisticated statisticians. I still dissuaded them from looking up the statistics, saying five-year survival curves are at least five years out of date. Somehow I felt that the numbers alone were too dry, or that a physician\xe2\x80\x99s daily experience with illness was needed for context. Mostly, I felt that impulse: Keep a measure of hope.'b'These survival curves, called Kaplan-Meier curves, are one way we measure progress in cancer treatment, plotting the number of patients surviving over time. For some diseases, the line looks like an airplane gently beginning its descent; for others, like a dive bomber. Physicians think a lot about these curves, their shape, and what they mean. In brain-cancer research, for example, while the numbers for average survival time haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed much, there\xe2\x80\x99s an increasingly long tail on the curve, indicating a few patients are living for years. The problem is that you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell an individual patient where she is on the curve. It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible, irresponsible even, to be more precise than you can be accurate.'b'One would think, then, that when my oncologist sat by my bedside to meet me, I would not immediately demand information on survival statistics. But now that I had traversed the line from doctor to patient, I had the same yearning for the numbers all patients ask for. I hoped she would see me as someone who both understood statistics and the medical reality of illness, that she would give me certainty, the straight dope. I could take it. She flatly refused: \xe2\x80\x9cNo. Absolutely not.\xe2\x80\x9d She knew very well I could \xe2\x80\x94 and did \xe2\x80\x94 look up all the research on the topic. But lung cancer wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my specialty, and she was a world expert. At each appointment, a wrestling match began, and she always avoided being pinned down to any sort of number.'b'Now, instead of wondering why some patients persist in asking statistics questions, I began to wonder why physicians obfuscate when they have so much knowledge and experience. Initially when I saw my CT scan, I figured I had only a few months to live. The scan looked bad. I looked bad. I\xe2\x80\x99d lost 30 pounds, developed excruciating back pain and felt more fatigued every day. My tests revealed severely low protein levels and low blood counts consistent with the body overwhelmed, failing in its basic drive to sustain itself.'b'For a few months, I\xe2\x80\x99d suspected I had cancer. I had seen a lot of young patients with cancer. So I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t taken aback. In fact, there was a certain relief. The next steps were clear: Prepare to die. Cry. Tell my wife that she should remarry, and refinance the mortgage. Write overdue letters to dear friends. Yes, there were lots of things I had meant to do in life, but sometimes this happens: Nothing could be more obvious when your day\xe2\x80\x99s work includes treating head trauma and brain cancer.'b'But on my first visit with my oncologist, she mentioned my going back to work someday. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I a ghost? No. But then how long did I have? Silence.'b'Of course, she could not stop my intense reading. Poring over studies, I kept trying to find the one that would tell me when my number would be up. The large general studies said that between 70 and 80 percent of lung cancer patients would die within two years. They did not allow for much hope. But then again, most of those patients were older and heavy smokers. Where was the study of nonsmoking 36-year-old neurosurgeons? Maybe my youth and health mattered? Or maybe my disease was found so late, had spread so far, and I was already so far gone that I was worse off than those 65-year-old smokers.'b'Many friends and family members provided anecdotes along the lines of my-friend\xe2\x80\x99s-friend\xe2\x80\x99s-mom\xe2\x80\x99s-friend or my-uncle\xe2\x80\x99s-barber\xe2\x80\x99s-son\xe2\x80\x99s-tennis-partner has this same kind of lung cancer and has been living for 10 years. Initially I wondered if all the stories referred to the same person, connected through the proverbial six degrees. I disregarded them as wishful thinking, baseless delusion. Eventually, though, enough of those stories seeped in through the cracks of my studied realism.'b'And then my health began to improve, thanks to a pill that targets a specific genetic mutation tied to my cancer. I began to walk without a cane and to say things like, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty unlikely that I\xe2\x80\x99ll be lucky enough to live for a decade, but it\xe2\x80\x99s possible.\xe2\x80\x9d A tiny drop of hope.'b'In a way, though, the certainty of death was easier than this uncertain life. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t those in purgatory prefer to go to hell, and just be done with it? Was I supposed to be making funeral arrangements? Devoting myself to my wife, my parents, my brothers, my friends, my adorable niece? Writing the book I had always wanted to write? Or was I supposed to go back to negotiating my multiyear job offers?'b'The path forward would seem obvious, if only I knew how many months or years I had left. Tell me three months, I\xe2\x80\x99d just spend time with family. Tell me one year, I\xe2\x80\x99d have a plan (write that book). Give me 10 years, I\xe2\x80\x99d get back to treating diseases. The pedestrian truth that you live one day at a time didn\xe2\x80\x99t help: What was I supposed to do with that day? My oncologist would say only: \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you a time. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to find what matters most to you.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed both nothing and everything. Before my cancer was diagnosed, I knew that someday I would die, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know when. After the diagnosis, I knew that someday I would die, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know when. But now I knew it acutely. The problem wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really a scientific one. The fact of death is unsettling. Yet there is no other way to live.'b'The reason doctors don\xe2\x80\x99t give patients specific prognoses is not merely because they cannot. Certainly, if a patient\xe2\x80\x99s expectations are way out of the bounds of probability \xe2\x80\x94 someone expecting to live to 130, or someone thinking his benign skin spots are signs of impending death \xe2\x80\x94 doctors are entrusted to bring that person\xe2\x80\x99s expectations into the realm of reasonable possibility.'b'But the range of what is reasonably possible is just so wide. Based on today\xe2\x80\x99s therapies, I might die within two years, or I might make it to 10. If you add in the uncertainty based on new therapies available in two or three years, that range may be completely different. Faced with mortality, scientific knowledge can provide only an ounce of certainty: Yes, you will die. But one wants a full pound of certainty, and that is not on offer.'b'What patients seek is not scientific knowledge doctors hide, but existential authenticity each must find on her own. Getting too deep into statistics is like trying to quench a thirst with salty water. The angst of facing mortality has no remedy in probability.'b'I remember the moment when my overwhelming uneasiness yielded. Seven words from Samuel Beckett, a writer I\xe2\x80\x99ve not even read that well, learned long ago as an undergraduate, began to repeat in my head, and the seemingly impassable sea of uncertainty parted: \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go on. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go on.\xe2\x80\x9d I took a step forward, repeating the phrase over and over: \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go on. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go on.\xe2\x80\x9d And then, at some point, I was through.'b'I am now almost exactly eight months from my diagnosis. My strength has recovered substantially. In treatment, the cancer is retreating. I have gradually returned to work. I\xe2\x80\x99m knocking the dust off scientific manuscripts. I\xe2\x80\x99m writing more, seeing more, feeling more. Every morning at 5:30, as the alarm clock goes off, and my dead body awakes, my wife asleep next to me, I think again to myself: \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go on.\xe2\x80\x9d And a minute later, I am in my scrubs, heading to the operating room, alive: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go on.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'DO the Republicans owe their current congressional majority to gerrymandering? At first glance, it seems self-evident that they do. In the 2012 election, the Democrats won the popular votes for the presidency, the Senate and the House of Representatives. But somehow in the House \xe2\x80\x94 for whose seats Republicans controlled the redistricting process in many crucial states \xe2\x80\x94 the Republicans managed to end up with a 16-seat majority despite losing the popular vote.'b'The presumption among\xc2\xa0many reformers is that the Democrats would control Congress today if the 2012 election had been contested in districts drawn by nonpartisan commissioners rather than politicians.'b'But is this true? Another possibility is that Democrats receive more votes than seats because so many of their voters reside in dense cities that Democratic candidates win with overwhelming majorities, while Republican voters are more evenly distributed across exurbs and the rural periphery. Perhaps even a nonpartisan redistricting process would still have delivered the House to the Republicans.'b'To examine this hypothesis, we adapted a computer algorithm that 'b'we recently introduced in the Quarterly Journal of Political Science'b'. It allows us to draw thousands of alternative, nonpartisan redistricting plans and assess the partisan advantage built into each plan. First we created a large number of districting plans (as many as 1,000) for each of 49 states. Then we predicted the probability that a Democrat or Republican would win each simulated district based on the results of the 2008 presidential election and tallied the expected Republican seats associated with each simulated plan.'b'The results were not encouraging for reform advocates. In\xc2\xa0the vast majority of states, our\xc2\xa0nonpartisan simulations produced Republican seat shares that were not much different from the actual numbers in the last election. This was true even in some states, like Indiana and Missouri, with heavy Republican influence over redistricting. Both of these states were hotly contested and leaned only slightly Republican over all, but of the 17 seats between them, only four were won by Democrats (in St. Louis, Kansas City, Gary and Indianapolis). While some of our simulations generated an additional Democratic seat around St. Louis or Indianapolis, most of them did not, and in any case, a vanishingly small number of simulations gave Democrats a congressional seat share commensurate with their overall support in these states.'b'The problem for Democrats is that they have overwhelming majorities not only in the dense, poor urban centers, but also in isolated, far-flung college towns, historical mining areas and 19th-century manufacturing towns that are surrounded by and ultimately overwhelmed by rural Republicans.'b'A motivated Democratic cartographer could produce districts that accurately reflected overall partisanship in states like these by carefully crafting the metropolitan districts and snaking districts along the historical canals and rail lines that once connected the nonmetropolitan Democratic enclaves. But such districts are unlikely to emerge by chance from a nonpartisan process. On the other hand, a Republican cartographer in these and other Midwestern states, along with some Southern states like Georgia and Tennessee, could do little to improve on the advantage bestowed by the existing human geography.'b'By no means does this imply that critics of gerrymandering are always wrong. In the states most frequently derided as overt Republican gerrymanders, our analysis shows that gerrymandering has indeed given the Republicans additional seats beyond the already pro-Republican average of our simulations. Most notable are North Carolina, Florida, Pennsylvania, Texas and Michigan.'b'But keep in mind that Democrats play this game as well. For example, by artfully dividing up Chicago into pie-sliced districts extending from Lake Michigan into the suburbs, the Illinois Democrats have done better for themselves than the outcome of our nonpartisan simulations. The Democrats have achieved something similar in Maryland. And in what will come as a surprise to many in the reform community, California\xe2\x80\x99s redistricting commission produced multiple Democratic seats beyond the predictions of our simulations. Evidently the enormous and sophisticated lobbying efforts of California Democrats were successful.'b'All told, the Republican seat share emerging from the 2012 election exceeds our simulation predictions by only a small handful of seats: not nearly enough to deliver Congress to the Democrats.'b'In short, the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 geography problem is bigger than their gerrymandering problem. We do not mean to imply that the absurd practice of allowing incumbents to draw electoral districts should continue. Rather, we suggest that unless they are prepared to take more radical steps that would require a party\xe2\x80\x99s seat share to approximate its vote share, reformers in many states may not get the results they are expecting.'b'YOU don\xe2\x80\x99t have to look far to see the woolly influence of sheep on our cultural lives. They turn up as symbols of peace and a vaguely remembered pastoral way of life in our poetry, our art and our Christmas pageants. Wolves also rank high among our cultural icons, usually in connection with the words \xe2\x80\x9cbig\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbad.\xe2\x80\x9d And yet there is now a debate underway about substituting the wolf for the sheep on the (also iconic) green hills of Britain.'b'The British author and environmental polemicist George Monbiot has largely instigated the anti-sheep campaign, which builds on a broader \xe2\x80\x9crewilding\xe2\x80\x9d movement to bring native species back to Europe. Until he recently relocated, Mr. Monbiot used to look up at the bare hills above his house in Machynlleth, Wales, and seethe at what Lord Tennyson lovingly called \xe2\x80\x9cthe livelong bleat / Of the thick-fleeced sheep.\xe2\x80\x9d Because of overgrazing by sheep, he says, the deforested uplands, including a national park, looked \xe2\x80\x9clike the aftermath of a nuclear winter.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have an unhealthy obsession with sheep,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Monbiot admits, in his book \xe2\x80\x9cFeral.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI hate them.\xe2\x80\x9d In a chapter titled \xe2\x80\x9cSheepwrecked,\xe2\x80\x9d he calls sheep a \xe2\x80\x9cwhite plague\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca slow-burning ecological disaster, which has done more damage to the living systems of this country than either climate change or industrial pollution.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The thought of all those sheep \xe2\x80\x94 more than 30 million nationwide \xe2\x80\x94 makes Mr. Monbiot a little crazy. But to be fair, sheep seem to lead us all beyond the realm of logic. The nibbled landscape that he denounces as \xe2\x80\x9ca bowling green with contours\xe2\x80\x9d is beloved by the British public. Visitors (including this writer, otherwise a wildlife advocate) tend to feel the same when they hike the hills and imagine they are still looking out on William Blake\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgreen and pleasant land.\xe2\x80\x9d Even British conservationists, who routinely scold other countries for letting livestock graze in their national parks, somehow fail to notice that Britain\xe2\x80\x99s national parks are overrun with sheep.'b'Mr. Monbiot detects \xe2\x80\x9ca kind of cultural cringe\xe2\x80\x9d that keeps people from criticizing sheep farming. (In part, he blames children\xe2\x80\x99s books for clouding vulnerable minds with idyllic ideas about farming.) Sheep have \xe2\x80\x9cbecome a symbol of nationhood, an emblem almost as sacred as Agnus Dei, the Lamb of God,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes. Much of the nation tunes in ritually on Sunday nights to BBC television\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCountryfile,\xe2\x80\x9d a show about rural issues, which he characterizes as an escapist modern counterpart to pastoral poetry. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it were any keener on sheep,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cit would be illegal.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The many friends of British sheep have not yet called for burning Mr. Monbiot at the stake. But they have protested. \xe2\x80\x9cWithout our uplands, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a UK sheep industry,\xe2\x80\x9d Phil Bicknell, an economist for the National Farmers Union pointed out. \xe2\x80\x9cFarmgate sales of lamb are worth over \xc2\xa31bn\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 or $1.7 billion \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cto U.K. agriculture.\xe2\x80\x9d The only wolves he wanted to hear about were his own Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club. A critic for The Guardian, where Mr. Monbiot contributes a column, linked the argument against sheep, rather unfairly, to anti-immigrant nativists, adding \xe2\x80\x9csheep have been here a damn sight longer than Saxons.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'More soberly, the Oxford geographer John Boardman says the uplands, in the Lake District and elsewhere, have already begun to recover as government policies encourage alternatives to sheep grazing. \xe2\x80\x9cI can see George\xe2\x80\x99s point and I can see the value of some reforestation,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Boardman. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what he is proposing isn\xe2\x80\x99t minimal or sensitive change. It\xe2\x80\x99s a wholesale change, and pretty impractical in terms of public policy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Monbiot acknowledges the antiquity of sheep-keeping in Britain. But the subjugation of the uplands by sheep, he says, only really got going around the 17th century, as the landlords enclosed the countryside, evicted poor farmers, and cleared away the forests from the hillsides and moorlands, particularly in Scotland. Britain is, he writes, inexplicably choosing \xe2\x80\x9cto preserve a 17th-century cataclysm.\xe2\x80\x9d The sheep wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in the uplands at all, he adds, without annual taxpayer subsidies, which average \xc2\xa353,000 per farm in Wales.'b'He proposes an end to this artificial foundation for the \xe2\x80\x9cagricultural hegemony,\xe2\x80\x9d to be replaced by a more lucrative economy of walking and wildlife-based activities. He also argues for bringing wolves back to Britain, for reasons both scientific (\xe2\x80\x9cto reintroduce the complexity and trophic diversity in which our ecosystems are lacking\xe2\x80\x9d) and romantic (wolves are \xe2\x80\x9cinhabitants of the more passionate world against which we have locked our doors\xe2\x80\x9d). But he acknowledges that it would be foolish to force rewilding on the public. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it happens, it should be done with the consent and active engagement of the people who live on and benefit from the land.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Elsewhere in Europe, the sheep are in full bleating retreat, and the wolves are resurgent. Shepherds and small farmers are abandoning marginal land at an annual rate of roughly a million hectares, or nearly 4,000 square miles, according to Wouter Helmer, co-founder of the group Rewilding Europe. That\xe2\x80\x99s half a Massachusetts every year left open for the recovery of native species.'b'Wolves returned to Germany around 1998, and they have been spotted recently in the border areas of Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark. In France, the sheep in a farming region just over two hours from Paris suffered at least 22 reported wolf attacks last year. But environmentalists there say farmers would do better protesting against dogs, which they say kill 100,000 sheep annually. Wolves are now a protected species across Europe, where their population quadrupled after the 1970s. Today an estimated 11,500 wolves roam there.'b'Lynx, golden jackals, European bison, moose, Alpine ibex and even wolverines have also rebounded, according to a recent study commissioned by Rewilding Europe. Mr. Helmer says his group aims to develop ecotourism on an African safari model, with former shepherds finding new employment as guides. That may sound na\xc3\xafve. But he sees rewilding as a realistic way to prosper as the European landscape develops along binary lines, with urbanized areas and intensive agriculture on one side and wildlife habitat with ecotourism on the other.'b'In northern Scotland, Paul Lister is working on an ecotourism scheme to bring back wolves and bears on his Alladale Wilderness Reserve, where he has already planted more than 800,000 native trees. He still needs government permission to keep predators on a proposed 50,000-acre fenced landscape. That\xe2\x80\x99s a long way from introducing them to the wild, on the model of Yellowstone National Park. Even so, precedent suggests that it will be a battle.'b'Though beavers are neither big nor bad, a recent trial program to reintroduce them to the British countryside caused furious public protest. (One writer denounced \xe2\x80\x9cthe emotion-based obsession with furry mammals of the whiskery type.\xe2\x80\x9d) And late last year, when five wolves escaped from the Colchester Zoo, authorities quickly shot two of them dead. A police helicopter was deployed to hunt and kill another, and a fourth was recaptured. Prudently, the fifth wolf slunk back into its cage, defeated.'b'Rewilding? At least for now, Britain once again stands alone (well, alone with its 30 million sheep) against the rising European tide.'b'In a speech on Jan. 17, President Obama spoke of the challenge of a world \xe2\x80\x9cthat is remaking itself at a dizzying speed.\xe2\x80\x9d The subject of his address at the Justice Department was the complex issues of security, privacy and the limits of government power raised by revelations about the National Security Agency\xe2\x80\x99s spying. That debate continued to rage through the last week. But Mr. Obama could have been speaking as well about conflicts in places like Syria and Ukraine, which seemed to become more intractable with every effort at resolution.'b''b'Secrets and Contractors 'b''b'When the first of Edward Snowden\xe2\x80\x99s cache of secret documents leaked out nearly eight months ago, the initial presumption was that the United States had another WikiLeaks on its hands \xe2\x80\x94 a painful and embarrassing breach of confidentiality that would require fixing and explaining, but not necessarily changing, what the government was trying to do. Before long, however, the revelations about the extraordinary spread of the N.S.A.\xe2\x80\x99s global surveillance raised a host of questions about the balance of liberty and security at a time, as Mr. Obama put it, when \xe2\x80\x9cthere are fewer and fewer technical constraints on what we can do.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Much of the debate has swirled around legality, constitutionality and morality. But the questions underscored last week were more practical: Has the N.S.A.\xe2\x80\x99s vast sweep of phone records, and specifically those of its own citizens, made us safer? Can we trust the government and its network of private contractors with so much data?'b'One development was the revelation that Mr. Snowden\xe2\x80\x99s background had been vetted by a private firm contracted by the government to perform sensitive security checks, and that the company, 'b'U.S. Investigations Services'b', had submitted more than 650,000 incomplete investigations. It was not immediately known whether Mr. Snowden\xe2\x80\x99s background check was among the flawed ones, but it is noteworthy that Mr. Snowden was working for another private contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, at the time he took off for Hong Kong with his trove of secrets. The complaint filed by the United States government against USIS thus underscored how extensively the government relied on contractors not only to do its secret work, but also to vet those very contractors.'b'Even more damaging to the government\xe2\x80\x99s case was the 'b'report'b' of a bipartisan, independent agency within the executive branch, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, which declared that the N.S.A. program that collects data on nearly every American phone call is both illegal and not particularly useful. In its 238-page report, issued Thursday, the board called on the president to end the program for both constitutional and practical reasons. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have not identified a single instance involving a threat to the United States in which the program made a concrete difference in the outcome of a counterterrorism investigation,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote the board.'b'In his speech last week, Mr. Obama said he would restrict the access of intelligence agencies to phone records and eventually move the data out of the hands of the government. But it was clear that the need to set limits on governmental snooping, not only within the United States but also around the world, would be passionately debated for a long time to come.'b'That, in turn, is likely to intensify the debate over whether Mr. Snowden is a whistle-blower or traitor. On Thursday, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said that he was prepared to discuss how to handle the case against Mr. Snowden, but only if Mr. Snowden first returned from temporary refuge in Russia and pleaded guilty. A growing number of voices, including that of the Times editorial board, have urged the government to consider clemency.'b''b'Low Expectations in Syria'b''b'In Geneva, the Syrian government and the divided opposition opened the first round of what were loosely termed \xe2\x80\x9cnegotiations,\xe2\x80\x9d with expectations so low that the absence of an immediate collapse was deemed to be progress. And in a sense it was: Since the Arab Spring protests against President Bashar al-Assad began in March 2011, nothing seems to have helped slow the spread of a full-scale civil war. More than 130,000 Syrians have died, and around seven million have been driven from their homes.'b'The Geneva meeting was the product of a conference in June 2012, attended by both Russia and the United States, which set guidelines for the establishment of a \xe2\x80\x9ctransitional governing body\xe2\x80\x9d formed on the basis of \xe2\x80\x9cmutual consent\xe2\x80\x9d and including members of the government and the opposition. All participants have nominally agreed to this.'b'The trouble is that Mr. Assad\xe2\x80\x99s representatives insist that this means first discussing how to stop \xe2\x80\x9cterrorism,\xe2\x80\x9d a term they apply to all the insurgents seeking their ouster, both moderates and Al Qaeda-linked radicals. The opposition insists that the outcome must be ridding Syria of Mr. Assad, something his side declares \xe2\x80\x9ca red line.\xe2\x80\x9d And each side has its international sponsors.'b'So wide apart are the two sides that they gathered for the first meeting on Friday morning in two adjacent rooms, with Lakhdar Brahimi, a veteran United Nations diplomat, shuttling back and forth. And so turbulent were the talks that it was deemed a success when the negotiators agreed to continue on Saturday and to meet in the same room.'b''b'Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s Cold Standoff 'b''b'The two-month-old Ukrainian standoff between President Viktor F. Yanukovych and protesters furious at his rejection of closer ties to Europe was nowhere near as fearsome as Syria\xe2\x80\x99s, but last week it claimed its first fatalities when two men died of bullet wounds. That led to a meeting between the president and the three most prominent opposition leaders, which temporarily raised hopes of a resolution to the conflict \xe2\x80\x94 hopes that fizzled when, after the talks, protests spread to some other cities.'b'For now, Mr. Yanukovych has shown no readiness to make any concessions, and the protesters have defied bitter cold and threatening new laws to maintain their camp on Kiev\xe2\x80\x99s Independence Square. With every passing day, a violent drive by security forces to clear the square becomes more likely.'b'Last week, the United States canceled the visas of some Ukrainian officials involved in earlier crackdowns on protesters \xe2\x80\x94 a move that implied a threat of even tighter sanctions against specific members of the government should there be greater violence. But beyond that, the West has been largely relegated to watching and waiting.'b'The alarming discovery that 'b'hackers stole'b' the credit card and personal information of tens of millions of Americans from Target\xe2\x80\x99s computers is yet another reminder of human vulnerability in the digital age. The more practical and immediate lesson, however, is that retailers, banks and other corporations can do far more than they have done so far to protect customers from identity theft and financial fraud.'b'At last count, hackers had stolen the credit or debit card information of 40 million Target shoppers, as well as information like the names, addresses and email addresses of 70 million customers. Though the company has said little about how its system might have been compromised, experts say the attackers, who may have been based in Russia, inserted 'b'malicious software'b' into Target\xe2\x80\x99s poorly secured systems during the holiday shopping season.'b'It was the latest in a series of high-profile attacks against retailers like T.J. Maxx and companies that process card payments like Heartland Payment Systems.'b'Many of the stolen card numbers have been showing up on black markets where such information is traded. Some Target shoppers have had to deal with fraudulent charges. Experts warn that things could get worse when criminals start using the personal information they\xe2\x80\x99ve stolen to try to commit identity theft by taking out loans and opening new credit card accounts in the names of Target customers.'b'Even as the investigation into the origins of the heist continues, Target and other companies must begin investing in better security measures to keep intruders out and start investing in software that will trigger alarms when it detects unauthorized access. A 'b'Verizon report'b' on data breaches found that nearly four-fifths of intrusions in 2012 were of \xe2\x80\x9clow difficulty,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning hackers found trespass remarkably easy.'b'Companies also need to think carefully about what data they are collecting and storing. By keeping lots of sensitive information, they place themselves and their customers at considerable \xe2\x80\x94 and in some cases unnecessarily greater \xe2\x80\x94 risk than if they had deleted the data or never collected it. To take one startling example, security experts say there was absolutely no reason for Target to have stored the four-digit personal identification numbers, or PINs, of their customers\xe2\x80\x99 debit cards. (Target says the codes were kept in an encrypted file, but hackers have broken open encrypted documents before.)'b'Retailers and banks can also reduce risk by moving away from cards that use magnetic strips, which are easily faked. Many countries in Europe, Asia and elsewhere have already replaced magnetic strips with chips, which are harder to duplicate. Chip-based cards also require customers to enter a secure code before they can be used. That\xe2\x80\x99s partly why the United States 'b'accounts for'b' nearly half of all global credit card fraud, even though it generates only about a quarter of all credit card spending. American retailers, including Target, 'b'have resisted'b' (foolishly, as it turns out) the introduction of chip-based cards because they would have to invest in new equipment to handle them. (Target now says it supports chip-based cards.)'b'No security measure will ever rid the economy of theft and fraud completely. But there is evidence that companies could do a lot more to protect data.'b'Only a few weeks into this midterm election year, the right-wing political zeppelin is fully inflated with secret cash and is firing malicious falsehoods at supporters of health care reform.'b'As Carl Hulse of The Times 'b'reported recently'b', Democrats have been staggered by a $20 million advertising blitz produced by Americans for Prosperity, the conservative advocacy group organized and financed by the Koch brothers, billionaire industrialists. The ads take aim at House and Senate candidates for re-election who have supported the health law, and blame them for the hyped-up problems with the law\xe2\x80\x99s rollout that now seem to be the sole plank in this year\xe2\x80\x99s Republican platform.'b'In one typical example, the group\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'ad against Representative Gary Peters'b' of Michigan, a Democrat who is running for an open Senate seat, is full of distortions and lies. It accuses Mr. Peters of lying when he said the law bars cancellations of insurance policies. Mr. Peters happened to be right, as millions of people who once faced losing all insurance after they got sick now appreciate. The 225,000 Michigan residents who the ad said received \xe2\x80\x9ccancellation notices\xe2\x80\x9d were actually told that they could change to a better policy; they were not told they could no longer have insurance, as the ad implies. And though the ad said health care costs are \xe2\x80\x9cskyrocketing,\xe2\x80\x9d national spending on health care is now growing 'b'at the slowest pace ever recorded'b', in part because of the reform law.'b'Democrats intend to counter this campaign with the facts, but few of the candidates have the money to do so now. As a result, the campaign is taking a serious political toll, increasing the chances that Republicans who support a repeal of the law will win back the Senate majority this fall.'b'Naturally, Democrats are using the campaign to increase their own fund-raising, begging donors to give unlimited amounts to left-leaning super PACs and advocacy groups. But it is unlikely that they will be able to match the resources or the cunning of the Kochs, who are using vast pools of money earned through corporate revenues to build a network unrivaled in complexity and secrecy. This weekend, they are bringing together some of the biggest Republican bank accounts at a resort in Palm Springs, Calif., to collect money and plan this year\xe2\x80\x99s strategy.'b'As 'b'Politico described it'b' on Friday, they have already set up an operation so sophisticated it rivals \xe2\x80\x9ceven the official Republican Party in its ability to shape policy debates and elections.\xe2\x80\x9d Its components include a political consulting firm to recruit, train and support like-minded antigovernment candidates, which will be active in the congressional primaries. There is also a center that provides technology and administrative services to right-wing groups and candidates, an office that compiles and analyzes voter data and a youth advocacy group.'b'In 2012, 'b'as The Washington Post reported,'b' the Koch network raised $407 million, which was secreted among 17 groups with cryptic names and purposes that were designed to make it impossible to figure out the names of donors the Kochs worked with. As one tax expert told The Post, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s designed to make it opaque as to where the money is coming from and where the money is going.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Democrats have smaller versions of these operations, though they are more focused on building 'b'a super PAC to collect unlimited donations supporting Hillary Rodham Clinton'b' in 2016, and they lack the resources to compete with the Kochs at this stage.'b'The clandestine influence of the Kochs and their Palm Springs friends would be much reduced if they were forced to play in the sunshine.'b'The Internal Revenue Service and several lawmakers are beginning to step up their interest in preventing \xe2\x80\x9csocial welfare\xe2\x80\x9d organizations and other tax-sheltered groups from being used as political conduits, but they have encountered the usual resistance from Republican lawmakers. Considering how effectively the Koch brothers are doing their job, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to see why.'b'Yancey Strickler is the chief executive of the crowdfunding site 'b'Kickstarter'b', which raises more than $1 million a day to pay for various posted projects.'b''b'READING'b' I just finished and loved 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSeveral Short Sentences About Writing,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' by Verlyn Klinkenborg.

Then conservatives point out that a major predictor of poverty is family instability, and that one of the biggest boosts to opportunity comes from having married parents.'b'Then liberals retort: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, the best way to help families is to make sure they have more money. And what\xe2\x80\x99s the alternative \xe2\x80\x94 having divorced politicians hector poor women about their choices?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Thanks to 'b'sweeping new research'b' on American mobility, we can have this predictable debate again. Conservatives can 'b'highlight the strong correlation'b' in the research between two-parent families and upward mobility \xe2\x80\x94 stronger than for variables like racial segregation and economic inequality. And liberals can 'b'dismiss marriage promotion'b' as a chimerical goal, and double down on redistribution.'b'Or both sides could be a bit more honest about the roots of marriage\xe2\x80\x99s decline.'b'Honesty from conservatives would begin by acknowledging that policies championed on the right \xe2\x80\x94 mass incarceration in response to the post-1960s crime wave, Bain Capital-style \xe2\x80\x9ccreative destruction\xe2\x80\x9d in response to Carter-era stagnation \xe2\x80\x94 have often made it harder for low-income men to find steady work and stay out of prison, and made women understandably wary of marrying them.'b'Then this honesty would continue with a concession that certain kinds of redistribution \xe2\x80\x94 especially if tied to wage-earning \xe2\x80\x94 might help make men more marriageable, families more stable, and touch off a virtuous interaction between the financial and the personal.'b'Right now, I think some conservatives \xe2\x80\x94 though not enough Republican politicians \xe2\x80\x94 are willing to concede these points. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t see a readiness among liberals to make any concessions of their own, beyond the minimal acknowledgment that all things being equal, two parents are often better than one.'b'A more significant concession would be to acknowledge the ways in which liberalism itself has undercut the two-parent family \xe2\x80\x94 through the 'b'liberal-dominated culture industry\xe2\x80\x99s 'b' permissive, reductive attitudes toward sex, and through the 1970s-era revolution in divorce and abortion law.'b'In the first case, liberals tend to feign agnosticism about 'b'pop culture\xe2\x80\x99s impact'b' on morals (even though a link is common-sensical and well supported), or to blame corporate capitalism for the entertainment industry\xe2\x80\x99s exploitative tendencies (as though the overwhelmingly liberal people making programming decisions had no agency of their own).'b'In the case of abortion and divorce, liberals expected their revolution to, if anything, stabilize the family \xe2\x80\x94 by reducing unwanted births and dissolving only marriages that had failed in all but name.'b'But these expectations were na\xc3\xafve. As Janet Yellen and George Akerlof 'b'pointed out'b' in a 1996 paper on the social impact of abortion and contraception, the power Roe v. Wade gave women over reproduction sometimes came at the expense of power in relationships. \xe2\x80\x9cBy making the birth of the child the physical choice of the mother,\xe2\x80\x9d they noted, the sexual revolution \xe2\x80\x9cmade marriage and child support a social choice of the father.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In this new landscape, \xe2\x80\x9cwomen who wanted children, who did not want an abortion for moral or religious reasons, or who were unreliable in their use of contraception\xe2\x80\x9d saw their partners\xe2\x80\x99 incentives altered for the worse. The result was a world with plenty of unplanned pregnancies but fewer ensuing marriages, fewer involved fathers, more unstable homes.'b'Meanwhile, no-fault divorce probably contributed to the unexpected \xe2\x80\x9c'b'social contagion'b'\xe2\x80\x9d effect of the divorce revolution, in which the example of a marital split undermines marriages across a social network. And it created new reasons to delay marriage in the first place, given the risk of investing in a venture that could be unilaterally dissolved.'b'Many marriages, especially in the upper-middle class, were strengthened by caution and delay. But for couples with more limited resources, and more to lose from failure, 'b'no-fault divorce'b' may have 'b'reduced'b' the value of the institution and the sacrifices embraced on its behalf.'b'When liberals claim social conservatives don\xe2\x80\x99t have any policy ideas for marriage promotion, then, they\xe2\x80\x99re somewhat self-deceived. A sustained conservative shift on abortion policy and marriage law probably would, over the long term, increase the rate at which couples take vows and stay together, and improve the life prospects of their children.'b'So one hypothetical middle ground on marriage promotion might involve wage subsidies 'b'and'b' modest limits on unilateral divorce, or a jobs program 'b'and'b' a second-trimester abortion ban.'b'The chances of liberals embracing this hypothetical are ... nonexistent. Which is fair enough \xe2\x80\x94 the belief that some personal liberties are nonnegotiable whatever their policy implications is obviously sincerely held, and I can respect a worldview that privileges moral absolutes over social science evidence.'b'But the evidence remains. And so, for families and children, do the consequences.'b'IF you\xe2\x80\x99re confused about all the turmoil in the Arab world and asking how the United States should respond, I find it useful to consider three questions:'b'1) Why is it that the Arab awakening country where the U.S. has had the least involvement, Tunisia, is where the most progress is being made toward building a consensual democracy? 2) Why are the three most important numbers to keep in mind when thinking about the Arab world today 1, 5,000 and 500,000? 3) Why does Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s strongman, Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, have so many medals on his chest when he\xe2\x80\x99s too young to have fought in any of Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s big wars, and why might that be a worrying sign?'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with Tunisia, where the country\xe2\x80\x99s National Constituent Assembly has forged a new Constitution that, 'b'as The Times reported'b', \xe2\x80\x9cis a carefully worded blend of ideas that has won the support of both Ennahda, the Islamist party ... and the secular opposition.\xe2\x80\x9d It is surely one of the most liberal and inclusive constitutions in the Arab world. It took three years of political struggles for the Tunisians to get there, and the whole thing could still blow up at any time, but it is an achievement that Tunisians basically did on their own. What\xe2\x80\x99s the secret?'b'Answer: The main religious and secular forces in Tunisia, after coming close to civil war, finally agreed to the sine qua non for the success of any Arab democracy movement \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cNo victor, no vanquished.\xe2\x80\x9d Whether you\xe2\x80\x99re talking Shiites, Sunnis, Alawites, Kurds, tribes, Islamists or secular generals, in these pluralistic Arab states, unless all the key parties accept the principle that power will be shared and rotated, there is no chance any of these awakenings will make a stable transition from autocracy to more consensual politics.'b'But Tunisians had another advantage, says Craig Charney, a veteran pollster in South Africa and the Middle East. Tunisia \xe2\x80\x9calready had strong civil society institutions\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 like the General Labor Union, the National Business Federation, the Tunisian Bar Association and the Tunisian Human Rights League. These institutions, explained Charney, \xe2\x80\x9cwere able to play a nonpartisan moderating role between the different political factions.\xe2\x80\x9d And, unlike Egypt, Tunisia also did not have a politicized military with deep roots in the economy that had incentives to meddle in the political arena. Syria, Libya and Iraq had no real civil society institutions at all.'b'And that leads to those numbers. When people in a country are ready to live together, you just need one Nelson Mandela \xe2\x80\x94 a unifying leader \xe2\x80\x94 to galvanize the political system to work productively. When people are not ready to live together but are ready to live apart \xe2\x80\x94 as in Bosnia or Lebanon after years of civil war \xe2\x80\x94 you just need 5,000 peacekeepers to police the de facto or de jure lines of partition. But when people are not ready to live together or apart \xe2\x80\x94 because of a lack of trust, lack of exhaustion or one or all parties still think they can have it all \xe2\x80\x94 then you probably need 500,000 peacekeepers to come in, remove the dictator, eliminate the most extreme elements on all sides, and protect the center for a long time while it forges a new citizenship and party system able to share power. Even then, failure is a real option.'b'In short, what ails the Arab world is something we alone can\xe2\x80\x99t fix: an inability to manage pluralism in a democratic way. We can stop the worst of it as long as we are there (see: Iraq). But only they can make the best of it \xe2\x80\x94 and make it self-sustaining. President Bashar al-Assad of Syria is a monster. But he can only be removed in a way that won\xe2\x80\x99t bring more chaos if the Syrian opposition can demonstrate on the ground that it not only believes in pluralism, but has the will and ability to enforce it. Otherwise, the Syrian minorities gathered around Assad will not abandon him. Everyone urging President Obama to intervene in Syria needs to keep all this in mind.'b'As for Egypt, I had no sympathy for the Muslim Brotherhood leaders. I wish they had been voted out office, but I understood why so many Egyptians wanted the army to get rid of them. Yet, when the army also decided to arrest decent, nonviolent, civil society youth leaders \xe2\x80\x94 like Ahmed Maher \xe2\x80\x94 for simply protesting, and eliminated the Muslim Brotherhood from Egyptian political life, not even allowing the Brotherhood to play by new restrictive rules, it felt like a return to the old model of relying on a military strongman and producing stability through suppression, not inclusion.'b'I hope I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong, but I worry. Wikipedia 'b'has a list of General Sisi\xe2\x80\x99s medals'b'. They include things like the Silver Jubilee of October [1973] War Medal and the Golden Jubilee of the 23rd of July [1953] Revolution. They fall into the category of looking for dignity in all the wrong places \xe2\x80\x94 celebrating Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s past, not winning its future. When General Sisi announces that the medals he will henceforth seek are for defeating Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s real enemies \xe2\x80\x94 like wiping out female illiteracy \xe2\x80\x94 or for building more science and technology high schools or for building a truly inclusive political system, I\xe2\x80\x99ll become a fan. And the day he starts pinning medals on other Egyptians for their leadership in those same causes, Egypt will be a strong nation that won\xe2\x80\x99t need a strongman.\xc2\xa0'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s rare to hear politicians at the national level discuss sexual violence. It\xe2\x80\x99s even rarer to hear them discuss it with real sensitivity. Yet President Obama and Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. managed exactly that last Wednesday, when they announced a 'b'task force'b' on campus rape \xe2\x80\x94 an area of particular concern. A 2007 study found that one in five women had been sexually assaulted in college.'b'The administration has addressed this issue before. In 2011, the Department of Education\xe2\x80\x99s Office for Civil Rights 'b'sent a letter'b' to colleges explaining that sexual violence is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX. And Mr. Biden\xe2\x80\x99s dedication to combating sexual assault is well established; he drafted the Violence Against Women Act in 1994. On Wednesday, though, the president and vice president distinguished themselves not just by what they said but by 'b'how they said it'b'.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOur daughters, our sisters, our wives, our mothers, our grandmothers have every single right to expect to be free from violence and sexual abuse,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Biden said. \xe2\x80\x9cNo matter what she\xe2\x80\x99s wearing, no matter whether she\xe2\x80\x99s in a bar, in a dormitory, in the back seat of a car, on a street, drunk or sober \xe2\x80\x94 no man has a right to go beyond the word \xe2\x80\x98no.\xe2\x80\x99 And if she can\xe2\x80\x99t consent, it also means no.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He added: \xe2\x80\x9cMen have to step up to the bar here. Men have to take more responsibility. Men have to intervene.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Obama also emphasized male accountability: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to keep teaching young men in particular to show women the respect they deserve and to recognize sexual violence and be outraged by it, and to do their part to stop it from happening in the first place.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Cynics might dismiss these remarks as focus-group pablum. But it\xe2\x80\x99s no small thing for two men in power to speak inoffensively on such a delicate topic, avoiding victim-blaming and callousness.'b'Just over a year ago, Richard Mourdock of Indiana, who was then a Republican candidate for the Senate, 'b'described pregnancy resulting from rape'b' as \xe2\x80\x9csomething that God intended to happen.\xe2\x80\x9d And Representative Todd Akin of Missouri, another failed Republican Senate hopeful, said he thought abortion should be illegal even in cases of rape because \xe2\x80\x9cif it\xe2\x80\x99s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When it comes to sexual violence, tone matters. A 'b'new report'b' on rape and sexual assault from the White House Council on Women and Girls notes that if men believe that their peers accept abusive behavior, they\xe2\x80\x99re less likely to intervene. Conversely, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen men speak out against abuse, other men are more likely to step in to neutralize a risky situation and prevent an assault.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Readers respond to a column that said many students today don\xe2\x80\x99t make the effort to excel.'b'\xc2\xa0'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Homework Assignment'b',\xe2\x80\x9d by Thomas L.

Chris Christie of New Jersey, in a Jan. 9 news conference.'b''b' 'b''b''b'FINAL REPORT OF A TRAFFIC STUDY CONDUCTED AT THE FORT LEE, N.J., APPROACH TO THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE, SEPT. 9-12, 2013'b''b'\xc2\xb6 'b'Object of the study.'b' The study was designed to ascertain the effect on traffic if two out of three tollbooths at the Fort Lee, N.J., approach to the George Washington Bridge were closed.'b'\xc2\xb6 'b'Study designer.'b' The traffic study was designed by Duane C. Milledge, Ph.D. Dr. Milledge was most recently the designer of a traffic study submitted to the agency that operates the two bridges that cross the Missouri River near downtown Kansas City, Mo. The design for that study calls for furnishing commuters on one bridge with $20 bills and instructions to say to the toll taker, \xe2\x80\x9cSorry, it\xe2\x80\x99s the smallest I\xe2\x80\x99ve got,\xe2\x80\x9d collecting no tolls on the other bridge, and observing the result. Dr. Milledge is a member of the American Association of Traffic Engineers, a contributor to Queue Quarterly, and a Republican precinct captain in Summit, N.J.'b'\xc2\xb6 'b'Hypotheses.'b' The principal hypothesis of the study was that the tollbooth closings might ease traffic flow onto the bridge, due to fewer cars from Fort Lee being able to gain bridge access.'b'Additionally, it was hypothesized that, if the two \xe2\x80\x9cextra\xe2\x80\x9d tollbooths were closed for an extended period of time, getting onto the bridge could prove so onerous for automobile commuters from Fort Lee that many of them might turn to public transportation or simply give up their jobs, thus ameliorating traffic congestion on the bridge on a more long-term basis.'b'\xc2\xb6 'b'Additional benefits that might accrue if the two tollbooths were closed permanently.'b' It was posited that the space occupied by the two tollbooths in question might more efficaciously serve the revenue-flow needs of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey through a use other than collecting tolls \xe2\x80\x94 for instance, concessioning them out as a Shake Shack or a retail outlet for selling such souvenirs as George Washington Bridge coffee mugs, Springsteen memorabilia and CDs of Don Imus drive-time radio shows from the \xe2\x80\x9980s.'b'\xc2\xb6 'b'Methdology.'b' The methodology of the study was to shut down two out of three tollbooths and see what happened.'b'\xc2\xb6 'b'Interaction of researchers and commuters.'b' The research team had no problem collecting data from individual drivers waiting to go through the one open lane, since their cars were virtually stationary. There were only 14 instances of violence directed at the survey takers, almost all of which consisted of commuters throwing coffee from travel mugs or paper cups. Fortunately, no researcher was scalded, since the drivers had been waiting so long that their coffee was cold.'b'With the permission of Dr. Milledge, Cpl. Vincent Sicola, of the Port Authority Police Department, who is taking courses in anthropology at Seton Hall University, collected data on what commuters said to researchers and to other people who seemed to have some connection to the Port Authority. Corporal Sicola found that 58 percent of the motorists in line shouted some imprecation, ranging from the sort often heard in the stress of a rush-hour subway or an overcrowded emergency room (e.g., \xe2\x80\x9cYou people should burn in hell\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cYou can take your study and stick it where the sun don\xe2\x80\x99t shine\xe2\x80\x9d) to rare curses, presumably ethnic in origin (e.g., \xe2\x80\x9cMay streetcars grow on the back of your throat\xe2\x80\x9d).'b'\xc2\xb6 'b'Findings.'b' No reliable statistics were gathered on the question of how commuters felt about using the two \xe2\x80\x9cextra\xe2\x80\x9d tollbooths for something other than collecting tolls. After it became clear that questions on various options were likely to draw curses or violence, researchers were, as a safety measure, told to avoid the subject.'b'By Day 3 of the study, traffic going from New Jersey to New York on the George Washington Bridge had been reduced by 6 percent, a figure that had increased approximately 1 percent a day. Although some had predicted a spate of reckless driving when desperately late commuters finally gained access to the bridge, such driving occurred only sporadically. None of the injuries were considered life threatening.'b'As to the question of whether long delays at the approach would eventually discourage Fort Lee commuters from using the bridge, the study unfortunately ended on the fourth day, well before reliable statistics on this hypothesis could be accumulated. This was due to the intervention of Patrick Foye, executive director of the Port Authority, who on Sept. 12 ordered the two closed lanes reopened, without consulting Dr. Milledge.'b'\xc2\xb6 'b'Recommendations.'b' We recommend a follow-up study. To obtain reliable statistics on what is required to discourage use of the bridge to a point of reducing bridge traffic flow on a long-term basis, the lane closings should be at least two weeks in duration, with unlimited options for extensions. The methodology to be used is described at length in Dr. Milledge\xe2\x80\x99s book, \xe2\x80\x9cNo Pain, No Gain: A New Approach to Traffic Studies.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'IF you think that protests about overzealous law enforcement are over the top, listen to what unfolded when the police suspected that David Eckert, 54, was hiding drugs in his rectum.'b'Eckert is a shy junk dealer struggling to get by in Hidalgo County, N.M. He lives a working-class life, drives a 16-year-old pickup and was convicted in 2008 of methamphetamine possession.'b'Police officers, suspecting he might still be involved in drugs, 'b'asked him to step out of his pickup early last year'b' after stopping him for a supposed traffic violation. No drugs or weapons were found on Eckert or in his truck, but a police dog showed interest in the vehicle and an officer wrote that Eckert\xe2\x80\x99s posture was \xe2\x80\x9cerect and he kept his legs together.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That led the police to speculate that he might be hiding drugs internally, so they took him in handcuffs to a nearby hospital emergency room and asked the doctor, Adam Ash, to conduct a forcible search of his rectum. Dr. Ash refused, saying it would be unethical.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was pretty sure it was the wrong thing to do,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Ash told me. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not medically indicated.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Eckert, protesting all the while, says he asked to make a phone call but was told that he had no right to do so because he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t actually been arrested. The police then drove Eckert 50 miles to the emergency room of 'b'the Gila Regional Medical Center'b', where doctors took X-rays of Eckert\xe2\x80\x99s abdomen and performed a rectal examination. No drugs were found, so doctors performed a second rectal exam, again unavailing.'b'Doctors then gave Eckert an enema and forced him to have a bowel movement in the presence of a nurse and policeman, according to a lawsuit that Eckert filed. When no narcotics were found, a second enema was administered. Then a third.'b'The police left the privacy curtain open, so that Eckert\xe2\x80\x99s searches were public, the lawsuit says.'b'After hours of fruitless searches, police and doctors arranged another X-ray and finally anesthetized Eckert and performed a colonoscopy.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNothing was found inside of Mr. Eckert,\xe2\x80\x9d the police report notes. So after he woke up, he was released \xe2\x80\x94 after 13 hours, two rectal exams, three enemas, two X-rays and a colonoscopy.'b'The hospital ended up billing Eckert $6,000.'b'When I came across this case, it seemed far-fetched to me \xe2\x80\x94 more like rape than law enforcement. But the authorities, hospital and doctors all refused to comment, and, a few days ago, the city and county settled the lawsuit by paying Eckert $1.6 million.'b'This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a unique case. A few months earlier, 'b'a man named Timothy Young who lives nearby says that police officers pulled him over'b', forcibly strip-searched him in a parking lot and then took him to a hospital for a forced X-ray and rectal examination while he was handcuffed. Nothing was found, so he was released \xe2\x80\x94 only to receive a hospital bill.'b'And a few weeks before Eckert\xe2\x80\x99s ordeal, 'b'a 54-year-old American woman crossing from Mexico into El Paso was strip-searched'b' and taken to the University Medical Center of El Paso. She says in a lawsuit that, over six hours, she was shackled to an examination table and subjected to rectal and vaginal examinations \xe2\x80\x94 with the door open to compound her humiliation. After a final X-ray and CT scan, all of which turned up nothing, she was released \xe2\x80\x94 and billed for the procedures.'b''b'Joseph P. Kennedy'b', Eckert\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, notes that such abuses are not random but are disproportionately directed at those on the bottom rungs of society. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a socioeconomic issue,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the indignities forced on people who are not articulate, not educated and don\xe2\x80\x99t have access to legal services.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Police are caught in a difficult balancing act, and obviously the abuse of Eckert isn\xe2\x80\x99t representative. But it is emblematic of something much larger in America, a kind of inequality that isn\xe2\x80\x99t economic and that we don\xe2\x80\x99t much talk about.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of inequality that lies behind police stops for \xe2\x80\x9cdriving while black,\xe2\x80\x9d or unequal implementation of stop-and-frisk policies, or \xe2\x80\x9czero tolerance\xe2\x80\x9d school discipline codes that lead many low-income children to be suspended.'b'This inequality has a racial element to it, but it is also about social class (Eckert is white but struggling financially). This is about Americans living in different worlds. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a middle-class reader, you probably see the justice system as protective. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a young man of color, you may see it as threatening.'b'So as we discuss inequality in America, let\xe2\x80\x99s remember that the divide is measured in more than dollars. It\xe2\x80\x99s also about something as fundamental as our dignity, our humanity and our access to justice; it\xe2\x80\x99s about the right of working stiffs not to endure forced colonoscopies.'b'WITH metronomic regularity, gauzy accounts extol the return of manufacturing jobs to the United States.'b'One day, it\xe2\x80\x99s Master Lock bringing combination lock fabrication back to Milwaukee from China.

This week, when President Obama gives his State of the Union address, he will most likely yet again stress his plans to strengthen our manufacturing base.'b'But we need to get real about the so-called renaissance, which has in reality been a trickle of jobs, often dependent on huge public subsidies. Most important, in order to compete with China and other low-wage countries, these new jobs offer less in health care, pension and benefits than industrial workers historically received.'b'In an 'b'article'b' in The Atlantic in 2012 about General Electric\xe2\x80\x99s decision to open its first new assembly line in 55 years in Louisville, Ky., it was not until deep in the story that readers learned that the jobs were starting at just over $13.50 an hour. That\xe2\x80\x99s less than $30,000 a year, hardly the middle-class life usually ascribed to manufacturing employment.'b'This disturbing trend is particularly pronounced in the automobile industry. When Volkswagen opened a plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., in 2011, the company was hailed for bringing around 2,000 fresh auto jobs to America. Little attention was paid to the fact that the beginning wage for assembly line workers was $14.50 per hour, about half of what traditional, unionized workers employed by General Motors or Ford received.'b'With benefits added in, those workers cost Volkswagen $27 per hour. Consider, though, that in Germany, the average autoworker earns $67 per hour. In effect, even factoring in future pay increases for the Chattanooga employees, Volkswagen has moved production from a high-wage country (Germany) to a low-wage country (the United States).'b'All told, wages for blue-collar automotive industry workers have dropped by 10 percent, after adjusting for inflation, since the recession ended in June 2009. By comparison, wages across manufacturing dropped by 2.4 percent during the same period, while earnings for Americans in equivalent private-sector jobs fell by \xe2\x80\x9conly\xe2\x80\x9d 0.5 percent. (To be fair, including benefits, compensation for manufacturing workers remains above that of service employees.)'b'These dispiriting wage trends are a central reason for the slow economic recovery; without sustained income growth, consumers can\xe2\x80\x99t spend.'b'Low wages are not the only price that America pays for its manufacturing \xe2\x80\x9crenaissance.\xe2\x80\x9d Hefty subsidies from federal, state and local government agencies often are required. Tennessee provided an estimated $577 million for Volkswagen \xe2\x80\x94 $288,500 per position! To get 1,000 Airbus jobs, Alabama assembled a benefits package of $158 million.'b'Now Boeing has just used the threat of moving to a nonunion, low-wage state to win both a record subsidy package \xe2\x80\x94 $8.7 billion from Washington State \xe2\x80\x94 and labor concessions.'b'Over objections from their local leadership, union workers approved a new contract that would freeze pensions in favor of less generous 401(k) plans, reduce health care benefits and provide for raises totaling just 4 percent over the eight-year term. (Boeing\xe2\x80\x99s stock price rose by over 80 percent last year.)'b'FOR all the hoopla, the United States has gained just 568,000 manufacturing positions since January 2010 \xe2\x80\x94 a small fraction of the nearly six million lost between 2000 and 2009. That\xe2\x80\x99s a slower rate of recovery than for nonmanufacturing employment. \xe2\x80\x9cWe find very little real evidence of a renaissance in U.S. manufacturing activity,\xe2\x80\x9d a recent Morgan Stanley report stated, echoing similar findings from Goldman Sachs.'b'If anything, the challenges to American manufacturing have grown, as less developed countries have become more adept. In Mexico, where each autoworker earned $7.80 per hour in 2012, auto industry officials say productivity is as high as in the United States, where total compensation costs were $45.34 per hour. No surprise then that in 2013, Mexican automobile production was 50 percent higher than seven years earlier, while output in the United States was at the same 2006 levels.'b'For the United States to remain competitive against countries like Mexico, productivity must continue to rise. But unlike past gains in productivity, these improvements in efficiency are not being passed along to workers.'b'And these necessary productivity gains often take the place of hiring more workers; the United States remains the world leader in agriculture while employing less than 2 percent of Americans.'b'Advanced manufacturing \xe2\x80\x94 a sector that many advocate as a path for the United States to remain relevant at making things \xe2\x80\x94 also involves a high degree of efficiency, meaning not as many hires and particularly, not as many of those old-fashioned, middle-class, assemble-a-thousand-pieces jobs.'b'Moreover, the lead that the United States has in some advanced manufacturing areas \xe2\x80\x94 notably aerospace \xe2\x80\x94 is being compromised by growing capabilities of workers elsewhere. Bombardier is now assembling Learjets in Mexico, and later this year Cessna will start delivering Citation XLS+ business jets that were put together in China.'b'Similarly, while America\xe2\x80\x99s energy boom will provide an incentive for manufacturers to locate here, don\xe2\x80\x99t count on cheap natural gas to fuel an employment boom. According to a 2009 study, only one-tenth of American manufacturing involved significant energy costs.'b'While we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect manufacturing to save our economy, we needn\xe2\x80\x99t despair. Among other things, we need to get over the notion that service jobs are invariably inferior. The United States remains a world leader in service industries like education and medicine. Not only do these fields generate well-paying jobs, but they also help with our balance of trade: when foreigners come to America to be educated or treated, those services are tallied as exports.'b'Manufacturing has been an emotional American touchstone since George Washington wore a wool suit that had been woven in Hartford, Conn., to his first inauguration to illustrate the importance of making stuff at home. We do need to maintain an industrial presence, but perhaps not for the obvious reasons.'b'For one thing, companies often locate research and development facilities \xe2\x80\x94 stuffed with high-paying jobs \xe2\x80\x94 near their manufacturing facilities. In addition to jobs, R&amp;D yields high-value intellectual property that spills over into still more innovation and employment. And not surprisingly, every manufacturing position requires an additional 4.6 service and supplier positions to support it.'b'The challenge for the United States is particularly acute because manufacturing now accounts for just 12 percent of our economy, down from a peak of 28 percent in 1953 and on a par with France and Britain as the least industrialized of major economies.'b'While keeping that share from dipping further should be a priority, we should be careful to avoid raising false hopes (like Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s unrealistic second-term goal of creating a million manufacturing jobs) and pursuing ill-conceived policies (such as special subsidies for manufacturing).'b'The president\xe2\x80\x99s proposals \xe2\x80\x94 unveiled over the last several years \xe2\x80\x94 include the two most important elements of a sensible manufacturing strategy: more training focused on the skills needed by employers and increased spending on research and development.'b'The United States work force is simultaneously overqualified (15 percent of taxi drivers are college graduates) and underqualified (we rank in the bottom half of many comparisons of developed countries).'b'When Volkswagen arrived in Chattanooga, it found that not enough eager applicants had the requisite technical skills, so it established a German-style training system (including three-year apprenticeships) at the factory.'b'As for research and development, the fiscal tightening by the federal government has prevented more investment in this critical area, the exact opposite of what is required. At the same time, while subsidies to draw jobs have become a necessary evil, we should be rigorous about analyzing the value of these costs. And we must stop short of excessive meddling in the private sector, and particularly the notion of picking winners. (Think Solyndra or Fisker.)'b'Mr. Obama skirted this problem by proposing to create 45 \xe2\x80\x9cmanufacturing innovation institutes,\xe2\x80\x9d which bring together companies, universities and government experts in a kind of laboratory setting to help develop advanced manufacturing strategies.'b'While these institutes are not going to turn the tide, they might help at the margin. But like the president\xe2\x80\x99s other proposals, they have been largely ignored by Congress. (The White House managed to establish a pilot center in Youngstown, Ohio, and another is coming in Charlotte, N.C.)'b'Manufacturing would benefit from the same reforms that would help the broader economy: restructuring of our loophole-ridden corporate tax code, new policies to bring in skilled immigrants, added spending on infrastructure and, yes, more trade agreements to encourage foreign direct investment and help get closer to Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s seemingly unattainable goal of doubling our exports.'b'Those who see a brighter manufacturing picture for the United States argue that wages are rising more rapidly elsewhere, not just in China and Brazil but also in Japan, Germany and France. But just like the \xe2\x80\x9cfeel good\xe2\x80\x9d stories, celebrating this fact ignores the reality that the flip side of wages\xe2\x80\x99 rising faster elsewhere means they are rising more slowly here.'b'And that is the essence of our challenge: In a flattened world, there will always be another China.'b'DENVER \xe2\x80\x94 SO you want to get high in a high-end way in the Mile High City.'b'You could call Dale Dyke and his wife, Chastity Osborn, a massage therapist, who run Get High Getaways.

Today it has 105.'b'What is most striking about this year\xe2\x80\x99s class isn\xe2\x80\x99t its size, but its composition. Though students come from places as diverse as India and Turkey, one group of foreigners stands out: Chinese students make up almost 30 percent, the largest group by nationality behind the French. Their American classmates comprise less than 4 percent.'b'Meanwhile, the Burgundy Business School in Dijon has also recorded a rise in Chinese students in its wine management programs. Between 2009 and 2012, Chinese students made up barely 10 percent of the graduate ranks; now, 33 of this year\xe2\x80\x99s 100 students hail from China.'b'Wine has always been an essential part of the French tradition, both culturally and economically, but the world\xe2\x80\x99s growing middle class has made it a global one: worldwide wine consumption is expected to grow almost 9 percent, to $182 billion, by 2016, with a large chunk of the demand coming from China.'b'Some in France, however, view this development with unease, which has at times exploded into violent xenophobia. In August a group of Frenchmen assaulted a group of Chinese oenology students at a wine school in nearby Sauternes, sending several to the hospital.'b'Along with a general fear of change within the centuries-old wine world, there is concern that China, with its huge population and geography, could someday eclipse France\xe2\x80\x99s place in wine production. Some even fear that these students could mark the first stage of a Chinese takeover of the French wine industry, buying up vineyards in the same way the country bought up huge tracts of Africa.'b'Such concerns are misplaced. Not only does the explosion in China\xe2\x80\x99s interest in wine bode well for the French economy, but the connections built between French vintners and their Chinese students will pay enormous cultural dividends for both countries.'b'Most people are surprised to learn that China already has a strong winemaking tradition. Indeed, many of the students at the French schools are working at the graduate level, having already completed undergraduate courses in oenology back home.'b'One student in Bordeaux, Zhang Xuan, began his wine studies in one of the new oenology programs at China\xe2\x80\x99s Northwest University of Agriculture and Forestry, in the central Chinese city of Yangling, and later interned with a Chinese winery before coming to France.'b'Others grew up working on their family\xe2\x80\x99s vineyards, or selling wine at a family-owned shop.'b'Whatever their background, most of them plan to return to China after their studies \xe2\x80\x94 and to take their new, French-inflected skills with them. Another Bordeaux student, Wu Zhaolong, discovered his passion for wine while working in the hotel and restaurant industry in Shanghai. He plans to go into restaurant management, integrating French food and wine styles with traditional Shanghainese dining.'b'As they move on, they will take along a respect for French culture, which they will later share with their co-workers and customers, in much the same way that the French winemaking know-how imported to California in the 1950s and \xe2\x80\x9960s helped initiate a new wave of interest in French cuisine and culture nationwide.'b'At the same time, these students will build strong binational business relationships: Zhu Qiyao, who ran a wine sales company in Hangzhou before coming to Bordeaux, wants to perfect her wine-negotiation skills and expand her business network before returning to China.'b'But the real benefit for France, and one that these students will help strengthen, is economic. French wine already accounts for 48 percent of Chinese wine imports, and Bordeaux\xe2\x80\x99s reds are a particular favorite of the Chinese elite.'b'And the Chinese market can only grow. A report presented last summer at Bordeaux\xe2\x80\x99s enormous VinExpo predicted that Chinese wine consumption would grow 40 percent from 2012 to 2016. And Chinese drinkers don\xe2\x80\x99t want plonk: While China ranks only 20th in per capita wine consumption, it ranks fourth in terms of the value of the wine it consumes.'b'A good bit of this demand will be met domestically, of course: China is already the fifth-largest wine-producing nation, and France\xe2\x80\x99s Center for Scientific Research recently predicted that it would double its production in five years.'b'Some in France fear that China\xe2\x80\x99s growing love of wine will drive wealthy Chinese investors to gobble up French vineyards. Chinese have been snatching up Bordeaux chateaus at roughly one a month. Last year a Chinese industrialist raised alarms in Bordeaux after buying a top-class, or grand cru, wine producer, Ch\xc3\xa2teau Bellefont-Belcier.'b'But such concerns are overblown. With upward of 8,000 properties, there are still plenty of French-owned vineyards. And there has been plenty of investment in the other direction.'b'In the last few years, many renowned French wine companies have rushed to open joint-venture vineyards and wineries in China. In July, Mo\xc3\xabt Hennessy\xe2\x80\x99s Chandon subsidiary opened its Ningxia Winery in central China, which will be dedicated to producing sparkling wine. Not far away, Pernod Ricard, a renowned wine producer, recently took over another large winery, Helan Mountain.'b'Globalization is reshaping every industry, even one as hidebound as French wine. But its partisans should be more optimistic. Far from destroying French wine traditions, forces of globalization, even one as large and powerful as China, can only help them.'b'And in any case, at least some in Bordeaux are keeping their prejudices closer to home. As one leading vintner said wryly, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care who buys these chateaus, as long as they are not from Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A SEEMINGLY un-American fact about America today is that for some groups, much more than others, upward mobility and the American dream are alive and well. It may be taboo to say it, but certain ethnic, religious and national-origin groups are doing strikingly better than Americans overall.'b'Indian-Americans earn almost double the national figure (roughly $90,000 per year in median household income versus $50,000). Iranian-, Lebanese- and Chinese-Americans are also top-earners. In the last 30 years, Mormons have become leaders of corporate America, holding top positions in many of America\xe2\x80\x99s most recognizable companies. These facts don\xe2\x80\x99t make some groups \xe2\x80\x9cbetter\xe2\x80\x9d than others, and material success cannot be equated with a well-lived life. But willful blindness to facts is never a good policy.'b'Jewish success is the most historically fraught and the most broad-based. Although Jews make up only about 2 percent of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 adult population, they account for a third of the current Supreme Court; over two-thirds of Tony Award-winning lyricists and composers; and about a third of American Nobel laureates.'b'The most comforting explanation of these facts is that they are mere artifacts of class \xe2\x80\x94 rich parents passing on advantages to their children \xe2\x80\x94 or of immigrants arriving in this country with high skill and education levels. Important as these factors are, they explain only a small part of the picture.'b'Today\xe2\x80\x99s wealthy Mormon businessmen often started from humble origins. Although India and China send the most immigrants to the United States through employment-based channels, almost half of all Indian immigrants and over half of Chinese immigrants do not enter the country under those criteria. Many are poor and poorly educated. Comprehensive data published by the Russell Sage Foundation in 2013 showed that the children of Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese immigrants experienced exceptional upward mobility regardless of their parents\xe2\x80\x99 socioeconomic or educational background.'b'Take New York City\xe2\x80\x99s selective public high schools like Stuyvesant and Bronx Science, which are major Ivy League feeders. For the 2013 school year, Stuyvesant High School offered admission, based solely on a standardized entrance exam, to nine black students, 24 Hispanics, 177 whites and 620 Asians. Among the Asians of Chinese origin, many are the children of restaurant workers and other working-class immigrants.'b'Merely stating the fact that certain groups do better than others \xe2\x80\x94 as measured by income, test scores and so on \xe2\x80\x94 is enough to provoke a firestorm in America today, and even charges of racism. The irony is that the facts actually debunk racial stereotypes.'b'There are some black and Hispanic groups in America that far outperform some white and Asian groups. Immigrants from many West Indian and African countries, such as Jamaica, Ghana, and Haiti, are climbing America\xe2\x80\x99s higher education ladder, but perhaps the most prominent are Nigerians. Nigerians make up less than 1 percent of the black population in the United States, yet in 2013 nearly one-quarter of the black students at Harvard Business School were of Nigerian ancestry; over a fourth of Nigerian-Americans have a graduate or professional degree, as compared with only about 11 percent of whites.'b'Cuban-Americans in Miami rose in one generation from widespread penury to relative affluence. By 1990, United States-born Cuban children \xe2\x80\x94 whose parents had arrived as exiles, many with practically nothing \xe2\x80\x94 were twice as likely as non-Hispanic whites to earn over $50,000 a year. All three Hispanic United States senators are Cuban-Americans.'b'Meanwhile, some Asian-American groups \xe2\x80\x94 Cambodian- and Hmong-Americans, for example \xe2\x80\x94 are among the poorest in the country, as are some predominantly white communities in central Appalachia.'b'MOST fundamentally, groups rise and fall over time. The fortunes of WASP elites have been declining for decades. In 1960, second-generation Greek-Americans reportedly had the second-highest income of any census-tracked group. Group success in America often tends to dissipate after two generations. Thus while Asian-American kids overall had SAT scores 143 points above average in 2012 \xe2\x80\x94 including a 63-point edge over whites \xe2\x80\x94 a 2005 study of over 20,000 adolescents found that third-generation Asian-American students performed no better academically than white students.'b'The fact that groups rise and fall this way punctures the whole idea of \xe2\x80\x9cmodel minorities\xe2\x80\x9d or that groups succeed because of innate, biological differences. Rather, there are cultural forces at work.'b'It turns out that for all their diversity, the strikingly successful groups in America today share three traits that, together, propel success. The first is a superiority complex \xe2\x80\x94 a deep-seated belief in their exceptionality. The second appears to be the opposite \xe2\x80\x94 insecurity, a feeling that you or what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done is not good enough. The third is impulse control.'b'Any individual, from any background, can have what we call this Triple Package of traits. But research shows that some groups are instilling them more frequently than others, and that they are enjoying greater success.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s odd to think of people feeling simultaneously superior and insecure. Yet it\xe2\x80\x99s precisely this unstable combination that generates drive: a chip on the shoulder, a goading need to prove oneself. Add impulse control \xe2\x80\x94 the ability to resist temptation \xe2\x80\x94 and the result is people who systematically sacrifice present gratification in pursuit of future attainment.'b'Ironically, each element of the Triple Package violates a core tenet of contemporary American thinking.'b'We know that group superiority claims are specious and dangerous, yet every one of America\xe2\x80\x99s most successful groups tells itself that it\xe2\x80\x99s exceptional in a deep sense. Mormons believe they are \xe2\x80\x9cgods in embryo\xe2\x80\x9d placed on earth to lead the world to salvation; they see themselves, in the historian Claudia L. Bushman\xe2\x80\x99s words, as \xe2\x80\x9can island of morality in a sea of moral decay.\xe2\x80\x9d Middle East experts and many Iranians explicitly refer to a Persian \xe2\x80\x9csuperiority complex.\xe2\x80\x9d At their first Passover Seders, most Jewish children hear that Jews are the \xe2\x80\x9cchosen\xe2\x80\x9d people; later they may be taught that Jews are a moral people, a people of law and intellect, a people of survivors.'b'That insecurity should be a lever of success is another anathema in American culture. Feelings of inadequacy are cause for concern or even therapy; parents deliberately instilling insecurity in their children is almost unthinkable. Yet insecurity runs deep in every one of America\xe2\x80\x99s rising groups; and consciously or unconsciously, they tend to instill it in their children.'b'A central finding in a study of more than 5,000 immigrants\xe2\x80\x99 children led by the sociologist Rub\xc3\xa9n G. Rumbaut was how frequently the kids felt \xe2\x80\x9cmotivated to achieve\xe2\x80\x9d because of an acute sense of obligation to redeem their parents\xe2\x80\x99 sacrifices. Numerous studies, including in-depth field work conducted by the Harvard sociologist Vivian S. Louie, reveal Chinese immigrant parents frequently imposing exorbitant academic expectations on their children (\xe2\x80\x9cWhy only a 99?\xe2\x80\x9d), making them feel that \xe2\x80\x9cfamily honor\xe2\x80\x9d depends on their success.'b'By contrast, white American parents have been found to be more focused on building children\xe2\x80\x99s social skills and self-esteem. There\xe2\x80\x99s an ocean of difference between \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re amazing. Mommy and Daddy never want you to worry about a thing\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t do well at school, you\xe2\x80\x99ll let down the family and end up a bum on the streets.\xe2\x80\x9d In a study of thousands of high school students, Asian-American students reported the lowest self-esteem of any racial group, even as they racked up the highest grades.'b'Moreover, being an outsider in a society \xe2\x80\x94 and America\xe2\x80\x99s most successful groups are all outsiders in one way or another \xe2\x80\x94 is a source of insecurity in itself. Immigrants worry about whether they can survive in a strange land, often communicating a sense of life\xe2\x80\x99s precariousness to their children. Hence the common credo: They can take away your home or business, but never your education, so study harder. Newcomers and religious minorities may face derision or hostility. Cubans fleeing to Miami after Fidel Castro\xe2\x80\x99s takeover reported seeing signs reading \xe2\x80\x9cNo dogs, no Cubans\xe2\x80\x9d on apartment buildings. During the 2012 election cycle, Mormons had to hear Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s clean-cut sons described as \xe2\x80\x9ccreepy\xe2\x80\x9d in the media. In combination with a superiority complex, the feeling of being underestimated or scorned can be a powerful motivator.'b'Finally, impulse control runs against the grain of contemporary culture as well. Countless books and feel-good movies extol the virtue of living in the here and now, and people who control their impulses don\xe2\x80\x99t live in the moment. The dominant culture is fearful of spoiling children\xe2\x80\x99s happiness with excessive restraints or demands. By contrast, every one of America\xe2\x80\x99s most successful groups takes a very different view of childhood, inculcating habits of discipline from a very early age \xe2\x80\x94 or at least they did so when they were on the rise.'b'In isolation, each of these three qualities would be insufficient. Alone, a superiority complex is a recipe for complacency; mere insecurity could be crippling; impulse control can produce asceticism. Only in combination do these qualities generate drive and what Tocqueville called the \xe2\x80\x9clonging to rise.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Needless to say, high-achieving groups don\xe2\x80\x99t instill these qualities in all their members. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have to. A culture producing, say, four high achievers out of 10 would attain wildly disproportionate success if the surrounding average was one out of 20.'b'But this success comes at a price. Each of the three traits has its own pathologies. Impulse control can undercut the ability to experience beauty, tranquillity and spontaneous joy. Insecure people feel like they\xe2\x80\x99re never good enough. \xe2\x80\x9cI grew up thinking that I would never, ever please my parents,\xe2\x80\x9d recalls the novelist Amy Tan. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a horrible feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d Recent studies suggest that Asian-American youth have greater rates of stress (but, despite media reports to the contrary, lower rates of suicide).'b'A superiority complex can be even more invidious. Group supremacy claims have been a source of oppression, war and genocide throughout history. To be sure, a group superiority complex somehow feels less ugly when it\xe2\x80\x99s used by an outsider minority as an armor against majority prejudices and hostility, but ethnic pride or religious zeal can turn all too easily into intolerance of its own.'b'Even when it functions relatively benignly as an engine of success, the combination of these three traits can still be imprisoning \xe2\x80\x94 precisely because of the kind of success it tends to promote. Individuals striving for material success can easily become too focused on prestige and money, too concerned with external measures of their own worth.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy for minority groups in America to maintain a superiority complex. For most of its history, America did pretty much everything a country could to impose a narrative of inferiority on its nonwhite minorities and especially its black population. Over and over, African-Americans have fought back against this narrative, but its legacy persists.'b'Black America is of course no one thing: \xe2\x80\x9cnot one or ten or ten thousand things,\xe2\x80\x9d as the poet and Yale professor Elizabeth Alexander has written. There are black families in the United States occupying every possible socioeconomic position. But Sean \xe2\x80\x9cDiddy\xe2\x80\x9d Combs \xe2\x80\x94 rapper, record producer and entrepreneur \xe2\x80\x94 undoubtedly spoke for many when he said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you study black history, it\xe2\x80\x99s just so negative, you know. It\xe2\x80\x99s just like, O.K., we were slaves, and then we were whipped and sprayed with water hoses, and the civil rights movement, and we\xe2\x80\x99re American gangsters. I get motivated for us to be seen in our brilliance.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Culture is never all-determining. Individuals can defy the most dominant culture and write their own scripts, as Mr. Combs himself did. They can create narratives of pride that reject the master narratives of their society, or turn those narratives around. In any given family, an unusually strong parent, grandparent or even teacher can instill in children every one of the three crucial traits. It\xe2\x80\x99s just much harder when you have to do it on your own, when you can\xe2\x80\x99t draw on the cultural resources of a broader community, when you don\xe2\x80\x99t have role models or peer pressure on your side, and instead are bombarded daily with negative images of your group in the media.'b'But it would be ridiculous to suggest that the lack of an effective group superiority complex was the cause of disproportionate African-American poverty. The true causes barely require repeating: They include slavery, systematic discrimination, schools that fail to teach, employers who won\xe2\x80\x99t promote, single motherhood and the fact that roughly a third of young black men in this country are in jail, awaiting trial or on probation or parole. Nor does the lack of a group superiority narrative prevent any given individual African-American from succeeding. It simply creates an additional psychological and cultural hurdle that America\xe2\x80\x99s most successful groups don\xe2\x80\x99t have to overcome.'b'At the same time, if members of a group learn not to trust the system, if they don\xe2\x80\x99t think people like them can really make it, they will have little incentive to engage in impulse control. Researchers at the University of Rochester recently reran the famous marshmallow test with a new spin. Children initially subjected to a broken promise \xe2\x80\x94 adults promised them a new art set to play with, but never delivered \xe2\x80\x94 almost invariably \xe2\x80\x9cfailed\xe2\x80\x9d the test (snatching the first marshmallow instead of waiting 15 minutes for a promised second). By contrast, when the adults followed through on their promise, most kids passed the test.'b'The same factors that cause poverty \xe2\x80\x94 discrimination, prejudice, shrinking opportunity \xe2\x80\x94 can sap from a group the cultural forces that propel success. Once that happens, poverty becomes more entrenched. In these circumstances, it takes much more grit, more drive and perhaps a more exceptional individual to break out.'b'Of course a person born with the proverbial silver spoon can grow up to be wealthy without hard work, insecurity or discipline (although to the extent a group passes on its wealth that way, it\xe2\x80\x99s likely to be headed for decline). In a society with increasing class rigidity, parental wealth obviously contributes to the success of the next generation.'b'But one reason groups with the cultural package we\xe2\x80\x99ve described have such an advantage in the United States today lies in the very same factors that are shrinking opportunity for so many of America\xe2\x80\x99s poor. Disappearing blue-collar jobs and greater returns to increasingly competitive higher education give a tremendous edge to groups that disproportionately produce individuals driven, especially at a young age, to excel and to sacrifice present satisfactions for long-term gains.'b'THE good news is that it\xe2\x80\x99s not some magic gene generating these groups\xe2\x80\x99 disproportionate success. Nor is it some 5,000-year-old \xe2\x80\x9ceducation culture\xe2\x80\x9d that only they have access to. Instead their success is significantly propelled by three simple qualities open to anyone.'b'The way to develop this package of qualities \xe2\x80\x94 not that it\xe2\x80\x99s easy, or that everyone would want to \xe2\x80\x94 is through grit. It requires turning the ability to work hard, to persevere and to overcome adversity into a source of personal superiority. This kind of superiority complex isn\xe2\x80\x99t ethnically or religiously exclusive. It\xe2\x80\x99s the pride a person takes in his own strength of will.'b'Consider the story of Sonia Sotomayor, who was born to struggling Puerto Rican parents. Her father was an alcoholic, she writes in her moving autobiography, \xe2\x80\x9cMy Beloved World,\xe2\x80\x9d and her mother\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cway of coping was to avoid being at home\xe2\x80\x9d with him. But Justice Sotomayor, who gave herself painful insulin shots for diabetes starting around age 8, was \xe2\x80\x9cblessed\xe2\x80\x9d with a \xe2\x80\x9cstubborn perseverance.\xe2\x80\x9d Not originally a top student, she did \xe2\x80\x9csomething very unusual\xe2\x80\x9d in fifth grade, approaching one of the smartest girls in the class to \xe2\x80\x9cask her how to study.\xe2\x80\x9d Soon she was getting top marks, and a few years later she applied to Princeton \xe2\x80\x94 though her guidance counselor recommended \xe2\x80\x9cCatholic colleges.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The point of this example is not, \xe2\x80\x9cSee, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to climb out of poverty in America.\xe2\x80\x9d On the contrary, Justice Sotomayor\xe2\x80\x99s story illustrates just how extraordinary a person has to be to overcome the odds stacked against her.'b'But research shows that perseverance and motivation can be taught, especially to young children. This supports those who, like the Nobel Prize-winning economist James J. Heckman, argue that education dollars for the underprivileged are best spent on early childhood intervention, beginning at preschool age, when kids are most formable.'b'The United States itself was born a Triple Package nation, with an outsize belief in its own exceptionality, a goading desire to prove itself to aristocratic Europe (Thomas Jefferson sent a giant moose carcass to Paris to prove that America\xe2\x80\x99s animals were bigger than Europe\xe2\x80\x99s) and a Puritan inheritance of impulse control.'b'But prosperity and power had their predictable effect, eroding the insecurity and self-restraint that led to them. By 2000, all that remained was our superiority complex, which by itself is mere swagger, fueling a culture of entitlement and instant gratification. Thus the trials of recent years \xe2\x80\x94 the unwon wars, the financial collapse, the rise of China \xe2\x80\x94 have, perversely, had a beneficial effect: the return of insecurity.'b'Those who talk of America\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdecline\xe2\x80\x9d miss this crucial point. America has always been at its best when it has had to overcome adversity and prove its mettle on the world stage. For better and worse, it has that opportunity again today.'b'Xi Jinping has vowed to end corruption among China\xe2\x80\x99s elite, but a report said that the country\xe2\x80\x99s wealthy are storing billions of dollars abroad.'b'BEIJING \xe2\x80\x94  On Jan. 12, Song Binbin, the daughter of a former prominent member of the Communist Party, created a stir on China\xe2\x80\x99s blogosphere when she joined some fellow former Red Guards at a Beijing high school and offered a public apology for her part in one of the most notorious killings of the Cultural Revolution. In August 1966, the school\xe2\x80\x99s vice principal, Bian Zhongyun, was tormented, beaten and left to die by students at the school. Ms. Song said she had tried to stop them but did not try hard enough. She said she did not participate in the beating.'b'The Cultural Revolution wreaked devastation on the lives of millions of Chinese people. Mao, who unleashed the movement by urging young people to rise up against their parents and teachers, was attempting to regain prominence after years of failed policies by purging the Communist Party of \xe2\x80\x9ccapitalists.\xe2\x80\x9d For 10 years, the nation was reduced to a state of barbarism.'b'Because Mao has continued to be revered by China\xe2\x80\x99s leaders since his death in 1976, genuine public reflection on the lessons of this disastrous time has been impossible. Attempts by intellectuals to publicly address the Cultural Revolution have been suppressed; only a smattering of research by state-funded scholars has seen the light of day. The result has been a gradual receding of memory. The economic surge of the past 30 years has even led some deluded souls to look back on the period with nostalgia. But given the authoritarian nature of today\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, many people fear the prospect of a return of the terror that marked the Cultural Revolution.'b'Still, a sort of \xe2\x80\x9capology compulsion\xe2\x80\x9d appears to have taken hold among people like Song Binbin who were lured into villainy during that tumultuous period. Wang Jiyu, haunted by a fatal beating he carried out in 1967 when he was 16 years old, published an article in a pro-reform journal, Yanhuang Chunqiu, in 2010, reflecting on his transgressions.'b'Wang Keming, who admitted to badly beating an older man during the Cultural Revolution, compiled a book of articles by people willing to tell their stories. He finished the book in 2013, but he could not find a publishing house willing to take on the project.'b'Perhaps the most prominent example is Chen Xiaolu, the son of a former foreign minister, Chen Yi, who created a storm late last year when he apologized for ordering teachers to line up in their school auditorium and wear dunce caps.'b'Among those who have apologized, Song Binbin and Chen Xiaolu do not appear to have committed very serious crimes. It is those who committed the greatest atrocities, such as the cannibals of the Guangxi region, or the people who actually killed Vice Principal Bian Zhongyun, who remain silent.'b'Yet the public reaction suggests that many Chinese people \xe2\x80\x94 especially the younger generation that is active online \xe2\x80\x94 consider Song Binbin\xe2\x80\x99s apology insincere. Many netizens accuse her of grandstanding; some argue that her apology is meaningless if she does not  say who killed the vice principal. Many doubt she was telling the whole truth. \xe2\x80\x9cNow she apologizes for her crime. Which of her words are true?\xe2\x80\x9d asked one anonymous commentator. Another wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cThe apology didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The truth is that we should not limit public reflection to the Cultural Revolution alone. China\xe2\x80\x99s history has been marked by an endless series of massacres and government-led persecutions \xe2\x80\x94 from the Great Famine right through to the more recent \xe2\x80\x9chard-strike\xe2\x80\x9d anti-crime campaigns, the Tiananmen Square massacre and the persecution of the Falun Gong spiritual movement, to name just a few.'b'But a public accounting of our tragedies will not come anytime soon. It is only because of the massive involvement of ordinary people in the Cultural Revolution that official suppression has failed to prevent some participants from spontaneously offering apologies.'b'Can China continue the momentum and create a framework for wider public acknowledgement? Are the Chinese people ready for such a mass reckoning?'b'Justice requires the application of legal principles, and a basic consideration for human feelings. In the case of the Cultural Revolution, an apology is the most important thing, more important than any punishment. More apologies should be encouraged \xe2\x80\x94 and accepted \xe2\x80\x94 even if they come 40 years late.'b'The concern is that those who might be willing to step forward will be discouraged from doing so for fear of facing excessive criticism, like Song Binbin. If those who publicly apologize are continually put through an online gauntlet, and are eventually subjected to absolute justice, the more reluctant perpetrators will certainly stay in the shadows.'b'We Chinese need to build an appropriate environment for the wrongdoers to come forward. First and foremost, this requires that people who were fortunate enough not to experience the Cultural Revolution put themselves in the place of the perpetrators. While they have a right to criticize perpetrators of past crimes, they should repress the impulse to harshly condemn those who come forward. We should not be making excessive demands on this process. Chinese people should try to consider what they themselves might have done under similar circumstances.'b'But as the vitriolic reaction to Song Binbin\xe2\x80\x99s apology shows, Chinese society is not ready for a public reckoning. There is simply not enough good will to accept the apologies of the Cultural Revolution\xe2\x80\x99s criminals.'b'The question remains whether society can come around before all of the victims have died, and the Cultural Revolution becomes yet another tragedy in our history that never receives the public airing it deserves.'b''b'\n'b'Xiao Han 'b' is an associate professor at China University of Political Science and Law. This article was translated by Stacy Mosher from the Chinese. 'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9cGender\xe2\x80\x9d has been chosen as the 2013 word of the year in Poland. In making their selection, scholars from the University of Warsaw and the Polish Language Foundation passed over other buzzwords like \xe2\x80\x9cwiretapping\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cEuromaidan.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Since the fall of Communism and integration into the West, gender has become an established concept in Poland, along with the feminist and L.G.B.T. movements. Many universities have Gender Studies programs, and numerous books on the subject have been published. And, as a European Union member, Poland is obligated to follow a policy of so-called gender mainstreaming.'b'In any case, the English word \xe2\x80\x9cgender\xe2\x80\x9d is hardly new to Poland. Academics have managed to make it standard in Polish humanities, and the country has had time to get used to it. Why, then, has gender suddenly become a hot topic?'b'The first sign that something strange was happening emerged this past summer at a debate I participated in with one of Poland\xe2\x80\x99s best-known bishops, Tadeusz Pieronek. We were at a summer culture festival at a resort in Swinoujscie, on the Baltic coast. All of a sudden, Bishop Pieronek blurted out, \xe2\x80\x9cI would like to add that the ideology of gender presents a threat worse than Nazism and Communism combined.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Bishop Pieronek, considered part of the liberal wing of Poland\xe2\x80\x99s Catholic Church, seemed to be reciting memorized talking points. In any case, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have more to say about his statement, nor could he name any victims or give the number of people killed or maimed by the threat of gender. He did, however, repeat his statement, while adding that gender ideology is at odds with nature and natural law.'b'The clergy always protest that in vitro fertilization, abortion, civil unions for gays and teaching sex education are at odds with nature. Yet priests\xe2\x80\x99 lifestyles, namely their celibacy, are hardly a textbook product of the theory of evolution.'b'Because politicians in Poland fear the church, all of the above activities are either banned or heavily restricted by the law or, as in the case of compulsory sex education, ignored by the authorities. But exist they do, on more or less the same scale as in any Western country. In this way, freedom has been privatized in Poland, and access to it depends on social class, and therefore on the contents of one\xe2\x80\x99s wallet, level of education and place of residence.'b'Bishop Pieronek\xe2\x80\x99s statement touched off a series of ever more perplexing actions by the church hierarchy. Posters have appeared in schools proclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cProtect Your Child Against Gender.\xe2\x80\x9d (The newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza reported that young children have begun to ask their parents how they can be vaccinated.) Almost every day there are new pronouncements warning against gender ideology, for example, as when a priest commented in a talk in Poznan that \xe2\x80\x9cgender leads to the devastation of families\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cis associated with radical feminism, which advocates for abortion, the employment of women and the detention of children in preschools.\xe2\x80\x9d Lining up behind the church fight, conservative politicians have convened a parliamentary group, \xe2\x80\x9cStop Gender Ideology,\xe2\x80\x9d consisting of one woman and 15 men.'b'The bishops voiced their official opinion in a pastoral letter posted online entitled, \xe2\x80\x9cThreats to the Family Stemming from the Ideology of Gender,\xe2\x80\x9d which proclaimed that \xe2\x80\x9cthe aim of gender education is the sexualization of children and young people.\xe2\x80\x9d According to Poland\xe2\x80\x99s Catholic Church, the Council of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence is promoting \xe2\x80\x9cnonstereotypical sexual roles\xe2\x80\x9d and is breaking down the educational system by requiring education on homosexuality and transsexuality.'b'In their letter the bishops also went after the World Health Organization, writing that it \xe2\x80\x9cpromotes, among other things, masturbation by preschool-aged children, encouraging them to seek joy and pleasure in touching their own bodies and those of their peers.\xe2\x80\x9d The bishops warned that \xe2\x80\x9cas a consequence of the education implemented by youth sexual educators, young people become regular customers of pharmaceutical, erotic, pornographic, pedophile and abortion enterprises.\xe2\x80\x9d The letter, perhaps not surprisingly, was replaced with a toned-down version less than two hours after it was published, according to Gazeta Wyborcza. Even so, the bishops announced that both versions were legitimate, but that the original was for pastoral use, and the second version for the laity.'b'The church hierarchy claims none are immune to the influence of gender. It might be that even the Polish Church itself is threatened. \xe2\x80\x9cChurch\xe2\x80\x9d was originally a feminine-declined noun (from the Greek \xe2\x80\x9cecclesia\xe2\x80\x9d). And it is traditionally personified by the image of a woman. In Polish, however, this same word is masculine. Is the Catholic Church also having gender issues?'b'A more serious question many in Poland are asking is, Why is this anti-gender paranoia happening now? If \xe2\x80\x9cgender ideology\xe2\x80\x9d were such an apocalyptical threat, it should have wiped out a significant part of the Polish population before our church\xe2\x80\x99s recent wake-up call.'b'For two decades, the church hierarchy exhibited no interest in the \xe2\x80\x9cideology of gender\xe2\x80\x9d until suddenly one day it began to speak of little else. The reasons behind such an orchestrated action might be found in the church\xe2\x80\x99s recent problems. Poles have been outraged by the large-scale financial fraud carried out by the commission tasked with the reprivatization of church property that had been seized by the Communist government. Poles also continue to be disturbed by increasingly common disclosures of pedophilia within the church.'b'In Poland, politics is the one area in which the church does not need any lessons. And in today\xe2\x80\x99s politics, when a party finds itself in trouble, its best bet is to change the subject with a media campaign. Necessity is the mother of invention, and thus arose the church\xe2\x80\x99s new invention, the \xe2\x80\x9cideology of gender.\xe2\x80\x9d This seems to be working wonderfully, since \xe2\x80\x9cgender\xe2\x80\x9d has become the word of the year, handily beating not just \xe2\x80\x9cwiretapping\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cEuromaidan,\xe2\x80\x9d but also \xe2\x80\x9cpedophilia\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cproperty commission.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'\n'b'Slawomir Sierakowski 'b' is a sociologist and a founder of the Krytyka Polityczna movement.

'b''b'IN recent years Americans have begun to wise up to the idea that our overstuffed prisons are a shameful waste of lives and money. Lawmakers have recoiled from the high price of mass incarceration (the annual per-inmate cost of prison approaches the tuition at a good college) and some have recognized that our prisons feed a pathological cycle of poverty, community dysfunction, crime and hopelessness. As crime rates have dropped, the public has 'b'registered support'b' for reforms that would have fewer nonviolent offenders languishing in prison. For three years in a row, the population of America\xe2\x80\x99s prisons has inched down; 13 states closed prisons last year. Efforts to fix the perpetual misery machine that is our criminal justice system have won support not only from progressives and academics but from 'b'conservatives'b' (both fiscal and evangelical), from enlightened law enforcement groups, from business and even from 'b'advocates for crime victims.'b''b'This emerging consensus is good news, since our prisons are an international scandal, and we can only hope the new attitude doesn\xe2\x80\x99t evaporate with the next Willie Horton-style rampage or spike in the crime rate. But it raises an important question: What is the alternative? How do we punish and deter criminals, protect the public and \xe2\x80\x94 the thing prisons do most abysmally \xe2\x80\x94 improve the chances that those caught up in the criminal justice system emerge with some hope of productive lives?'b'That has become about the hottest subject in criminal justice, the focus of a profusion of experiments in states and localities, and of researchers trying to determine what works. California alone, which is under a Supreme Court mandate to relieve its inhumanely congested prisons, is offering counties $1 billion a year to try out remedies. A 'b'study'b' released on Monday by the Urban Institute examined 17 states, red and blue, testing an approach called Justice Reinvestment \xe2\x80\x94 reducing prison costs and putting some of the savings into alternatives. Perhaps the most striking thing, said Nancy La Vigne, the principal investigator on the report, is the enthusiasm of law-and-order states that a few years ago might have shunned such programs as bleeding-heart liberalism.'b'In conversations with a wide range of criminal justice experts, I found several broad strategies that seem promising:'b''b'SENTENCING'b' America has long been more inclined than other developed countries to treat crime as a disposal problem; \xe2\x80\x9ctrail \xe2\x80\x99em, nail \xe2\x80\x99em and jail \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d is our tough-on-crime slogan. Beginning in the \xe2\x80\x9870\xe2\x80\x99s, rising crime rates, compounded by the crack epidemic and the public fear it aroused, set off a binge of punitive sentencing laws. Three-strikes, mandatory minimum sentences and requirements that felons serve a minimum portion (often 85 percent) of their sentence lengthened the time offenders \xe2\x80\x94 especially drug offenders, and especially black men \xe2\x80\x94 spent in lockup. Restoring common sense to sentencing is the obvious first step in downsizing prisons. New York rolled back its notorious Rockefeller drug laws, California has softened its three-strikes law and several other states have tinkered with rigid sentencing laws. But there is stiff resistance from prosecutors, who use the threat of long sentences to compel cooperation or plea deals. Reformers concede that those draconian laws have had a modest effect on the crime rate, but because of them we are paying to imprison criminals long past the time they present any danger to society. \xe2\x80\x9cKeeping a 60-year-old in prison until he\xe2\x80\x99s 65 does close to zero for crime rates,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeremy Travis, president of John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we\xe2\x80\x99re really seeing something deep going on here, the proof will be whether legislators have the political will to roll back sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'SUPERVISION'b' For every inmate in our state and federal prisons, another two people are under the supervision of probation or parole. Caseworkers are often poorly paid and usually overwhelmed. About all they can do is keep count of an offender\xe2\x80\x99s violations until the system decides to kick that offender back to prison. A few jurisdictions have tried to make parole and probation less of a revolving door back to prison, with some encouraging results. They focus attention on offenders considered most likely to commit crimes. They send caseworkers out of the office and into the community. They use technology (ankle bracelets with GPS, A.T.M.-style check-in stations, Breathalyzer ignition locks to keep drinkers from driving) to enhance supervision. They employ a disciplinary approach called \xe2\x80\x9cswift and certain,\xe2\x80\x9d which responds promptly with a punishment for missing an interview or failing a drug test. The punishments start small, then escalate until the offender gets the message and changes his behavior \xe2\x80\x94 preferably before he has to be sent back to prison. Mark Kleiman, a U.C.L.A. public policy professor who is a champion of the technique, says, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s basically applying the principles of parenting to probation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'DIVERSION'b' Many jurisdictions now send drug offenders to special courts that divert nonviolent drug abusers to treatment instead of prison. Adam Gelb, director of the Public Safety Performance Project at the Pew Charitable Trusts, said more than 2,000 drug courts have been created. The popularity of drug courts has spawned other specialized venues \xe2\x80\x94 veterans\xe2\x80\x99 courts, domestic violence courts \xe2\x80\x94 that aim to address problems rather than simply dispense punishment.'b''b'RE-ENTRY'b' We release more than 650,000 prisoners into society every year, often just dropping them on a curb to fend for themselves. Two-thirds of them are rearrested within three years. A number of programs aim to improve the odds that a released felon will have options besides unemployment, homelessness and a return to crime. Some feature prerelease counseling and enlist family members to assure a safe landing. \xe2\x80\x9cBan the box\xe2\x80\x9d initiatives encourage employers to eliminate the box on job applications that asks if you have ever been arrested. A criminal history can still count against you in hiring, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t eliminate you from consideration. (Target is the biggest retailer to ban the box.) Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, says another simple measure is to repeal rules that say a felon can\xe2\x80\x99t be licensed as a barber or beautician.'b''b'POLICING'b' It may seem counterintuitive, but sophisticated police work has helped reduce prison populations in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, New Orleans and other cities while also bringing down violent crime, 'b'according to'b' David Kennedy of John Jay. Instead of wholesale policing of \xe2\x80\x9cbad neighborhoods\xe2\x80\x9d and indiscriminately stopping and frisking residents, they target micro hot spots, such as drug corners, and small groups of violent actors, such as gang members. Police in these cities have become more selective about who gets arrested and put into the criminal justice system in the first place.'b'Although the government has stepped up evaluation of all these programs (see the National Institute of Justice\xe2\x80\x99s impressive 'b'CrimeSolutions.gov'b' 'b'website'b'), most of the evidence is still tentative. Joan Petersilia of the Stanford Criminal Justice Center, who is monitoring California\xe2\x80\x99s wild experiment in prison downsizing, says the reform movement has been hampered by a lack of rigorous science \xe2\x80\x94 and by public impatience. To know what works, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to stay the course, and we never do in criminal justice policy.\xe2\x80\x9d Sooner or later crime ticks back up, and, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen fear gets in the American public, they will pay anything for prisons.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The quest for safe and humane alternatives to lockup faces opposition from prosecutors protecting their leverage, from corrections employee unions protecting jobs and from a private prison industry protecting profits. (Private prison operators, who house about 9 percent of prison inmates, have a vested interest in keeping prisons full because they are paid based on occupancy.) Liberal skeptics, in turn, point out that these programs do not solve the root problems: communities, bereft of good schools, decent housing and jobs, that become cradles of crime. They are right, of course, but they remind me of critics who oppose charter schools because the real problem is poverty. I\xe2\x80\x99m all for reaching out to those trapped on the bottom. But in the meantime, why not try to save some lives?'b'Rising inequality has obvious economic costs: stagnant 'b'wages'b' despite rising productivity, rising debt that makes us more vulnerable to financial crisis. It also has big social and human costs. There is, for example, strong evidence that 'b'high inequality leads to worse health'b' and higher mortality.'b'But there\xe2\x80\x99s more. Extreme inequality, it turns out, creates a class of people who are alarmingly detached from reality \xe2\x80\x94 and simultaneously gives these people great power.'b'The example many are buzzing about right now is the billionaire investor Tom Perkins, a founding member of the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers. In a 'b'letter to the editor'b' of The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Perkins lamented public criticism of the \xe2\x80\x9cone percent\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and compared such criticism to Nazi attacks on the Jews, suggesting that we are on the road to another Kristallnacht.'b'You may say that this is just one crazy guy and wonder why The Journal would publish such a thing. But Mr. Perkins isn\xe2\x80\x99t that much of an outlier. He isn\xe2\x80\x99t even the first finance titan to compare advocates of progressive taxation to Nazis. Back in 2010 Stephen Schwarzman, the chairman and chief executive of the Blackstone Group, 'b'declared'b' that proposals to eliminate tax loopholes for hedge fund and private-equity managers were \xe2\x80\x9clike when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And there are a number of other plutocrats who manage to keep Hitler out of their remarks but who nonetheless hold, and loudly express, political and economic views that combine paranoia and megalomania in equal measure.'b'I know that sounds strong. But look at all the speeches and opinion pieces by Wall Streeters accusing President Obama \xe2\x80\x94 who has never done anything more than say the obvious, that some bankers behaved badly \xe2\x80\x94 of 'b'demonizing'b' and 'b'persecuting'b' the rich. And look at how many of those making these accusations also made the ludicrously self-centered claim that their hurt feelings (as opposed to things like household debt and premature fiscal austerity) were the main thing holding the economy back.'b'Now, just to be clear, the very rich, and those on Wall Street in particular, are in fact doing worse under Mr. Obama than they would have if Mitt Romney had won in 2012. Between the partial rollback of the Bush tax cuts and the tax hike that partly pays for health reform, tax rates on the 1 percent have gone more or less back to 'b'pre-Reagan levels'b'. Also, financial reformers have 'b'won some surprising victories'b' over the past year, and this is 'b'bad news for wheeler-dealers'b' whose wealth comes largely from exploiting weak regulation. So you can make the case that the 1 percent have lost some important policy battles.'b'But every group finds itself facing criticism, and ends up on the losing side of policy disputes, somewhere along the way; that\xe2\x80\x99s democracy. The question is what happens next. Normal people take it in stride; even if they\xe2\x80\x99re angry and bitter over political setbacks, they don\xe2\x80\x99t cry persecution, compare their critics to Nazis and insist that the world revolves around their hurt feelings. But the rich are different from you and me.'b'And yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s partly because they have more money, and the power that goes with it. They can and all too often do surround themselves with courtiers who tell them what they want to hear and never, ever, tell them they\xe2\x80\x99re being foolish. They\xe2\x80\x99re accustomed to being treated with deference, not just by the people they hire but by politicians who want their campaign contributions. And so they are shocked to discover that money can\xe2\x80\x99t buy everything, can\xe2\x80\x99t insulate them from all adversity.'b'I also suspect that today\xe2\x80\x99s Masters of the Universe are insecure about the nature of their success. We\xe2\x80\x99re not talking captains of industry here, men who make stuff. We are, instead, talking about wheeler-dealers, men who push money around and get rich by skimming some off the top as it sloshes by. They may boast that they are job creators, the people who make the economy work, but are they really adding value? Many of us doubt it \xe2\x80\x94 and so, I suspect, do some of the wealthy themselves, a form of self-doubt that causes them to lash out even more furiously at their critics.'b'Anyway, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been here before. It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to read screeds like those of Mr. Perkins or Mr. Schwarzman without thinking of F.D.R.\xe2\x80\x99s famous 1936 Madison Square Garden 'b'speech'b', in which he spoke of the hatred he faced from the forces of \xe2\x80\x9corganized money,\xe2\x80\x9d and declared, \xe2\x80\x9cI welcome their hatred.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'President Obama has not, unfortunately, done nearly as much as F.D.R. to earn the hatred of the undeserving rich. But he has done more than many progressives give him credit for \xe2\x80\x94 and like F.D.R., both he and progressives in general should welcome that hatred, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a sign that they\xe2\x80\x99re doing something right.'b'Republican leaders have chosen an odd way to try to win back female voters alienated by relentless G.O.P. attacks on women\xe2\x80\x99s health care and freedoms. Instead of backing off, they\xe2\x80\x99re digging in, clinging to an approach that gave President Obama a 12-point advantage among women in the 2012 election and provided the slim margin of victory for Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic candidate for governor in Virginia, in 2013. On the national level and even in some red states, the party\xe2\x80\x99s stance on women\xe2\x80\x99s rights is plainly not helping it.'b'Yet the ideological tide rolls on. States dominated by Republicans continue to enact new abortion restriction. The Republican National Committee last week heard Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, 'b'suggest'b' that Democrats favor universal access to free contraception because they think women \xe2\x80\x9ccannot control their libido\xe2\x80\x9d without the help of \xe2\x80\x9cUncle Sugar.\xe2\x80\x9d And this week, the Republican-led House is expected to pass the deceptively named No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.'b'Federal financing for abortion has been outlawed since 1976 by what\xe2\x80\x99s known as the Hyde Amendment, harming poor women and others who rely on the federal government for their health care. Now here comes the House with a new bill that would erect new obstacles to women who might seek an abortion. For instance, it would deny tax credits to small businesses that offer health plans including abortion coverage, as most such plans now do, thus discouraging businesses from offering such plans. The measure\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of tax benefits as the equivalent of public spending for abortion seems especially strange in a landscape where people are permitted to deduct donations to religious institutions despite the constitutional bar on government support of religion. Other insidious provisions would permanently codify the Hyde Amendment, now subject to annual approval, and a ban on the District of Columbia\xe2\x80\x99s use of locally raised revenue to provide abortion care.'b'The new measure is the latest iteration of a bill introduced by Representative Christopher Smith, a New Jersey Republican, in 2010 and passed by the House in 2011 after gaining notoriety because of wording (subsequently deleted amid broad public criticism) limiting the rape exception to \xe2\x80\x9cforcible\xe2\x80\x9d rapes.'b'As House Republicans well know, the measure stands no chance of being approved in the Senate. It is thus tempting to dismiss the coming vote as political theater of the absurd, staged to stoke up enthusiasm among the party\xe2\x80\x99s core supporters. But in forging ahead, as expected, to approve the bill, the House will lend it undeserved legitimacy, encouraging more states to pass copycat legislation. And it will reinforce the notion of the Republican party as insensitive to women at just the moment when the party \xe2\x80\x94 not to mention society at large \xe2\x80\x94 would profit from a more welcoming approach.'b'The heartening effects of the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'landmark ruling'b' last June striking down the core of the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, continue to ripple outward. On Jan. 21, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that gays and lesbians 'b'may not be excluded from juries'b' on the basis of their sexual orientation.'b'In a 'b'strongly worded opinion'b', Judge Stephen Reinhardt, writing for a unanimous three-judge panel, explained that the reasoning of United States v. Windsor \xe2\x80\x94 in which the Supreme Court gutted DOMA, the spiteful 1996 law that denied federal benefits to married same-sex couples \xe2\x80\x94 compelled the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s holding.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cJury service is one of the most important responsibilities of an American citizen,\xe2\x80\x9d Judge Reinhardt wrote. Although the Windsor case addressed only marriage, Judge Reinhardt added, the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was premised on the idea of equal dignity for all, a dignity enhanced by \xe2\x80\x9cresponsibilities, as well as rights.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Ninth Circuit is just the latest court to rely on the Windsor decision to expand the equal treatment of gays and lesbians. In recent weeks, federal judges in 'b'Utah'b' and 'b'Oklahoma'b' have cited Windsor in striking down state bans on same-sex marriage, a federal judge in Ohio 'b'ordered that state'b' to recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere, and state courts in 'b'New Jersey'b' and 'b'New Mexico'b' have relied on the ruling to permit same-sex marriages there.'b'The Ninth Circuit case involved a dispute between two drug companies, SmithKline Beecham and Abbott Laboratories, over the marketing and pricing of certain H.I.V. medications. During jury selection in the trial, Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer eliminated a prospective juror who had made several references to his male partner. The lawyer relied on what is known as a peremptory challenge, which allows the striking of a limited number of potential jurors without explanation. The Supreme Court has prohibited the use of such strikes based on a juror\xe2\x80\x99s race or gender; after the Windsor case, the Ninth Circuit reasoned, that prohibition must extend to a juror\xe2\x80\x99s sexual orientation.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGays and lesbians have been systematically excluded from the most important institutions of self-governance\xe2\x80\x9d based on persistent prejudice, the court wrote.'b'Critics contend that the Windsor ruling is more properly understood to protect each state\xe2\x80\x99s right to decide its own marriage laws. But that misses Windsor\xe2\x80\x99s essence, which is that DOMA\xe2\x80\x99s central, impermissible purpose was \xe2\x80\x9cto impose inequality\xe2\x80\x9d on a class of individuals without legitimate justification.'b'In applying heightened judicial scrutiny to classifications based on sexual orientation, the Ninth Circuit used a standard the Windsor ruling never explicitly applied. But the impact of that scrutiny is likely to be felt throughout the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s nine states, in cases involving public employment, family law and same-sex marriage itself.'b'While the Supreme Court has so far declined to decide whether there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, it is increasingly clear that because of its holding in Windsor, the court will be confronted with that issue sooner rather than later. Seventeen states now permit same-sex marriage \xe2\x80\x94 not counting Utah and Oklahoma, where officials are challenging the recent judicial rulings \xe2\x80\x94 and that number is likely to grow in the next few years. The court has laid the groundwork for the recognition of equal rights for all. Now it must follow through on its own reasoning.'b'New York state test data to be released later this spring will include sobering news for Mayor Bill de Blasio and his new schools chancellor, Carmen Fari\xc3\xb1a. The data show that only one in four New York City students who started high school in 2009 and graduated in 2013 performed well enough on the Regents exams to meet the state definition of college readiness. Racial and ethnic breakdowns are not yet available. But they are likely to mirror last year\xe2\x80\x99s statistics, which showed striking racial disparities: Only about 11 percent of black and about 12 percent of Hispanic graduates were deemed college-ready.'b'Mr. de Blasio, who has had a field day bashing his predecessor over this problem, must now find a way to solve it by ramping up the quality of education for poor and minority children. For starters, the city must preserve, at least in part, the controversial school evaluation system that Michael Bloomberg introduced in 2006.'b'Mr. de Blasio has rightly decided to junk the simplistic, deeply unpopular A-through-F grading system that is used to rate schools. But there is much about the evaluation system that\xe2\x80\x99s worth preserving, including its tight focus on the issue of equity, which means holding schools accountable for how well they educate poor and minority children who are too often written off and left behind.'b'Historically, the rankings compared a school\xe2\x80\x99s test scores with those of the district as a whole. But under that system, demographics ruled the day; wealthy schools invariably were ranked at the top and poor schools at the bottom. Commendably, the Bloomberg administration devised a way to control for demographically driven differences that enabled it to reach the bedrock question of how much a given school actually improves student learning from year to year. Despite its imperfections, the system found that schools with similar populations of poor and minority children posted vastly dissimilar results. This, in turn, allowed officials and teachers to zero in on a school\xe2\x80\x99s weaknesses, with positive results. The data show that over the last two years, nearly 80 percent of the lowest-performing schools improved their ratings after receiving help in the areas where they were weak.'b'The A-through-F rating system has several deficiencies. First, it lacks transparency; many people find it hard to understand how reams of complex information are crunched down into a single grade. Second, when people think of letter grades, they think of an overall quality rating, not a rating based largely on special factors. As a result, parents, lawmakers and others were confused when a school at which the overwhelming majority of students were performing well received a mediocre rating because it saw less improvement than schools at which students were not doing as well. It would be better to do away with the overall grade and continue to report a separate rating for each relevant metric \xe2\x80\x94 say, one each for overall performance, success with disadvantaged students and so on.'b'The Bloomberg administration acknowledged shortcomings in the evaluation system, especially at the elementary and middle school levels, where too much weight had been given to testing and too little weight to nontest indicators of school performance (thus forcing weaker schools to spend far too much time teaching students how to take tests). The new evaluation system must give significant weight to how well schools are preparing students for the next level and keeping children on track for college readiness.'b'The report cards can be improved and revised. But their basic purpose \xe2\x80\x94 providing a plausible system for measuring student progress \xe2\x80\x94 cannot be abandoned. If it is, city officials will never know how well students are doing until, on graduation day, they find that too many of them do not have the skills they need to go to college.'b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 The majestic view at sunset from the terrace of President Vladimir V. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s dacha overlooking the Black Sea told you right away why he fought so hard to bring the 2014 Winter Olympics to this resort. Sochi is one of Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s favorite places.'b'On a visit to his presidential mansion in 2007, shortly after Russia had won the 2014 Games, a group of us listened intently as he looked forward to the Games as vital proof that Russia was back and that he had restored his country to its rightful role in the world. Sochi, he said, would give back to Russia its lost glory. This month, he added that the Games will be a \xe2\x80\x9cmoral moment\xe2\x80\x9d for Russia.'b'The Olympic Games are supposed to symbolize international cooperation as well as competition. Of course, any country hosting the Games wants to highlight its best features. But Sochi may be one of those times in Olympic history when a leader wants to use the Games for a much more specific political purpose \xe2\x80\x94 in this case, to prove that the system he presides over is preferable to that in many participating countries. To that end, he is insisting that Russia is the guardian of a culture that sets superior moral and political standards.'b'Sochi may well represent a milestone for Russia, but perhaps not the one Mr. Putin has envisaged. For all its beauty and history, Sochi and the circumstances around the Olympics have dampened, rather than heightened, the luster evoked by the Russian leader, and not just because Sochi\xe2\x80\x99s subtropical climate will be a challenge for Winter Olympics. More important is its proximity to the volatile North Caucasus, where Islamic militants clash daily with Russian forces; that backdrop has forced extraordinary security measures, heightened after two bombings in Volgograd that killed 34 people in December, and recent reports that female suicide bombers may have entered the Olympic Games enclave. The cost of building the untested facilities has been reported to be an unprecedented $51 billion. And Russian legislation banning homosexual \xe2\x80\x9cpropaganda\xe2\x80\x9d has prompted calls for protests and boycotts.'b'Moreover, Sochi has now become a symbol of how Russia is defining itself as a unique civilization no longer interested in integration with the West. With increasing forcefulness, Mr. Putin is offering instead a model for a world he portrays as weary of the West\xe2\x80\x99s arrogance and attempts to impose its values.'b'Sochi\xe2\x80\x99s message: Russia is a status quo power, while the United States is a revisionist power seeking to use the principles of democracy promotion and humanitarian intervention to force change on other governments around the world \xe2\x80\x94 including on Russia\xe2\x80\x99s borders and in Russia itself. Internationally, this self-image translates into support for absolute sovereignty and not meddling in other countries\xe2\x80\x99 domestic politics \xe2\x80\x94 at least in principle, if not in practice, when it comes to its own nearest neighbors, like Ukraine and Georgia.'b'Around the world, Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s message to authoritarian regimes is: We won\xe2\x80\x99t interfere in your internal affairs; your system of government is up to you. And vice versa.'b'Recently, President Putin asserted that Western Christianity had lost its moral compass by supporting L.G.B.T. rights and that the Russian Orthodox Church was the true guardian of Christian values. And, he added, these values are also compatible with traditional Islamic values \xe2\x80\x94 an important message in a country where ethnic and religious tensions are on the rise. The signal from Sochi is that the West has no right to impose its alien conceptions of \xe2\x80\x9chuman rights\xe2\x80\x9d on Russian Christians and Muslims, and that athletes and spectators should respect Russia\xe2\x80\x99s laws and customs. To that end, they should also refrain from using the special protest zone near the Games to express their opposition to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s laws.'b'Russia\xe2\x80\x99s quest for recognition has already suffered because of the refusal of Western leaders to attend the Games\xe2\x80\x99 opening ceremony, even though China\xe2\x80\x99s president, Xi Jinping, is going. The contrast with the high-level attendance at the Beijing Summer Olympics in 2008 is striking. Neither President Obama nor Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will attend, a decision made after Russia granted asylum to Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked agency documents.'b'Instead, the American delegation is to include several prominent gay athletes in an obvious rebuke to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s anti-gay laws. This is an appropriate response. A boycott reminiscent of the one against the 1980 Moscow Olympics would have hurt the American athletes without having any impact on Russia\xe2\x80\x99s L.G.B.T. legislation.'b'To be sure, the international community\xe2\x80\x99s reticence seems to have had some effect. In response to growing criticism of Russian human rights violations, and seeking to pre-empt any more, Mr. Putin unexpectedly granted amnesty before Christmas for the former oil tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, two members of the punk band Pussy Riot and other political prisoners. These releases, however, should not be mistaken for harbingers of liberalization, since many opposition activists remain in jail.'b'Sochi ought to have demonstrated how different Russia today is from the ailing country Mr. Putin inherited in 2000. If the Games go off without any terrorist incident or serious political clash, and if Russian athletes excel, Sochi may well fulfill the Russian president\xe2\x80\x99s immediate hopes. But the shiny new sports facilities only mask the deeper problems that Russia faces \xe2\x80\x94 a declining population, mortality rates for young men similar to those in sub-Saharan Africa, a growth rate predicted to remain at 1.4 percent for the next year and an economy that remains too dependent on the price of oil and on income from other energy exports.'b'The Sochi Olympics will not be the game changer Mr. Putin initially hoped for. After the spotlight is removed from the palm trees lining the Black Sea shore, the Kremlin will, true to its past, continue to assert itself forcefully on the international stage while postponing efforts to deal with its internal challenges.'b'The American and Japanese governments may have thought they had finally struck a deal to resolve a long-festering dispute over the United States military presence on Okinawa, but a familiar obstacle has reappeared: furious Okinawans, who will have to bear the consequences of the agreement.'b'On Dec. 27, Pentagon and Japanese officials announced an apparent breakthrough in the plan to move a Marine base from the city of Ginowan, on the prefecture\xe2\x80\x99s main island, where it is much resented, to a fishing hamlet in the small city of Nago, on the less-populated north of the island. They said Okinawa\xe2\x80\x99s governor had approved a necessary landfill permit to build two runways on a coral-filled bay there.'b'But on Jan. 19, residents of Nago re-elected a mayor adamantly opposed to the relocation. The mayor, Susumu Inamine, says he will do all he can to thwart the base construction, which Okinawans say will bring noise, pollution, crime and an environmental disaster to a quiet village and its pristine bay. Among other things, the bay is home to the Okinawan dugong, an extremely rare and endangered cousin of the manatee.'b'Okinawan resistance goes far deeper than everyday not-in-my-backyard complaints. But Japan\xe2\x80\x99s defense minister, Itsunori Onodera, dismissed the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s re-election as having no bearing on national policy, and the national government in Tokyo declared that the construction of the base would proceed as planned.'b'A resolution is essential, given the importance of America\xe2\x80\x99s military presence to regional stability. But the United States and Japan must be responsive to Okinawan concerns. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has tried to sway Nago residents with promises of a half-billion dollars in public-works spending, may yet find a way to entice Okinawans into acceptance. An abandoned plan to shift Marines to another base, Kadena, may need revisiting.'b'In any case, Mr. Abe and President Obama need to realize that there are three players in this drama. The third is Okinawa, which is part of Japan but has its own centuries-old history as an independent kingdom. It was the only part of Japan to be invaded and occupied by American forces, who fought their way onto the island in 1945 and have never left. Though Okinawa makes up less than 1 percent of Japan\xe2\x80\x99s land mass, mainland Japanese have been content to let Okinawans host more than half of the 50,000 American military personnel in the country. A base-relocation plan that protects American and Japanese strategic concerns cannot be allowed to unfairly burden Okinawa\xe2\x80\x99s citizens.'b'BERLIN \xe2\x80\x94  This year the Munich Security Conference turns 50. For decades the gathering has been one of the most important places for the trans-Atlantic community to exchange ideas, find common ground and devise foreign and security policy.'b'But when politicians, military and business leaders, think tank experts and journalists gather this Friday in southern Germany, they won\xe2\x80\x99t be in the mood for much celebration.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s because, over the last year, the Western security community has seen a series of setbacks unprecedented since the end of the Cold War. It finds itself in a period of strategic drift, with an increasingly isolationist superpower that seems to have lost the spirit to lead and a self-centered Europe unready to step up to the plate.'b'Of course, things haven\xe2\x80\x99t been always rosy in Munich. Just take the run-up to the Iraq war in 2003, when an emotional German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, uttered his now famous line \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, I am not convinced\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 in the face of an uneasy American defense secretary, Donald H. Rumsfeld, exposing the deep rift that American war plans had created in the West.'b'Not long after, the German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\xc3\xb6der, and the French president, Jacques Chirac, took things a step further, calling for a multilateral world to replace the unilateral order imposed by the United States.'b'Now we have a classic case of \xe2\x80\x9cbeware what you wish for.\xe2\x80\x9d Eleven years and one global financial crisis later, we can see in Syria what such a world might look like, with rogue states, regional wannabes and nonstate actors filling the vacuum that America\xe2\x80\x99s absence has created.'b'To be sure, the United States remains an unrivaled power, with military resources and economic prowess that no other nation can match. The risk is not so much that another country might take its place; in a way, it is that no one will.'b'Syria is a cautionary tale. It shows that the leadership vacuum is not going to be filled by benign actors, as Mr. Schr\xc3\xb6der and Mr. Chirac hoped, but by rogue actors like Al Qaeda, Hezbollah and Iran \xe2\x80\x94 and not only in Syria.'b'Libya is becoming a hotbed of extremism; Al Qaeda and other groups are using the town of Derna, near Benghazi, as a new logistics hub in the region. The borders of northern Africa are becoming increasingly porous, and global jihadis are using that erosion to their advantage. The order established by the colonial powers in the Middle East after the end of World War I is in danger of dissolving.'b'The situation would be less dire if Europe showed more ambition to take over some of America\xe2\x80\x99s balancing functions. But so far that seems to be a vain hope, both in practical and political terms.'b'Practically, Europe is steadily losing its capacity to project force over long distances for a prolonged time. Every year, in a usually cold and snowy Munich, the NATO secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, urges his organization\xe2\x80\x99s European members not to cut their defense budgets to the bone, or at least to do more pooling of resources to spend their money more efficiently. To no avail.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s partly for political reasons. In recent decades, many European states have largely outsourced their security to the United States, which provided a defensive umbrella and protected global trade routes vital for European commerce and energy supplies.'b'This enabled most Western European states to invest their money in lavish welfare systems instead of powerful armies.'b'As a result, many European countries have grown out of the habit of thinking in hard, strategic terms.'b'But Russia\xe2\x80\x99s recent efforts to force Ukraine and Armenia into abandoning Europe should be a reminder that we are not living in a world ruled by accepted international norms, as many Europeans believe.'b'The savage killing in Syria is proof, too, that there is no such thing as an \xe2\x80\x9cinternational community\xe2\x80\x9d that would intervene when the going got rough.'b'In recent years the Obama administration has used the Munich conference to assure Europeans that America\xe2\x80\x99s pivot to Asia doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean abandoning Europe and the Middle East.'b'And for a time, Europe chose to believe this. Enhancing its foreign and security posture didn\xe2\x80\x99t score high on the agenda while the Continent was fending off a financial meltdown. This year though, with the euro crisis seemingly contained, it might be the right time  for the United States to change script.'b'To be clear, further American disentanglement from the Middle East is not good for the region, or for the West as a whole.'b'But if this is where the United States is heading \xe2\x80\x94 as many experts fear \xe2\x80\x94  it would be better to challenge the Europeans with some frank talk in Munich.'b'The American delegation might say: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Middle East needs a strong outside stabilizer in order not to explode or become a large ungoverned space. But we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to own this region anymore, and strategically, it is much more important to you than to us, given our increasing energy independence. So prepare yourself to take over in five years or so. Because we will reduce our role to what is absolutely necessary. We will keep the Russians out, we will keep the Iranians down by preventing the bomb. But for the rest we want Europe to get in.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That would at least generate a real debate in Munich about what Europe can and should do to help stop the current trajectory of Western decline and to help shore up a liberal world order, which benefits an overwhelming majority of people worldwide.'b''b'\n'b'Clemens Wergin 'b' is the foreign editor of the German newspaper group Die Welt and the author of the blog Flatworld. 'b''b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 THERE are only two ways to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon: negotiations or military action.'b'Amazingly, after 34 years of mostly diplomatic silence between Iran and the United States, we are in the midst of negotiations with the potential to eliminate the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran.'b'Instead of cautiously welcoming this development and letting these talks play out over the next six months, however, some members of Congress are circulating proposals that seek to impose additional sanctions in the middle of the negotiations. This step, we fear, risks scuttling the process and could have damaging ramifications for the United States as well as our regional allies and partners, especially Israel.'b'The increasingly stringent economic sanctions that have been imposed on Iran over the last three decades have worked. Iran\xe2\x80\x99s new president, Hassan Rouhani, came to office last year promising an improved economy, and he seems to have quickly realized that the only way to deliver on this promise is by achieving relief from the sanctions. And so, with the approval of its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran has finally come to the table \xe2\x80\x94 reluctantly and grudgingly.'b'If the sanctions have worked, so the argument goes, won\xe2\x80\x99t additional sanctions work even better? If we just increase the pressure, won\xe2\x80\x99t we get a more favorable outcome? That logic would make sense only if Iran were a politics-free zone where a consensus existed in support of negotiations to end the country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.'b'But all evidence \xe2\x80\x94 from public statements as well as available intelligence \xe2\x80\x94 suggests that there is no such consensus. In fact, there are hard-line elements within the Iranian government and military who don\xe2\x80\x99t like the idea of negotiations, are not terribly worried about new sanctions (oligarchs always get what they need anyway), and feel that the nuclear program is a matter of national pride and, perhaps, national survival.'b'For us to impose additional sanctions under these circumstances (or threaten to impose additional sanctions) could be an \xe2\x80\x9cI told you so\xe2\x80\x9d moment for these hard-liners, providing the very excuse they\xe2\x80\x99re looking for to kill the negotiations and, with them, what is probably the best chance we have of resolving this incredibly dangerous situation without resorting to military action.'b'From our vantage point as senators serving on the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, the risk analysis is quite straightforward.'b'The potential upside of legislating further sanctions is the hope that increased pressure might elicit more concessions or push Iran to conclude a more favorable deal. But this is unlikely. The potential downside is more likely and more dangerous: Iran\xe2\x80\x99s decision makers could conclude that the United States government was not negotiating in good faith \xe2\x80\x94 a view that Iranian hard-liners already espouse. This could prompt Iran to walk away from the negotiations or counter with a new set of unrealistic demands while redoubling its efforts to produce nuclear weapons.'b'Instead of slowing Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, such legislation could actually accelerate its quest for atomic weapons, leaving a stark choice: Either accept the possibility of a nuclear-armed Iran, or use military force to stop it.'b'Worse still, it could alienate our international partners. The sanctions have been effective largely because of the active participation of many countries, including China and Russia. When the United States alone doesn\xe2\x80\x99t buy Iranian oil, it has little effect on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s economy, but when the European Union stops, and other major oil customers of Iran such as China, Japan, South Korea, India and Turkey significantly reduce their purchases (which they have), Iran is in trouble (which it is).'b'The countries that have joined America in ratcheting up the economic pressure on Iran all support the interim agreement that went into effect on Jan. 20. Legislation to impose additional sanctions by the United States could be interpreted by our partners as undermining the negotiations. This could have the adverse effect of lessening the international community\xe2\x80\x99s economic pressure on Iran, spooking our partners and diminishing their commitment to the cause.'b'Finally, under the terms of the interim agreement, the Iranians have six months to prove they are serious about this process. If they fail this test, the United States will surely act immediately to impose additional sanctions, and our international partners, understanding that we have given a negotiated approach a chance to succeed, are likely to join us.'b'We don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether Iran can be persuaded to peacefully give up its nuclear weapons ambitions \xe2\x80\x94 but it is very much in our interest to give this diplomatic process every chance to succeed.'b'Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was'b' in Brussels'b' last week seeking to repair relations with Europe, but the first place to look for a solution is within himself. Once hailed as the leader of a model Muslim democracy, he has created a political disaster at home, transforming Turkey into an authoritarian state that poses dangers not just for itself but for its allies in NATO, including the United States.'b'The latest turmoil has its roots in a political war between Mr. Erdogan\xe2\x80\x99s Justice and Development Party and his former close allies who follow Fethullah Gulen, a moderate Islamic scholar who lives in Pennsylvania. The tensions erupted into the open last month with a corruption probe that led to the resignation of four government ministers and threatened to ensnare Mr. Erdogan\xe2\x80\x99s family. The prime minister called the probe a \xe2\x80\x9ccoup attempt\xe2\x80\x9d and blamed a \xe2\x80\x9csecret organization\xe2\x80\x9d within the judiciary and police directed by the Gulen movement and serving \xe2\x80\x9cforeign powers\xe2\x80\x9d like the United States and Israel. The government has since purged hundreds of police officials and prosecutors and sought to assert control over the judiciary. It also 'b'drafted legislation'b' expanding the government\xe2\x80\x99s power to appoint judges and prosecutors, further breaching judicial independence, and has prevented journalists from reporting freely. All the while, Mr. Erdogan has spewed endless conspiracy theories and incendiary rhetoric, even hinting at American treachery and suggesting that the American ambassador might be expelled.'b'The probe and Mr. Erdogan\xe2\x80\x99s reaction may well be politically motivated. There are important local elections in March. But Mr. Erdogan should be insisting that the probe be fair and transparent, not trying to derail it. His ruthless ways and his attempt to crush dissent are not new, as the crackdown against demonstrators during protests last June showed. Such actions trample on democratic reforms demanded by the European Union as part of Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s bid for union membership, which may be more in peril than ever, and they are increasingly at odds with the ground rules for NATO members.'b'Germany\xe2\x80\x99s foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, was right when he said in Brussels that the Europeans must demand that Turkey return to the rule of law. The Obama administration also needs to send a strong message about the damaging course Mr. Erdogan is pursuing. Whether Turkey nurtures its hard-won democracy, which has contributed to its impressive economic growth, or turns authoritarian is as critical to regional stability and to its NATO allies as it is to Turks.'b'What began as a sovereignty dispute between China and Japan over uninhabited islets in the East China Sea has expanded into a battle of national egos in a worldwide public relations campaign. This month, for instance, China\xe2\x80\x99s ambassador to Britain, Liu Xiaoming, and Japan\xe2\x80\x99s, Keiichi Hayashi, each likened the other\xe2\x80\x99s country to the evil Lord Voldemort in the Harry Potter books.'b'Resorting to such schoolboy rhetoric does not help in reconciling differences between the two countries.'b'The current dispute began in September 2012, when the Japanese government nationalized the islets, which China claims, by purchasing land from private owners. China demanded that Japan denationalize the islets; Japan retorted that the islets were Japanese territory and simply denied the existence of any dispute. In time, both sides were sending ships and planes into the area, arousing fears around the world of an accidental war that could involve the United States, which has a treaty obligation to defend Japan.'b'Then, last December, the dispute expanded into the realm of history, threatening to spin differences out of control. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan visited the Yasukuni Shrine, which honors the country\xe2\x80\x99s war dead, including those executed as war criminals after World War II. China accused Mr. Abe of trying to revive Japanese militarism, while Chinese and Japanese ambassadors around the world began cranking up a public relations battle in local media, attacking each other as threats to world peace.'b'Absurdly, the two countries even managed to turn economic competition in Africa  into a public relations battle. Xie Xiaoyan, China\xe2\x80\x99s ambassador to Ethiopia, held a news conference at which he held up graphic photos of Japanese atrocities in China during World War II. On the Japanese side, Tomohiko Taniguchi, Mr. Abe\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman, commented that Japan will not just extract resources from Africa but create local jobs, an apparent jab at China\xe2\x80\x99s practice of using Chinese workers.'b'Hardly any country in the world wants to take sides in the Sino-Japanese battle of national egos. Instead of harping on history, China and Japan should tackle concrete issues to reconcile their differences \xe2\x80\x94 and there aren\xe2\x80\x99t that many.'b'LONDON \xe2\x80\x94 In Davos, Secretary of State John Kerry talked for a long time about Iran. He talked for a long time about Syria. He talked for a very long time about Israel-Palestine. And he had nothing to say about Egypt.'b'This was a glaring omission. Egypt, home to about a quarter of all Arabs and the fulcrum of the Arab Spring, is in a disastrous state. Tahrir Square, emblem of youthful hope and anti-dictatorial change three years ago, is home now to Egyptians baying for a military hero with the trappings of a new Pharaoh to trample on the \xe2\x80\x9cterrorists\xe2\x80\x9d of the Muslim Brotherhood.'b'Yet, in a speech devoted to rebutting what he called \xe2\x80\x9cthis disengagement myth\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the notion that a war-weary United States is retreating from the Middle East \xe2\x80\x94 Kerry was silent on a nation that is a United States ally, the recipient of about $1.3 billion a year in military aid (some suspended), and the symbol today of the trashing of American hopes for a more inclusive, tolerant and democratic order in the Middle East.'b'The silence was telling. The Obama administration has been all over the place on Egypt, sticking briefly with Hosni Mubarak, then siding with his ouster, then working hard to establish productive relations with the Muslim Brotherhood and its democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, then backing the military coup that removed Morsi six months ago (without calling it a coup) and finally arguing, in the words of Kerry last August, that the military headed by Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi was \xe2\x80\x9crestoring democracy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This \xe2\x80\x9crestoration\xe2\x80\x9d has in fact involved a fierce crackdown on the Brotherhood, named a terrorist organization on Dec. 25, and on anyone not bowing to Sisi, whose brutal new order has left well over 1,000 people dead. It has involved the rapid adoption of a Constitution drafted by a 50-member committee including only two representatives of Islamist parties, so providing a mirror image of the problems with Morsi\xe2\x80\x99s Islamist-dominated drafting process.'b'The Constitution won the approval this month of 98.1 percent of voters, a back-to-the-future number recalling Saddam Hussein\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9celections.\xe2\x80\x9d In fact this was 98.1 percent of the mere 38.6 percent of Egyptians who voted: Most Egyptians are either cowed in fear (the Brotherhood) or despairing (the Twitter-generation youth who ignited the Tahrir revolution) or reduced to apathy: So much for inclusiveness.'b'Egypt is the most vivid illustration of the American disengagement Kerry sought to rebut. Saudi and Emirati billions deployed behind Sisi have been more telling than America\xe2\x80\x99s paltry billion, or its training of Egyptian officers, or its pious expressions of backing for an Egypt offering equal rights to all citizens regardless of their gender, faith, ethnicity or political affiliation. America has watched and wavered as the most important Arab society lost its revolution to the familiar, arid juxtaposition of the military and Islamists (all of them now \xe2\x80\x9cterrorists\xe2\x80\x9d to the baying pro-Sisi crowd.)'b'This Egyptian debacle is a significant strategic failure for the United States, and of course, like red lines that proved not to be so red in Syria, it has sent a message of American retreat. It seems inevitable that Sisi will now run for president and win with some back-to-the-future number. If he does not run whoever does will be no more than his puppet.'b'David Kirkpatrick, my colleague in Cairo, said it all in 'b'this brilliant, depressing lead'b': \xe2\x80\x9cThousands of Egyptians celebrated the third anniversary of their revolt against autocracy on Saturday by holding a rally for the military leader who ousted the country\xe2\x80\x99s first democratically elected president.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mohamed Soltan, a 26-year-old American graduate of Ohio State University whose Egyptian father belongs to the Brotherhood and who was detained in Cairo in August, is one victim of that military leader. He 'b'wrote a devastating letter'b' to President Obama, recently made public by his family. Soltan sits in a \xe2\x80\x9cpacked underground cell,\xe2\x80\x9d being operated on for gunshot wounds without anesthetic by a doctor who is a cellmate wielding pliers, wondering if \xe2\x80\x9ctoday is going to be the day Americanness counts\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe Egyptian authorities will have no choice but to treat me like a human being.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Soltan is still waiting. As are the many Egyptian people who wanted to move toward a more open society, not back to one of countless political prisoners.'b'I was in Cairo in early January. Out at the Great Pyramid in Giza there was not one Western tourist. I went for a camel ride out of pity for the many camel owners doing zero business. The tourism industry, once an economic mainstay, is in tatters. It reflects the abject state of a great nation.'b'There is plenty of blame to go around \xe2\x80\x94 for Obama, for the hapless Morsi, for the paranoid power-grabbing Muslim Brotherhood, for the controlling military. But above all I blame the squabbling Egyptian liberals who fought for Mubarak\xe2\x80\x99s ouster but did not give democracy a chance.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'David Brooks should be applauded for pointing out that the next generation\xe2\x80\x99s well-being and success hinge not only on what we provide children during the early years, but also on how we serve them throughout childhood and adolescence (\xe2\x80\x9c'b'It Takes a Generation'b',\xe2\x80\x9d column, Jan. 24).'b'Adolescence is an especially weak link in our education and social service systems.

One of the candidates is an undocumented immigrant who readily identifies himself that way. In fact he\xe2\x80\x99s at or near the head of the pack.'b'His name is Emilio Vicente. He\xe2\x80\x99s a junior, 22, and a minority three times over: Latino, undocumented and gay. He came to the United States from Guatemala at 6, his mother leading him under barbed wire and into Arizona, as he recalls it. (He remembers the screech of a woman with them whose hair got caught.) And he flourished here, his grades earning him the private scholarship he needed for Chapel Hill, where he\xe2\x80\x99s on this committee, that board, a one-man whirlwind of engagement.'b'I hung out with him on Sunday, including at a meeting of his campaign team. They took stock of their efforts to meet the Tuesday deadline for 1,250 petition signatures. Emilio was already above 2,000. The election is Feb. 11, with a runoff, if needed, a week later.'b'His victory would be a milestone, not just locally but perhaps nationally, and it would be a chance, he told me, \xe2\x80\x9cto change the narrative of what it means to be undocumented.\xe2\x80\x9d It would be a vindication, too, and that\xe2\x80\x99s clear from his 'b'campaign site'b'.

From Arizona they made their way to Siler City, N.C., where his father plucked chickens in a big poultry plant. His mother got a job there, too.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey would come home from work and show me their hands \xe2\x80\x94 blistered, pruned,\xe2\x80\x9d Emilio remembered. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they said, \xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t want this.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d He buckled down to schoolwork, though it was hard, partly because his parents had little education and almost no English. And he stayed out of trouble, careful not to draw any attention to his family.'b'Things got tougher still. His father, who had taken a new job in a lumber plant, was paralyzed in an accident there. Homebound, dependent, he returned to relatives in Guatemala, Emilio\xe2\x80\x99s mother beside him. The choice belonged to Emilio, then 15: join them or stay in Siler City with an older brother who had managed to get to America.'b'It was our national anthem Emilio could sing, our president whose name he knew. He thought about the future and about his parents\xe2\x80\x99 hands. He stayed.'b'He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t seen his parents in seven years, because he can\xe2\x80\x99t re-enter the country if he leaves. He has no papers, no legal status. If the government didn\xe2\x80\x99t typically turn a blind eye to young people like him, he\xe2\x80\x99d be at risk of deportation, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really fear it, especially since President Obama in 2012 created renewable two-year 'b'reprieves'b' for productive young immigrants without criminal records, enabling them, for example, to be legally employed. Emilio is applying for one.'b'But a change in government could end that program. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include any durable peace of mind, not the kind offered by the long-stalled 'b'Dream Act'b', which creates a path to citizenship for many immigrants who were tugged here by their parents, are blameless for their illegal crossings, got educations in America, and are eager to lend their skills to this country.'b'Federal and state laws are a welter of contradictions. As an undocumented immigrant, Emilio can attend Chapel Hill, but must be considered a foreigner and pay out-of-state tuition. He\xe2\x80\x99s ineligible for state or federal aid. Lucky for him, his private scholarship covers the full cost. His many campus involvements, he said, are his way of saying thank you and giving back.'b'Republicans in Washington, who have been an obstacle to immigration reform, are about to unveil some 'b'new proposals'b', which reportedly will deal with the perverse limbos of young immigrants.'b'I sure hope so, because if we, as a country, aren\xe2\x80\x99t prepared to open our arms and workplaces to strivers like Emilio, who could so easily have sunk into self-pity and had to summon a grace and grit that many of us never manage, then we\xe2\x80\x99re not just callous.

The measures would allow states to apply their own standards to the cleanup of hazardous waste sites \xe2\x80\x94 standards that in most cases are likely to be considerably weaker than those governing the federal 'b'Superfund'b' program, the 1980 program that has identified thousands of toxic waste sites and cleaned up many of them.'b'The program has always required companies responsible for the pollution to clean it up; when responsibility could not be determined, a fund underwritten by special corporate taxes paid for the cleanup. But when Congress refused to renew those taxes in 1995, that part of the program became wholly dependent on annual appropriations, an increasingly dicey proposition. The Environmental Protection Agency would like to renew the corporate contributions, but the House 'b'legislation'b' would restrict its ability to do so. 'b'Other provisions'b' would make it harder to clean up Superfund sites by requiring the agency to follow state regulations even when they are weaker than federal rules, and the federal government would be restricted from adding new sites to the Superfund list without the consent of the states they are in.'b'The package is the latest House Republican proposal designed to undermine environmental protections. The House has tried to 'b'cut'b' the E.P.A.\xe2\x80\x99s budget substantially, attempted to strip the agency of its ability to regulate 'b'greenhouse gases'b' and sought to prevent the government from 'b'enforcing energy efficiency standards'b' for ceiling fans and other household appliances.'b'Thankfully, the Superfund measure, like the others, is expected to stall in the Senate. House Republicans know this. Their legislation is mainly intended to signal that they stand ready to do the bidding of polluters if the party manages to take control of the Senate.'b'In a disappointing order on Friday, the Supreme Court 'b'extended a temporary injunction'b' barring the Obama administration from enforcing paperwork rules against a Colorado nuns\xe2\x80\x99 group in connection with a federal law that requires employer health plans to cover birth control without a co-payment.'b'In its order, the justices required the Little Sisters of the Poor, which operates nursing homes, to file a written notice of its religious objection with the Health and Human Services Department. But they did not require the group to send a copy to its insurance administrator or to sign the normal government certification form that the nuns say would make them complicit in providing birth control and infringe on religious freedom in violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.'b'Religiously affiliated organizations like Little Sisters are exempt from having to provide contraceptive coverage if they offer a health insurance plan to their employees. The minor paperwork requirement frees them from having to \xe2\x80\x9ccontract, arrange, pay or refer for contraceptive coverage.\xe2\x80\x9d The notion that it substantially burdens religious liberty is ridiculous. It is especially ridiculous in this instance, since contraceptive coverage will not be made available to the group\xe2\x80\x99s employees even if the group ultimately loses its case. Its insurance plan is a self-insured \xe2\x80\x9cchurch plan,\xe2\x80\x9d which the government concedes does not have to provide birth control coverage.'b'The justices said their order, which stands while the group\xe2\x80\x99s suit goes before a federal appeals court, \xe2\x80\x9cshould not be construed as an expression of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s views on the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope that\xe2\x80\x99s true.'b'In March, the court will hear two more far-reaching cases challenging the birth control mandate brought by secular, profit-making companies, which are also claiming that the mandate infringes on their religious freedom. As in the nuns\xe2\x80\x99 case, the real threat to religious liberty is the unjustified effort by employers to impose their religious views on their employees.'b'Mayor Bill de Blasio went to Albany on Monday to answer the naysayers and skeptics \xe2\x80\x94 chief among them, Gov. Andrew Cuomo \xe2\x80\x94 who want him to abandon his prekindergarten plan and his tax on wealthy residents. Mr. de Blasio was there to make an ambitious case: to extend free, full-day, \xe2\x80\x9chigh-quality\xe2\x80\x9d pre-K across the city in two years, eventually to reach more than 73,000 4-year-olds.'b'The program (and a separate after-school initiative for middle-schoolers) is to be a transformative investment in the city\xe2\x80\x99s future. It would be paid for, he says, by a small, five-year income tax increase on those earning $500,000 a year or more.'b'It was his first Albany appearance as mayor, and the cameras and commentary seemed more suited to a prize fight than to an earnest debate over early education. But such is the passive-aggressive drama playing out in Albany. Mr. Cuomo has been trying to outmaneuver the mayor over pre-K, embracing him as friend and ally while doing what he can to bury Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s plan in favor of his own, which envisions pre-K statewide, someday, using existing state funds, with no tax increase.'b'What Mr. Cuomo hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done is give details. The mayor, on the other hand, makes a persuasive case in a paper released Monday, called \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Ready to Launch'b',\xe2\x80\x9d which shows that his pre-K team has thought this through \xe2\x80\x94 how many classrooms and teachers are needed, and how much it would cost per year ($340 million) and per student ($10,239). It would meet the need by expanding existing public school and community-based pre-K classes. The program would adhere to rigorous Common Core standards. Because the program is so big and expensive the mayor insists that it can work only if the Legislature allows the city to impose a dedicated tax, immune to the vagaries of year-to-year budget appropriations.'b'Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s plan is preliminary, and it has weak spots and unanswered questions. In less than nine months, the mayor will have to find about 2,000 more classrooms and lead teachers; where will they come from?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNew momentum around pre-K expansion,\xe2\x80\x9d the paper says, will lead to increased teacher applications. That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty optimistic. So is the assumption that community-based organizations, on their own, would add \xe2\x80\x9cclose to 20,000 seats.\xe2\x80\x9d The participation level is also unknown: There will have to be a huge effort, especially in poor neighborhoods, to get parents to sign up.'b'Mr. Cuomo and his allies complain that the mayor is moving too fast. They also argue that the pre-K situation does not justify the kind of tax increase the city generally imposes in dire emergencies, as when it hired more cops to fight crime in the 1990s. Whether the city\xe2\x80\x99s educational failures count as dire is a matter of opinion, though Mr. de Blasio answered that when he won the election \xe2\x80\x94 based in part on his pre-K promise.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe space is there, the personnel is there, the curriculum is there,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. de Blasio said on Monday, overstating the case. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re confident.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. de Blasio has a lot more to do to make this work. But he is pushing in the right direction and has already created a political consensus that pre-K is worth fighting over. Making the case for his plan and his tax is his responsibility as mayor. The people who elected him want it done. So, Albany, why not let him do it?'b'The recently released images from a cache of 55,000 photographs depicting emaciated, strangled and beaten corpses \xe2\x80\x94 allegedly taken in the jails of the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad \xe2\x80\x94 are terrible to view. They are also bewildering. The photographs, which document the deaths of some 11,000 detainees, were taken not by the opposition but at the behest of Mr. Assad\xe2\x80\x99s regime. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t such a government \xe2\x80\x94 wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t any government \xe2\x80\x94 want to hide its crimes rather than record them?'b'Though this trove of photographs was not meant for release \xe2\x80\x94 it was reportedly smuggled out of the country by a defector \xe2\x80\x94 these are not the first images of savagery produced by the Syrian regime. Mr. Assad\xe2\x80\x99s forces have disseminated numerous other photographs and videotapes documenting executions and torture that they have orchestrated. Meanwhile, anti-Assad jihadists proudly broadcast their own images of violence and mayhem (beheadings seem to be especially favored, sometimes accompanied by cheering crowds).'b'If the Spanish Civil War was the first conflict to be photographed, by Robert Capa and others, in a modern way \xe2\x80\x94 that is, up close on the battlefield and among civilians \xe2\x80\x94 the Syrian civil war may be the first truly postmodern conflict, at least when it comes to its images. Both sides are engaged in a perverse competition to show the world, and each other, how ruthlessly barbaric they can be. Aided by new technologies \xe2\x80\x94 the cellphone camera, YouTube, Instagram, social-media sites \xe2\x80\x94 these images of cruelty ricochet around the globe. The traditional role of war photojournalism has been turned on its head: Rather than expose atrocities, photographs now advertise them.'b'But in other ways the Syrian images are hardly unique. They are the culmination of a long and ignoble lineage of perpetrator photographs: pitiless pictures taken by tormentors of the violence and sadism they inflict on helpless victims. Some of these photographs are disgustingly graphic and reveal the ways in which the human body can be undone; others are quiet portraits of terror and powerlessness in the face of death. Some were taken by those working for recognized governments to impassively record mass murder; others, often exultant, were taken by soldiers on their own or by members of guerrilla groups, paramilitaries or terrorist organizations.'b'The largest and most notorious collection of such images, combining both official and \xe2\x80\x9cautonomous\xe2\x80\x9d photographs, was taken by Nazi photographers, soldiers and civilian supporters: in the Jewish ghettos, on the Eastern front, in the occupied countries, even in some of the concentration camps (Auschwitz employed two official SS photographers).'b'More recently, members of Sierra Leone\xe2\x80\x99s Revolutionary United Front, famed for their mass amputations of their countrymen, photographed themselves as they committed some of their atrocities. So did some of Saddam Hussein\xe2\x80\x99s Baathists, as well as the Scorpions, a feared Serbian paramilitary force. Several years ago, Hizbul Islam, an Islamist militia in Somalia, invited a photographer to document its death-by-stoning of a man accused of adultery; the resulting photographs are as close to unviewable as any I have ever seen. And some of the most searing and unforgettable images from the post-9/11 era \xe2\x80\x94 including the beheading of the Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl and the Abu Ghraib torture photos \xe2\x80\x94 surely fall in the category of perpetrator images.'b'Other sets of perpetrator photographs display what we might call the \xe2\x80\x9ccool gaze\xe2\x80\x9d of murderous regimes as they go about their business; such photographs are not always overtly violent, though they are always cruel. Stalin\xe2\x80\x99s police photographed condemned political prisoners in Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s infamous Lubyanka prison before their executions; their faces peer out at us in sadness, fear and bewilderment. The recently revealed photographs from Mr. Assad\xe2\x80\x99s secret jails, though far more graphic, fall under this rubric. Here, again, photography becomes a handy appendage in the bureaucratic manufacture of death.'b'There is a double horror in the act of looking at perpetrator images. First and most obviously, they show repellent things, fearsome things, unbearable things \xe2\x80\x94 things that we would like to believe human beings don\xe2\x80\x99t really do to one another. But this revulsion is intensified by the knowledge that these images were made not as protests against viciousness but rather in celebration, or at least documentation, of it. The very existence of such photographs testifies to the fact that such acts can be cause for satisfaction, for pride, for glory \xe2\x80\x94 or even for amusement. (It is striking how many smiles appear in the Nazi photographs and those from Abu Ghraib.)'b'This is why there is such resistance to looking at perpetrator photographs, and why they are often dismissed as \xe2\x80\x9ctorture porn\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a handy excuse that relieves us of the burden of viewing and thinking about them. They present a sharp challenge to modern concepts of universalism, to the comforting belief that \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d are all essentially the same and that the family of man, while sometimes disputatious, can unite on at least some basic common values. Not so. Perpetrator photographs reveal how terribly different people can be and how terribly easy it is to excise others from the category of the human. As one of Mr. Assad\xe2\x80\x99s supporters asked of the tortured corpses, \xe2\x80\x9cAre they innocent political prisoners or are they Al Qaeda?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The documentary photographers of the early 20th century, and especially the early war photographers, believed that the revelation of violence and oppression would lead to saving action. Some even dreamed of a world without war and exploitation. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they ever imagined that the camera would become a tool with which to proclaim and affirm, rather than fight against, the most hideous aspects of war and the most fearsome authoritarian regimes. Their dream has become our nightmare.'b'The country unveils an inclusive new constitution.'b'Regarding \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Obama\xe2\x80\x99s losing bet on Iran'b',\xe2\x80\x9d (Opinion, Jan. 16): Michael Doran and Max Boot, in trying to discredit the idea that rapprochement with Iran would bring benefits to the United States and the world, make a weak case.

They then cite the Sunni attack on the Iranian Embassy in Beirut by way of making another rather unclear point about Sunni militarism.

VENKATACHALAM Vadodara, India'b''b'DHAKA, Bangladesh \xe2\x80\x94  In early December, after weeks of strikes and road blocks called by the political opposition, the dairy farmers of the Rangpur district, in northern Bangladesh, started protesting the disruption to their business by pouring milk onto highways. For many weeks, they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to get their milk to the processing and packaging plants in the capital; instead, they had to sell it to local confectioners and small restaurants. Supply far outstripped demand.'b'Across the country, an average of half a million liters of milk was dumped every day that the opposition called a general strike or a blockade. After many such protests since late October, the dairy industry was on its knees. Many small farmers, like those in Rangpur, had borrowed money to buy their livestock and could no longer afford to feed their cows; they started selling the animals and looking for other ways to make a living.'b'Supermarket shelves in Dhaka grew more sparse. They carried little fresh milk, and no butter, except for shockingly expensive brands imported from India and Australia.'b'The crisis erupted after the opposition, led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its ally Jamaat-e-Islami, objected to holding a national election unless the government first handed over power to a neutral caretaker body; it feared rigging otherwise. When the ruling Awami League refused, the opposition leader Khaleda Zia called a series of crippling protests.'b'B.N.P. supporters and Jamaat-e-Islami unleashed their anger on anyone who defied the strikes, destroying roads, damaging rail lines, torching buses \xe2\x80\x94 and killing about 200 people since late October, according to the British newspaper The Independent.'b'The milk farmers\xe2\x80\x99 plight was just one example of the colossal waste caused by the chaos surrounding the election. Supply roads to the capital were obstructed, and across the country, milk soured on roads and vegetables rotted in fields. The garment industry, a major engine of the economy, was in jeopardy because of delayed deliveries to international buyers. Shahidullah Azim, vice president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, told Reuters early this month that up to $1 billion in orders were at risk in the weeks ahead if stability did not return.'b'But as political negotiations foundered, the opposition decided to boycott the election. So when the vote took place on Jan. 5, like many of my fellow citizens, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother to cast a ballot. The sole candidate in my constituency \xe2\x80\x94 an ally of the Awami League \xe2\x80\x94 was running uncontested. Some 152 other members of Parliament from the Awami League and affiliated parties also ran against no competition, and the 147 remaining Awami League contestants faced off against weak independent candidates. (In the end, the Awami League won 232 out of 300 seats.) Bangladesh is now in the unprecedented situation of having a Parliament with no real opposition.'b'How much staying power can such a government have? Enough to serve the whole term, it turns out, no matter how dysfunctional the situation. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has had the good sense of forming a new cabinet that is relatively fresh and untainted, leaving behind many ministers suspected of corruption. And while the Awami League has taken a hit in terms of popularity for staging an election with no serious contender, the B.N.P. seems to have come out of the experience even more discredited.'b'Many people have been put off by its hard-line stance and violent tactics. The B.N.P. has refused to sever its links to the right-wing Jamaat-e-Islami, even though that group was widely believed to be behind much of the street violence. On polling day and in subsequent weeks, Hindu minorities were targeted by Jamaat-e-Islami members simply for having gone out to vote. Especially in northern districts, where religious minorities are concentrated, Hindu families have been attacked, their homes torched and their businesses destroyed. According to one count, up to 700 people may have been affected. These attacks have been widely condemned, and not just by Hindus, with protests taking place throughout the country.'b'Most important, economic considerations will prevail over concerns about political representation, and this will favor the new status quo. The cost of more upheaval would be too high, and the prevailing mood now is for restoring economic stability. Businesses cannot afford another disruptive year. The Center for Policy Dialogue, an independent think tank, estimates the total economic loss at more than $6.3 billion.  The transport sector has borne the brunt of the losses, followed by the agricultural sector and the clothing and textile industries.'b'Previous elections in Bangladesh were celebrated with great fanfare: Voters would display their inky thumbs with pride. Not this time. Still, after the near-standstill of this fall, a semblance of normality has returned. There has been no major public outcry yet over this lopsided election. Children are going back to school. The roads in the capital are reassuringly clogged with traffic again. Butter has returned to the supermarket shelves. The fundamental political issues remain, but for now, an uneasy peace holds.'b''b'\n'b'Tahmima Anam 'b' is a writer and anthropologist, and the author of the novel \xe2\x80\x9cA Golden Age.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b''b'PARIS \xe2\x80\x94  L\xe2\x80\x99Affaire Hollande reminds us that there are two ways to consider a statesman\xe2\x80\x99s private life. He is either a priest, or a king. If he is a priest, he can have only the nation for his mistress: the state is a church, of which he is the national pope; his sex life is sacrificed for the well-being of his fellow citizens.'b'In France we\xe2\x80\x99ve had some priests. Robespierre, a leader of the French Revolution who unleashed a wave of beheadings, was a chaste man. General Charles de Gaulle was a faithful husband who served as a priest for the glory of France. The United States, as well, has had priest-presidents. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, George W. Bush were priests, at least as far as we know. But Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton behaved more like kings. There have also been Marxist priests around the world, such as Venezuela\xe2\x80\x99s Hugo Ch\xc3\xa1vez and the leaders of North Korea.'b'What is a king? He\xe2\x80\x99s a man who lists among the pleasures of life the exquisite company of women. To lead armies and to sign treaties are gestures of regal power, but these acts don\xe2\x80\x99t stop men from behaving like Frank Sinatra. In France, all great kings were known for the beauty of their favorites, their legendary mistresses, Diane de Poitiers or Louise de La Valli\xc3\xa8re, Madame de Montespan or La Du Barry. One king of France who had no mistress, Louis XVI, was sent to the guillotine by Robespierre, who had none either. French monarchs will always prefer a lovely woman to a hideous guillotine.'b'Other European monarchies behave similarly. Just watch the discreet escapades of the current king of Spain, Juan Carlos. See the illegitimate children of Albert II of Belgium and Albert II of Monaco. Also see Prince Charles of England, who cheated on Diana with Camilla Parker-Bowles, before marrying her.'b'France is both a republic and an old monarchist country. Its presidents tend to behave like kings. In 1899, President F\xc3\xa9lix Faure died in the \xc3\x89lys\xc3\xa9e Palace during an amorous liaison with his mistress, Marguerite Steinheil. Since 1974, all French presidents have been womanizers. Val\xc3\xa9ry Giscard d\xe2\x80\x99Estaing had a weakness for actresses and African beauties. Fran\xc3\xa7ois Mitterrand was famous as a Don Juan, and it was revealed in 1995 that he had a hidden daughter, young Mazarine Pingeot. Jacques Chirac had a revealing nickname: \xe2\x80\x9c10 minutes, shower included.\xe2\x80\x9d He was thought to prefer loafers to lace-up shoes because they were quicker to remove in cases of a pressing desire. Nicolas Sarkozy got divorced while in power to marry the lovely Carla Bruni.'b'So we have our modern Louis XIV, our current Mesdames de Maintenon. We even have men who want to be king and behave as if they were riding in a horse-drawn carriage with La Du Barry. Such was Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who thought he was king of France when he was only duke of the International Monetary Fund.'b'Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande is no exception to the rule. For a long time, he was an ambitious young man, father of four along with his companion S\xc3\xa9gol\xc3\xa8ne Royal. Even though he dreamed of behaving like Dean Martin in the locker rooms of the Las Vegas Sands casino, he had to obey the rules of the French Socialist Party, which is, politically, a party of strict and moralistic bigwigs, a party of priests. Although no one in France should underestimate the Tartuffe character, created by Moli\xc3\xa8re in the 17th century, model of the false bigot who strokes a servant behind walls, like a wigged Elmer Gantry. While getting closer to power, Mr. Hollande started to dream of monarchy, which brought with it access to women.'b'According to the Kremlinologists of the socialist love science, he started an affair around 2005 with an imperious, beautiful journalist, Val\xc3\xa9rie Trierweiler. For several years, she stayed a hidden, backstreet mistress. Then Mr. Hollande separated from his children\xe2\x80\x99s mother to live with his mistress. So when he was elected president of the French Republic in 2012, Val\xc3\xa9rie Trierweiler appeared at his side. At that moment, the scenario was written on the wall: Bewitched by a long dynasty of royal loves, President Hollande was bound to be soon dissatisfied with Madame Trierweiler, his official partner. He needed a Du Barry. As the saying goes, \xe2\x80\x9cA man who cheated once will cheat again.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Du Barry of 2014 has the face of a charming 41-year-old actress, Julie Gayet. Since we live in a time of paparazzi and soap operas, the lovers have been discovered by a hidden camera, and the pictures have been published in a street magazine. Today, George Washington would be treated just like Kim Kardashian. And here we are, with news of the affair a worldwide buzz, provoking a schizophrenic reaction in France: the priest lying dormant in each of us blames the vagaries of a king that we could well send to the guillotine. But the subjects of the kingdom reflect that a loving monarch is a man with a heart.'b'Who will win? Robespierre or F\xc3\xa9lix Faure?

This article was translated from the French by Philippe G\xc3\xa9lie.'b''b'After the final articles of Tunisia\xe2\x80\x99s new constitution were approved on Sunday, legislators rose to their feet, flashing victory signs and applauding before singing the national anthem. They have good reason to celebrate. After a long and often fraught process, Tunisia has managed to produce the most liberal constitution in the Arab world, and it has done so through consensus.'b'The Arab Spring began in Tunisia three years ago when a desperate fruit vendor set himself on fire, unleashing a wave of protests by angry citizens against tyrannical regimes across the Middle East. Egypt, Yemen and Libya remain mired in the turmoil that followed. Tunisia also traversed hard times, including deep political divisions, the assassination of two opposition political leaders and terrorist threats. But legislators across the political spectrum never gave up on their country\xe2\x80\x99s future, taking more than two years to hammer out every article of the new constitution until nearly everyone could back it. In the end, the constitution was approved by an overwhelming 200 of Tunisia\xe2\x80\x99s 216-member National Constituent Assembly.'b'While Tunisia\xe2\x80\x99s new constitution names Islam as the country\xe2\x80\x99s religion, it guarantees freedom of worship and a secular rule of law. The constitution also bans torture, and guarantees women parity in political bodies. Power has been handed over to a caretaker government led by Mehdi Jomaa, a former minister of industry and an engineer by training. Elections are expected to be held later this year.'b'Tunisia still faces challenges. Its economy is in tatters and unemployment seems stuck at 17 percent. Riots over economic conditions broke out earlier this month. Not all the Islamists are happy with the concessions they had to make.'b'Western governments, human rights and civil society groups gave Tunisia valuable support through the process of forging its new constitution. This is not the time for international lending institutions, eager for Tunisia to cut public spending and reduce its  deficit, to lean too hard. The last thing Tunisia\xe2\x80\x99s  government needs is a new reason for long-suffering citizens to hit the streets again in protest.'b'Tunisia\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable achievement proves that consensus among bitterly divided political rivals is possible, and that respect for democratic rights and freedoms is compatible with deeply held religious beliefs and cultural values. That is a valuable lesson for the rest of the Arab world, and beyond.'b'More than a decade after it defaulted on its foreign debts, Argentina is again facing a financial crisis caused largely by misguided government policies.'b'The administration of President Cristina Fern\xc3\xa1ndez de Kirchner recently 'b'devalued'b' the peso and relaxed some capital controls in an effort to preserve the country\xe2\x80\x99s dwindling foreign reserves. The government is hoping that these steps will 'b'ease'b' some of the pressure on the currency, which does not float freely against the dollar. But Argentina needs to do a lot more to address inflation and other underlying economic problems that have led investors and ordinary citizens to bet against the peso.'b'In the years after its painful default in 2002, which wiped out the savings of millions of people, Argentina enjoyed a 'b'fast-growing economy'b' thanks in part to the booming world demand for soybeans and other commodities the country exports. But Mrs. Kirchner squandered the recovery in recent years by increasing spending on wasteful subsidies and financing the government partly by printing pesos. As a result, inflation has shot up; independent economists estimate that consumer prices'b' jumped 'b'28 percent last year. The official inflation rate was only 10.9 percent but few economists or the International Monetary Fund find that data credible.'b'Mrs. Kirchner has also hurt the economy by picking unnecessary fights with private businesses and investors. In recent years, she 'b'nationalized'b' an oil company, an airline and pension funds. And, in 2011, the country implemented controls on how many pesos its citizens could convert into dollars, which has helped create a thriving black market for currency transactions and undermined public confidence in the government\xe2\x80\x99s economic policies. A 'b'recent poll'b' showed that three-quarters of the country said the economy was headed in the wrong direction.'b'Government officials have begun taking some small steps to correct past mistakes. For example, the economy minister, Axel Kicillof, 'b' has been negotiating 'b'compensation for the oil company, YPF, that the government seized in 2012. And Argentina will put out a new inflation index next month to convince the I.M.F. to accept its official data again. But Mrs. Kirchner will have to take much bolder steps to repair the damage.'b'Washington \xe2\x80\x94 Ukraine is on the verge of spinning out of control. A pro-European protest that began more than two months ago in Kiev\xe2\x80\x99s central square has flared into broad, angry opposition to the authoritarian policies of President Viktor F. Yanukovych. If the United States and European Union wish to encourage a peaceful resolution, they must use their leverage now. Otherwise the situation could degenerate further, to the point where the West will be no more than a spectator.'b'Since its failed initial crackdown in late November, the Yanukovych government has procrastinated, employed force, and only recently offered political dialogue. This has not worked. As the government brought more police into Kiev, demonstrators became impatient with the standoff and attacked police lines. They ignored calls by the opposition leaders Vitali Klitschko and Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk to remain peaceful. Clashes in Kiev have left several protesters dead and hundreds injured, and demonstrations have spread across the country.'b'In a sign that he understands the precarious nature of his position, Mr. Yanukovych has begun to offer concessions \xe2\x80\x94 including a proposal on Monday to revoke laws pushed through Parliament on Jan. 16 that severely restrict political dissent. These concessions might have helped resolve the crisis a month or even two weeks ago. Now, however, the government is offering too little, too late. Even Prime Minister Mykola Azarov\xe2\x80\x99s offer to resign on Tuesday seems unlikely to appease the protesters.'b'In \xe2\x80\x9cThe Anatomy of Revolution,\xe2\x80\x9d Crane Brinton famously observed that revolutions replace moderates with radicals, who then fall to authoritarians. Whether or not Ukraine is entering a revolutionary moment, the moderates\xe2\x80\x99s hold clearly is loosening.'b'If the West seeks a peaceful settlement that returns Ukraine to a democratic path before mass violence erupts, this is the time to act. Washington and Brussels should immediately coordinate on several messages.'b'First, United States and European Union officials should make clear to Mr. Yanukovych that he must refrain from the use of force and must negotiate seriously to find a resolution to the crisis. That means going beyond his latest proposals. He must offer shared control over state security organs with the opposition. He needs to provide concrete assurances that the 2015 presidential election will be free and fair, including that Mr. Klitschko can run and that former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko will be released from prison.'b'Second, American and European officials should directly engage Mr. Yanukovych\xe2\x80\x99s inner circle and underscore that they need to act now to promote a settlement or face Western visa and financial sanctions. Washington took a good first step on Jan. 22 when it announced the revocation of visas for officials linked to the use of force. It should add financial sanctions and threaten also to target those close to Mr. Yanukovych, as well as their families, if they do not use their influence to end the crisis. The European Union should join in; it is in Europe that Ukrainian oligarchs close to the president park their money, buy luxury residences, travel on holiday, and send their children to school. People such as the oligarch Rinat Akhmetov must understand that they have a personal stake in achieving a peaceful, democratic settlement.'b'Third, American and European officials should press the opposition not to overreach. They should leave Mr. Yanukovych a way out. He could still order the police to move against the demonstrators. While that would undoubtedly hasten his departure from office, it could also mean more bloodshed and increase the stress on Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s unity.'b'Fourth, the European Union has already taken the good step of dispatching Stefan F\xc3\xbcle, the Union\xe2\x80\x99s commissioner for enlargement, to Kiev to mediate between the sides. Brussels needs to maintain a high-level team in Kiev for the duration of the crisis. In parallel, American and European diplomatic officials should visibly monitor the streets of Kiev: that makes it harder for the government to launch a crackdown and easier for opposition leaders to control less-disciplined protesters.'b'Fifth, Washington and Brussels need a coordinated message for Moscow. The West should be transparent with President Vladimir Putin about its actions. European leaders should caution Mr. Putin against taking steps that would intensify the crisis, a message that President Obama should send as well. Mr. Putin should understand that rough stuff with Ukraine would cast a shadow over his hopes as host for the 2014 Olympic Games in Sochi next month.'b'Western influence in Ukraine is real but limited and could fade. The United States and European Union should apply it now, lest the West find itself watching Ukraine succumb to widespread violence that it cannot stop.'b''b' The writers are former ambassadors to Ukraine.

They have voted more than 40 times to wipe the law from the books. But Republicans have never gotten around to describing, in detail, the set of policies they believe should replace Obamacare. That is, until yesterday.'b'After nearly four years, we finally have a Republican counterproposal: the Patient Choice, Affordability, Responsibility and Empowerment (or 'b'Patient CARE'b') Act.'b'Senators Tom Coburn, Richard Burr and Orrin Hatch deserve credit for developing this plan. Putting together a proposal to reform the American health care system is hard and politically courageous. And while it is lacking in important details, this plan contains some interesting ideas that might have enabled bipartisan compromises had they been offered in 2009, when I was a health care adviser to the Obama administration and the Affordable Care Act was being debated. For instance, the plan would shift many low-income adults from Medicaid to subsidized private insurance. There are some Democrats who could certainly have supported such a proposal, if it had been offered as part of a deal to enact a bipartisan bill.'b'Despite all the heated rhetoric from Republicans about Obamacare laying ruin to America, the plan would actually keep some of the law\xe2\x80\x99s key provisions. It would preserve some subsidies for lower-income people to buy private insurance, though it would change the way they are calculated. Those $700 billion worth of Medicare savings Mitt Romney denounced during the 2012 campaign? Republicans would keep them. Allowing young adults to stay on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 plan until age 26? Republicans would keep that, too. And the ban on lifetime insurance caps, so people with very expensive diseases don\xe2\x80\x99t lose insurance? Republicans wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t touch it.'b'But in other crucial ways, the Republican plan is different. First, Obamacare\xe2\x80\x99s absolute ban on withholding coverage from people with pre-existing conditions would be rolled back. Those who remained continuously insured would stay protected, so they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be charged higher rates or be excluded entirely. But if their insurance lapsed, health insurance companies could charge more or refuse to cover them.'b'Second, it would shrink the Medicaid expansion. Pregnant women, children and families below the poverty line would still be eligible, but childless adults would not. States would be given a fixed amount per person enrolled in Medicaid to reduce spending.'b'Third, the Republicans would provide tax credits for people to buy insurance, but only for families earning up to $70,650 per year. (The Affordable Care Act\xe2\x80\x99s subsidies go to families earning up to $94,200.) And employees of large companies, even if those companies did not offer health insurance, would be exempt, regardless of income.'b'The largest difference is in cost control. Currently, employer-sponsored health insurance is tax free; the Republican plan would make employees pay income tax on at least 35 percent of what their company pays for their plan. The idea is to make patients pay more for their coverage, giving them an incentive to choose cheaper health insurance plans with more deductibles and co-payments, which, in turn, would encourage them to shop around for cheaper tests and treatments and forgo unnecessary ones.'b'On a more individual level, this is what the Republican plan means: If you are one of the 150 million Americans who get their health insurance through an employer-sponsored plan, get ready for a big tax increase. For a family in the 28 percent tax bracket (earning around $150,000 per year), according to my calculations, it would add up to about $1,470 per year.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s how you get that number: In 2013, the average employer-sponsored insurance plan cost $16,351 for a family of four. On average, employers pay 72 percent of that premium, or $11,786. The Republican plan taxes 35 percent of the employer contribution, meaning that an additional $4,125 would be counted as income and subject to both payroll and income taxes. So that family would pay about $1,154 in income taxes and $316 in payroll taxes \xe2\x80\x94 $1,470 per year. Obviously, people would pay even more if their health-insurance premium was higher, if they were in a higher tax bracket, or if their state had an income tax.'b'People who don\xe2\x80\x99t get insurance through their employer would also be likely to pay more. The Republican plan would provide the unemployed, people in the individual market and those working for small businesses that don\xe2\x80\x99t provide health insurance a tax credit to buy private insurance. But the credit increases only by age, not by need \xe2\x80\x94 which means people with lower incomes would pay much more than they would under Obamacare. For example, under the Republican plan, a 30-year-old man living in New York City earning $35,000 a year would pay the full price of insurance, roughly $4,383 for a typical plan. Under Obamacare, he would pay $3,325. A 30-year-old earning $25,000 would get a $1,560 tax credit and pay roughly $2,823 under the Republican plan, but pay only $1,728 under Obamacare.'b'In addition, the proposed plan would take us back to the old days when insurance companies could charge women more than men for the same health plan. And older people would also be penalized. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies are allowed to charge 64-year-olds only three times what they charge 21-year-olds. But the Republican plan allows insurance companies to charge 64-year-olds five times more. So a 64-year-old individual could pay as much as $21,900 for a plan that costs a 21-year-old only $4,380.'b'The plan would bring back many insurance company shenanigans. For instance, the decision to roll back the ban on excluding those with pre-existing conditions sounds O.K. in theory: \xe2\x80\x9cindividuals moving from one health plan to another \xe2\x80\x94 regardless of whether it was in the individual, small group, or large employer markets \xe2\x80\x94 could not be medically underwritten,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning charged higher premiums based on a disease, and \xe2\x80\x9cdenied a plan based on a pre-existing condition if they were continuously enrolled in a health plan.\xe2\x80\x9d So if you lose your job and therefore your employer-sponsored health insurance, you would not be excluded for a pre-existing condition if you immediately bought your own insurance. But if there were a gap in coverage, insurance companies could deny you coverage.'b'What if the paperwork you filled out is \xe2\x80\x9clost\xe2\x80\x9d? The history of insurance companies\xe2\x80\x99 tricks for denying coverage to high-cost patients \xe2\x80\x94 like revoking the insurance of a cancer patient who failed to disclose that she had back problems \xe2\x80\x94 does not inspire confidence.'b'Finally, there is the issue of prevention. The Affordable Care Act made preventive services free. To save money, Republicans want to reverse that, so that Americans will behave like cost-conscious consumers \xe2\x80\x94 getting their blood tests at a cheaper laboratory or their CT scans at the cheaper imaging center. The problem is that mountains of evidence show that when patients have to pay, prevention is the first thing to go, in part because people aren\xe2\x80\x99t suffering pain or other symptoms, and the benefits of preventive services are typically years away. Saving money by cutting back these services makes no economic sense in the long-term.'b'There are many other problematic things the Republican plan does, like eliminate the health law\xe2\x80\x99s taxes on health insurance, drug and device companies; allow insurance companies to sell plans that don\xe2\x80\x99t cover maternity, mental health or other types of care; and allow insurance companies to impose annual limits on benefits.'b'We finally got the \xe2\x80\x9creplace\xe2\x80\x9d part of the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 pledge to \xe2\x80\x9crepeal and replace\xe2\x80\x9d the Affordable Care Act. Now that Americans have the chance to examine the alternative, it might help them see the advantages of Obamacare.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'For the Mentally Ill, It\xe2\x80\x99s Worse'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (column, Jan. 25):'b'Joe Nocera describes yet another example of a well-intentioned law that has brought about devastating unintended consequences.

The horrifying chemical spill that recently contaminated the drinking water of hundreds of thousands of people in West Virginia is the latest in a relentless series of disasters and near-misses across the country.'b'It is clear to me, as chairman of the independent federal agency charged with investigating industrial chemical accidents, that urgent steps are required to significantly improve the safety of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s chemical industry \xe2\x80\x94 an industry vital to our economy, yet potentially dangerous to those who live near the thousands of facilities that process or store hazardous chemicals.'b'Those facilities include ones like the Chevron refinery in Richmond, Calif., where aging, corroding pipes resulted in a huge fire in August 2012, and the fertilizer plant in West, Tex., where stores of ammonium nitrate exploded last year and laid waste to a large part of the town, killing more than a dozen people.'b'Sifting through chemical-plant rubble from catastrophic accidents year after year, our board has long called on regulators to require \xe2\x80\x94 and for industry to adopt \xe2\x80\x94 what is known as 'b'inherently safer technology'b'. By this, we mean using safer designs, equipment and chemicals, minimizing the amounts of hazardous chemicals stored and used, and modifying and simplifying processes to make them as safe as practicable.'b'While there is now, at last, a strong current within industry to adopt this safer technology as a best practice, many still oppose any actual regulatory requirements, arguing they are too costly and prescriptive. We can\xe2\x80\x99t wait for corporations to volunteer, because the accidents continue, often with devastating consequences.'b'What we need is comprehensive regulatory reform. But achieving safety reforms is complicated and time-consuming. In the interim, the Environmental Protection Agency should step in and use its power under the Clean Air Act\xe2\x80\x99s general duty clause to compel chemical facilities to take steps to make their operations inherently safer. The law assigns owners and operators of these facilities a general duty to identify hazards, design and maintain safe facilities and minimize the consequences of leaks. The E.P.A. should follow up by adopting specific regulations to meet those goals.'b'Twelve years ago, the E.P.A.\xe2\x80\x99s administrator, Christine Todd Whitman, proposed regulations that would have encouraged producers and users of high-risk chemicals to find safer alternatives or processes.'b'But her proposal stalled in the face of strong opposition from American companies, which are already required to use safer technologies and other risk reduction methods at their European operations. (Insurance data indicate that losses from refinery accidents, for instance, are at least three times lower in Europe than in the United States.) In 2012, Ms. Whitman urged the agency to use the Clean Air Act to require safer technology \xe2\x80\x9cbefore a tragedy of historic proportions occurs.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The E.P.A. said recently that it was considering such an approach. The agency\xe2\x80\x99s own National Environmental Justice Advisory Council has urged it to issue new rules to reduce the \xe2\x80\x9cdanger and imminent threat\xe2\x80\x9d posed by chemical plants, manufacturing and transport. Across the nation, an estimated 13,000 facilities store or process chemicals in amounts hazardous enough to endanger the public, according to the E.P.A.'b'But that estimate understates the dimensions of the problem. For example, the West Virginia facility implicated in the recent spill, which stored chemicals used in the coal industry, would not fall under criteria used by the agency to come up with its estimate.'b'Consider how a requirement forcing safer practices and technologies might have prevented the three accidents I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned.'b'The Chevron refinery would have been required to replace aging, corroded pipes with safer corrosion-resistant material that almost certainly would have prevented the rupture that endangered 19 workers caught in the initial vapor cloud, not to mention the smoke plume that sent 15,000 Bay Area residents to hospitals. The refinery industry accident rate overall is unacceptably high.'b'The agricultural chemical company in West, Tex., would have used safer storage practices and safer fertilizer blends, and kept far less ammonium nitrate on site. The lives of more than a dozen firefighters and residents might have been spared, and the widespread damage to homes, schools, a nursing home and other structures would not have occurred.'b'And the decades-old chemical storage tank in West Virginia that leaked as much as 10,000 gallons of chemicals used in coal processing into the nearby Elk River, contaminating the water supply of some 300,000 Charleston-area residents, would have been moved and replaced by modern, anti-leak storage tanks and safer containment.'b'After the West, Tex., explosion, President Obama issued an executive order requiring federal agencies to review safety rules at chemical facilities. I am strongly encouraged by the White House leadership on this issue. The E.P.A. is working with other agencies to comply. But in the meantime, the agency has the authority to act now, on its own, to require inherently safer design, equipment and processes that would go a long way toward preventing more catastrophes.'b'Onerous restrictions imposed by Missouri on federally approved counselors who help people understand and enroll in health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act have rightly 'b'been blocked'b' by a federal district judge in Kansas City. Although the ruling by Judge Ortrie Smith applies only to Missouri, its reasoning applies to similar laws or regulations adopted by more than a dozen Republican-led states that are doing their best to sabotage health care reform.'b'Missouri has been especially recalcitrant in trying to block reform. It declined to create its own insurance exchange, as have many other states, leaving that task to the federal government. It also forbade state and local officials from cooperating with the federal exchange.'b'Its most outrageous tactic requires counselors, known as navigators, who are already required to meet federal standards, to obtain a separate state license that requires many extra hours of training. They are also required to get an insurance agent\xe2\x80\x99s license before offering advice about the strengths and weaknesses of various health plans. Judge Smith called these additional burdens impermissible obstacles to carrying out the federal law. State officials claim the law ensures that counselors are competent and not scam artists. But the judge ruled that the state law, which he said is pre-empted by the federal law, would harm the public interest by preventing navigators from carrying out their duties. Consumer advocates ought to challenge such laws in other states as well.'b'TEL AVIV \xe2\x80\x94 It is pretty clear now that Secretary of State John Kerry will either be Israel\xe2\x80\x99s diplomatic salvation or the most dangerous diplomatic fanatic Israel has ever encountered.

Has the neighborhood around Israel become so much more unstable that any Israeli withdrawal from anywhere is unthinkable? Has the number of Israeli Jews now living in East Jerusalem and the West Bank become so much larger \xe2\x80\x94 more than 540,000 \xe2\x80\x94 that they are immovable? And has the Palestinian rhetoric on the right of return become so deeply embedded in Palestinian politics? So when you add them all up, it becomes a fantasy to expect any Israeli or Palestinian leader to have the strength to make the huge concessions needed for a two-state solution?'b'President Obama is letting Kerry test all this. Kerry has done so in a fanatically relentless \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost count of his visits here \xe2\x80\x94 but highly sophisticated way. After letting the two sides fruitlessly butt heads for six months, he\xe2\x80\x99s now planning to present a U.S. framework that will lay out what Washington considers the core concessions Israelis and Palestinians need to make for a fair, lasting deal.'b'The \xe2\x80\x9cKerry Plan,\xe2\x80\x9d likely to be unveiled soon, is expected to call for an end to the conflict and all claims, following a phased Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank (based on the 1967 lines), with unprecedented security arrangements in the strategic Jordan Valley. The Israeli withdrawal will not include certain settlement blocs, but Israel will compensate the Palestinians for them with Israeli territory. It will call for the Palestinians to have a capital in Arab East Jerusalem and for Palestinians to recognize Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people. It will not include any right of return for Palestinian refugees into Israel proper.'b'Kerry expects and hopes that both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will declare that despite their reservations about one or another element in the U.S. framework, they will use it as the basis of further negotiations.'b'This is where things will get interesting. U.S. and Israeli officials in close contact with Netanyahu describe him as torn, clearly understanding that some kind of two-state solution is necessary for Israel\xe2\x80\x99s integrity as a Jewish democratic state, with the healthy ties to Europe and the West that are vital for Israel\xe2\x80\x99s economy. But he remains deeply skeptical about Palestinian intentions \xe2\x80\x94 or as Netanyahu said here Tuesday: \xe2\x80\x9cI do not want a binational state. But we also don\xe2\x80\x99t want another state that will start attacking us.\xe2\x80\x9d His political base, though, which he nurtured, does not want Netanyahu making a U-turn.'b'Which is why \xe2\x80\x94 although Netanyahu has started to prepare the ground here for the U.S. plan \xe2\x80\x94 if he proceeds on its basis, even with reservations, his coalition will likely collapse. He will lose a major part of his own Likud Party and all his other right-wing allies. In short, for Netanyahu to move forward, he will have to build a new political base around centrist parties. To do that, Netanyahu would have to become, to some degree, a new leader \xe2\x80\x94 overcoming his own innate ambivalence about any deal with the Palestinians to become Israel\xe2\x80\x99s most vocal and enthusiastic salesman for a two-state deal, otherwise it would never pass.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNothing in politics is as risky as a U-turn or as challenging as a successful one,\xe2\x80\x9d says Gidi Grinstein, the president of the Reut Institute, a leading Israeli strategy group. \xe2\x80\x9cIt requires a gradual disengagement from one\xe2\x80\x99s greatest supporters, who slowly turn into staunchest enemies, while forming a new coalition of backers, made up of former opponents. In a cautious dance of two-steps-forward, one-step-back, U-turning leaders must shift their political center of gravity from the former base to their future platform.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If the Palestinians and Israelis find a way to proceed with the Kerry plan, everything is still possible. Success is hardly assured, but it will prove that it\xe2\x80\x99s not midnight yet. But if either or both don\xe2\x80\x99t agree, Kerry would have to take his mission to its logical, fanatical conclusion and declare the end of the negotiated two-state solution. (If not, he loses 'b'his credibility'b'.)'b'If and when that happens, Israel, which controls the land, would have to either implement a unilateral withdrawal, live with the morally corrosive and globally isolating implications of a permanent West Bank occupation or design a new framework of one-state-for-two-people.'b'So that\xe2\x80\x99s where we are: Israelis and Palestinians need to understand that Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s mission is the last train to a negotiated two-state solution. The next train is the one coming at them.\xc2\xa0'b'DENVER \xe2\x80\x94 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of giggling in Colorado, and about Colorado, these days.'b'Except by the state\xe2\x80\x99s leaders, who are like uneasy chaperones at a rowdy school dance.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s insane,\xe2\x80\x9d says Senator Michael Bennet.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no fun,\xe2\x80\x9d says Gov. John Hickenlooper, who admits he winces when he hears late-night pot shots, like Jimmy Fallon\xe2\x80\x99s barb: \xe2\x80\x9cStoners took a moment to thank Governor Hickenlooper, then they spent a few hours just saying the word \xe2\x80\x98Hickenlooper.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'b'Sitting in an office filled with panoramic depictions of the West and a New York license plate that belonged to family friend Kurt Vonnegut, the governor, 61, notes: \xe2\x80\x9cNo matter how big a failure the war on drugs was, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be the butt of late-night jokes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The lanky Jimmy Stewart look-alike, known as Hick, has warned Coloradans that they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cbreak out the Cheetos or Goldfish too quickly,\xe2\x80\x9d given that pot is still illegal under federal law. But unlike some other Colorado pols, the former microbrewery pub entrepreneur has been leery about being drawn into any joshing about Chronic Bud Bowl bets.'b'Both Bennet and Hickenlooper opposed the recreational pot referendum. (One marijuana advocate denounced Hickenlooper years before for balking, saying that a pub owner is a \xe2\x80\x9cdrug dealer.\xe2\x80\x9d) The pair of Democrats, who ambled into politics late, seem as if they wandered out of a Frank Capra movie; they have the sort of innocent, zany charm that you rarely see in a profession that stamps out spontaneity.'b'But how will the role of pioneer scouts in a spacey odyssey, leaders in a state that suddenly has a more louche image, affect their promising national ambitions?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLuckily, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have serious national aspirations,\xe2\x80\x9d Hickenlooper says, \xe2\x80\x9cso that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really become much of an issue.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s vice presidential pick?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it,\xe2\x80\x9d he replies, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause by that time I\xe2\x80\x99ll be 64.\xe2\x80\x9d It has been rare to have a ticket with both people over 60, he said, noting: \xe2\x80\x9cYou have an older, wise person who\xe2\x80\x99s a leader and then you have a young, spirited charismatic one.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always work, I point out. Consider Sarah Palin and Dan Quayle.'b'But look at Barack Obama and Joe Biden, the governor replies.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGreat social experiments always have risk,\xe2\x80\x9d says Hickenlooper, who, amid floods, fires, droughts and shootings, finds the pot issue bogarting his time. The state, subtly supported by the president and attorney general, must conjure up a regulatory system, sort out legal and banking complexities, and quickly try to head off deleterious effects.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like opening a restaurant,\xe2\x80\x9d the governor says. \xe2\x80\x9cJust because you have three great weeks does not make it a successful restaurant.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The infusion of young people into Colorado made the seismic shift inevitable, he said, because they thought banning pot was \xe2\x80\x9cabsurd.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet the big trend of the premiere month is the parade of giggling grannies scarfing down pot-infused granola bars, candy and pastries. Hickenlooper is bracing himself for the first traffic or workplace fatality traced to pot, which is far more potent now and sometimes spurs an acid-trippy effect, and he\xe2\x80\x99s working on an anti-pot-smoking campaign directed at teenagers, who he says are at the most risk for long-term memory deterioration.'b'Although some Colorado pols think the tax revenue should be higher, Hickenlooper demurs that states shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be dependent on revenues from vices, like drugs or gambling or tobacco, \xe2\x80\x9cthat inherently don\xe2\x80\x99t make people happier or better.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'State Representative Jared Wright, a Republican, warned on Fox News that it was only a \xe2\x80\x9cmatter of time\xe2\x80\x9d before violence ensues and, spurred by a Web satire, sponsored legislation to stop people from using their food stamps on pot.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMarijuana, generally, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make people confrontational or combative, unlike alcohol,\xe2\x80\x9d Hickenlooper objected.'b'Now that the rollout has been a success, the governor can once more think about his re-election race.

He contends that capitalism\xe2\x80\x99s inherent dynamic propels powerful forces that threaten democratic societies.'b'Capitalism, according to Piketty, confronts both modern and modernizing countries with a dilemma: entrepreneurs become increasingly dominant over those who own only their own labor. In Piketty\xe2\x80\x99s view, while emerging economies can defeat this logic in the near term, in 'b'the long run'b', \xe2\x80\x9cwhen pay setters set their own pay, there\xe2\x80\x99s no limit,\xe2\x80\x9d unless \xe2\x80\x9cconfiscatory tax rates\xe2\x80\x9d are imposed.'b'Piketty\xe2\x80\x99s book \xe2\x80\x94 published four months ago in France and due out in English this March \xe2\x80\x94 suggests that traditional liberal government policies on spending, taxation and regulation will fail to diminish inequality. Piketty has also delivered and posted 'b'a series of lectures'b' in French and English outlining his argument.'b'Conservative readers will find that Piketty\xe2\x80\x99s book disputes the view that the free market, liberated from the distorting effects of government intervention, \xe2\x80\x9cdistributes,\xe2\x80\x9d as Milton Friedman famously 'b'put it'b', \xe2\x80\x9cthe fruits of economic progress among all people. That\xe2\x80\x99s the secret of the enormous improvements in the conditions of the working person over the past two centuries.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Piketty proposes'b' instead that the rise in inequality reflects markets working precisely as they should: \xe2\x80\x9cThis has nothing to do with a market imperfection: the more perfect the capital market, the higher\xe2\x80\x9d the rate of return on capital is in comparison to the rate of growth of the economy. The higher this ratio is, the greater inequality is.'b'In a 20-page 'b'review'b' for the June issue of the Journal of Economic Literature that has already caused a stir, Branko Milanovic, an economist in the World Bank\xe2\x80\x99s research department, declared:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am hesitant to call Thomas Piketty\xe2\x80\x99s new book Capital in the 21st Century one of the best books in economics written in the past several decades. Not that I do not believe it is, but I am careful because of the inflation of positive book reviews and because contemporaries are often poor judges of what may ultimately prove to be influential. With these two caveats, let me state that we are in the presence of one of the watershed books in economic thinking.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There are a number of key arguments in Piketty\xe2\x80\x99s book. One is that the six-decade period of growing equality in western nations \xe2\x80\x93 starting roughly with the onset of World War I and extending into the early 1970s \xe2\x80\x93 was unique and highly unlikely to be repeated. That period, Piketty suggests, represented an exception to the more deeply rooted pattern of growing inequality.'b'According to Piketty, those halcyon six decades were the result of two world wars and the Great Depression. The owners of capital \xe2\x80\x93 those at the top of the pyramid of wealth and income \xe2\x80\x93 absorbed a series of devastating blows. These included the loss of credibility and authority as markets crashed; physical destruction of capital throughout Europe in both World War I and World War II; the raising of tax rates, especially on high incomes, to finance the wars; high rates of inflation that eroded the assets of creditors; the nationalization of major industries in both England and France; and the appropriation of industries and property in post-colonial countries.'b'At the same time, the Great Depression produced the New Deal coalition in the United States, which empowered an insurgent labor movement. The postwar period saw huge gains in growth and productivity, the benefits of which were shared with workers who had strong backing from the trade union movement and from the dominant Democratic Party. Widespread support for liberal social and economic policy was so strong that even a Republican president who won easily twice, Dwight D. Eisenhower, recognized that an assault on the New Deal would be futile. In 'b'Eisenhower\xe2\x80\x99s words'b', \xe2\x80\x9cShould any political party attempt to abolish Social Security, unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear from that party again in our political history.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The six decades between 1914 and 1973 stand out from the past and future, according to Piketty, because the rate of economic growth exceeded the after-tax rate of return on capital. Since then, the rate of growth of the economy has declined, while the return on capital is rising to its pre-World War I levels.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf the rate of return on capital remains permanently above the rate of growth of the economy \xe2\x80\x93 this is Piketty\xe2\x80\x99s key inequality relationship,\xe2\x80\x9d Milanovic writes 'b'in his review'b', it \xe2\x80\x9cgenerates a changing functional distribution of income in favor of capital and, if capital incomes are more concentrated than incomes from labor (a rather uncontroversial fact), personal income distribution will also get more unequal \xe2\x80\x94 which indeed is what we have witnessed in the past 30 years.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Piketty has 'b'produced the chart'b' at Figure 1 to illustrate his larger point.'b'The only way to halt this process, he argues, is to impose a global progressive tax on wealth \xe2\x80\x93 global in order to prevent (among other things) the transfer of assets to countries without such levies. A global tax, in this scheme, would restrict the concentration of wealth and limit the income flowing to capital.'b'Piketty would impose an annual graduated tax on stocks and bonds, property and other assets that are customarily not taxed until they are sold. He leaves open the rate and formula for distributing revenues.'b'The Piketty diagnosis helps explain the recent drop in the share of national income going to labor (see 'b'Figure 2'b') and a parallel increase in the share going to capital.'b'Piketty\xe2\x80\x99s analysis also sheds light on the worldwide growth in the number of the unemployed. The International Labor Organization, an agency of the United Nations, 'b'reported recently'b' that the number of unemployed grew by 5 million from 2012 to 2013, reaching nearly 202 million by the end of last year. It is projected to grow to 215 million by 2018.'b'Piketty\xe2\x80\x99s wealth tax solution runs directly counter to the principles of contemporary American conservatives who advocate antithetical public policies: cutting top rates and eliminating the estate tax. It would also run counter to the interests of those countries that have purposefully legislated low tax rates in order to attract investment. The very infeasibility of establishing a global wealth tax serves to reinforce Piketty\xe2\x80\x99s argument concerning the inevitability of increasing inequality.'b'Some liberals are none too happy with Piketty, either.'b''b'Dean Baker'b', one of the founders of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, wrote me in an email that he believes that Piketty \xe2\x80\x9cis far too pessimistic.\xe2\x80\x9d Baker contends that there are a host of far less ambitious actions that might help to ameliorate inequality:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIs it really implausible that we would ever see any sort of tax on finance in the U.S., either the financial transactions tax that I would favor or the financial activities tax advocated by the I.M.F.?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Baker also noted that \xe2\x80\x9cmuch of our capital is tied up in intellectual property\xe2\x80\x9d and that reform of patent laws could serve both to limit the value of drug and other patents and simultaneously lower consumer costs.'b''b'Lawrence Mishel'b', the president of the Economic Policy Institute, responded to my email asking for his take on Piketty:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d take the perspective that this phenomenon is related to the suppression of wage growth so that policies which generate broad-based wage growth are an antidote. The political economy is such that the political power to enact those taxes also requires a mobilized citizenry and institutional power, such as a robust labor movement.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Daron Acemoglu'b', a more centrist economist at MIT, praised Piketty\xe2\x80\x99s careful acquisition of data, as well as his emphasis on the economic forces and political conflicts over distribution that shape inequality. In an email, Acemoglu went on to say:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPart of his interpretation I do not share. Piketty argues that there is a natural tendency for high inequality in \xe2\x80\x98capitalist\xe2\x80\x99 economies (the term capitalist is not my favorite) and that certain unusual events (world wars, the Great Depression and policy responses thereto) temporarily reduced inequality. Then both earnings inequality and inequality between capital and labor have been reverting back to their \xe2\x80\x98normal\xe2\x80\x99 levels. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that the data allow us to reach this conclusion. All we see is this pattern of fall and rise, but so many other things are going on. It is consistent with what Piketty says, but it is also consistent with certain technological changes and discontinuities (or globalization) having created a surge in inequality which will then stabilize or even reverse in the next several decades. It is also consistent with the dynamics of political power changing and this being a major contributor to the rise in inequality in advanced economies. We may be seeing parts of several different trends underpinned by several different major shocks rather than the mean-reverting dynamics following the shocks that Piketty singles out.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There is, however, significant liberal applause for Piketty.'b''b'Richard Freeman'b', an economist at Harvard who specializes in inequality, unions and employment patterns, wrote me by email:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am in 100 percent agreement with Piketty and would add that much of labor inequality comes because high earners got paid through stock options and capital ownership.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Freeman and two colleagues, Joseph Blasi and Douglas Kruse, professors at the School of Labor and Management Relations at Rutgers, contend in 'b'their 2013 book'b', \xe2\x80\x9cThe Citizen\xe2\x80\x99s Share: Putting Ownership Back into Democracy,\xe2\x80\x9d that they have an alternative to a global wealth tax. They argue that:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe way forward is to reform the structure of American business so that workers can supplement their wages with significant capital ownership stakes and meaningful capital income and profit shares.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In other words, let\xe2\x80\x99s turn everyone into a capitalist.'b'Piketty does not treat worker ownership as a solution, and he is generally dismissive of small-bore reforms, arguing that they will have only modest effects on economic growth worldwide, which he believes is very likely to be stuck at 1 to 1.5 percent through the rest of this century.'b'Piketty joins a number of scholars raising significant questions about how the global economic system will deal with such phenomena as 'b'robotics'b', the 'b'hollowing out'b' of the job market, 'b'outsourcing'b' and 'b'global competition'b'.'b'His prognosis is extremely bleak. Without what he acknowledges is a politically unrealistic global wealth tax, he sees the United States and the developed world on a path toward a degree of inequality that will reach levels likely to cause severe social disruption.'b'Final judgment on Piketty\xe2\x80\x99s work will come with time \xe2\x80\x93 a problem in and of itself, because if he is right, inequality will worsen, making it all the more difficult to take preemptive action.'b'Every winter since 2009, President Obama has stood at the podium of the House and pleaded for the cooperation of Congress. For the last three State of the Union speeches, he has largely been ignored. That has left a growing trail of unfinished business: background checks for gun buyers, immigration reform, a higher minimum wage, tax fairness, universal preschool.'b'This year was different. Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s speech on Tuesday night acknowledged the obvious: Congress has become a dead end for most of the big, muscular uses of government to redress income inequality and improve the economy for all, because of implacable Republican opposition. As a result, the remainder of Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s presidency will be largely devoted to a series of smaller actions that the White House can perform on its own.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAmerica does not stand still, and neither will I,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Taking the offensive by veering around Congress 'b'isn\xe2\x80\x99t new'b' for the administration, but it is more important than ever. As the president forcefully described, inequality has deepened and upward mobility has stalled. If Republicans in Congress stymie the public\xe2\x80\x99s needs and desires, Mr. Obama should employ every tool in his box to bypass those barriers. The multistate tour that he plans in the coming days will give him a chance to be even more critical of Congress than he was in the House chamber.'b'Most of the executive actions in the speech have the potential to make a difference, though their diminished scope demonstrates the lost potential caused by political intransigence. 'b'Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour for federal contract workers'b' might benefit only a few hundred-thousand people, but it increases the pressure on other businesses and, ultimately, Congress to raise the wage for everyone. (The $10.10 wage, however, provides an income too paltry to celebrate as a huge achievement.)'b'The increased focus on federal job-training efforts and manufacturing institutes could help reduce unemployment by improving job skills to match the market, as will a $100 million competition to goad high schools into 'b'improving science, technology and math learning'b'. A new retirement account could help people save money.'b'But he left out an executive ban on discrimination by contractors against employees based on sexual orientation and gender identity. That would have made a strong statement about fairness in spending taxpayer money. He could also have prohibited contractors from retaliating against employees who disclose or seek salary information, which would help women know when they are being paid less.'b'The only way to truly affect the economy on a mass scale, and to make a difference for tens of millions of people instead of a few hundred thousand, is to persuade Congress to go along on the major initiatives the president was forced to repeat in his remarks, such as extending jobless benefits, creating high-quality preschool for all 4-year-olds, and especially raising the minimum wage.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis will help families,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of the wage. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will give businesses customers with more money to spend. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t involve any new bureaucratic program. So join the rest of the country. Say yes. Give America a raise.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'One particularly promising request the president made of Congress was to expand the earned-income tax credit, which now benefits 15 million families a year, 'b'to workers without children'b'. That would not only boost the incomes of many at the bottom of the ladder, but it would provide the incentive to work that many Republicans say they support.'b'Pushing for a vote would reveal whether Republicans are so opposed to anything Mr. Obama wants that they would reject their own ideas. As important as executive orders can be, they should not replace showing that Republicans are voting against the public\xe2\x80\x99s wishes.'b'The least productive Congress in nearly half a century has rarely looked more out-of-sorts than during the speech that put its members on notice for their irrelevance. That, essentially, was the triumph of the rhetorical trick President Obama employed in his fifth State of the Union address.'b'The president\xe2\x80\x99s wish list \xe2\x80\x94 a rise in the minimum wage, healthcare that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t dump sick people, resolve to do something over the basic fact of climate change and the scourge of income inequality \xe2\x80\x94 is backed in poll after poll by a majority of Americans. What stands in the way of doing something about these issues are the people who sat on their hands Tuesday night in that chamber.'b'For some time now, the Republican House has made it clear that they have no intention of governing. They shut down the government for 16 days, in case you didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the point. And on Tuesday, they seemed more interested in having their pictures taken with the \xe2\x80\x9cDuck Dynasty\xe2\x80\x9d guy than finding middle ground with the American majority. For freak value on the fringe, Representative Randy Weber, Republican of Texas, tweeted just before the speech: \xe2\x80\x9cWaiting for the Kommandant-in-Chef [sic]\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cSocialist dictator who been feeding US a line.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Need more proof? Two-thirds of Americans rated this Congress the worst in their lifetime, in a recent CNN poll. And 81 percent disapproved of them in the latest NBC News-Wall Street Journal survey.'b'What Obama did in his speech, in outlining a unilateral map for the sixth year of his presidency, was to finally join the majority of citizens in dismissing the lawmakers who will not do their bidding. On raising the minimum wage, Obama framed it as a simple measure to keep out of poverty the people \xe2\x80\x9cwho cook our troops\xe2\x80\x99 meals or wash their dishes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In one of the speech highlights, he urged Republicans to \xe2\x80\x9cjoin the rest of the country. Say yes. Give Americans a raise.\xe2\x80\x9d That was the Democratic campaign slogan going into the midterms, birthed in the den of the opposition.'b'Having marginalized a branch of government that is already on the wrong side of popular sentiment, Obama now takes his bully pulpit on the road, to Nashville and Milwaukee and other stops. But if he really hopes to have a lasting impact \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cI really want to make a difference,\xe2\x80\x9d he told The New Yorker \xe2\x80\x94 he has to do more than staged road stopovers. If he\xe2\x80\x99s truly going to take his case to the people, he has to spend more time with the people. For starters, he could treat the West Coast, a big part of his base, as something more than a fundraising fount.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly heartening to hear Obama, in full-throated defiance that is rare for him, proclaim, \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica will not stand still \xe2\x80\x94 and neither will I.\xe2\x80\x9d But executive orders can only go so far. He needs the majority of the people back with him in order to govern around the say-no, do-nothing Congress. This speech was a muscular start \xe2\x80\x94 one of the better efforts by a man whose orator skills were missing for most of the last year.'b'NEW YORK \xe2\x80\x94  Recently, I was a victim of the Israeli Chief Rabbinate. As an Orthodox rabbi, one who advocates for a more open and inclusive Orthodoxy, I\xe2\x80\x99ve often attested to the Jewish status of congregants who wish to marry in Israel, as required by the Chief Rabbinate. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing so for 45 years, but in October, one of my letters was rejected. Suddenly, my judgment had been found unacceptable.'b'Eventually, protests about that rejection moved the Chief Rabbinate to change its mind and restore my ability to attest for candidates for marriage. But the episode has propelled me to raise a larger issue: the Chief Rabbinate\xe2\x80\x99s far-reaching and exclusive control in Israel over personal matters like marriage, and its intrusion into the affairs of the Diaspora. It is time to decentralize the Chief Rabbinate\xe2\x80\x99s power and to give Jewish communities greater say in what is acceptable for their members.'b'The modern institution of the Orthodox Chief Rabbinate was created for the Jewish community in Palestine by the British during the Mandate period and kept in place when the independent state of Israel was established in 1948. The Chief Rabbinate controls the foundations of Jewish life in Israel: conversion, marriage, burial, food and more.'b'In a democratic state like Israel, it might seem anomalous for a centralized body appointed by the government to be invested with so much power over individual affairs. For a time, the Chief Rabbinate was perceived to serve all the Jewish people. Today it is largely seen and experienced by many Jews in Israel and abroad as an intrusive and coercive religious body. Not only does it impose Orthodox religious law on all Jews, but it also demands ultra-strict standards in most areas it oversees.'b'The recent events are just one manifestation of this. Since there is no civil marriage for Jews in Israel, those wishing to marry must prove, to the satisfaction of the Chief Rabbinate, that they are Jewish. In the past, a statement provided by an Orthodox rabbi had been sufficient. Without warning, I and some other Orthodox rabbis found ourselves on a \xe2\x80\x9cblacklist\xe2\x80\x9d last October; our testimony was no longer considered reliable.'b'It would have been easier to remain quiet and avoid the embarrassment that rejection had caused me. I realized, however, that the issue had serious consequences for Jews in Israel and abroad. I therefore went public by challenging the Chief Rabbinate in the press in the hope that community awareness and involvement would lead to a solution. I was ready to bring the matter before the Israeli Supreme Court.'b'The Chief Rabbinate\xe2\x80\x99s reversal in my case, earlier this month, was an encouraging sign, but the issue is far from resolved. Systemic problems persist.'b'In the late \xe2\x80\x9990s, I published an essay articulating a vision of Open Orthodoxy. Those who identify with this vision believe in the divinity of the Torah and are committed to the detailed observance of the practices of Jewish law. But commitment does not have to mean rigidity. We believe in an Orthodoxy that empowers women to be more involved in Jewish ritual and spiritual leadership; invites religious questioning; promotes dialogue across the Jewish denominations; welcomes all people regardless of sexual orientation or level of religious observance; and looks outward, driven by a sense of responsibility to all people.'b'The Chief Rabbinate, in contrast, has been turning inward, taking religiously extreme positions, consolidating and extending its power. In 2008, in one sweeping move, it limited the right to participate in American conversions to a short list of handpicked rabbis and rabbinical courts. It did so by enlisting the full cooperation of a major American rabbinical association that ceded its autonomy and capitulated rather than stand up for all of its members in the field.'b'This was a major step backward. One of the most vibrant aspects of Orthodoxy in America has been its decentralization and proliferation of many voices. It would be particularly distressing for Orthodoxy in America to reverse course and adopt the stifling hierarchical model of the Israeli Rabbinate.'b'In a democratic Jewish state, options must be available. For example, an Orthodox group in Israel, Ne\xe2\x80\x99emanei Torah Va\xe2\x80\x99Avodah, has proposed that communities elect their own religious leadership and receive state funding. In matters like marriage and conversion, communal standards would be taken into consideration instead of dictates imposed from above.'b'This does not mean that individual Orthodox rabbis in Israel would be obliged to go against their conscience by accepting all conversions or marriages as valid. No rabbi should be asked to compromise personal standards of Jewish law. But Israel is a state for all the Jewish people. As such, it should allow for the option of secular as well as religious marriage.'b'Coercion and religion do not mix. Religious choice would benefit all. When choice is available, religion in general and Orthodoxy in particular will fare better because people will have the freedom to embrace faith willingly. An imposed religion is a disservice to the people and a disservice to religion.'b''b'\n'b'Avi Weiss,'b'an Orthodox rabbi, is the spiritual leader of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale, in the Bronx.

What sustains the protesters at Independence Square in weather this bleak can only come from inside: an exceptionally hot mix of despair, hope, self-sacrifice and hatred.'b'Yes, hatred. Morality does not forbid hating murderers. Especially if the murderers are in power or in direct service of those in power \xe2\x80\x94 with batons, tear gas, water cannons, rubber bullets, and, starting Jan. 22, live ammunition.'b'That day, the news came about the first two protesters to be shot and killed by the police since the protests began in November. One of them, Serhiy Nihoyan, a 20-year-old Ukrainian of Armenian heritage, dreamed of becoming an actor. The other, Mikhail Zhiznevsky, a citizen of Belarus, was also young, just 25 years old. An ethnic Armenian and a Belarusian, giving their lives for the freedom of Ukrainians \xe2\x80\x94 this gives the lie to the fears, held by some in the West, that the democracy movement here is being hijacked by Ukrainian nationalists.'b'If anyone is promoting hatred it is the government. My friend Josef Zissels, chairman of the Association of Jewish Organizations and Communities of Ukraine, and vice president of the World Jewish Congress, wrote a few days ago that the website of Berkut, the special police force (and a final line of defense for the powers that be) had been \xe2\x80\x9cflooded with anti-Semitic materials that allege that the Jews are to blame for organizing at Maidan,\xe2\x80\x9d the central square, which has become synonymous with the protests.'b'Mr. Zissels wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is completely absurd, but those who are armed with batons and shields, now facing the protesters, believe this. They are brainwashed into believing that the Maidan is a Jewish project, and thus there is no need to take pity on anyone \xe2\x80\x94 you can beat them all.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Beat them all. The police have beaten women and children, and even priests trying to intervene to stop the bloodshed. Berkut not only beats; it maims, tortures and kills. Its members like to pounce on individuals who have gotten separated from the crowd of protesters. Some have even posed for the cameras, their boots on the heads of victims lying on the ground.

'b''b'President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan seems to have decided that there is nothing lost, and maybe something to be gained, in destroying his relationship with the United States. While such behavior may serve his interests, it does not serve his long-suffering country\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'Mr. Karzai has long been at odds with the United States. In the last week, 'b'his government distributed a falsified dossier'b', including graphic photographs, to support charges that the American-led NATO coalition caused great carnage, including civilian deaths, 'b'in airstrikes in Afghanistan on Jan. 15'b'. The Times found that much of the same material had been posted on a Taliban website and that at least two photos were more than three years old.'b'No one disputes that 'b'civilians died'b' in the attack, which hit Wazghar, a village in a valley heavy with Taliban fighters, but coalition and Afghan officials differ on the toll. The coalition said two children were killed when two compounds producing the heaviest Taliban fire were destroyed; the Afghans said 12 to 17 civilians were killed.'b'Mr. Karzai \xe2\x80\x94 like most citizens of his country \xe2\x80\x94 is fed up with airstrikes and civilian deaths after a dozen years of war. But the United Nations has said that most civilians are killed by the Taliban. Instead of dealing with the issue honestly, Mr. Karzai uses it to demonize America. Publicly, he seems to blame the United States for the war with the Taliban. Privately, according to reports, he has suggested that Americans may have aided or conducted attacks aimed at undermining his government. That\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe, but, if he has evidence, he should produce it.'b'Mr. Karzai has not stopped there. Over American protests, he is said to be pushing forward with plans to 'b'release 37 detainees'b' regarded by the coalition as dangerous insurgents responsible for the deaths of Americans and Afghans. He has refused to sign a security agreement that would allow some residual American troops, perhaps 10,000, to remain in Afghanistan after the bulk of the forces withdraw by the end of this year. Given all this, the C.I.A. should quickly rethink \xe2\x80\x94 and possibly stop \xe2\x80\x94 the regular 'b'cash deliveries'b' it has been making to Mr. Karzai for more than a decade. Congress, wisely, has reduced 'b'Afghan aid'b' for 2014 to show its dismay.'b'No one knows what Mr. Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s game is. He may be seeking leverage before April\xe2\x80\x99s presidential election, or as some believe, he may really want all coalition troops out because he thinks that America is conniving with Pakistan to perpetuate the conflict and divide the country.'b'Some Afghans have pushed back against Mr. Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s conspiracies and destructive ways but not enough. The candidates running to succeed him owe voters a vision of how they will improve governance, reduce corruption and work more productively with the United States and its allies, who have spent billions of dollars to underwrite Afghanistan\xe2\x80\x99s economy and will be asked to continue the aid, at reduced levels, in the years to come.'b'BUSAN, South Korea \xe2\x80\x94  Last September, a 55-year-old man lit some scrap paper on fire and threw it into a Seoul subway car as he left the train. He had just been cursed at and kicked by senior citizens for sitting in a seat designated for \xe2\x80\x9cthe elderly and the infirm.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The man, whom we know only by his surname of Kim, was sentenced on Jan. 14 by a Seoul court to one year and six months in prison. One news article reporting the results of his trial garnered more than 1,000 comments in just one day, most of which were from sympathetic younger people complaining about being forced to give up their seats on the subway to senior citizens. Mr. Kim is hardly young, but his frustration resonated with the younger generations.'b'The Seoul subway\xe2\x80\x99s designated-seating section has become a curious backdrop of intergenerational conflict in South Korea. In the 40 years or so since full-scale industrialization began, the social divide between generations has widened. Senior citizens grew up during Japanese occupation and the Korean War, and lived through the era of breakneck economic growth that followed, building a modern country from the ground up in just a few decades, most of the time under a military dictatorship. Most younger South Koreans have come of age in a time of relative affluence and freedom, and like many younger people in East Asia, have gradually become more independent-minded than their elders and less attached to the traditional Confucian values that have been the basis of Korean society for centuries.'b'In recent years, South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s economic woes have put strain on both groups, and frustrations are high. Older South Koreans are finding themselves financially unprepared for retirement, while younger people can\xe2\x80\x99t find jobs. The Seoul subway is a rare place where the generations cross paths \xe2\x80\x94 and the intergenerational tensions are playing out in the crowded trains.'b'South Korea is one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most rapidly aging countries. It is expected to become an \xe2\x80\x9caged society,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the United Nations\xe2\x80\x99 definition of 14 percent of the population above age 65, in four years. South Korea also has the third lowest birthrate in the world.'b'The country\xe2\x80\x99s elderly spent their lives assuming their children would care for them in old age and did little to prepare for retirement. But their children don\xe2\x80\x99t appear to be fulfilling their end of the bargain \xe2\x80\x94 and now the elderly are not faring well economically. The relative poverty rate among senior citizens in South Korea is 49.3 percent, the highest of the industrialized countries. Public pensions tend to be small. And the suicide rate for senior citizens, surely an indicator of economic strain, is the highest among the industrialized countries, at about 80 for every 100,000 people.'b'Meanwhile, South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s younger people are facing unemployment not seen since the early 1980s. More than half of the country\xe2\x80\x99s college-educated youth in their 20s remains unemployed or has stopped searching for work.'b'The notoriously congested Seoul Metropolitan Subway, which opened in 1974 and covers a total of some 200 miles, transports an average of 7 million passengers per day, which is more than twice the daily average of London\xe2\x80\x99s Tube. For years, \xe2\x80\x9cpushmen\xe2\x80\x9d were employed at busy stations to stuff hundreds of extra passengers into each train. In 2008, the subway switched to employing \xe2\x80\x9ccutmen\xe2\x80\x9d instead, who prevent people from boarding cars once they are full.'b'At both ends of each subway car, 12 seats are set aside for \xe2\x80\x9cthe elderly and the infirm.\xe2\x80\x9d As the name suggests, these seats are intended for senior citizens as well as for the handicapped and pregnant women, but in practice they are mostly occupied by the elderly.'b'According to the Seoul Metropolitan Subway authorities, there was a sharp increase in the number of complaints over the seats, from 252 in 2009 to 536 in 2011 (the latest year for which statistics are available). Anecdotal evidence suggests the trend has continued.'b'About two years ago, I had unintentionally sat in one of the elderly-designated seats on the subway and was checking my email when I looked up to meet the eyes of a scowling elderly man. I got up right away. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t thank me, but continued to stare at me from across the train. There had been other free seats for him to use, but he pressured me to get up just to make the point that I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been sitting there.'b'All subway lines in South Korea are free for those over 65 years of age, so most elderly people use it whenever possible. There was a time when young people were happy to give up their seats for the elderly. And the elderly, fitting to tradition, have always assumed they had a right to a seat occupied by a younger person. But young people today are simply less deferential to their elders.'b'The fighting over seats mirrors a vast political gap outside the subway. A majority of older Koreans support President Park Geun-hye and the governing party, but the younger generation is strongly opposed to her leadership. Many older people feel nostalgia for the days of Park Chung-hee, the current president\xe2\x80\x99s father, when they were more prosperous and the country was in the throes of exciting development.'b'For now, South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s intergenerational conflict seems limited to the underground. But without a meaningful dialogue on how to help both our struggling elderly and disaffected young people, the tensions will find a way of rising to the surface.'b''b'\n'b'Young-ha Kim 'b' is a novelist and short-story writer.

After an afternoon of pressing the police to acknowledge the crime and failing, I went home and posted a picture on Weibo, a microblogging platform, showing only my injured forehead, hoping that some friends among my 23 followers would respond to a cry for help.'b'My photograph unleashed a torrent of pent-up frustration, agony and support from abused women across China. Within hours of my post, it was forwarded and commented on by more than 20,000 people. I was inspired by the reaction, and the next day went again to a police station and insisted on making an official report. The saga took more than a week and eventually the police officially acknowledged my husband\xe2\x80\x99s abuse.'b'My now ex-husband is a prominent Chinese businessman, famous for a chain of English-language schools that we built together. I\xe2\x80\x99m an American who has adopted China as my home. Our story was played out in the media, leading to widespread attention on us, and more importantly, on the cause of domestic abuse. In the two and a half years since the attack, I have partnered with the United Nations and a Beijing domestic violence organization to foster awareness of the problem and help victims.'b'The All-China Women\xe2\x80\x99s Federation reports that nearly 25 percent of married women in China have experienced domestic violence. But the abuse is far more prevalent than those numbers show: A large percentage of attacks go unreported. When women find the courage to go to the police, they most often meet the kind of resistance I did. Meanwhile, the legal system favors men \xe2\x80\x94 even abusive men \xe2\x80\x94 leaving desperate women few options.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve received countless messages from Chinese women describing a culture that denies there is a problem. One woman wrote to me in frustration: \xe2\x80\x9cI accompanied my injured mother to the police station, but the officers here didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know the term \xe2\x80\x98domestic violence.\xe2\x80\x99 They only say that this kind of \xe2\x80\x9cprivate matter\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfamily problem\xe2\x80\x9d is common and there isn\xe2\x80\x99t anything they can do.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When abused women are ignored by the police, the last legal option is divorce in civil court. But divorce still carries a heavy stigma for Chinese women, and this is another strong deterrent for women to take action against abusive husbands. Those who pursue divorce have an uphill battle: Among all divorces filed on the grounds of domestic violence, about 3 percent are awarded on this basis alone. If the court fails to recognize the husband\xe2\x80\x99s violence but still grants the divorce, the result can be financially devastating for the woman. Even more horrifying, divorce puts the woman at risk of losing custody of her children, as the parent with the higher income is seen as the better caretaker.'b'Those who have never lived through domestic violence often wonder about the victim, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t she just leave?\xe2\x80\x9d The answers to this question are varied and complex, but for women in China there is a very practical answer to consider: There is no place to go. Support services are few and far between even in the largest cities, and there are no functioning shelters to speak of.'b'Faced with the prospect of a lengthy divorce that could end up costing a woman her home and her child, is it any wonder that prisons are full of women who attacked their husbands with axes and fruit knives rather than rely on the law to protect themselves? Surveys of some women\xe2\x80\x99s prisons have shown that more than 60 percent of inmates were sentenced for injuring or killing their husbands in retaliation for domestic violence. Many women convicted of killing their husbands serve life sentences, while most men who beat their wives to death serve only several years in prison.'b'In 2009, a 26-year-old Beijing woman, Dong Shanshan, reported her abusive partner to local police eight times, only to repeatedly have her bruises and complaints dismissed as \xe2\x80\x9cfamily problems.\xe2\x80\x9d She was later beaten to death by him. He received a sentence of six and a half years, for the crime of \xe2\x80\x9cmaltreatment.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'China needs better domestic violence laws. Only a smattering of local courts are able to issue protection orders against abusive husbands. A national anti-domestic violence law has been drafted and is under consideration by the government. The legislative process is too opaque to know where things stand. Its opponents say that \xe2\x80\x9cfamily matters cannot be legislated,\xe2\x80\x9d yet last year the national government passed a highly publicized law requiring grown children to visit their elderly parents.'b'It is heartening that some localities are pushing ahead with anti-domestic violence laws in the absence of a national law, but it is not enough. Only a national law can drastically raise awareness that domestic violence is in fact a crime. It would give women something to reference when turned away by the police or even to warn abusive husbands with.'b'In the aftermath of the publicity around my case, I was often asked by incredulous Chinese media why I, as an American, put up with my husband\xe2\x80\x99s violence. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think nationality makes a difference when it comes to the shame and fear women feel about speaking up. No woman is eager to say her family isn\xe2\x80\x99t happy. No woman is proud of the fact that the man she loves beats her. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure my nationality contributed to the amount of attention that my case received, but certainly no more than the fact that my Chinese ex-husband is a celebrity.'b'Domestic violence isn\xe2\x80\x99t a country-specific problem or a cultural phenomenon. It\xe2\x80\x99s a crime. Stopping it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t start with laws \xe2\x80\x94 though in some countries, like in China, new laws are necessary.

As the article reports, the troubling trend of a shrinking labor force, even while our working-age population is growing, signals a serious problem in our labor markets.'b'That problem is a lack of jobs. Unemployment insurance cuts will not solve that problem, and they are likely to make it worse.'b'ALEXANDRA SIROTA'b'\nDirector'b'\nNorth Carolina Budget and Tax Center'b'\nRaleigh, N.C., Jan. 23, 2014'b''b''b''b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 IN his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Obama focused on reversing the growth of economic inequality in the United States and restoring the American dream. At the same time, he also announced his support for fast track authority that would limit Congress\xe2\x80\x99s role in determining the content of trade agreements.'b'The president\xe2\x80\x99s call follows on legislation introduced earlier this month to grant him fast-track authority as a way of forcing Congress to speed up its consideration of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation pact with Latin American and Asian nations.'b'But Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s desire for fast-track authority on the T.P.P. and other agreements clashes with another priority in his speech: reducing income inequality.'b'This month is the 20th anniversary of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which significantly eliminated tariffs and other trade barriers across the continent and has been used as a model for the T.P.P. Anyone looking for evidence on what this new agreement will do to income inequality in America needs to consider Nafta\xe2\x80\x99s 20-year record.'b'While many analysts focus on the number of jobs lost from Nafta and similar pacts \xe2\x80\x94 and some estimates say upward of a million \xe2\x80\x94 the most significant effect has been a fundamental change in the composition of jobs available to the 63 percent of American workers without a college degree.'b'At Nafta\xe2\x80\x99s core \xe2\x80\x94 and proposed for the T.P.P. \xe2\x80\x94 are investor rights and privileges that eliminate many of the risks that make firms think twice about moving production to low-wage countries. Today, goods once made here are being produced in Mexico and exported here for sale. Indeed, American manufacturing exports to Mexico and Canada grew at less than half the rate after Nafta than in the years before it.'b'As a result, our trade deficit has ballooned. In 1993, before Nafta, the United States had a $2.5 billion trade surplus with Mexico and a $29 billion deficit with Canada. In 2012, the combined Nafta trade deficit was $181 billion, even as the share of that deficit made up of oil imports dropped 22 percent. The average annual growth of our trade deficit has been 45 percent higher with Mexico and Canada than with countries that are not party to a Nafta-style pact. The companies that took the most advantage of Nafta \xe2\x80\x94 big manufacturers like G.E., Caterpillar and Chrysler \xe2\x80\x94 promised they would create more jobs at their American factories if Nafta passed. Instead, they fired American workers and shifted production to Mexico.'b'The Labor Department\xe2\x80\x99s Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which documents this trend, reads like a funeral program for the middle class. More than 845,000 workers have been certified under this one narrow and hard-to-qualify-for program as having lost their jobs because of offshoring of factories to, and growing imports from, Mexico and Canada since Nafta.'b'The result is downward pressure on middle-class wages as manufacturing workers are forced to compete with imports made by poorly paid workers abroad. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly two out of every three displaced manufacturing workers who were rehired in 2012 saw wage reductions, most losing more than 20 percent.'b'The shift in employment from high-paying manufacturing jobs to low-paying service jobs has contributed to overall wage stagnation. The average American wage has grown less than 1 percent annually in real terms since Nafta, even as productivity grew three times faster.'b'But the decline in the wages of workers who lost a job to Nafta is only part of the story. They joined the glut of workers competing for low-skill jobs that cannot be done offshore in industries like hospitality and food service, forcing down real wages in these sectors as well.'b'And, for America\xe2\x80\x99s remaining manufacturing workers, Nafta put downward pressure on wages by enabling employers to threaten to move jobs offshore during wage bargaining. A 1997 Cornell University study ordered by the Nafta Commission for Labor Cooperation found that as many as 62 percent of union drives faced employer threats to relocate abroad, and the factory shutdown rate following successful union certifications tripled after Nafta.'b'This is hardly news; in the early 1990s a spate of studies resulted in an academic consensus that trade flows contributed to between 10 and 40 percent of inequality increases. Indeed, since Nafta\xe2\x80\x99s implementation, the share of national income collected by the richest 10 percent has risen by 24 percent, while the top 1 percent\xe2\x80\x99s share has shot up by 58 percent.'b'Some advocates of Nafta-style pacts acknowledge that they will cause the loss of some jobs, but argue that workers will win over all by being able to purchase cheaper imported goods.'b'But when the Center for Economic and Policy Research applied the data to the theory, they found that reductions in consumer prices had not been sufficient to offset losses in wage levels. They found that American workers without college degrees had most likely lost more than 12 percent of their wages to Nafta-style trade, even accounting for the benefits of cheaper goods. This means a loss of more than $3,300 per year for a worker earning the median annual wage of $27,500.'b'The Nafta data poses a significant challenge for President Obama. As he said on Tuesday, he wants to battle the plague of income inequality and he wants to expand the Nafta model with T.P.P. But he cannot have it both ways.'b'WHEN New York City\xe2\x80\x99s mayor, Bill de Blasio, 'b'went to Albany'b' earlier this week to talk about his program for universal preschool, the discussion reportedly focused on funding, not on whether or how preschool would actually help children. President Obama seemed equally confident when he 'b'introduced his plan'b' for universal preschool last year, flatly stating, \xe2\x80\x9cWe know this works.\xe2\x80\x9d But the state of research is actually much murkier. And unless policy makers begin to design preschool programs in ways that can be evaluated later, the situation won\xe2\x80\x99t get any clearer.'b'A preschool that \xe2\x80\x9cworks\xe2\x80\x9d could mean different things. It might simply be a safe spot for kids to go. Or it could be a means to get poor kids ready to learn reading and math; they are currently eight to 10 months behind wealthy kids when they start kindergarten. Mayor de Blasio and the president are more ambitious: They think that preschool ought to change life trajectories, resulting in more high school graduates and fewer prison inmates. These plans have two precedents in particular, the Abecedarian and Perry preschool programs from the 1960s and \xe2\x80\x9970s, whose students went farther in school and, decades later, had better jobs than children from similar backgrounds who did not attend those programs.'b'But large state programs differ from these model programs in two important ways. First, Perry and Abecedarian attendees were randomly selected from a large group of volunteers. The other kids served as the comparison group, which made it easy for researchers to assess the programs\xe2\x80\x99 impact. Large state programs seldom use random selection, so their effectiveness is more open to debate.'b'In addition, Perry and Abecedarian were expensive, intensive programs. Preschools in large state programs inevitably vary in what they do, and they show variable results. That\xe2\x80\x99s why advocates always solemnly intone that preschool must be \xe2\x80\x9chigh quality.\xe2\x80\x9d But what does that actually mean?'b'Researchers know what doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work. Preschools that focus mostly on social activities (as the federal 'b'Head Start'b' program does) show minimal academic benefits. But trying to teach primarily reading and math to 4-year-olds \xe2\x80\x94 essentially putting a kindergarten curriculum into preschool \xe2\x80\x94 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work either.'b'The preschools that do work teach less well-prepared kids precursor skills, the kind that many wealthy kids learn at home, through activities that don\xe2\x80\x99t look especially academic. Songs and rhyming games, for example, help children hear that words are composed of individual sounds, making it easier to learn how to read letters. Kids gain knowledge about the world \xe2\x80\x94 important for reading comprehension in later elementary years \xe2\x80\x94 when they are read to by their parents and when they listen to them. Jigsaw puzzles and globes help kids develop spatial skills, which later help with math. Household rules teach children to learn to control their impulses, part of learning self-discipline.'b'Teaching these precursor skills in a preschool setting, rather than at home, is not easy. Teachers have just a few hours per day and many children to serve. But at present, it is not often a key objective.'b'So large state preschool programs have two problems: It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to guarantee quality at the outset, and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to evaluate results once the program gets going. But both problems can be addressed.'b'First, we should capitalize on what we know. Small-scale studies indicate that some curriculums (like 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBuilding Blocks\xe2\x80\x9d'b' for mathematics) are effective. We know some features of preschools (like a warm emotional climate) are important. The federal government ought to ensure that states have access to concise research summaries of what does and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work. Such communication is currently not a priority, but it could increase the proportion of good schools pretty painlessly.'b'Second, high-quality evidence requires planning. Ideally, we would be able to compare kids with access to the program to kids without access. If all children gain access at the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99re stuck with less-optimal research methods and uncertain results. Policy makers could encourage states to randomly vary when and where new programs start \xe2\x80\x94 complications of pre-K implementation will probably make this necessary in any case. Yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s a moral bullet to be bitten in the short term because some families will gain access to preschool later than others. But gaining high-quality evidence for program effectiveness is the best strategy for the long term.'b'Third, comparing preschool programs is hard because quality depends not just on factors in the classroom like the curriculum and the teacher\xe2\x80\x99s skill, but also on how those factors interact with sleep, nutrition, parenting and other aspects of domestic life. Yet we know little about such interactions.'b'To understand them, we need a national study (enrolling perhaps 15,000 children) that would collect detailed information about the family and the preschool, beginning at age 3 and continuing through at least second grade.'b'Helping poor children succeed will not be easy, and we\xe2\x80\x99d be fools to think we\xe2\x80\x99ll get this right the first time. We need the tools of science to help plan course corrections, which means planning policies so that both scientists and teachers can learn on the job.'b'It was hard to watch President Obama during Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union address and not see a man who has had his coat trimmed and his ambitions adjusted.'b'He touted his accomplishments, as he should have, but in laying out the parameters of his \xe2\x80\x9cyear of action\xe2\x80\x9d he outlined goals that didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask America to dream as much as adjust to the paralysis, abandoning big moves for smaller ones.'b'Republican lawmakers have made clear that they have no desire to work with him and that they have every intention of opposing him, even if that means the legislative branch passes almost no laws. And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done. In December, 'b'Politico put it this way'b': using \xe2\x80\x9cpublic laws passed\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cbills passed\xe2\x80\x9d as the measurement, \xe2\x80\x9cthe 113th Congress has passed just 58 laws so far, the lowest since 1947.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'So, the president pledged Tuesday that he would work with Congress where he could, but would move forward without Congress if necessary, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'His plans were noble enough, and they were poll-friendly \xe2\x80\x94 raising the minimum wage, working for universal high-quality pre-K, equal pay for women, a new \xe2\x80\x9cMyRA\xe2\x80\x9d retirement savings plan \xe2\x80\x94 but they are not nearly large enough proposals to solve our most intractable problems.'b'There was only one line devoted to fixing our \xe2\x80\x9cupside-down tax code\xe2\x80\x9d for individuals, and that was in reference to the retirement account. Gone were the appeals to get Congress to have the wealthy pay their fair share.'b'Last year, the president put it this way:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and the most powerful.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He continued:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMost Americans \xe2\x80\x94 Democrats, Republicans and independents \xe2\x80\x94 understand that we can\xe2\x80\x99t just cut our way to prosperity. They know that broad-based economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction, with spending cuts and revenue, and with everybody doing their fair share.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Last year, on the issue of new gun control legislation, the president said:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt has been two months since Newtown. I know this is not the first time this country has debated how to reduce gun violence. But this time is different. Overwhelming majorities of Americans \xe2\x80\x94 Americans who believe in the Second Amendment \xe2\x80\x94 have come together around common-sense reform, like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This year, he mentioned gun violence only once, saying:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCitizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals from us each day.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The only big proposal that even has a chance this year is comprehensive immigration reform, and its prospects are far from certain.'b'Last year, the president spoke extensively about passing immigration reform, repeating, \xe2\x80\x9cNow is the time to do it. Now is the time to get it done. Now is the time to get it done.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke about stronger border security, a pathway to citizenship and decreasing waiting times for highly skilled immigrants.'b'This year, he spoke of immigration in a single passage, with no specifics other than to cite this: \xe2\x80\x9cIndependent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion in the next two decades.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The president seems to have been reduced by the resistance. He seems to be concentrating on what can be done rather than on what should be done. This is a rational reaction, I suppose, to irrational opposition, but nonetheless it\xe2\x80\x99s a sad indictment of our politics.'b'The president has had failures and missteps, to be sure. Every administration has some. None are perfect. But the idea of grinding government to a halt in opposition to one leader \xe2\x80\x94 as Republicans have done \xe2\x80\x94 has been an extraordinary and infuriating thing to behold.'b'And it has been sad to watch a president full of hope and promise be stymied at nearly every turn and have to reframe his objectives.'b'In 'b'an article this week'b' in The New Yorker, Obama attempted to give context to his struggles and place his term in the long sweep of history:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I think America was very lucky that Abraham Lincoln was President when he was President. If he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been, the course of history would be very different. But I also think that, despite being the greatest President, in my mind, in our history, it took another hundred and fifty years before African-Americans had anything approaching formal equality, much less real equality. I think that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t diminish Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s achievements, but it acknowledges that at the end of the day we\xe2\x80\x99re part of a long-running story. We just try to get our paragraph right.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The president who was fond of proclaiming that under his leadership, the country was beginning a \xe2\x80\x9cnew chapter\xe2\x80\x9d on everything from 'b'diplomacy'b' to 'b'climate change'b', is now just trying to get his paragraph right.'b'All of a sudden, early childhood education is really, really popular. Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s favorite. If early childhood education were an actor, it would be Tom Hanks or Meryl Streep. If it were a video game, it would be Candy Crush or Angry Birds, minus the spyware.'b'The other night at the State of the Union speech, President Obama mentioned \xe2\x80\x9chigh-quality early education\xe2\x80\x9d and John Boehner applauded. Boehner applauded early education! Paul Ryan likes it, too. Prekindergarten is so in, the guys on \xe2\x80\x9cDuck Dynasty\xe2\x80\x9d would probably have a good word for it.'b'Kudos, guys! We certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t want to complain about this. Early education is one of the best tools for breaking the poverty-to-poverty trap. Unfortunately, it only works if it\xe2\x80\x99s high quality, and high quality is expensive. Yet very little of this newfound enthusiasm comes with serious money attached.'b'Last year, in his State of the Union speech, President Obama called for universal preschool for 4-year-olds, to be paid for by a tobacco tax that would raise $78 billion over 10 years. The prekindergarten idea was hailed throughout the nation. The tax part did not go anywhere. To say it was dead on arrival at Congress is an insult to the word \xe2\x80\x9cdead.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody seems to agree we need some sort of national effort to provide preschool education to our kids. What we don\xe2\x80\x99t have is any discussion about how to pay for it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Senator Patty Murray who is, I am pretty sure, the first former preschool teacher ever to run the Senate Budget Committee.'b'When President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s detailed budget proposal comes out, he\xe2\x80\x99ll presumably include some way of paying for his universal preschool idea. Perhaps it will be the tobacco tax again. Perhaps you will never know because, in recent years, the presidential budget has all the traction and clout of a small mouse attempting to cross a frozen lake. During a windstorm. While wearing bedroom slippers.'b'Here in New York, we\xe2\x80\x99re having a political dispute that pits the let\xe2\x80\x99s-just-cheer camp against the pick-a-tax crowd. Mayor Bill de Blasio wants to pay for universal prekindergarten for New York City 4-year-olds with an increase in the income tax rate for high income city residents. He got elected on this issue, but he needs the state\xe2\x80\x99s permission.'b'Gov. Andrew Cuomo says he\xe2\x80\x99ll just give de Blasio some money out of the state budget. This is an election year, and Cuomo is definitely not targeting any taxpayers, even if the ones in question are jumping up and down and waving their arms to get attention.'b'The mayor wants money the city can count on to keep coming every year. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very interesting argument. If New York is lucky, the nation will find the debate so fascinating that everyone will forget about the fact that on Tuesday, shortly after Obama called for more quality prekindergarten classes, a congressman from New York City threatened to throw a reporter off the Capitol balcony. This had nothing to do with early childhood education, but you know how people talk.'b'Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of how much it would cost to do preschool for the entire state is lower than de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s estimate for just New York City. Which is, on a per-pupil basis, much lower than the amount New Jersey spends on a much-praised prekindergarten program. (Cheers to New Jersey for your effort to provide quality early education to the state\xe2\x80\x99s poorest children. We are so impressed that we will leap right over the fact that you only did it because a judge made you.)'b'One way to dodge the responsibility for coming up with actual cash for a great leap in preschool financing is to argue, as Cuomo does, that you need to roll these things out slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cTo do it on a large scale is very difficult,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ron Haskins of the Brookings Institution, a former adviser to the Bush administration. But Haskins thinks poor children\xe2\x80\x99s needs are so great, and so immediate, that it\xe2\x80\x99s worth the risk. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re desperate. These kids are coming into school already a grade behind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'A quarter of the youngest Americans are poor. We need to get to them quickly, and do the job right, well before they\xe2\x80\x99re 4. And while we should start with the neediest families, if the programs are good, middle-class parents are rightfully going to point out that they need help, too.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99ll be a huge number of kids, and the classes have to be really small. Also, the teachers have to get much better pay. They go into the business out of love, but when you are talking about median salaries of $27,000 a year, sometimes love is not enough. All in all, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a ton of money.'b'So here\xe2\x80\x99s the question: How much of the new enthusiasm for early childhood education is real, and how much is just an attempt to dodge the whole inequality debate? Maybe we could agree that no politician is allowed to mention pre-k without showing us the money.'b'Against all odds, prekindergarten is gaining ground.'b'President Obama called again 'b'in his State of the Union address'b' for Congress to support high-quality preschool for all, noting that 30 states are already moving ahead on this front (including New York).'b'\xe2\x80\x9cResearch shows that one of the best investments we can make in a child\xe2\x80\x99s life is high-quality early education,\xe2\x80\x9d Obama said. The House speaker, John Boehner, who sat stonily through most of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s speech, applauded that line. Congress also unexpectedly increased financing this year for early education.'b'Aside from apple pie, preschool may also be the only issue on which voters agree. 'b'A poll last year found'b' that 60 percent of Republicans and 84 percent of Democrats support expansion of prekindergarten. Republican-led states like Oklahoma have been leaders in early education for a simple reason: It works.'b'Yet one obstacle is the misperception that early education has been debunked by researchers \xe2\x80\x94 when, in fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s the opposite. With so many programs and billions of dollars at stake, let\xe2\x80\x99s carefully review the evidence.'b'Advocates focus on the stunning success of two tiny programs in the 1960s and 1970s, 'b'Perry Preschool'b' and 'b'Abecedarian'b'. Children from low-income families who participated in them were more likely to graduate from high school and get a job and less likely to end up on welfare.'b'Yet critics correctly note that programs often work when small but don\xe2\x80\x99t scale up. It\xe2\x80\x99s an open question whether those two programs would have an impact as great today if they were rolled out nationwide.'b'Republican critics focus on (and misunderstand) a major, well-designed project called 'b'the Head Start Impact Study'b'. It found that Head Start produces educational gains that fade away. By third grade, when the research ended, there was little detectable difference between those assigned to Head Start and those in control groups.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s disappointing. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why critics denounce Head Start as a waste of money.'b'Yet early education has always had an impact not through cognitive gains but through long-term improvements in life outcomes. With Perry, Abecedarian and other programs, educational gains fade, yet, mysteriously, there are often long-term improvements on things that matter even more, such as arrest rates and high school graduation rates. The Head Start Impact Study couldn\xe2\x80\x99t examine those outcomes.'b'Other researchers have, and their findings are almost unanimous. 'b'One rigorous study led by Eliana Garces'b', then of U.C.L.A., found that Head Start graduates were more likely to graduate from high school and attend college than their peers. 'b'David Deming of Harvard found'b' that children who attended Head Start were more likely to graduate from high school and less likely as young adults to be \xe2\x80\x9cidle\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 out of a job and out of school.'b'Jens Ludwig of University of Chicago found that Head Start reduced child mortality in elementary years, apparently because of screening and treatment referrals.'b'Beyond Head Start, a series of randomized trials of other early education initiatives repeatedly found the same result: Long-term outcomes improve.'b'When experts weigh these benefits against short-term costs, preschool for at-risk kids from low-income families more than pays for itself. (It\xe2\x80\x99s not as clear that this is as true for middle-class kids.) When we have kids growing up in poverty and homes without books, we end up paying one way or the other. We can invest 'b'in preschool today'b' (about $8,000 per child per year), or 'b'in juvenile detention tomorrow'b' (around $90,000 per child per year).'b'So where does this prekindergarten \xe2\x80\x9csleeper effect\xe2\x80\x9d come from? Nobody is quite sure. Maybe children learn self-discipline, patience or grit.'b'Or maybe parents do. Alexander Gelber of University of California, Berkeley, found that parents of children in Head Start are significantly more likely to read to them, and spend more time reading to them \xe2\x80\x94 even years later. Parents are more likely to take them to museums. Dads living apart spend an extra day a month with them.'b'The United States is an outlier in early education. 'b'We rank 28th out of 38 industrialized countries'b' in the share of 4-year-olds in preschool. In Shanghai, with one of the top-performing school systems in the world, nearly all preschoolers participate in early education programs.'b'Of course, what we need in America isn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cpre-k\xe2\x80\x9d narrowly but broad investment in young children, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what Obama proposes. Programs like Nurse-Family Partnership or Reach Out and Read that coach low-income parents on reading to their kids and other parenting skills seem to have a particularly powerful long-term impact.'b'One of the most consequential national debates this year will be about early education. The evidence that it builds opportunity is overwhelming. So the next time you hear people scoff that it\xe2\x80\x99s a failure, push back \xe2\x80\x94 and school them.'b'Few bills of real substance emerge from today\xe2\x80\x99s polarized Congress, and those that do tend to be misshapen lumps. They have enough useful provisions to win approval from Democrats, but are weighed down by the dangerous and occasionally bizarre demands of the many branches of the Republican Party.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the case with the $956 billion farm bill that 'b'passed the House on Wednesday'b' with bipartisan support. It seems headed for approval by the Senate and the White House in the next few days. It makes some of the most significant reforms to wasteful agriculture subsidies in many years, and it contains dozens of important provisions designed to increase employment in rural areas and save lives with farsighted crop research. It preserves some important environmental protections, while cutting others. And though its food-stamp provisions were saved from being much worse, they will still reduce benefits for too many poor people.'b'On balance, the bill is clearly worthy of support, particularly because it will prevent austerity fanatics in future Congresses from gutting food stamps for the next five years. It will save $16.6 billion over a decade, or $23 billion if you count existing budget cuts imposed in the last two years. But endorsing the bill also means acknowledging the low expectations for real progress in Washington.'b'The most important reform in the bill is the elimination of direct payments to farmers, which provided cash subsidies in good years and bad, whether crop prices were high or low. This program was one of the worst abuses in the federal budget, and negotiators in the House and Senate should be commended for overcoming intense lobbying to preserve it, thereby saving $19 billion over 10 years.'b'To protect farmers from disaster in bad years, the bill moves $7 billion of that savings into a beefed-up insurance subsidy program, which is a better way of reducing risk. But that program is still too generous to big farmers. As 'b'the Environmental Working Group argues'b', the subsidies should have been means-tested. Reducing the insurance program\xe2\x80\x99s size might have paid for more food stamps.'b'Negotiators took an important step by linking crop insurance subsidies to requirements that farms meet environmental standards, including soil conservation and wetlands protection. But a few smaller conservation programs were eliminated, and the overall amount spent on conservation was cut by $4 billion.'b'The bill also pays for research to improve crop yields and reduce plant disease that could have an important effect in developing countries, along with energy-efficiency programs and new manufacturing opportunities in agriculture-related businesses.'b'The most painful cut in the bill is the $8 billion reduction in food stamps over a decade. The effect of this is limited to 'b'4 percent of recipients'b', or 850,000 families, who would lose about $90 a month. Most of them live in the 16 states that have taken advantage of a loophole in a utility-assistance program, receiving benefits that Congress did not intend. That loophole should have been closed, but not in such a precipitous way for needy families.'b'Nonetheless, the bill\xe2\x80\x99s authors rejected the far worse cuts in the original House bill, which would have tossed 3.8 million people from the program. As the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities argues, rejecting the farm bill means rolling the dice that the next Congress will do a better job. In today\xe2\x80\x99s environment, that\xe2\x80\x99s a tough bet.'b'It is bad enough that the death penalty is barbaric, racist and arbitrary in its application, but it is also becoming less transparent as the dwindling number of death-penalty states work to hide the means by which they kill people.'b'The increased secrecy around lethal-injection drug protocols is only the latest tactic of pro-death-penalty legislators and corrections officials around the country. In Missouri, this secrecy was 'b'upheld last week'b' by a federal appeals court, which denied a condemned inmate\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional claim that he is entitled to basic information about the drugs that would be used to put him to death.'b'Herbert Smulls 'b'was executed late Wednesday'b' for the 1991 murder of a jewelry-store owner. Missouri refused to name the pharmacy or pharmacies involved in producing the execution drugs.'b'Missouri\xe2\x80\x99s secrecy, along with new legislation in states such as Georgia and Tennessee, is a response to a mounting \xe2\x80\x9ccrisis\xe2\x80\x9d in death-penalty states: Because many drug manufacturers now refuse to supply drugs for use in executions, states are scrambling to replenish their stocks. This often means turning to 'b'compounding pharmacies'b', which exist in a largely unregulated world.'b'In 2011, the Drug Enforcement Administration 'b'seized'b' Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s supply of one lethal-injection drug after concerns that it had been illegally imported from Britain. And last fall, Louisiana officials sought to buy drugs from an Oklahoma pharmacy, the Apothecary Shoppe, which 'b'was not licensed to provide drugs'b' in Louisiana.'b'There have been multiple reports of previously untested drug combinations leading to botched executions, which is a polite way of saying the condemned person suffered greatly while being put to death. (On Jan. 16, an Ohio man, Dennis McGuire, 'b'appeared'b' to gasp and choke after being administered a new combination of lethal-injection drugs.) States should simply admit that they don\xe2\x80\x99t really know how these drug protocols will work, but instead they have tried to hide almost all information about the drugs and who makes them \xe2\x80\x94 increasingly through legislation.'b'Some courts have had little patience for this behavior. In July, a Georgia judge issued a last-minute stay of execution to one inmate, reasoning that the state\xe2\x80\x99s secrecy law \xe2\x80\x9c'b'makes it impossible'b'\xe2\x80\x9d to show that the drug protocol violates the Eighth Amendment.'b'But, on Friday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit 'b'ruled'b' that Mr. Smulls had no constitutional claim against Missouri\xe2\x80\x99s practice because he had not demonstrated that the \xe2\x80\x9crisk of severe pain\xe2\x80\x9d from the state\xe2\x80\x99s intended drug protocol would be substantially greater than a readily available alternative. As the dissent argued, this \xe2\x80\x9cplaces an absurd burden on death row inmates,\xe2\x80\x9d who must identify \xe2\x80\x9ca readily available alternative method for their own executions,\xe2\x80\x9d even though the state won\xe2\x80\x99t let them see the method it plans to use.'b'Meanwhile, Missouri and other states race to execute inmates using new and untested drug protocols developed on the fly and under a cowardly shroud of secrecy. Mr. Smulls was the third inmate executed in Missouri since November. In some states, lawmakers have even proposed 'b'reintroducing older execution methods'b', such as the firing squad and electrocution, so as to avoid the escalating legal battles over lethal injection.'b'In the end, the argument over what is the most \xe2\x80\x9chumane\xe2\x80\x9d way to kill someone only obscures the larger point, which is that, in the 21st century, the United States has no business putting people to death by any means. Public support for capital punishment has reached a 40-year low, and virtually all other Western societies have rejected it. It will end here, too, but not until this despicable practice is dragged out into the open for all to see.'b'LAGOS, Nigeria \xe2\x80\x94  In the weeks since Jan. 7, when President Goodluck Jonathan signed the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act into law, nearly 40 purportedly gay men have been arrested in Bauchi State alone, with warrants out for the arrests of another 168 suspects, according to Dorothy Aken\xe2\x80\x99Ova, executive director of the International Center for Reproductive Health and Sexual Rights. So far, it seems that at least one man has been punished, with 20 lashes. No doubt much is happening that we are not hearing about. Many things go unreported in Nigeria for all sorts of reasons, not the least of them being a justice system that often contradicts itself.'b'Take the new law. It stipulates 14 years in prison for anyone who enters into a same-sex union, and 10 years for \xe2\x80\x9cany person who registers, operates or participates in gay clubs, societies and organizations or directly or indirectly makes public show of same-sex amorous relationship.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is assuming that English Common Law \xe2\x80\x94 which Nigeria inherited from Britain after independence \xe2\x80\x94 will be applied. However, in the years since military rule ended in 1999, and in defiance of the secular provisions of the Constitution, nine of the 19 northern states, including Bauchi, embraced Shariah, as did some parts of another three.'b'Those arrested in the north will be tried under Islamic law, where the punishment for sodomy is death. Their cases will be tried in the so-called Area Courts, which were summed up by a retired magistrate in a report by the Civil Liberties Organization. \xe2\x80\x9cEspecially in criminal matters,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared, there is \xe2\x80\x9ca general ignorance of applicable laws and procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d This was illustrated in 2002 in cases against two women who were sentenced to be stoned to death for adultery. But their sentences were overturned. No one in modern times has been executed that way in Nigeria, although at least one man did have his right hand amputated for stealing a cow.'b'The Islamic legal code is enforced by a special, state-funded force known as Hisbah, partly because some state governments don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the federal police are up to the job. While it is true that the federal police are understaffed and mired in corruption, it is also doubtful that they would want to spend their limited resources  arresting people on morals charges. The well-funded Hisbah, by contrast, are a zealous lot. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will go into every nook and cranny,\xe2\x80\x9d said Usman Nabahani, deputy head of the Hisbah in Kano State, to fully enforce \xe2\x80\x9cthe prohibition of prostitution, gay marriages and consumption of alcohol.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is absurd on several levels. State police forces are illegal under the Constitution, even though state governors say they are needed to fight crime. Moreover, homosexuality was already a criminal offense under federal law, so why bother with yet another statute, one that has drawn so much international protest?'b'Preserving national unity \xe2\x80\x94 or the illusion of it \xe2\x80\x94 is one reason. That was why Olusegun Obasanjo, president from 1999 to 2007, ignored the challenge to his authority when he turned a blind eye to the imposition of Shariah in the first place, declaring that it would soon \xe2\x80\x9cfizzle out.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'President Jonathan, a Christian and a southerner, also can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to offend Muslim sensibilities. Desperate to win re-election in February 2015, he knows his only real hurdle is among the majority Muslim northerners, many of whom consider him an interloper. When, as vice president, he succeeded his northern predecessor, President Umaru Yar\xe2\x80\x99Adua, who died in 2010, Mr. Jonathan repudiated an arrangement by his own People\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic Party stipulating that the north and the south would take turns holding Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s presidency for two, four-year terms. Now a powerful coalition of prominent northerners have agreed to  work to ensure his defeat.'b'Still, the anti-gay bill is popular throughout the country. Christian leaders, who wield much political as well as moral power, were full of praise. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the beliefs of most Nigerians, same sex marriage is offensive to us as a people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pastor Ayo Oritsejafor, president of the Christian Association of Nigeria. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile we love all human beings created by God, we also believe that human beings must have restraint.\xe2\x80\x9d He added that individual countries should be free \xe2\x80\x9cto develop according to their cultures.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Behind these sentiments lie the widespread belief that homosexuality is somehow un-African, along with the idea that societies that permit such \xe2\x80\x9cungodly\xe2\x80\x9d acts (i.e. the West) are displaying their moral depravity.'b'So far, only a few prominent voices have spoken out against the law, notably Wole Soyinka, the Nobel laureate, who simply said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat people do in their bedrooms is no business of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Foreign objections  have come with threats to withdraw aid. This apparently worked with Uganda, which has backpedaled on its call to jail gay people for life. But, unlike Uganda, Nigeria is a major oil producer.  Britain has announced an increase in development aid from 200 million pounds ($332 million) to nearly \xc2\xa3270 million. The United States, which buys 70 percent of Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s crude, is considering its options.'b'Though Nigeria has now joined 37 other African countries that outlaw homosexuality, there is some solace in the fact that 13 others \xe2\x80\x94 South Africa, Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Central African Republic, Chad, Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, Benin Republic, Ivory Coast, Guinea Bissau and Equatorial Guinea \xe2\x80\x94 have actively legislated to protect the rights of L.G.B.T. people.'b'Meanwhile, the Kenyan writer Binyavanga Wainaina has ratcheted up the debate by choosing to come out, asserting, among other things, that homosexuality in Africa actually \xe2\x80\x9ccame out of the box a long time ago\xe2\x80\x9d but that attacking it has been an easy tool for populists. He also belittled talk that it was somehow foreign. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a pan-Africanist,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared. \xe2\x80\x9cI belong to this continent.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'\n'b'Adewale Maja-Pearce'b' is a writer and critic, and the author of \xe2\x80\x9cRemembering Ken Saro-Wiwa, and Other Essays.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'In recent months, India has welcomed the Japanese emperor, then the defense minister, and last weekend, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, at national Republic Day celebrations. K. Shankar Bajpai, a former secretary of Indian external affairs, said: \xe2\x80\x9cIndia and Japan can honestly say that they are not building relations in hostility against China. But it is right for them to plan for the eventuality of Chinese hostility.\xe2\x80\x9d Between India and Japan, this is largely a marriage of convenience.'b'Both have territorial disputes with China. India fought a border war with China in 1962 and, last year, had several military standoffs. But, in October, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India and Prime Minister Li Keqiang of China signed an agreement pledging restraint on border issues. Japan has an escalating territorial dispute with China over islets in the East China Sea. Japanese and Chinese leaders have been unable to meet to ease the tension. And Mr. Abe has long regarded India as a powerful counterweight to China\xe2\x80\x99s strategic rise.'b'Mr. Abe offered a $2 billion loan for an array of infrastructure investments including the expansion of the New Delhi Metro train services, the Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor project and a children\xe2\x80\x99s hospital. Mr. Abe and Mr. Singh agreed to discuss further Japanese aid and loans to India for nuclear power reactors and high-speed rail systems.  But Mr. Singh declined to take sides in the territorial dispute between China and Japan.'b'What Mr. Abe got from India were agreements for the director of Japan\xe2\x80\x99s national security council to meet regularly with the Indian counterpart, and to hold consultations between the countries\xe2\x80\x99 defense and foreign ministers. India also invited Japan to join an India-United States naval exercise. Both India and Japan are pleased by the state of their relationship. Still, Mr. Abe should realize that India is not about to weigh in on Japan\xe2\x80\x99s differences with China. He needs to coordinate his China policy with Washington, which sees little gain from confronting China.'b'The political crisis in Ukraine has reached a critical turning point, at which each side must consider what it stands to lose from further conflict. On Saturday, President Viktor Yanukovych unexpectedly offered serious concessions to opponents camped out on the Maidan, as Independence Square in Kiev is known, including senior government posts to two of the opposition leaders. On Tuesday, his prime minister and close political ally, Mykola Azarov, resigned, while the Parliament voted to repeal most of the laws passed earlier in the crisis limiting freedom of speech and assembly.  Then on Thursday, the president went on sick leave, but without signing into law the repeal, leaving both the measure and a broader, negotiated solution with the opposition hanging in the air.'b'Mr. Yanukovych has to be aware that his grip on power is slipping fast, and that his political survival depends on cutting a deal. That might seem to argue for the opposition to continue fighting until his corrupt administration is ousted. But danger lies that way. For one thing, the Ukrainian economy is disintegrating. The Russian aid that helped persuade Mr. Yanukovych to reject an agreement with the European Union last November \xe2\x80\x94 and thus triggering the protests \xe2\x80\x94 has provided a slim financial lifeline. Perhaps ominously for Mr. Yanukovych, reports from Kiev on Wednesday suggested that Russia might refuse to come through with the next $2 billion of its $15 billion package.'b'Another problem is that the opposition is united largely in its disgust with the corruption and authoritarianism of the Yanukovych-led political elite and a vague longing for Westernization and transparency. Beyond that, the protesters are sharply divided. The differences were on display Wednesday when five people were wounded in a spat over who would control the occupied building of the Agriculture Ministry.'b'No matter how incompetent, discredited or unhealthy he may be, Mr. Yanukovych is the democratically elected president, and to oust him by street protests and without a coherent plan or united leadership would be a recipe for further turmoil and a dangerous precedent.'b'This is not the time to spurn negotiations. Though the opposition rightly rejected Mr. Yanukovych\xe2\x80\x99s offer of two government positions, it should take his concessions seriously and join him in seeking a suitable compromise. The West could help by seriously considering emergency aid and by proposing to actively mediate. A popular revolt that began with hope in the West should not end in disillusionment with the West.'b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94  On Sunday, El Salvador will hold elections for a new president. In Washington, some on the right are raising alarms that the party of El Salvador\xe2\x80\x99s onetime leftist guerrilla army, the F.M.L.N., will win re-election, with a former guerrilla commander as the new president. The drumbeat started early this month when Elliott Abrams, who oversaw the Reagan administration\xe2\x80\x99s Central America policy during El Salvador\xe2\x80\x99s civil war, warned in The Washington Post of the dangers of an F.M.L.N. victory. He cited the party\xe2\x80\x99s connections with the Colombian leftist movement FARC, and accusations of its involvement in the drug and arms trades. Other conservatives have echoed his warning. Implicit is a threat that if Salvadorans make the wrong choice, America will reduce its support.'b'From 1985 to 1988, I worked closely with Mr. Abrams at the State Department. I respect his honesty, but I believe he is wrong in this case. I travel often to El Salvador on business. I have seen how much the country, and the F.M.L.N., have changed in the 22 years since the war ended in 1992. I believe those spreading fear are stuck in the past.'b'I served as the American ambassador  during the final three and a half years of the war, and the first months of peace. I know well how grisly that war was; the State Department protected me with Delta Team security, believing I was high on the F.M.L.N.\xe2\x80\x99s hit list. But a lasting peace was negotiated in 1992, and in 2009 the F.M.L.N., relying on the ballot box, fairly won the right to govern.'b'That year, the party chose Mauricio Funes, a television journalist, as its candidate, precisely to reassure voters that the F.M.L.N. would not reignite old conflicts. But presidents are limited to one term, and after five years of mixed reviews, the F.M.L.N. has nominated Salvador S\xc3\xa1nchez Cer\xc3\xa9n, who is considered a far more orthodox F.M.L.N. representative, as its flag-bearer. His campaign promises a more rigorous, but lawful and peaceful, effort to address the F.M.L.N.\xe2\x80\x99s core issues \xe2\x80\x94 the corrosive inequality and social injustice that underlaid the civil war.'b'It is not my place to assess the merits of Mr. S\xc3\xa1nchez Cer\xc3\xa9n. This is 2014, not 1992. He and his party have earned a fair chance to let El Salvador\xe2\x80\x99s voters decide. The peace agreement 22 years ago ended one of the  bloodiest civil wars in Latin American history. On one side was a right-wing government that had used every tool at its command, including American assistance, in a vain effort to crush the F.M.L.N. insurgency. Both sides used terror, but government forces and civilian right-wing militias were among the most promiscuous by far. Few Salvadorans can forget the bodies, the disappearances, the torture of loved ones carried out by American-supported security forces, all in the name of defeating Communism. But in the aftermath, F.M.L.N. perpetrators who were judged to be terrorists were placed on blacklists by the United States, while right-wing terrorists seldom were. Even today, most former F.M.L.N. commanders remain ineligible for American visas while right-wing terrorists are seldom so identified. A similar imbalance between left and right characterizes the accusations of corruption and criminality.'b'In 1992, there were understandable concerns regarding the intentions of the F.M.L.N. Salvadoran voters  gave Arena, the party of the right, three successive victories. But now, after five years in power, the F.M.L.N. has played down leftist rhetoric and has come to realize \xe2\x80\x94  enthusiastically and publicly  \xe2\x80\x94 that El Salvador needs to work with the United States to confront its problems. Lawlessness, corruption,  poverty and narcotics trafficking all worsened during the years of Arena rule, and little was done to improve the lives of the poor.'b'So when Americans demonize former F.M.L.N. commanders like Mr. S\xc3\xa1nchez Cer\xc3\xa9n, either for their activities during the war or for accepting assistance from the Castro regime  or from the political heirs of Venezuela\xe2\x80\x99s Hugo Ch\xc3\xa1vez, they are making a big mistake. The Salvadoran people view Venezuelan assistance as a blessing. American assistance  has dwindled, even though an estimated one-fifth of people born in El Salvador now live in the United States. Salvadoran migrants send home $4 billion or so in remittances each year \xe2\x80\x94 90 percent of it from the United States. These payments account for more than 16 percent of El Salvador\xe2\x80\x99s gross national product, more than any other source. And narcotics trafficking, gang violence and money laundering are problems all shared with the United States. We should welcome the F.M.L.N.\xe2\x80\x99s statements of good faith and cooperate with it.'b'Mr. Abrams did get one important point right: Corruption, criminality and violence all undermine democracy. That is what makes Central America a hot spot posing a threat to our national security. Do some in the F.M.L.N. wish the United States ill so long after the war? Yes. Are some engaged in corruption? Certainly. But in both cases, the same could be said of some players on the right. So should the United States pay close attention to this election? Yes. But we should not fear the prospect of another five years of F.M.L.N. rule.'b'I am neither predicting, nor advocating, an F.M.L.N. victory, though polls suggest it is likely. But Salvadorans must be able to make their choice free of veiled suggestions that one or another outcome will lead to a worsening of United States-Salvadoran relations. If the majority deem an F.M.L.N. victory better for them than the alternatives, we must respect that choice.'b''b'\n'b'William G. Walker, 'b' a retired career diplomat, was the United States ambassador to El Salvador from 1988 to 1992. 'b''b'GSTAAD, Switzerland \xe2\x80\x94  Events in the new Middle East, which is located in western Asia like the old Middle East, can seem confusing. In the belief that clarity leads to understanding, which in turn leads to good policy, here is a primer for the region.'b'1) The United States invaded Iraq in 2003 because of its weapons of mass destruction program. However, Iraq did not have any weapons of mass destruction. The invasion brought the Shiite (see below) majority to power, so advancing the interests of Shiite Iran, America\xe2\x80\x99s enemy. It ousted the Sunnis, upsetting the Sunni-Shiite balance in the Middle East. This infuriated Sunni Saudi Arabia, America\xe2\x80\x99s ally (in theory).'b'2) To redress the balance, the wealthy Saudi royal family backs Sunni Islamists in Syria against the country\xe2\x80\x99s despot, Bashar al-Assad (who is from the quasi-Shiite Alawite sect), but at the same time is bankrolling the destruction of Sunni Islamists in Egypt. This wrong sort of Sunnis, known as the Muslim Brotherhood, commits the ultimate l\xc3\xa8se-majest\xc3\xa9 of believing in the ballot box as a source of authority rather than royal lineage.'b'3) In the aftermath of the Arab Spring (see below) the three main Arab states \xe2\x80\x94 Egypt, Syria and Iraq \xe2\x80\x94 are in disarray. The functioning or semi-functioning states in the Middle East are non-Arab: Israel, Turkey and Iran. Israel has been in a stop-go war with Arabs since 1948 over claims to the same land but is most angry with Iran, which is not Arab, not Sunni and not on its border.'b'4) Sunni-Shiite tensions have escalated through the Syrian war. They are now regional. The Sykes-Picot Middle Eastern order is in tatters. Sir Mark Sykes and Fran\xc3\xa7ois Georges-Picot were dyspeptic European diplomats who drew lines on maps that became the borders of the modern Middle East (don\xe2\x80\x99t sweat the details).'b'5) Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk Turkey: It backs the Sunni fighters battling to oust Assad in Syria. But it is close to Iran, which supports Assad against this very Sunni insurgency. The Turkish government is furious about a military coup in Egypt that last year ousted a democratically elected Muslim Brotherhood president. The United States declines to call this coup a coup. It is wise not to ask why if you plan to visit Egypt, which you probably don\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'6) Think of the Middle East as a huge arms bazaar. The United States plans to sell Apache helicopters to the 'b'Shiite 'b'government of Iraq, with which to suppress Sunni revanchist stirrings, while the United States is (sort of) supporting the 'b'Sunnis 'b' against the Shiite-backed Assad in Syria.'b'7) Saudi Arabia thinks the United States is not backing the Sunnis 'b'enough'b' in Syria. The Saudis blame Iran for everything, including (but not limited to) unrest in Bahrain, the Arab Spring, terrorism and the melting of the polar ice cap. The Sunni Wahhabi Islamism trafficked by the Saudi royal family sees Zionism as its enemy. However, Saudi views are often identical to Israeli views (again, don\xe2\x80\x99t sweat the details).'b'8) Like the old Middle East the new Middle East has a cottage industry called the peace process. This involves Israelis, Palestinians and various mediators, principally the United States. Palestinians are represented by the Palestinian Authority, an authority that has no authority over Palestinians in Gaza, no democratic legitimacy, and no obvious claim to represent anything but itself.'b'9) Israel has a nuclear deterrent but tries to pretend it does not because if it did it could presumably deter Iran, which does not have a nuclear weapon. The United States and Israel have agreed never to talk about the Jewish state\xe2\x80\x99s alleged nuclear weapons (again, don\xe2\x80\x99t ask).'b'10) The Arab Spring happened three years ago. Several nasty despots were swept out. This event demonstrated that nobody controls the new Middle East: No nation could produce that much change that fast. The revolutions produced a vacuum. Sectarianism loves a vacuum. Sectarianism means looking out for your own and brutalizing the rest (see Egypt, Syria etc.).'b'11) Iran is a theocracy. The supreme leader stands in for the hidden imam, who disappeared long ago but could show up any time. (Sunnis and Shiites had an inheritance wrangle after Muhammad\xe2\x80\x99s death in 632, which led to a split. One thing they don\xe2\x80\x99t agree about is the hidden imam.) Iran has something called a nuclear issue. The United States and other powers have reached an interim nuclear accord with Iran opposed by Israel, Saudi Arabia, the largest American pro-Israel lobby, and many members of the U.S. Congress who have drafted a bill President Obama vows to veto that says America should \xe2\x80\x9cstand with Israel\xe2\x80\x9d and provide \xe2\x80\x9cdiplomatic, military and economic support\xe2\x80\x9d to Israel if it goes to war with Iran, which it has been threatening to do for a very long time.'b'12) Got it now? Good. If not, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. Foreign policy is a posh term for managing contradictions.'b'OXFORD, England \xe2\x80\x94  On Jan. 14, the Israeli defense minister, Moshe Yaalon, told the daily Yediot Aharonot, \xe2\x80\x9cSecretary of State John Kerry \xe2\x80\x94 who arrived here determined, who operates from an incomprehensible obsession and a sense of messianism \xe2\x80\x94 can\xe2\x80\x99t teach me anything about the conflict with the Palestinians.\xe2\x80\x9d Even by Israeli standards, Mr. Yaalon\xe2\x80\x99s comments were rather rude. Mr. Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s crime was to try to broker Israeli-Palestinian peace talks that began last July and to stipulate a nine-month deadline. This is the kind of talk that gives chutzpah a bad name.'b'The episode also reveals a great deal about the nature of the much-vaunted special relationship between the United States and Israel. It suggests that this relationship is a one-way street, with America doing all the diplomatic heavy lifting while Israel limits its role to obstruction and whining \xe2\x80\x94 repaying Uncle Sam\xe2\x80\x99s generosity with ingratitude and scorn.'b'Israeli leaders have always underlined the vital importance of self-reliance when it comes to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security. But the simple truth is that Israel wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to survive for very long without American support. Since 1949, America\xe2\x80\x99s economic aid to Israel amounts to a staggering $118 billion and America continues to subsidize the Jewish state to the tune of $3 billion annually. America is also Israel\xe2\x80\x99s main arms supplier and the official guarantor of its \xe2\x80\x9cquantitative military edge\xe2\x80\x9d over all its Arab neighbors.'b'In the diplomatic arena, Israel relies on America to shield it from the consequences of its habitual violations of international law. The International Court of Justice pronounced the so-called \xe2\x80\x9csecurity barrier\xe2\x80\x9d that Israel is building on the West Bank to be illegal. All of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s civilian settlements on the West Bank violate the Fourth Geneva Convention, but Israel continues to expand them.'b'Since 1978, when the Camp David Accords were brokered by President Jimmy Carter, the United States has used its veto power on the Security Council 42 times on behalf of Israel. The most shocking abuse of this power was to veto, in February 2011, a resolution condemning Israeli settlement expansion that had the support of the 14 other members of the Security Council.'b"Some Americans, especially those of the neoconservative persuasion, favor the strongest support for Israel on the grounds that the interests of the two allies coincide in the Middle East. An argument can be made that the occupation of the West Bank serves Israel's security interests even if it erodes the foundations of Israeli democracy and turns Israel into an international pariah."b'There is no rational argument, however, that Israel\xe2\x80\x99s occupation of the West Bank serves America\xe2\x80\x99s national interest. On the contrary, as General David Petraeus told a Senate committee in 2010, the occupation foments anti-American sentiment throughout the Islamic world and hinders the development of America\xe2\x80\x99s partnership with Arab governments. A resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is therefore a major, if not vital American interest.'b"America poses as an honest broker, but everywhere it is perceived as Israel's lawyer. The American-sponsored \xe2\x80\x9cpeace process\xe2\x80\x9d since 1991 has been a charade: all process and no peace while providing Israel with just the cover it needs to pursue its illegal and aggressive colonial project on the West Bank."b'The Quartet, which consists of the United States, Russia, the United Nations and European Union, came up in 2003 with an excellent road map for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel by the end of 2005. But the Quartet cannot act independently of the United States to pressure Israel. Its record suggests that it is little more than a clever American device for wasting time.'b'Mr. Kerry is to be commended for the energy and commitment that he has displayed in pursuit of peace in the Middle East and for the 11 trips he has made to the region in his first year in office. But his peace mission was doomed to failure from the start. The Kerry-hating Mr. Yaalon and his hawk-infested Likud party are committed to the geopolitical status quo on the West Bank at almost any price. Their real aim is to terminate the peace talks and blame the Palestinians.'b'In a normal country a defense minister who played fast and loose with such a crucial bilateral relationship would have been thrown out on his ear. But Israel is not a normal country.'b'The reason that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not disown his defense minister is that what Mr. Yaalon said is what Mr. Netanyahu thinks.  The real problem is not Mr. Yaalon\xe2\x80\x99s bad manners but the policy that he and Mr. Netanyahu are trying to foist on their senior ally: to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state, to confront Iran, to protect Israel\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear monopoly, and to preserve its regional hegemony solely by military means. This program is diametrically opposed to America\xe2\x80\x99s true national security  interests.'b'America gives Israel money, arms and advice. Israel takes the money, it takes the arms, and it rudely rejects the advice.'b'The fundamental problem with American support for Israel is its unconditional nature. Consequently, Israel does not have to pay a price for acting unilaterally in a multilateral world, for its flagrant violations of international law, and for its systematic abuse of Palestinian human rights.'b'Blind support for the Jewish state does not advance the cause of peace. America is going nowhere in the Middle East until it makes the provision of money and arms conditional on good manners and, more importantly, on Israeli respect for its advice.'b''b'\n'b'Avi Shlaim 'b'is an emeritus professor of international relations at Oxford University and the author of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Iron Wall: Israel and the Arab World.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'SPOKANE, Wa. \xe2\x80\x94 Only the snarkiest would not be open to the likable life story of Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the Eastern Washington politician who gave the \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d Republican response to the president\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union speech. She\xe2\x80\x99s a farm girl from a big empty county just north of here, first in her family to attend college, mother of three, a rare woman in the retrograde men\xe2\x80\x99s club of her party\xe2\x80\x99s leadership.'b'Her district, poorer than the west side of the state, with much of the broken-family, broken-promise poverty of white rural America, is in real trouble. But the policy prescriptions of McMorris Rodgers have nothing to offer these people. Through her, you can see what happens when biography trumps substance in politics.'b'Consider Stevens County, her home, an area about half the size of Connecticut with fewer than 50,000 people. It\xe2\x80\x99s gorgeous country, hard by the Columbia River, but a hard place to make a decent living. The county\xe2\x80\x99s unemployment rate was 30 percent above the national average last year. One in six people live below the poverty level. One in five are on food stamps. And the leading employer is government, providing 3,023 of the 9,580 nonfarm payroll jobs last year.'b'Given that picture, it would seem surprising that McMorris Rodgers voted to drastically cut food aid last year, and joined her party in resisting emergency benefits to the unemployed. She has been a leading strategist in the unrelenting Republican attempt to kill the Affordable Care Act.'b'And yet, in her district, people are flocking to Obamacare \xe2\x80\x94 well beyond the national average. Though she has been screening town hall meetings to highlight only critics of the new law, her constituents are doing something entirely different in making their personal health decisions.'b'In Spokane County, the most populous in the Fifth Congressional District with nearly half a million people, the rate of participation in the new health care law is even well above the state average. At the end of December, signups were 102 percent of the state target. That\xe2\x80\x99s saying something, because Washington, with a big range of insurance choices and a well-run exchange, has been one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s success stories for the Affordable Care Act.'b'Ignoring what her own neighbors are doing, McMorris Rodgers said on Tuesday that new health care law \xe2\x80\x9cis not working.\xe2\x80\x9d But if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, why have nearly one in 12 people in her home county signed up for expanded Medicaid coverage or new private health insurance? It could be, as the state noted, because the average time it takes a poor person to apply for health care here has now been cut from 45 days to 45 minutes.'b'On Tuesday night, McMorris Rodgers talked about how she worked at McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s as a teen. But don\xe2\x80\x99t expect any help from her on raising the minimum wage for the people holding the job she left behind. Her state, with the highest minimum wage in the country at $9.32 an hour and job growth above the national average, has shown the fallacy of her party\xe2\x80\x99s argument that raising wages for low-end workers is a net job killer.'b'Lucky for the people in Eastern Washington they live in a state that has extended Medicaid to working poor and consistently raised its minimum wage. This would not happen if Republicans governed as they preach.'b'So, McMorris Rodgers clearly votes against the welfare of her constituents \xe2\x80\x94 no surprise there. That\xe2\x80\x99s the \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the Matter With Kansas\xe2\x80\x9d premise, based on the Thomas Frank book documenting how poor whites choose cultural and social issues over economic ones at the ballot box.'b'What doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense is how McMorris Rodgers is so full of animus toward the leading employer of her county, government. Yes, she protects the Air Force base here, as if it\xe2\x80\x99s not really government, and payments to wealthy wheat farmers. But every other form of federal outlay is demonized.'b'It gets stranger still when looking at her career. On Tuesday night, she proudly mentioned working in an orchard and a fruit stand as a girl. But since then, she has spent most her adult life in \xe2\x80\x94 you guessed it \xe2\x80\x94 government. She\xe2\x80\x99s been on a state or federal payroll since graduating from Pensacola Christian College, in the early 1990s.'b'As for the substance of the Republican alternative, there was none. Her speech was soft-focus theater and platitudes. The message was: We\xe2\x80\x99re not all angry white guys. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes, Republicans think just putting a woman up front means somehow that women are going to feel good about the party,\xe2\x80\x9d Christine Whitman, the former New Jersey governor, and a Republican, told The Los Angeles Times. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not about the messenger. It\xe2\x80\x99s about the message.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And the message was mush. For those struggling, the congresswoman said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have plans,\xe2\x80\x9d at least four times, and then mentioned no plans. It was the same market-tested ether about \xe2\x80\x9cempowering you\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctrusting people, not government.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Reducing dependence and giving people a way to step up the class ladder are fine goals. And no doubt, broken families and single parents \xe2\x80\x94 as the Republican Party has long pointed out \xe2\x80\x94 keep many people in poverty. But one way to strengthen families is to help them with the kind of medical debt that forces people onto food stamps or prompts a woman to work two jobs, with no time for her kids.'b'The reason that large numbers of people here in the home district of Cathy McMorris Rodgers are signing up for the first chance in their lives to get affordable, or even free, health care is because they know something their member of Congress doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. The girl who once picked apples in Kettle Falls can\xe2\x80\x99t see what they see, because she\xe2\x80\x99s committed to a party that won\xe2\x80\x99t allow it.'b''b' 'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Alone, Yet Not Alone'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (column, Jan. 28):'b'David Brooks paints a beautiful picture of the religious experience \xe2\x80\x94 one that recognizes the sublime, sees beauty in the ordinary, feels love and hope in the curious spirit of humanity and seeks truth in a world with no instruction manual.

It is a welcome sign that seven months after the Senate passed a comprehensive bill that included a path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants now in the country illegally, there might be movement on the issue this year.'b'The Republican proposal predicates legalization for the undocumented on stringent requirements and border enforcement. The House speaker, John A. Boehner, ruled out any \xe2\x80\x9cspecial path to citizenship\xe2\x80\x9d for undocumented migrants, but seemed to leave open the possibility that they could eventually be naturalized. Even that stance, however, is likely to raise hackles among conservatives.'b'Those who take this ultraconservative position (including many aligned with the Tea Party) are blind to the lessons of history. The United States has a long track record not only of legalizing illegal immigrants, by legislative or administrative action, but also of pairing legalization with a grant of permanent residency, the prerequisite for naturalization.'b'After the passage of the severely restrictive National Origins Act of 1924, which cut annual admissions of immigrants to the United States by 85 percent of pre-World War I levels, many Europeans, wishing to join family members in America, entered the country unlawfully. In the 1930s and 1940s, tens of thousands of people, overwhelmingly Europeans and Canadians, were legalized by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Labor Department and the Justice Department through various administrative programs. In each case, the adjustment to legal status came with permanent residency.'b'Even the McCarran-Walter Act of 1952, known mostly as a conservative immigration measure, included provisions for suspending deportation orders in cases in which deportation would separate families or otherwise result in hardship. These provisions also included adjustment to permanent resident status. The most recent legalization program, under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, granted permanent residency, or green cards, to 2.7 million people.'b'The rationale for the linking of legalization and permanent residency is straightforward. Legalization recognizes that the undocumented have become part of our society \xe2\x80\x94 by working, paying taxes, raising families, owning property and the like. In other words, we recognize their de facto inclusion and we adjust their status to align with that reality.'b'Not all immigrants wish to naturalize, of course, and none should be forced to do so. But since the nation\xe2\x80\x99s founding, we have always recognized that access to citizenship is the best way to promote social and economic integration, democratic participation and political equality.'b'The alternative now envisioned by some House members \xe2\x80\x94 legal status without access to citizenship \xe2\x80\x94 would effectively create a new stratum of society, a permanent second class of Americans.'b'We have been down that road before, with grim results. The Asiatic exclusion laws, in force from the 1880s to the World War II era, were openly racist attempts to protect America from the \xe2\x80\x9cyellow peril\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cunassimilables.\xe2\x80\x9d These laws not only prohibited most prospective immigrants from China and other Asian countries from entering; they also excluded all Asians from naturalized citizenship, including merchants and professionals who were otherwise legal residents. In most Western states exclusion from citizenship also meant exclusion from owning agricultural property and from a range of occupations, from teaching to commercial fishing.'b'Congress repealed the Chinese exclusion law in 1943, when China had become an American war ally. By 1952 all the other Asian exclusion laws had fallen. In the late 1950s the I.N.S. and Justice Department legalized some 30,000 Chinese-American \xe2\x80\x9cpaper sons,\xe2\x80\x9d who had entered the country with false identities in order to circumvent the Chinese exclusion laws. They, too, all received green cards, and those who had served in the United States armed forces during World War II instantly became citizens. In 2012 Congress expressed \xe2\x80\x9cregret\xe2\x80\x9d over the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.'b'Today\xe2\x80\x99s political opposition to a path to citizenship is out of sync with democratic principles, historical practice and the vast majority of public opinion. It is punitive in spirit. It also suggests an unease with the prospect of more Latino voters. Republicans seem divided between those who recognize the need to appeal to the growing Latino electorate and those who would rather shut out prospective Latino voters than try to win their support.'b'Citizenship is precious.

The radiation doses of CT scans (a series of 'b'X-ray'b' images from multiple angles) are 100 to 1,000 times higher than conventional X-rays.'b'Of course, early diagnosis thanks to medical imaging can be lifesaving. But there is distressingly little evidence of better health outcomes associated with the current high rate of scans. There is, however, evidence of its harms.'b'The relationship between radiation and the development of cancer is well understood: A single 'b'CT scan'b' exposes a patient to the amount of radiation that epidemiologic evidence shows can be cancer-causing. The risks have been demonstrated directly in two large clinical studies in Britain and Australia. In the British study, children exposed to multiple CT scans were found to be three times more likely to develop leukemia and brain cancer. In a 2011 report sponsored by Susan G. Komen, the Institute of Medicine concluded that radiation from medical imaging, and hormone therapy, the use of which has substantially declined in the last decade, were the leading environmental causes of 'b'breast cancer'b', and advised that women reduce their exposure to unnecessary CT scans.'b'CTs, once rare, are now routine. One in 10 Americans undergo a CT scan every year, and many of them get more than one. This growth is a result of multiple factors, including a desire for early diagnoses, higher quality imaging technology, direct-to-consumer advertising and the financial interests of doctors and imaging centers. CT scanners cost millions of dollars; having made that investment, purchasers are strongly incentivized to use them.'b'While it is difficult to know how many cancers will result from medical imaging, a 2009 study from the National Cancer Institute estimates that CT scans conducted in 2007 will cause a projected 29,000 excess cancer cases and 14,500 excess deaths over the lifetime of those exposed. Given the many scans performed over the last several years, a reasonable estimate of excess lifetime cancers would be in the hundreds of thousands. According to our calculations, unless we change our current practices, 3 percent to 5 percent of all future cancers may result from exposure to medical imaging.'b'We know that these tests are overused. But even when they are appropriately used, they are not always done in the safest ways possible. The rule is that doses for medical imaging should be as low as reasonably achievable. But there are no specific guidelines for what these doses are, and thus there is considerable variation within and between institutions. The dose at one hospital can be as much as 50 times stronger than at another.'b'A recent study at one New York hospital found that nearly a third of its patients undergoing multiple cardiac imaging tests were getting a cumulative effective dose of more than 100 millisieverts of radiation \xe2\x80\x94 equivalent to 5,000 chest X-rays. And last year, a survey of nuclear cardiologists found that only 7 percent of stress tests were done using a \xe2\x80\x9cstress first\xe2\x80\x9d protocol (examining an image of the heart after exercise before deciding whether it was necessary to take one of it at rest), which can decrease radiation exposure by up to 75 percent.'b'In recent years, the medical profession has made some progress on these issues. The American College of Radiology and the American College of Cardiology have issued \xe2\x80\x9cappropriateness criteria\xe2\x80\x9d to help doctors consider the risks and benefits before ordering a test. And the insurance industry has started using radiology benefit managers, who investigate whether an imaging test is necessary before authorizing payment for it. Some studies have shown that the use of medical imaging has begun to slow.'b'But we still have a long way to go. Fortunately, we can reduce the rate of medical imaging by simply avoiding unnecessary scans and minimizing the radiation from appropriate ones. For example, emergency room physicians routinely order multiple CT scans even before meeting a patient. Such practices, for which there is little or no evidence of benefit, should be eliminated.'b'Better monitoring and guidelines would also help. The Food and Drug Administration oversees the approval of scanners, but does not have regulatory oversight for how they are used. We need clear standards, published by professional radiology societies or organizations like the Joint Commission or the F.D.A. In order to be accredited for CT scans, hospitals and imaging clinics should be required to track the doses they use and ensure that they are truly as low as possible by comparing them to published guidelines.'b'Patients have a part to play as well. Consumers can go to the 'b'Choosing Wisely website'b' to learn about the most commonly overused tests. Before agreeing to a CT scan, they should ask: Will it lead to a better treatment and outcome? Would they get that therapy without the test? Are there alternatives that don\xe2\x80\x99t involve radiation, like 'b'ultrasound'b' or 'b'M.R.I.'b'? When a CT scan is necessary, how can radiation exposure be minimized?'b'Neither doctors nor patients want to return to the days before CT scans. But we need to find ways to use them without killing people in the process.'b'President Obama can spend the remainder of his term planting a few more high-tech hubs, working on reforming the patent law and doing the other modest things he mentioned in his State of the Union address. And if he did that, he might do some marginal good, and he would manage the stately decline of his presidency during its final few years.'b'Or, alternately, he can realize that he is now at a moment of liberation. For the past five years he has been inhibited by the need to please donors, to cater to various Congressional constituencies and to play by Washington rules.'b'But the legislating phase of his presidency is now pretty much over. Over the next few years he will be free to think beyond legislation, beyond fund-raising, beyond the necessities of the day-to-day partisanship. He will have the platform and power of the presidency, but, especially after the midterms, fewer short-term political obligations.'b'This means he will have the opportunity to build what he himself could have used over the past few years: An Opportunity Coalition. He\xe2\x80\x99ll have the chance to organize bipartisan groups of mayors, business leaders, legislators, activists and donors into permanent alliances and institutions that will formulate, lobby for, fund and promote opportunity and social mobility agendas for decades to come.'b'There are already signs that President Obama is stepping back to take the long view. In his interviews with David Remnick of The New Yorker, he observed that the president is \xe2\x80\x9cessentially a relay swimmer in a river full of rapids.\xe2\x80\x9d You are trying to do your leg and pass things along to the next swimmer. As president, he\xe2\x80\x99s been made aware of how little a president can accomplish unless there is organized support from the outside. Obama now has the chance to build that support for future presidents, on the issues that concern him most.'b'He might start, for example, by scrambling the current political categories. We now have one liberal tradition that believes in using government to enhance equality. We have another conservative tradition that believes in limiting government to enhance freedom. These two traditions have fought to a standstill and prevented Obama from passing much domestic legislation of late.'b'But there is a third ancient tradition that weaves through American history, geared directly at enhancing opportunity and social mobility. This is the Whig tradition, which begins with people like Henry Clay, Daniel Webster and Abraham Lincoln. This tradition believes in using the power of government to give marginalized Americans the tools to compete in a capitalist economy.'b'The Whigs fought against the divisive populist Jacksonians. They argued that it is better to help people move between classes than to pit classes against each other. They also transcended our current political divisions.'b'The Whigs were interventionist in economics while they were traditionalist and family-oriented in their moral and social attitudes. They believed America should step boldly into the industrial age, even as they championed cultural order. The Whigs championed large infrastructure projects and significant public investments, even as they believed in sacred property rights. They believed in expanding immigration along with assimilation and cohesion.'b'President Obama could travel the country modernizing the Whig impulse, questioning current divisions and eroding the rigid battle lines. More concretely, he could create a group of Simpson-Bowles-type commissions \xe2\x80\x94 with legislators, mayors, governors and others brought together to offer concrete proposals on mobility issues from the beginning to the end of the life span:'b'Is there a way to improve family patterns so disadvantaged young children grow up in more ordered environments? Is there a way to improve Head Start and intelligently expand early childhood education? Is there a way to structure neighborhoods so that teenagers are more likely to thrive? Is there a way to get young men wage subsidies so they are worth marrying? Is there a way to train or provide jobs for unemployed middle-aged workers?'b'These commissions could issue their reports in the spring of 2016, to make life maximally difficult for the next presidential candidates.'b'President Obama could also credential a different style of public sector leader. If you are trying to pass legislation, you staff your administration with political operatives. But if you are trying to change the discussion and mobilize the country, you hire and promote social entrepreneurs, people from Ashoka, Teach for America, Opportunity International, the International Justice Mission and the Clinton Global Initiative. Once hired in this White House, these people will be filling senior government jobs for decades to come.'b'President Obama began his career as an organizer. His mobility agenda floundered because the governing majority he needed to push it forward does not exist. He has the chance to remedy that, to organize, to convene, to build, and to make life a lot easier for the next swimmer in the race.'b'O.K., who ordered that? With everything else going on, the last thing we needed was a new economic crisis in a country already racked by political turmoil. True, the direct global spillovers 'b'from Turkey'b', with 'b'its Los Angeles-sized economy'b', won\xe2\x80\x99t be large. But we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing that dreaded word \xe2\x80\x9ccontagion\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the kind of contagion that once caused a crisis in Thailand to spread across Asia, more recently caused a crisis in Greece to spread across Europe, and now, everyone worries, might cause Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s troubles to spread across the world\xe2\x80\x99s emerging markets.'b'It is, in many ways, a familiar story. But that\xe2\x80\x99s part of what makes it so disturbing: Why do we keep having these crises? And here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing: The intervals between crises seem to be getting shorter, and the fallout from each crisis seems to be worse than the last. What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?'b'Before I get to Turkey, a brief history of global financial crises.'b'For a generation after World War II, the world financial system was, by modern standards, remarkably crisis-free \xe2\x80\x94 probably because most countries placed restrictions on cross-border capital flows, so that international borrowing and lending were limited. In the late 1970s, however, deregulation and rising banker aggressiveness led to a surge of funds into Latin America, followed by what\xe2\x80\x99s known in the trade as a \xe2\x80\x9csudden stop\xe2\x80\x9d in 1982 \xe2\x80\x94 and a crisis that led to a decade of economic stagnation.'b'Latin America eventually returned to growth (although Mexico had a nasty relapse in 1994), but, in the 1990s, a bigger version of 'b'the same story unfolded in Asia'b': Huge money inflows followed by a sudden stop and economic implosion. Some of the Asian economies bounced back quickly, but investment never fully recovered, and neither did growth.'b'Most recently, yet another version of the story has played out within Europe, with a rush of money into Greece, Spain and Portugal, followed by a sudden stop and immense economic pain.'b'As I said, although the outline of the story remains the same, the effects keep getting worse. 'b'Real output fell'b' 4 percent during Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s crisis of 1981-83; it fell 14 percent in Indonesia from 1997 to 1998; it has fallen more than 23 percent in Greece.'b'So is an even worse crisis brewing? The fundamentals are slightly reassuring; Turkey, in particular, has low government debt, and while businesses have borrowed a lot from abroad, 'b'the overall financial situation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look that bad'b'. But each previous crisis defied sanguine expectations. And the same forces that sent money sloshing into Turkey also make the world economy as a whole highly vulnerable.'b'You may or may not have heard that there\xe2\x80\x99s a big debate among economists about whether we face \xe2\x80\x9c'b'secular stagnation'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d What\xe2\x80\x99s that? Well, one way to describe it is as a situation in which the amount people want to save exceeds the volume of investments worth making.'b'When that\xe2\x80\x99s true, you have one of two outcomes. If investors are being cautious and prudent, we are collectively, in effect, trying to spend less than our income, and since my spending is your income and your spending is my income, the result is a persistent slump.'b'Alternatively, flailing investors \xe2\x80\x94 frustrated by low returns and desperate for yield \xe2\x80\x94 can delude themselves, pouring money into ill-conceived projects, be they subprime lending or capital flows to emerging markets. This can boost the economy for a while, but eventually investors face reality, the money dries up and pain follows.'b'If this is a good description of our situation, and I believe it is, we now have a world economy destined to seesaw between bubbles and depression. And that\xe2\x80\x99s not an encouraging thought as we watch what looks like an emerging-markets bubble burst.'b'The larger point is that Turkey isn\xe2\x80\x99t really the problem; neither are South Africa, Russia, Hungary, India, and whoever else is getting hit right now. The real problem is that the world\xe2\x80\x99s wealthy economies \xe2\x80\x94 the United States, the euro area, and smaller players, too \xe2\x80\x94 have failed to deal with their own underlying weaknesses. Most obviously, faced with a private sector that wants to save too much and invest too little, we have pursued austerity policies that deepen the forces of depression. Worse yet, all indications are that, by allowing unemployment to fester, we\xe2\x80\x99re depressing our long-run as well as short-run growth prospects, which will depress private investment even more.'b'Oh, and much of Europe is already 'b'at risk of a Japanese-style deflationary trap'b'. An emerging-markets crisis could, all too plausibly, turn that risk into reality.'b'So Turkey seems to be in serious trouble \xe2\x80\x94 and China, a vastly bigger player, 'b'is looking a bit shaky, too'b'. But what makes these troubles scary is the underlying weakness of Western economies, a weakness made much worse by really, really bad policies.'b'Ben S. Bernanke ascended to the chairmanship of the Federal Reserve eight years ago as a little-known \xe2\x80\x94 albeit distinguished \xe2\x80\x94 Princeton economics professor who had notched just three years of federal public service.'b'When he takes his leave this week, having presided over his final meeting of the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s policy-making committee, he will depart as one of the finest chairmen in the institution\xe2\x80\x99s hundred year history, having played a central role in averting a financial meltdown and lifting the nation out of recession.'b'Mr. Bernanke\xe2\x80\x99s success may seem particularly surprising because before assuming the Fed chairmanship, the closest he had ever been to a financial crisis was his academic research into the Great Depression.'b'Indeed, the economic climate during his early service under President George W. Bush \xe2\x80\x94 who named him a Fed governor, then chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and then finally Fed chairman \xe2\x80\x94 was so benign that in 2004, Mr. Bernanke erroneously called the era one of \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Great Moderation'b',\xe2\x80\x9d in which economic policy had helped tame the business cycle.'b'But when the Great Moderation abruptly ended soon after his arrival as chairman in 2006, Mr. Bernanke shifted to crisis-fighting mode and proved that his first-rate mind was matched by a first-rate temperament.'b'A key to his success was a nonideological approach that allowed him to take on each fresh challenge unshackled to a particular dogma. Similarly, even though he lacked major leadership experience \xe2\x80\x94 as well as any panache \xe2\x80\x94 he proved a calming and confidence-building figure to politicians, colleagues and the bevy of Fed watchers.'b'And his collegial style allowed him to work effectively with two other extraordinarily capable architects of the rescue: Henry M. Paulson Jr., Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s final Treasury secretary, and Timothy F. Geithner, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and later President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s first Treasury secretary.'b'These men first threw out the playbook from past crises as inadequate to the current challenge and then threw out the rule book, as they formulated innovation after innovation to fight the conflagration.'b'Most notable were the 2008 rescue of the insurance giant A.I.G. and the alphabet soup of programs designed to pump liquidity into the frozen financial system.'b'I had a glimpse of Mr. Bernanke\xe2\x80\x99s pragmatic approach as he helped President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s auto task force, which I then headed, navigate the complex world of car financing in the face of obstacles erected by more sharp-elbowed regulators like Sheila C. Bair, the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.'b'To counter the recession, Mr. Bernanke championed cutting interest rates to zero. But when even that proved insufficient, the Fed began its highly controversial program to buy Treasury and other debt as a means of lowering financing costs and stimulating growth.'b'This program, known as quantitative easing, brought a chorus of criticism down on Mr. Bernanke, ironically, mostly from Republicans.'b'An unusually large group of 30 senators \xe2\x80\x94 an equally unusual coalition of inflation-obsessed conservative Republicans paired with liberal Democrats who felt the Fed favored the financial community \xe2\x80\x94 voted against his confirmation to a second term, in 2010.'b'And in a November 2010 letter in The Wall Street Journal, 24 well-known, conservatively inclined economists, financiers and academics decried the asset purchase program as risking \xe2\x80\x9ccurrency debasement and inflation\xe2\x80\x9d while not promoting employment.'b'Well, the group proved wrong on all counts. The program has succeeded in lowering interest rates without causing inflation \xe2\x80\x94 prices were up just 1.5 percent last year.'b'Meanwhile, John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, noted at a recent Brookings Institution symposium on monetary policy that unemployment may have been pushed down by a quarter of a percentage point \xe2\x80\x94 roughly 400,000 jobs \xe2\x80\x94 by just the second phase of quantitative easing.'b'To be sure, in parallel with mispronouncing the Great Moderation, Mr. Bernanke missed the housing bubble. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve never had a decline in house prices on a nationwide basis,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in 2005 while serving in the Bush White House.'b'Similarly, after joining the Fed, Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues failed to detect the onset of recession. And before the crisis, the Fed, under both Mr. Bernanke and his longstanding predecessor, Alan Greenspan, was lax in its regulatory responsibilities.'b'But on balance, Mr. Bernanke\xe2\x80\x99s reign was a godsend. In addition to his policy successes, he brought a measure of transparency to an overly opaque institution, even instituting quarterly news conferences.'b'Importantly, he also deserves praise for being unusually outspoken (by the standards of Fed chairmen) about the nation\xe2\x80\x99s poor fiscal policy, and particularly the too-rapid speed at which the deficit has been reduced, which exacerbated the tepidness of the recovery.'b'At an early January meeting of the American Economic Association in Philadelphia, Mr. Bernanke\xe2\x80\x99s farewell address was followed by a standing ovation, symbolic of the standing ovation he deserves from the entire country.'b'What you need to know now that House Republican leaders have unveiled a list of \xe2\x80\x9cprinciples\xe2\x80\x9d that have raised hopes for a breakthrough on immigration reform this year:'b'Principles are no substitute for actual legislation, and we\xe2\x80\x99re still a great distance from a deal. Repairing a system so huge and so broken is a big undertaking for any Congress, much less this dismally dysfunctional one. The Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 grab bag of ideas still leaves Democrats nothing to negotiate with.'b'That said, 'b'the list\xe2\x80\x99s release Thursday'b', after years of stalemate, leaves us with a palmful of blessings to count.'b''b'LEGALIZATION! 'b''b' 'b' The question about the nation\xe2\x80\x99s 11 million unauthorized immigrants has always been this: Are they out or in? Criminals or potential Americans? The new principles say that these immigrants must \xe2\x80\x9cget right with the law.\xe2\x80\x9d This is a big change from \xe2\x80\x9cget out,\xe2\x80\x9d the central immigration position of the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 2012 presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, who embraced the \xe2\x80\x9cself-deportation\xe2\x80\x9d mantra of his adviser Kris Kobach, author of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s brutal immigration law. Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s moral and electoral failure left his party in dire straits with Latino voters. From absolute denial to the brink of grudging acceptance is a big step away from neo-nativism.'b''b''b'AN OVERDUE EPIPHANY ON DREAMERS'b''b' The principles also acknowledge that children should not be punished for their parents\xe2\x80\x99 acts, a central premise of the Dream Act, a bill to legalize some young immigrants brought here as children. It\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful that Republicans, too, now endorse giving young people \xe2\x80\x94 raised as Americans, but with sharply diminished hopes for advancement after high school \xe2\x80\x94 a full shot at a future.'b'But as we await an actual Republican bill, or bills, there remain serious pitfalls to watch out for:'b''b'WHAT ABOUT CITIZENSHIP?'b' Any legalization plan has to include the real possibility of immigrants\xe2\x80\x99 becoming Americans. The principles rule out a \xe2\x80\x9cspecial\xe2\x80\x9d path to citizenship but do not reject outright the possibility of eventual naturalization for the 11 million. The details matter, and we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen them yet. Republicans need to remember: Maybe some European or Asian societies are happy to rely on imported laborers with no right to vote, no representation or hope of equality, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the American way, and must never be.'b''b'NEW ENFORCEMENT AND TOO FEW VISAS'b' The Republicans are demanding \xe2\x80\x9csignificant fines\xe2\x80\x9d and other punishments for the undocumented, and the meeting of enforcement benchmarks as a condition for legalization, along with mandatory national expansion of the E-Verify hiring database and a new entry-exit visa system. New layers of enforcement, onerous to the point of spiteful, cannot be allowed to prevent immigrants from leaving the shadows. Increased powers for states and localities to enforce immigration laws \xe2\x80\x94 an invitation to racial profiling and other abuses \xe2\x80\x94 have no place in any bill. And reforms to legal immigration \xe2\x80\x94 with visas for farmworkers, high-skilled workers and others \xe2\x80\x94 must be expansive enough to ease crushing backlogs that discourage millions overseas.'b''b'THE DEPORTER IN CHIEF'b''b' 'b'As we wait for a bill, which could come in months or years or never, deportations continue. The Obama administration has expelled nearly two million people, breaking up thousands of the families President Obama has repeatedly promised to protect. If Congress fails, will he protect them through his own administrative action, as he already has by deferring deportations for a relative handful of unauthorized youths?'b''b'THE TEMPTATION TO DESPAIR'b''b' 'b'We are a long way from the hopeful days when John McCain and Edward Kennedy embarked on big bipartisan Senate legislation that was eventually killed by a Republican filibuster. Reform has died several deaths since then, and millions have suffered. Now Republicans, the party of self-deportation and Arizona-style laws, may be edging closer to saying yes to legal status for millions of the undocumented. Who knows if they\xe2\x80\x99re serious, or if any bills will get past the party\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chell no\xe2\x80\x9d caucus. It will be clear soon enough whether this is the first step back toward the rational, humane reform that should have passed years ago.'b'Mayor Bill de Blasio closed a divisive chapter in New York City history Thursday when 'b'he announced'b' that his administration had reached an agreement with the civil rights lawyers who challenged the Police Department\xe2\x80\x99s abusive and racially discriminatory stop-and-frisk program in federal court.'b'The agreement clears the way for the Police Department to carry out reforms ordered last summer by Judge Shira Scheindlin of Federal District Court in Manhattan, and thus to repair its damaged relationship with minority communities. The judge ruled that the department\xe2\x80\x99s stop-and- frisk tactics violated the constitutional rights of minority citizens and said that city officials under the former mayor, Michael Bloomberg, had been \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately indifferent\xe2\x80\x9d to these illegalities.'b'In response, the city argued that minority residents were stopped more frequently because they committed more crimes. But evidence at trial showed that those being stopped were overwhelmingly innocent, that blacks and Hispanics were stopped in disproportionate numbers and that officers were more likely to use force against minority citizens. Mr. Bloomberg appealed the decision. Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s criticism of the policy, and his promise to drop the appeal, helped propel him into office.'b'The setting for the announcement from Mr. de Blasio, Police Commissioner William Bratton and the city\xe2\x80\x99s top lawyer, Zachary Carter \xe2\x80\x94 a community recreation center in the mainly minority Brownsville section of Brooklyn \xe2\x80\x94 powerfully reinforced their message. Brownsville was ground zero for the stop-and-frisk program at its height. A Times 'b'analysis in 2010'b' found that the police had logged nearly 52,000 stops within eight or so blocks over a four-year period. This meant that young people in the area were growing up in the equivalent of a police state where they could be detained on the sidewalk at any time for no reason at all. The fear and distrust that flowed from this undermined confidence in the Police Department, making it all the more difficult for officers to do their jobs.'b'Mr. Bratton, who has made good community relations a cornerstone of his career, acknowledged as much in his remarks. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will not break the law to enforce the law,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my solemn promise to every New Yorker, regardless of where they were born, where they live, or what they look like. Those values aren\xe2\x80\x99t at odds with keeping New Yorkers safe \xe2\x80\x94 they are essential to long-term public safety.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. de Blasio spoke movingly of the toll that the program has taken on the social fabric and on minority youth, many of them deeply alienated by tactics that have presumed them criminal until proved otherwise.'b'The city can now set about taking the corrective steps that Judge Scheindlin ordered. She has selected Peter Zimroth, a respected lawyer and former prosecutor, to serve as a monitor. His responsibilities will include developing new reforms governing Police Department policies and training and discipline on stop-and-frisk. These measures should help to bring police policies fully in line with the Constitution.'b'The National Football League prohibits the use of marijuana as part of its broader, longstanding program to prevent substance abuse. It also imposes stiff penalties on players caught breaking the rules.'b'In the lead-up to the Super Bowl, in which it so happens both teams hail from states that recently legalized marijuana for recreational purposes, pressure is mounting on the league to reconsider its ban. A group called the Marijuana Policy Project has even bought space on five billboards in New Jersey, where the game will take place on Sunday, asking why the league disallows a substance that, the group says, is less harmful than alcohol.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a fair question. Marijuana isn\xe2\x80\x99t a performance-enhancing drug, for starters, and more than 20 states have legalized it for medical purposes. The league would merely be catching up to contemporary practice by creating a medical exception.'b'At a news conference on Jan. 7, the league commissioner, Roger Goodell, did not rule out a change in policy. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s going to develop as far as the next opportunity for medicine to evolve and to help either deal with pain or help deal with injuries,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'he said'b', \xe2\x80\x9cbut we will continue to support the evolution of medicine.\xe2\x80\x9d On Jan. 23, he 'b'said'b' the league would \xe2\x80\x9cfollow medicine and if they determine this could be a proper usage in any context, we will consider that.\xe2\x80\x9d There is, in fact, a body of evidence indicating a \xe2\x80\x9cproper usage\xe2\x80\x9d: one of particular relevance to a hard-hitting, injury-riddled sport.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCannabinoids,\xe2\x80\x9d the Institute of Medicine 'b'reported in 1999'b', \xe2\x80\x9ccan have a substantial analgesic effect.\xe2\x80\x9d N.F.L. medical experts obviously aren\xe2\x80\x99t convinced, but N.F.L. players seem to be. HBO\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cReal Sports With Bryant Gumbel\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'estimated in January'b' that 50 to 60 percent of players smoked marijuana, many to manage pain.'b'Players, of course, have access to other painkillers, including prescription drugs. Yet as former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders 'b'has argued'b', \xe2\x80\x9cmarijuana is less toxic than many of the drugs that physicians prescribe every day.\xe2\x80\x9d As public opinion and state laws move away from strict prohibition, it\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable for the N.F.L. to do the same and let its players deal with their injuries as they \xe2\x80\x94 and their private doctors \xe2\x80\x94 see fit.'
