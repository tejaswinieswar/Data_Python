b'NEW Year\xe2\x80\x99s resolutions often have to do with eating more healthfully, going to the gym more, giving up sweets, losing weight \xe2\x80\x94 all admirable goals aimed at improving one\xe2\x80\x99s physical health. Most people, though, do not realize that they can strengthen their brains in a similar way.'b'While some areas of the brain are hard-wired from birth or early childhood, other areas \xe2\x80\x94 especially in the cerebral cortex, which is central to higher cognitive powers like language and thought, as well as sensory and motor functions \xe2\x80\x94 can be, to a remarkable extent, rewired as we grow older. In fact, the brain has an astonishing ability to rebound from damage \xe2\x80\x94 even from something as devastating as the loss of sight or hearing. As a physician who treats patients with neurological conditions, I see this happen all the time.'b'For example, one patient of mine  who had been deafened by scarlet fever at the age of 9, was so adept at lip-reading that it was easy to forget she was deaf. Once, without thinking, I turned away from her as I was speaking. \xe2\x80\x9cI can no longer hear you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said sharply.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean you can no longer see me,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou may call it seeing,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I experience it as hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Lip-reading, seeing mouth movements, was immediately transformed for this patient into \xe2\x80\x9chearing\xe2\x80\x9d the sounds of speech in her mind. Her brain was converting one mode of sensation into another.'b'In a similar way, blind people often find ways of \xe2\x80\x9cseeing.\xe2\x80\x9d Some areas of the brain, if not stimulated, will atrophy and die. (\xe2\x80\x9cUse it or lose it,\xe2\x80\x9d neurologists often say.) But the visual areas of the brain, even in someone born blind, do not entirely disappear; instead, they are redeployed for other senses. We have all heard of blind people with unusually acute hearing, but other senses may be heightened, too.'b'For example, Geerat Vermeij, a biologist at the University of California-Davis who has been blind since the age of 3, has identified many new species of mollusks based on tiny variations in the contours of their shells. He uses a sort of spatial or tactile giftedness that is beyond what any sighted person is likely to have.'b'The writer Ved Mehta, also blind since early childhood,  navigates in large part by using \xe2\x80\x9cfacial vision\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the ability to sense objects by the way they reflect sounds, or subtly shift the air currents that reach his face.   'b'Ben Underwood'b', a remarkable boy who lost his sight at 3 and died at 16 in 2009, developed an effective, dolphin-like strategy of emitting regular clicks with his mouth and reading the resulting echoes from nearby objects. He was so skilled at this that he could ride a bike and play sports and even video games.'b'People like Ben Underwood and Ved Mehta, who had some early visual experience but then lost their sight, seem to instantly convert the information they receive from touch or sound into a visual image \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cseeing\xe2\x80\x9d the dots, for instance, as they read Braille with a finger. Researchers using functional brain imagery have confirmed that in such situations the blind person activates not only the parts of the cortex devoted to touch, but parts of the visual cortex as well.'b'One does not have to be blind or deaf to tap into the brain\xe2\x80\x99s mysterious and extraordinary power to learn, adapt and grow. I have seen hundreds of patients with various deficits \xe2\x80\x94 strokes, Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s and even dementia \xe2\x80\x94 learn to do things in new ways, whether consciously or unconsciously, to work around those deficits.'b'That the brain is capable of such radical adaptation raises deep questions. To what extent are we shaped by, and to what degree do we shape, our own brains? And can the brain\xe2\x80\x99s ability to change be harnessed to give us greater cognitive powers? The experiences of many people suggest that it can.'b'One patient I knew became totally paralyzed overnight from a spinal cord infection. At first she fell into deep despair, because she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy even little pleasures, like the daily crossword she had loved.'b'After a few weeks, though, she asked for the newspaper, so that at least she could look at the puzzle, get its configuration, run her eyes along the clues. When she did this, something extraordinary happened. As she looked at the clues, the answers seemed to write themselves in their spaces. Her visual memory strengthened over the next few weeks, until she found that she was able to hold the entire crossword and its clues in her mind after a single, intense inspection \xe2\x80\x94 and then solve it mentally. She had had no idea, she later told me, that such powers were available to her.'b'This growth can even happen within a matter of days. Researchers at Harvard found, for example, that blindfolding sighted adults for as few as five days could produce a shift in the way their brains functioned: their subjects became markedly better at complex tactile tasks like learning Braille.'b'Neuroplasticity \xe2\x80\x94 the brain\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to create new pathways \xe2\x80\x94 is a crucial part of recovery for anyone who loses a sense or a cognitive or motor ability. But it can also be part of everyday life for all of us. While it is often true that learning is easier in childhood, neuroscientists now know that the brain does not stop growing, even in our later years. Every time we practice an old skill or learn a new one, existing neural connections are strengthened and, over time, neurons create more connections to other neurons. Even new nerve cells can be generated.'b'I have had many reports from ordinary people who take up a new sport or a musical instrument in their 50s or 60s, and not only become quite proficient, but derive great joy from doing so. Eliza Bussey, a journalist in her mid-50s who now studies harp at the Peabody conservatory in Baltimore, could not read a note of music a few years ago. In a letter to me, she wrote about what it was like learning to play Handel\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPassacaille\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cI have felt, for example, my brain and fingers trying to connect, to form new synapses. ... I know that my brain has dramatically changed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ms. Bussey is no doubt right: her brain has changed.'b'Music is an especially powerful shaping force, for listening to and especially playing it engages many different areas of the brain, all of which must work in tandem: from reading musical notation and coordinating fine muscle movements in the hands, to evaluating and expressing rhythm and pitch, to associating music with memories and emotion.'b'Whether it is by learning a new language, traveling to a new place, developing a passion for beekeeping or simply thinking about an old problem in a new way, all of us can find ways to stimulate our brains to grow, in the coming year and those to follow. Just as physical activity is essential to maintaining a healthy body, challenging one\xe2\x80\x99s brain, keeping it active, engaged, flexible and playful, is not only fun. It is essential to cognitive fitness.'b'To the Editor:'b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Tax-Cap Illusion'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Dec. 22) did not make a convincing case as to why Governor-elect Andrew M.

Property taxes are rising at more than twice the rate of inflation. Meanwhile, New York\xe2\x80\x99s population is decreasing, resulting in fewer people left to share this growing burden.'b'I agree with you on some key points \xe2\x80\x94 the state must find ways to reduce the unfunded mandates it puts upon schools, counties and municipalities; to bring its personnel costs under control; and to facilitate school district consolidations when appropriate.'b'Just count me among those who are skeptical that our State Legislature will willingly take on any of these complicated and unpopular issues without some brute force being applied.

The high property taxes in New York are a prime reason that over 1 million residents fled the state in the past decade (even as mostly less prosperous newcomers led to a small population increase). The proposed cap would limit how much localities and school districts may spend without receiving voter consent.'b'Contrary to your assertion, the cap in Massachusetts has worked well for 30 years and has forced government to live within the means of the citizens.

Laws rigged in favor of public unions by Albany are the real culprit, as well as unaffordable pensions and retiree health care promises.'b'The sad truth is that New York has driven away private-sector jobs with decades of antibusiness policies.

Vital reforms, like local mandate relief, public employee pension reform and government consolidation, will never happen without the discipline of a property tax cap to control the revenue side of the equation.'b'Mr. Cuomo has proposed a comprehensive package of fiscal reforms to reduce the cost of state and local government and revitalize New York\xe2\x80\x99s economy. The property tax cap is the centerpiece of that package.'b'And while some may call it a blunt instrument, it is precisely the instrument required to break Albany\xe2\x80\x99s logjam on fiscal reforms.'b'Kenneth Adams'b'\nPresident and C.E.O.'b'\nThe Business Council of New York State'b'\nAlbany, Dec. 22, 2010'b''b''b''b'Even after the herculean effort required to win Senate ratification of the New Start treaty, President Obama has no time to rest. The treaty, which mandates modest cuts in long-range nuclear weapons, is on its way to approval by the Duma, the lower house of Parliament in Russia. Once that happens, Washington and Moscow should quickly begin discussing other, more far-reaching agreements.'b'Two decades after the end of the cold war, the United States and Russia still have many thousands of nuclear weapons. The two countries cannot credibly argue for restraining the nuclear ambitions of Iran, North Korea and other wannabes unless they keep working to bring their own numbers down.'b'One of their most urgent tasks is slashing \xe2\x80\x94  or better, doing away with \xe2\x80\x94  their tactical nuclear weapons. These smaller arms, with a 300- to 400-mile range, have no military utility or deterrent value. They also have never been the subject of a treaty, or of any verification. That is what makes them so particularly frightening.'b'The United States has about 500 tactical nukes, including 180 in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey. These weapons are considered secure. But Russia\xe2\x80\x99s arsenal is much larger \xe2\x80\x94 between 3,000 and 5,000 \xe2\x80\x94 and, likely, vulnerable to covert sale or theft.'b'President Obama is already committed to negotiating cuts in tactical nukes. And he may have some new allies: Republicans who pushed through a side resolution to the New Start treaty requiring negotiations on tactical weapons within a year. If they meant what they said \xe2\x80\x94 and weren\xe2\x80\x99t just trying to kill New Start \xe2\x80\x94 they need to support the president in any negotiations and commit to swift ratification of a treaty.'b'Whether Russia would give up its \xe2\x80\x9cadvantage\xe2\x80\x9d in tactical weapons is hard to gauge. Moscow had said it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t negotiate until Washington removed all of its tactical weapons from Europe. More recently, Russian officials appear more open to discussions.'b'The two sides cannot stop there. They also need to reduce their number of stored warheads \xe2\x80\x94 their \xe2\x80\x9chedge.\xe2\x80\x9d Russia and the United States are each estimated to have around 2,000 stored weapons. Some spares are needed as replacements in case of catastrophic failure in deployed warheads or cheating by the other side, but these huge reserves are far more than necessary.'b'Russia will want to include missile defenses in any negotiations. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be a deal breaker. The administration has already made important progress by persuading Moscow to cooperate with NATO in jointly developing a system intended to intercept short-  and medium-range missiles.'b'We also strongly urge President Obama to press Congress to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996. It is nearly impossible for countries to build weapons without testing, so the treaty is a powerful tool for curbing proliferation. But it cannot come into force without ratification by the United States and a handful of other countries.'b'Senate Republicans blocked ratification in 1999. But there are few agreements more in this country\xe2\x80\x99s favor. The United States tested its weapons more than 1,000 times before adopting a voluntary moratorium nearly 18 years ago. President Obama has already promised a huge infusion of new money \xe2\x80\x94 $85 billion over 10 years \xe2\x80\x94 to ensure the nuclear weapons complex remains safe and up to date without testing.'b'President George W.

Either way, states should make sure people have a legitimate shot at success.'b'A G.E.D. program developed by New York City\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Education may help show New York State \xe2\x80\x94 and other states with poor test results \xe2\x80\x94 the way forward. The program  uses innovative instructional techniques to make sure students are fully prepared. Over the last several years, the program has a pass rate of about 78 percent, more than 20 percentage points higher than the statewide rate.'b'The city\xe2\x80\x99s program has so impressed the American Council on Education, the nonprofit group that owns the G.E.D., that it will soon begin a pilot program in District 79, which deals with alternative schools and programs. Underwritten by a $3 million grant from the MetLife Foundation, this pilot program is intended to develop a model for educating more adults more quickly so they can pass the G.E.D. and move on with their careers.'b'These improvements are timely because the G.E.D. test itself is about to get tougher. The new test, to be developed over the next several years, is being revised to conform to more rigorous educational standards proposed earlier this year by the National Governors Association and state school superintendents.'b'These standards set forth ambitious new goals for what children should learn from kindergarten through high school and have already been embraced by most states. Among other things, they would require students to develop reasoning skills earlier in their educational experience and set higher, college-level standards in math, English and science.'b'For all these reasons, states \xe2\x80\x94 including New York \xe2\x80\x94 will need to invest much more heavily in programs that prepare people for the G.E.D. At stake is their economic future \xe2\x80\x94 and the country\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'2011. Perhaps you can remember when the thought of a brand new year \xe2\x80\x94 even the very numeral \xe2\x80\x94 was exciting. Somehow, it is harder to place the moment when the excitement of a new year turned to wariness and then to alarm and then to futile questions about the nature of time. Are we tunneling forward into the future, or is time blowing past us like a stiff breeze? Perhaps we simply carry time within us. To be conscious at all is to be conscious of time.'b'By now, of course, 2010 feels like a completely familiar, totally used-up year. But why does 2011 still sound like an annum out of science fiction? It\xe2\x80\x99s not as though 2011 is a remoter outpost in the hinterland of the future than, say, 1971 was. Yet here we are in the second decade of the 21st century, living in the very future we tried to imagine when we were young so many years ago. Surely we must have colonies throughout the solar system by now. Surely hunger is no more, and peace is planet-wide.'b'The coming of the new year reminds us, again, that we live, as we always have, somewhere on a sliding scale between utopia and dystopia and that we continuously   carry our burdens and opportunities with us. 2011 is merely a new entry in our ancient custom of chronological bookkeeping, an arbitrary starting point for our annual trip around the sun.'b'But it is also so much more. Who can live without fresh intentions, new purposes? Who does not welcome a chance to start over, if only on a new page of the calendar? Life goes on, but it goes on so much better with hope and renewal and recommitment.'b'Last night was a night for banishing regrets. Today is for wondering how to live without new ones, how to do right by ourselves and one another.'b'I got a call on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve from Gladys Scott, which was a terrific way for 2010 to end.'b'As insane as it may seem, Gladys and her sister, Jamie, are each serving consecutive life sentences in a state prison in Mississippi for their alleged role in a robbery in 1993 in which no one was hurt and $11 supposedly was taken.'b'Gladys was on the phone, excited and relieved, because Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi had agreed to suspend the prison terms.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve waited so long for this day to come,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'I was happy for the Scott sisters and deeply moved as Gladys spoke of how desperately she wanted to \xe2\x80\x9cjust hold\xe2\x80\x9d her two children and her mother, who live in Florida. But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking that right up until the present moment she and Jamie have been treated coldly and disrespectfully by the governor and other state officials. It\xe2\x80\x99s as if the authorities have found it impossible to hide their disdain, their contempt, for the two women.'b'The prison terms were suspended  \xe2\x80\x94  not commuted  \xe2\x80\x94  on the condition that Gladys donate a kidney to Jamie, who is seriously ill with diabetes and high blood pressure and receives dialysis at least three times a week. Gladys had long expressed a desire to donate a kidney to her sister, but to make that a condition of her release was unnecessary, mean-spirited, inhumane and potentially coercive. It was a low thing to do.'b'Governor Barbour did not offer any expression of concern for Jamie\xe2\x80\x99s health in his statement announcing the sentence suspension.'b'He said of the sisters: \xe2\x80\x9cTheir incarceration is no longer necessary for public safety or rehabilitation, and Jamie Scott\xe2\x80\x99s medical condition creates a substantial cost to the state of Mississippi.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'By all means, get those medical costs off the books if you can.'b'I asked Gladys how she had learned that she was to be released. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I saw it while I was looking at the news on television,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'The authorities hadn\xe2\x80\x99t bothered to even tell the sisters. After all, who are they? As Gladys put it, \xe2\x80\x9cNobody told me a thing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I asked if she had seen Jamie, who is in another section of the prison, since the governor\xe2\x80\x99s decision had been announced. She said no one had tried to get the two of them together for even a telephone conversation.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen her or heard from her,\xe2\x80\x9d Gladys said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to see her. I want to see how she\xe2\x80\x99s doing and take care of her.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I am not surprised at Governor Barbour\xe2\x80\x99s behavior. He\xe2\x80\x99s not the first person who comes to mind when I think of admirable public officials. The Clarion-Ledger of Jackson, Miss., noted that the governor had been on the radio this week asserting that there was hardly anyone in prison who didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve to be there. It\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting comment from a governor who has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to free prisoners convicted of the most heinous crimes.'b'The Jackson Free Press, an alternative weekly, and Slate magazine have noted that Mr. Barbour has pardoned four killers and suspended the life sentence of a fifth. So cold-blooded murder is no reason, in Mr. Barbour\xe2\x80\x99s view, to keep the prison doors closed.'b'This is also a governor who said recently, while reminiscing about the civil rights struggle and the treatment of blacks in his hometown of Yazoo City, Miss., in the 1960s: \xe2\x80\x9cI just don\xe2\x80\x99t remember it being that bad.\xe2\x80\x9d The comment was in an article in The Weekly Standard in which the governor managed to find some complimentary things to say about the rabidly racist White Citizens Councils.'b'Faced with heavy and widespread criticism, he later pulled back on the comments, describing the era as \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult and painful\xe2\x80\x9d and the councils as \xe2\x80\x9cindefensible.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The only reason the Scott sisters have gotten any relief at all is because of an extraordinary network of supporters who campaigned relentlessly over several years on their behalf. Ben Jealous, the president of the N.A.A.C.P., emerged as one of the leaders of the network. The concerted effort finally paid off.'b'Gladys Scott said her 16 years in prison have been extremely difficult and that she had gotten depressed from time to time but had not given up hope. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a very bad experience, \xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'What is likely to get lost in the story of the Scott sisters finally being freed is just how hideous and how outlandish their experience really was. How can it be possible for individuals with no prior criminal record to be sentenced to two consecutive life terms for a crime in which no one was hurt and $11 was taken? Who had it in for them, and why was that allowed to happen?'b'The Scott sisters may go free, but they will never receive justice.'b'P\xc3\xa9tionville, Haiti'b'Jan. 12, 2010, 4:53 p.m., a high-magnitude telluric wave 'b'twisted the ground under our feet'b'. In just  35 seconds about 300,000 people lost their lives and more than one million souls in three cities became homeless. How eerie the huge cloud of dust rising in the dying day over Port-au-Prince, and spreading up to this suburb of the capital. How unreal the sound of car alarms blasting under the building debris.'b'I believe that in all bad things there is some good \xe2\x80\x94 if we take a moment to look, if we don\xe2\x80\x99t miss the essential. Often I ask myself, was there any good in that earthquake? And then I remember the first minutes, the few hours, the two days right after the shock. Before foreign aid workers arrived loaded with survival kits and good will. Before greed turned misery into business opportunities.'b'In that moment, our country was on her knees; we were on our knees. It felt as if we had lost a mother. And when we looked one another in the eyes, we all felt the  same thing \xe2\x80\x94 we were struck by the same calamity. We were a people lost in a tremor but united by a common fate.'b'For the first two or three days after the earthquake, we relied on one another to save the lives that could be saved, however few there were. With bare hands, survivors pulled the wounded from concrete and iron, then drove them to hospitals, or pushed them there in carts, or carried them on their backs. We shared our food and water. Money, for once, was not important, nor were last names or skin color. For a brief and enlightening moment in our lives we experienced the true meaning of brotherhood.'b'I want to keep forever in my mind those nights when we slept in yards and empty lots, on sidewalks or in the middle of streets. It was possible to sleep in the open without fear, for we understood for the first time that the walls and gates we used to hide behind meant nothing \xe2\x80\x94 they lay everywhere like crumpled paper. Those nights, the stars were very beautiful; they told us to go on living.'b'And although this year has been a litany of hardships, although we have known the wrath of storms, the terrors of the cholera epidemic, the frustration of being locked in an incredible political stalemate since the presidential election, I think we should remember the lessons of the earthquake. Only in fellowship can we rescue Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s dream from destruction.'b''b'\xe2\x80\x94 KETTLY MARS,  novelist whose short story has appeared in the collection \xe2\x80\x9cHaiti Noir\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Vancouver, British Columbia'b'When people ask me, an American expat, what it\xe2\x80\x99s like living in Canada, I tell them,  \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s kind of like living in the States, if the States were on lithium.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is the price of living in the land of \xe2\x80\x9cPeace, Order and Good Government.\xe2\x80\x9d With the notable exceptions of Arcade Fire fans and the Alberta tar sands developers, there\xe2\x80\x99s just not a lot of mania to be found north of the border. But for a few weeks last February, all that changed: Vancouver hosted the Winter Olympics, and Canada went off its meds.'b'From that heartbreaking opening bell sounded by 'b'the Republic of Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s Nodar Kumaritashvili'b'  when he collided with an unpadded stanchion to become the first Olympic luge fatality in nearly 50 years,  to 'b'Sidney Crosby\xe2\x80\x99s epic tiebreaker'b' in the men\xe2\x80\x99s hockey final, Canadians rode out the lows along with the highs. For two weirdly warm and sunny weeks in the middle of what was supposed to be winter, even the doomsayers \xe2\x80\x94 who saw the Games as a commercial boondoggle \xe2\x80\x94 were swayed by the excitement.'b'Gone was the usual gaze-averting reserve, and in its place was an ecstatic, high-fiving street party the likes of which Vancouver had never seen. The roar of the crowds cheering a Canadian goal against the United States was audible even through the walls of a house sealed for winter. For a brief moment, Canada embraced its inner patriot, and it felt pretty good.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCanada isn\xe2\x80\x99t one of those countries that wears its flag all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d one of my friends said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut when I rode the SkyTrain, every single person was wearing red and white.\xe2\x80\x9d Another described it as a \xe2\x80\x9cgradual building of red energy,\xe2\x80\x9d adding,  \xe2\x80\x9cWherever you went, suddenly people were talking to you, laughing, joyful.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Vancouver\xe2\x80\x99s Olympic high took other forms as well: the lineup for free bong hits outside Marc Emery\xe2\x80\x99s Cannabis Culture Headquarters was relentless,  and there were some unfortunate run-ins with the billion-dollar security apparatus. During the torch relay, one free-spirited Canadian reached toward the Olympic Torch and tried  to light ... what? A cigarette, a firecracker, his finger? only to find himself wrestled to the ground by the police.'b'By March, Vancouver had come back down to earth as well and, by June, our red wave  had been replaced by a \xe2\x80\x9cyellow zone\xe2\x80\x9d on the other side of the country \xe2\x80\x94  the security perimeter around the Group of 20 meeting  in Toronto.  Canada was back to its old self again \xe2\x80\x94 reserved, responsible, safe.'b'But deep in Vancouver\xe2\x80\x99s heart, the memory of that manic red reprieve will be treasured for a long time.'b''b' \xe2\x80\x94 JOHN VAILLANT,'b''b' author of  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Tiger: A True Story of Vengeance and Survival\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'I remember March 26 vividly. I was watching the news as I do each night when the words \xe2\x80\x9cCheonan Sunk\xe2\x80\x9d appeared on the screen.'b'The South Korean warship had been patrolling around Baengnyeong Island, near the maritime border with North Korea, when it went down,'b' sinking deep into the Yellow Sea'b'  with 46 sailors trapped inside. Wanting to know if there were any survivors, if anyone could be rescued, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring myself to turn off the TV.'b'I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only one transfixed. The owner of the neighborhood bookstore closed his shop. My friend canceled her vacation to India.  We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop thinking of those sailors, waiting at the bottom of the sea. But the tides and rough winds worked against the rescue operations. As the clock ticked, the weather worsened.'b'In the end, not one of the 46 was saved. And we lost a 47th: a man who became unconscious underwater while trying to rescue the others.  How can we hope to understand the anger and despair that their families must have gone through? Watching, I felt my powerlessness acutely.'b'Twenty days after it sank, the ship was pulled to the surface, revealing its tattered stern.   After it was drained of water, most of the sailors were returned too, as corpses.  That night I went to a mostly empty restaurant, ordered dinner and watched the news. While the screen displayed the photographs of the dead, their hometowns and ages, I heard the sound of quiet sobbing. It was the cook. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can God be so indifferent?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.'b'For South Korea, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Cheonan Incident\xe2\x80\x9d is far from over. There has been a spate of accusations about the cause of the ship\xe2\x80\x99s sinking (an international inquiry found a North Korean torpedo responsible), then a flaring of hostilities between North and South. Within South Korea, politicians have theories; the ruling party blames the opposition; the opposition blames the ruling party.'b'As for me, I am haunted by the faces of the six who were never found.  I imagine their bodies tossed in the current, in the stillness of that cold dark sea. Even at this moment, they are probably being knocked against rocks, fed on by fish, their bodies worn away by rough waves. Or maybe they\xe2\x80\x99ve come to some kind of rest by an uninhabited island, caught in a tangle of water plants.'b'One of the sailors had a month to go before his discharge. One was about to be married.  I am reduced to silence by how youthful they look in the photographs, how full of health and beautiful. They still have not returned.'b''b' \xe2\x80\x94 SHIN KYUNG-SOOK, author of the forthcoming novel \xe2\x80\x9cPlease Look After Mom.\xe2\x80\x9d This article was translated by Jae Won Chung from the Korean. 'b''b'London'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a salutary measure of smug, fat democracies that the substance and ire of elections are forgotten almost before the crumpled campaign literature has been recycled into budget toilet paper. It now seems fairly embarrassing that we in the British press spent so much furrowed-brow time on the broadcast of the first-ever American-style head-to-head debate by party leaders on April 15. Should they sit, or should they stand? What color would the background be? Could they talk to one another? Can you rebut rebutted rebuttal? Would there be a live audience, as well as the comatose one at home? It was like getting a m\xc3\xa9nage \xc3\xa0 trois of pandas to mate.'b'The aggregated wisdom of the news media and the polls was that the debates came out as neutral for the Conservative candidate, David Cameron; as a predictable and confirming disaster for the Labour prime minister, Gordon Brown; and a surprise victory for the priggishly keen new boy, the Liberal Democrat Nick Clegg. After the event, all the backroom party planners and panjandrums were privately infuriated: the debates had overshadowed and laid waste their expensive and minutely coordinated election strategies. The synchronized unfolding of policies was plowed under by the blunt and simplistic debates, which themselves were reduced to sound bites and \xe2\x80\x9cX Factor\xe2\x80\x9d polls.'b'The American nature of the event made the entire election even more presidential-manqu\xc3\xa9, negating each party\xe2\x80\x99s platform, reducing members of Parliament to cheerleading the leader. The broadcast added momentum to a personality-driven style of government that had been started by Mr. Brown\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor, Tony Blair. This may be the last time that a man like Mr. Brown \xe2\x80\x94 plain and puffy, with bitten fingernails and a sincere glass eye \xe2\x80\x94 can realistically run for prime minister.'b'In the end, the debates swung enough votes to the Liberal Democrats to parlay them into a role as junior partner in a new government, their best result since the days of detachable collars. But if you trust your fortune to TV, then you must accept TV\xe2\x80\x99s plotting, and any soap aficionado could have warned Mr. Clegg to be careful what he wished for. He has now been cast as the lightning rod and flak-catcher for all the sturm und drang over the Tories\xe2\x80\x99 economic cuts and hard truths. Behind this human shield, David Cameron looks surprisingly statesmanlike and unruffled.'b'The Labour Party learned its lesson, and chose a new, younger, fresher, pinker liberal leader (Ed Miliband) who so far has been a spectacularly bad piece of casting, an insignificant disaster. Privately, party mandarins are already writing off the next election. But before then, we have a TV royal wedding. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope that turns out better than the first televised one.'b'\xe2\x80\x94 'b'A. A. GILL, contributing editor at Vanity Fair and author of the forthcoming \xe2\x80\x9cA. A.

We, the young generation in Israel, suffer from an obsession with the present, a worship of the here and now, and a lack of faith in our power to bring about change.'b'Dreading what we sense our future holds, we bask in our own individualism and try to block the torment that is all round us. We do not protest. We do not take to the streets. That is our sin. Someone watching from afar cannot realize what it takes to live as we do, cherishing liberal democracy, while in the countries around us women are being stoned to death for adultery and men are hanged in the squares for insobriety and homosexuality. In the face of this, we are losing our will to fight for our liberal values.'b'My friends, members of what was once the \xe2\x80\x9cpeace camp,\xe2\x80\x9d feel trapped: between the cruelty of collective punishment in Gaza and Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s fundamentalist zeal, its willingness to execute Palestinians, to crushingly repress dissent, and to send rockets into Israeli towns and cities.'b'Many Israeli writers petition for peace and rail against the occupation. I have added my voice to that choir, particularly in May during the government\xe2\x80\x99s lethally inept handling of the Turkish flotilla that tried to break the embargo on Gaza. Yet, as I look back at 2010 and the flotilla, I deeply believe that the greatest peril is from a ruthless and implacable foe: religious fanaticism. And the people on the ship that the Israeli naval commandos boarded, the Mavi Marmara, with their motive and capacity to manipulate world opinion, were acting cynically on its behalf. The death of nine people on the Mavi Marmara was a calamity. But activists on board stabbed and shot the soldiers who sought to steer the ship to a port from which nonmilitary cargo could be trucked to Gaza.'b'It is simple for an author to declare: \xe2\x80\x9cPeace. Peace now!\xe2\x80\x9d But it is a hollow demand. Instead I say that  all progressive, humane and fair-minded people are my brothers and sisters. All fundamentalists, Jews included, who seek to demolish liberalism are the enemies.

While the land was still a swamp, I went out to meet the people who had survived by crouching for days on its terrace.'b'Most of their mud houses had crumbled; those still standing had been destroyed from within. But the villagers were hopeful: I had brought food in a truck, and they had heard that the military was sending tents. As the water receded, they would return to the fields and start sowing winter crops.'b'Proudly they led me to their mosque, a squat white thing with three turquoise doors and a stump of a minaret \xe2\x80\x94 it was built on a platform, which had kept it above the water. The villagers said it had been given to them some years ago by a follower of the Ahl-e-Hadith sect, the Pakistani affiliate of Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s prohibitive Wahhabi strand of Islam.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said an old man with bright eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are all Ahl-e-Hadith here.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It was a revelation.

And in Pakistan, where the descendants of many Sufi saints have used their lineage over the centuries like a slow magic to acquire land and political power, the Ahl-e-Hadith doctrine, with its insistence on a direct and abstract relationship between humanity and the divine, has begun to look like a long-denied cause.'b'I remembered my own little childhood fantasy for Islam, one that did away with priests and pedigrees and gave everyone his or her own right to God.

The water had receded and the surrounding fields were lush with crops.'b'Naseem Bibi, a diminutive mother of eight who was squatting on the edge of the village, said she was poorer now than ever. \xe2\x80\x9cThe next time a big man comes to ask for my vote,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will pelt him with stones.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Two young men tried to shut her up.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what the big man does!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cHe throws a little money at a poor man and buys him.

But she meant the men who looked after the mosque, the sons of the man who had donated it. They belonged to a mid-level caste, had inherited the small mustard fields around the village and worked as schoolteachers and crane operators in the town. They still claimed to be Ahl-e-Hadith. But in this anciently divided, ever-hierarchical land, these Ahl-e-Hadith, too, had been reduced to living as intermediaries. They had slightly bigger houses than the villagers, whose votes they collected for still-bigger intermediaries, negotiating in the meantime with callous notaries and bureaucrats for rationed food and money that, when it did arrive, was given only to their allies in the village, passing as it always has: from patron to client, man to man, hand to greased hand.'b''b' \xe2\x80\x94 ALI SETHI, author of the novel \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wish Maker\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Paris'b'In the M\xc3\xa9tro stations and the streets of Paris, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to sense the anxiety and irritation of passers-by when they encounter a Roma woman carrying a baby in her arms or holding a little girl by the hand and asking plaintively for a few coins. In August, however, the French government \xe2\x80\x94 attacked on all sides after the political and financial scandals of the summer \xe2\x80\x94 'b'decided to take cynical advantage'b' of this shameful sentiment: President Nicolas Sarkozy began to condemn criminals of \xe2\x80\x9cforeign origin\xe2\x80\x9d; hundreds of Roma encampments were violently razed; and more than 1,000 of the 20,000 Roma in France were deported.'b'While most cultural and ethnic minorities have become visible here, the Roma remain obscure; indeed, many of the French still confuse these Roma \xe2\x80\x94 who have been driven by poverty from their villages in Romania and Bulgaria since the 1990s \xe2\x80\x94 with gypsies. This means that the Roma have been endowed with the romantic aura of the performers in old traveling carnivals and of bohemians; from M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e to Hugo, gypsies have been emblematic of freedom and adventure and proud beauty. It also means that they have been saddled with the urban myths of gypsies as thieves, sellers of pots and pans, organized beggars with their children in rags but driving Mercedeses, stereotypes that the president of the republic himself has repeated.'b'These Roma have become second-class citizens of the European Union, able to travel freely within the union\xe2\x80\x99s borders but, because of the \xe2\x80\x9ctransitional\xe2\x80\x9d nature of their civil status, allowed to stay in other countries for only three months at a time. They are thus condemned to working off the books and to begging, building temporary shelters and living on vacant lots or in empty buildings that become little slums. They are constantly exposed to the threat of expulsion. And like Sisyphus, they are pushed back to their country of origin, simply to return, legally, to France \xe2\x80\x94 just as unwanted at home as they are here.'b'The French politicians who pushed for this free-market Europe have forgotten that if you want wealth and capital to cross borders, you have to accept the fact that the poverty of others becomes yours as well. Like the people in the subway who are irritated by the reminder of this truth, the French government and most of the neighboring states have made the Roma the perfect scapegoats for the failure of their imagination: a Europe that is white, rich and impenetrable, where the Roma are the pariahs.'b''b' \xe2\x80\x94 TRISTAN GARCIA, author of \xe2\x80\x9cHate: A Romance.\xe2\x80\x9d This article was translated by The Times from the French.'b''b'Mexico City'b'In my country we\xe2\x80\x99ve been learning under extreme duress to live in a different nation from the one we grew up in. Some 30,000 people have died in Mexico in the last four years in a grotesque carnival of shootouts, beheadings and mutilations; the city of Ju\xc3\xa1rez has emerged as a worldwide symbol of lawlessness and horror; tens of thousands of children have been left orphaned and permanently embittered against the state. But what happened in August and unfolded throughout September and the fall was something else.'b'In the northern state of Tamaulipas, on an abandoned ranch some 100 miles south of the American border, a young Ecuadorean man escaped from beneath a pile of bodies to tell his story. The previous day he had been on a bus with 73 other people traveling north to the United States, most from Central America, a few from Brazil and Ecuador. The bus was hijacked and driven to the abandoned ranch. There, the migrants \xe2\x80\x94 young men, for the most part, but quite a few young women as well \xe2\x80\x94 were tied up in groups of four and 'b'systematically murdered.'b' Only the young Ecuadorean and a Honduran man escaped.'b'The victims were reported to have been killed \xe2\x80\x94 on a whim? for practice? \xe2\x80\x94 by members of a particularly bloody group, the Zetas, which got its start as an enforcement gang for a powerful drug trafficker from Tamaulipas. Equipped with an alarming array of smuggled weapons and financed by illegal drug sales, it is now a nationwide organization. Its local franchises trade in drugs, but also in prostitution, pirated CDs and DVDs, gangland movies, child pornography and people-smuggling. As a result, migrants\xe2\x80\x99 passage through Mexico has become an odyssey of horror. The lucky ones are robbed of their last penny.

Rape is routine.'b'It was Richard Nixon who coined the term \xe2\x80\x9cwar on drugs\xe2\x80\x9d 40 years ago,  creating difficulties for policy makers ever since. As opposed to complex social problems, which must be understood and solved, wars must be fought and, if financing is to be renewed, battles must be won. But four decades later, we are still without a victory.'b'Even worse: where once only a handful of countries were involved in the cultivation and processing of cocaine, marijuana and heroin, now old and new drugs are manufactured on an industrial scale on almost every continent. Where once outlaws used their weapons sparingly and tried not to attract attention, now ferocious mafias are willing to defy the state and buy off the law-enforcement apparatus of an entire country. And where once traffickers mostly killed each other, we in Mexico now have to mourn the death of 72 migrants \xe2\x80\x94 and who knows how many thousands of similar victims \xe2\x80\x94 who were merely looking for hard work and a better life.'b''b' \xe2\x80\x94 ALMA GUILLERMOPRIETO, author, most recently, of \xe2\x80\x9cDancing With Cuba\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Santiago, Chile'b'In Chile we live too far away from everything, separated from the world by what our poet Pablo Neruda has called \xe2\x80\x9ca sundering geography.\xe2\x80\x9d He was alluding to the mighty Andes, of course, but also to the Pacific Ocean.

Minute by minute, on the radio or the TV, we followed the progress of the probes that were searching for them. At a camp set up near the entombed men, many prayed, wept, shouted out their pain.

And this is a country that, according to many outsiders, is about to boil over with fundamentalist, anti-Western rage, and here were documents that showed Riyadh in collusion with Washington.'b'But that\xe2\x80\x99s not what Saudi society is like at all, and the public and government reaction to the cables proves it.'b'The documents were certainly revealing. One reported on a 'b'Saudi proposal to invade Lebanon'b' and root out Hezbollah; another told of a 'b'party'b' where liquor was abundant and some guests were prostitutes.'b'But generally speaking, all Saudi politics is local \xe2\x80\x94 just as it is in the United States. Public debates focus on domestic concerns, not international issues; most Saudis have more to worry about than diplomatic scandals. As Mahmood Sabbagh, a popular newspaper columnist, told me, \xe2\x80\x9cPeople were more joking than concerned about them.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s more, Saudis and their government are generally in agreement on foreign policy: it was heartening for many Saudis to read cables exposing Riyadh\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to preventing Iranian nuclear proliferation.'b'True, the government was not happy, but it was more concerned about the leaks\xe2\x80\x99 impact on global diplomacy. Prince Turki al-Faisal, who had served as the director general of the Saudi intelligence agency and as the ambassador to the United Kingdom and the United States, called for Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, to be punished for harming countries\xe2\x80\x99 diplomatic integrity.'b'But that was about it. And instead of using its heavy hand to block access to sites carrying the cables, the government officially remained silent. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs commented only briefly, using the extremely tranquil language with which Saudi officials often react to negative international news: \xe2\x80\x9cWikiLeaks does not concern the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and, therefore, the government is not interested in commenting on it.\xe2\x80\x9d This was not the sound of a government worried about an upset public.'b'It was right. The government judged correctly that most Saudis would decide that the documents were old news: an echo of familiar rhetoric (the foxiness of American foreign policy) or established fact (the government\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear ambitions).'b'Moreover, according to Fouad al-Farhan, a social activist, Riyadh deftly recognized that many of the leaked documents weren\xe2\x80\x99t all that harmful to Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s image, and the rest did little actual harm.'b'Saudi society is not without its concerns and tensions. But in this case, the place that many assume to be a boiling pot, with its young population and conservative rules, received the WikiLeaks documents as a cooling liquid rather than fuel for the fire.'b''b'\xe2\x80\x94 MOHAMMED HASAN ALWAN, novelist. 'b''b' 'b''b'THE show was called \xe2\x80\x9cVia Galactica.\xe2\x80\x9d In 1972, as this science fiction musical was being prepared for its Broadway opening, some members of the creative team feared that no one would be able to say its name. And in any case, what did it mean? According to the show\xe2\x80\x99s publicity material it meant, \xe2\x80\x9croad to the stars.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Investors in the production knew \xe2\x80\x9cVia Galactica\xe2\x80\x9d was going to be the most expensive musical ever staged. To the Nederlander theater family, it was the show that would open their new flagship theater, the Uris (now called the Gershwin). But in my house, growing up, it meant many other things: Regret. Heartache. Disappointment. Failure. A very public failure. I was 12 when my parents\xe2\x80\x99 musical opened and closed. After a decade in the works, it lasted a fleeting seven performances.'b'I will never forget the opening night party at Sardi\xe2\x80\x99s. My father, the producer George W. George, was waiting for the reviews in a shadowy corner of the restaurant. Champagne was flowing, and spirits were high. We were in the dark ages of communication \xe2\x80\x94 pre-Internet, pre-blogs, pre-Twitter \xe2\x80\x94 and reviews dictated the fate of a show. At around 12:30, the first notices came in. The New York Times review would make or break you. And break us, it did.'b'I say \xe2\x80\x9cus,\xe2\x80\x9d even though I was a child, because from as early as I can remember, \xe2\x80\x9cVia Galactica\xe2\x80\x9d was in the air. It was part of my DNA. From the vantage of our den on Central Park West, where my mother, Judith Ross, co-wrote the book, or the living room, where my parents held readings of the script to attract investors, or the dining room, where they debated every aspect of the show, I watched them build the perfect beast. A spectacle like no one had ever seen.'b'It was going to be fantastic! Flying spaceships! Flying people! A stage made of interconnecting walkways and trampolines \xe2\x80\x94 with a backdrop of thousands of Ping-Pong balls strung together, floor to ceiling, upon which gorgeous images would be projected. The cast was multicolored \xe2\x80\x94 Raul Julia, the lead, was blue; Virginia Vestoff, his leading lady, was painted gold; and the other actors on stage were every color in between. Peter Hall, former head of the Royal Shakespeare Company, would make his American directorial debut. Galt McDermott, who composed the score for \xe2\x80\x9cHair,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote the music. My mother, a relative newcomer, wrote the book with Christopher Gore, who also wrote the lyrics. And as producer, my dad put all the pieces together.'b'But \xe2\x80\x9cVia Galactica\xe2\x80\x9d seemed plagued from the start. For a moment the show was to be called \xe2\x80\x9cUp,\xe2\x80\x9d but when posted next to the Uris name on the marquee, it sent an unfortunate message. Once again, the title became \xe2\x80\x9cVia Galactica.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In previews, both actors and scenery fell through the soft trampoline flooring. Irene Cara, the actress of future \xe2\x80\x9cFame\xe2\x80\x9d fame, flew around the stage \xe2\x80\x94 that is, when the rigging worked. Raul once got stuck in the spaceship and hung helplessly over the orchestra for 20 minutes until stagehands extricated him. The new wireless microphones, which allowed the actors to jump freely from trampoline to trampoline, somehow got cross-wired with the local police precinct. When Virginia opened her mouth to sing, out came emergency calls about car accidents and arrests in Midtown.'b'They say the devil is in the details. And the details were killing the show. A production that had seemed like a sure thing was careening out of control. It went over budget. There were delays, clashing egos, injuries. Everyone was asking, how could so many talented people get so many things so wrong?'b'The publicity poster for \xe2\x80\x9cVia Galactica\xe2\x80\x9d now hangs in infamy at the entrance to Joe Allen\xe2\x80\x99s, the restaurant on West 46th Street whose walls are lined with posters of famous Broadway flops.'b'Many years after the play closed, my father would still talk about things he would have done differently. \xe2\x80\x9cVia,\xe2\x80\x9d as he called it, would send him walking to the refrigerator late at night, reliving it in his mind. One thing that bothered him enormously was a song, perhaps his favorite, that was cut from the show in the final stages of production. It was called \xe2\x80\x9cHome,\xe2\x80\x9d and it was a sentimental ballad that cut to the core of the main character\xe2\x80\x99s plight.'b'In the show, Raul Julia played a man who falls in love with a rebel woman who\xe2\x80\x99s leaving earth for good. Finally he has to choose: stay in the place he knows, the home he loves, or go with her to the stars. In the race toward opening night, despite the talent and the spectacle, too many of the human elements of \xe2\x80\x9cVia Galactica\xe2\x80\x9d got stripped away, and the show fell flat. None of the special effects could make up for the lack of what draws us to the theater in the first place: story, characters we care for, pathos.'b'It took my father a long time to learn this lesson \xe2\x80\x94 and with a lifetime of experience he conceived the more down-to-earth musical \xe2\x80\x9cMemphis.\xe2\x80\x9d Sadly, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t live to see it win last year\xe2\x80\x99s Tony Award for best musical.'b'Last week I went to a preview performance of \xe2\x80\x9cSpider-Man: Turn Off the Dark.\xe2\x80\x9d Three hours and one mechanical glitch later, I left the theater feeling uneasy, my long-dormant \xe2\x80\x9cVia Galactica\xe2\x80\x9d synapses firing. I can well imagine the pressure the creators of \xe2\x80\x9cSpider-Man\xe2\x80\x9d have been under. Right before opening night, when you\xe2\x80\x99re running out of time, you can find yourself so close to the canvas that you can\xe2\x80\x99t see the big picture.'b'But I\xe2\x80\x99d like to urge them, take a moment, now if you can. Step back and look at what you have. Put the play\xe2\x80\x99s human moments front and center. There\xe2\x80\x99s still time.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m rooting for \xe2\x80\x9cSpider-Man.\xe2\x80\x9d May it become the brilliant show it deserves to be. And may everyone connected with it have an old age with no regrets, no posters in Joe Allen\xe2\x80\x99s and no late-night walks to the fridge.'b'When people say that the recovery does not feel like a recovery, they are describing reality. The economy is growing, but for many Americans life is not getting better. Unemployment remains high. Home values are depressed. And state budgets are in deep trouble, presaging more layoffs, service cuts and tax increases.'b'The question for 2011 is whether growth will ever translate into broad prosperity.'b'For that to happen, the federal government must ensure that the recovery does not falter for lack of adequate stimulus, while fostering job-creating industries and committing itself to long-term deficit reduction.'b'With corporate profits robust and a one-year payroll tax cut set to start this month, there are reasons to hope for continued growth in 2011. Yet, growth is not expected to be strong enough to make a real dent in unemployment, which at 9.8 percent remains close to the recession\xe2\x80\x99s peak of 10.2 percent in October 2009.'b'Rising corporate profits should spur hiring, but recent history is not encouraging. Part of the problem is that companies are more apt to spend their cash on  stock buy-backs and acquisitions that increase share prices  but not hiring. Many companies that are hiring are doing it in fast-growing markets like China and India.'b'The rift between recovery and prosperity is also painfully evident in housing. Prices are likely to fall another 5 percent in 2011, as unemployment-related defaults and the failure to adequately address the foreclosure crisis add to the inventory of unsold homes. Some two million homes will probably be lost in 2011, on top of 6.8 million homes lost in the bust so far.'b'Joblessness and the housing bust will continue to batter state and city budgets in 2011. Promises by so many newly elected state officials to balance their budgets without raising any taxes are not only cynical, they are a recipe for more crises to come.'b'President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s recent tax-cut deal with the Republicans included measures to support growth, notably extended unemployment benefits, and the payroll tax cut. Deep state budget cuts could offset much of that, unless Congress funnels more aid to states. The administration must continue to press banks for more and better mortgage workouts to help borrowers keep their homes.'b'Such efforts, while vital, are only the start. Competing in a global economy requires spare-no-expense effort to improve education. And Washington needs to do a lot more to help create globally competitive industries with jobs that pay well. We have heard President Obama talk about green jobs and rebuilding the nation\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure. The country and the economy need a big idea and a big project to move forward.'b'The federal deficit must be addressed. But cutting too deep, too fast will stall the recovery. There will have to be painful cuts ahead, and everything will have to be on the table, including entitlements and defense. Despite what the Republicans claim, there is no way to tackle the deficit and keep growing without raising taxes.'b'President Obama will need to make that case clearly in 2011 and challenge politicians \xe2\x80\x94 from both parties \xe2\x80\x94 to do what is necessary to ensure real prosperity.'b'Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s drive to extend its military and territorial reach is making America\xe2\x80\x99s close allies in the region nervous and raising legitimate questions about American diplomacy and future military procurement. The commander of America\xe2\x80\x99s Pacific forces recently revealed that China could soon deploy a ballistic missile capable of threatening American aircraft carriers in the region.'b'The Pentagon has a long history of hyping the Chinese  threat to justify expensive weapons purchases, and sinking well-defended ships with ballistic missiles is notoriously hard. But what should rightly concern American military planners is not so much the missile but the new Chinese naval strategy behind it.'b'China seems increasingly intent on challenging United States naval supremacy in the Western Pacific. At the same time it is aggressively pressing its claims to disputed offshore islands in the East and South China Seas. Washington must respond, carefully but firmly.'b'The Pentagon must accelerate efforts to make American naval forces in Asia less vulnerable to Chinese missile threats by giving them the means to project their deterrent power from further offshore.'b'Cutting back purchases of the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s DDG-1000 destroyer (with its deficient missile defense system) was a first step. A bigger one would be to reduce the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on short-range manned strike aircraft like the F-18 and the F-35, in favor of the carrier-launched N-UCAS, a longer-range unmanned strike aircraft. The Air Force should also drop its plans to buy 2,000 short-range strike planes but no long-range bombers.'b'The Obama administration must also redouble its diplomatic efforts to persuade Beijing that great power cooperation is far better than a costly and dangerous military rivalry. North Korea is a good starting point. The two countries share a clear interest in reining in Pyongyang\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear ambitions and reckless threats.'b'China \xe2\x80\x94 North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s main supplier of food and fuel \xe2\x80\x94 has been far too reluctant to use its leverage. Fearing a huge influx of refugees, it is focused solely on propping up the Kim dynasty. Before it is too late, Beijing needs to realize that an erratic, nuclear-armed neighbor is anything but a recipe for stability  \xe2\x80\x94 or for an American military drawdown.'b'Dealing with a rising China could be Washington\xe2\x80\x99s biggest challenge in the decades ahead. The United States has no interest in heightening tensions. A rapidly developing China has better uses for its new wealth than weapons. But when China pushes, as it is doing now, America needs to push back with a creative mix of diplomatic suppleness and military steadfastness.'b'It is disturbing to listen to Representative Peter King, the incoming chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. He has announced plans to hold a hearing next month into what he calls the \xe2\x80\x9cradicalization of the American Muslim community.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. King, a New York Republican, is no stranger to bluster, but his sweeping slur on Muslim citizens is unacceptable.'b'The new chairman, of course, acknowledges \xe2\x80\x9cthe great majority of Muslims in our country are hardworking, dedicated Americans.\xe2\x80\x9d At the same time he claims, with no evidence, that the hearing is urgently needed because \xe2\x80\x9claw enforcement officials throughout the country told me they received little or \xe2\x80\x94 in most cases \xe2\x80\x94 no cooperation from Muslim leaders and imams\xe2\x80\x9d in tracking domestic threats, according to his essay in Newsday.'b'We hope that if Mr. King insists on going ahead, he at least calls a true cross section of law enforcement officials, who we are sure will rebut that hype.'b'We agree with Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s first Muslim elected to the House, who called Mr. King\xe2\x80\x99s words \xe2\x80\x9cvery scary.\xe2\x80\x9d It is worthwhile to try to fathom \xe2\x80\x9cwhat turns somebody from a normal citizen into a violent radical,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Ellison says, but not by vilifying an entire community for openers.'b'It is all the more perplexing because Mr. King was one of the few Republicans to back the Clinton administration\xe2\x80\x99s interventions in the Balkans to protect Muslims. He has popped off far too often in recent years, claiming, among other things, that President George W. Bush \xe2\x80\x9cdeserves a medal\xe2\x80\x9d for authorizing waterboarding.'b'He had better recall his role as a gifted intermediary in helping to settle Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s sectarian troubles. He would have bristled at any simplistic talk about the \xe2\x80\x9cradicalization\xe2\x80\x9d of the Irish Catholic or Protestant communities. Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security is a very serious job. Mr. King needs to get serious.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m standing in the barnyard with the farrier. Remedy, the quarter horse, is getting his winter shoes. We\xe2\x80\x99re surrounded by vast heaps of plowed snow. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sparkling day, and for some reason I find myself thinking about a photograph we found after my father died. My grandfather is sitting on a high bank of snow, dressed in his work clothes, and he\xe2\x80\x99s holding up a fox terrier, which looks as if it\xe2\x80\x99s ready to eat the camera. This is the home farm in northwest Iowa, probably 1936.'b'Behind him is the barn where the draft horses lived. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether my grandfather was his own horse-shoer, but I doubt it. So there must have come many days like the one I\xe2\x80\x99m having, standing in the cold beside a sleepy horse while a man with a badly damaged thumb and a sore back goes about his work. In all these years, the technology has hardly changed. Fire, steel, nails, rasp, hammer, anvil, and a pair of heavy chaps with a hoof knife in a leather pocket.'b'I knew that farm long after the horses had been replaced by tractors. When I was older, I tried to get my dad to tell stories about what it was like growing up there during the Depression. He would sometimes talk about the blizzard of 1936, and he talked about the kindly cunning of the draft horses, who loved to impose upon him. But those days were cloaked in a vagueness I never understood, as if the farm were a country he\xe2\x80\x99d emigrated from and long since put out of mind. I wanted the details, what the work was like, what chores were his, how June differed from January. I never got them.'b'So I look back at the old photos and try to imagine the life there. I think especially of a photo of my grandfather holding my dad on his knee and a pup in the other arm. My dad\xe2\x80\x99s older brothers are there, all of them in ragged overalls and each one holding an apple. In the background there\xe2\x80\x99s a long house for laying hens. What I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give to go back and see it all.'b'The closest I can come is to stand as quietly as Remedy does and wait for the farrier to finish. I close the gate behind him and send the horses thundering into the breast-deep snow of the pasture.'b''b''b'John Steinbeck observed that \xe2\x80\x9ca sad soul can kill you quicker, far quicker, than a germ.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That insight, now confirmed by epidemiological studies, is worth bearing in mind at a time of such polarizing inequality that the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans possess a greater collective net worth than the bottom 90 percent.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s growing evidence that the toll of our stunning inequality is not just economic but also is a melancholy of the soul. The upshot appears to be high rates of violent crime, high narcotics use, high teenage birthrates and even high rates of heart disease.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s the argument of an important book by two distinguished British epidemiologists, 'b'Richard Wilkinson'b' and 'b'Kate Pickett'b'. They argue that gross inequality tears at the human psyche, creating anxiety, distrust and an array of mental and physical ailments  \xe2\x80\x94  and they cite mountains of data to support their argument.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you fail to avoid high inequality, you will need more prisons and more police,\xe2\x80\x9d they assert. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will have to deal with higher rates of mental illness, drug abuse and every other kind of problem.\xe2\x80\x9d They explore these issues in their book, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Spirit Level: Why Greater Equality Makes Societies Stronger.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The heart of their argument is that humans are social animals and that in highly unequal societies those at the bottom suffer from a range of pathologies. For example, a long-term study of British civil servants found that messengers, doormen and others with low status were much more likely to die of heart disease, suicide and some cancers and had substantially worse overall health.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s similar evidence from other primates. For example, macaque monkeys are also highly social animals, and scientists put them in cages and taught them how to push a lever so that they could get cocaine. Those at the bottom of the monkey hierarchy took much more cocaine than high-status monkeys.'b'Other experiments found that low-status monkeys suffered physical problems, including atherosclerosis in their arteries and an increase in abdominal fat. And as with monkeys, so with humans. Researchers have found that when people become unemployed or suffer economic setbacks, they gain weight. One 12-year study of American men found that when their income slipped, they gained an average of 5.5 pounds.'b'The correlation is strong around the world between countries with greater inequality and greater drug use. Paradoxically, countries with more relaxed narcotics laws, like the Netherlands, have relatively low domestic drug use  \xe2\x80\x94  perhaps because they are more egalitarian.'b'Professors Wilkinson and Pickett crunch the numbers and show that the same relationship holds true for a range of social problems. Among rich countries, those that are more unequal appear to have more mental illness, infant mortality, obesity, high school dropouts, teenage births, homicides, and so on.'b'They find the same thing is true among the 50 American states. More unequal states, like  Mississippi and Louisiana, do poorly by these social measures. More equal states, like New Hampshire and Minnesota, do far better.'b'So why is inequality so harmful? \xe2\x80\x9cThe Spirit Level\xe2\x80\x9d suggests that inequality undermines social trust and community life, corroding societies as a whole. It also suggests that humans, as social beings, become stressed when they find themselves at the bottom of a hierarchy.'b'That stress leads to biological changes, such as the release of the hormone cortisol, and to the accumulation of abdominal fat (perhaps an evolutionary adaptation in preparation for starvation ahead?). The result is physical ailments like heart disease, and social ailments like  violent crime, mutual distrust, self-destructive behaviors and persistent poverty. Another result is the establishment of alternative systems in which one can win respect and acquire self-esteem, such as gangs.'b'Granted, humans are not all equal in ability: There will always be some who are more wealthy  \xe2\x80\x94  and others who constitute the bottom. But inequality does not have to be as harsh, oppressive and polarized as it is in America today. Germany and Japan have attained modern, efficient economies with far less inequality than we have  \xe2\x80\x94  and far fewer social problems. Likewise, the gap between rich and poor fell during the Clinton administration, according to data cited in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Spirit Level,\xe2\x80\x9d even though that was a period of economic vigor.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cInequality is divisive, and even small differences seem to make an important difference,\xe2\x80\x9d Professors Wilkinson and Pickett note. They suggest that it is not just the poor who benefit from the social cohesion that comes with equality, but the entire society.'b'So as we debate national policy in 2011  \xe2\x80\x94  from the estate tax to unemployment insurance to early childhood education  \xe2\x80\x94  let\xe2\x80\x99s push to reduce the stunning levels of inequality in America today. These inequities seem profoundly unhealthy, for us and for our nation\xe2\x80\x99s soul.'b'Minneapolis'b'WE all have hopes for the New Year. Here\xe2\x80\x99s one of mine: filibuster reform. It was around this time 36 years ago \xe2\x80\x94 during a different recession \xe2\x80\x94 that I was part of a bipartisan effort to reform Senate Rule 22, the cloture rule. At the time, 67 votes were needed to cut off debate and thus end a filibuster, and nothing was getting done. After long negotiations, a compromise lowered to 60 the cloture vote requirement on legislation and nominations. We hoped this moderate change would preserve debate and deliberation while avoiding paralysis, and for a while it did.'b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s now clear that our reform was insufficient for today\xe2\x80\x99s more partisan, increasingly gridlocked Senate. In 2011, senators should pull back the curtain on Senate obstruction and once again amend the filibuster rules.'b'Reducing the number of votes to end a filibuster, perhaps to 55, is one option. Requiring a filibustering senator to actually speak on the Senate floor for the duration of a filibuster would also help. So, too, would reforms that bring greater transparency \xe2\x80\x94 like eliminating the secret \xe2\x80\x9cholds\xe2\x80\x9d that allow senators to block debate anonymously.'b'Our country faces major challenges \xe2\x80\x94 budget deficits, high unemployment and two wars, to name just a few \xe2\x80\x94 and needs a functioning legislative branch to address these pressing issues. Certainly some significant legislation passed in the last two years, but too much else fell by the wayside. The Senate never even considered some appropriations and authorization bills, and failed to settle on a federal budget for all of next year. Votes on this sort of legislation used to be routine, but with the new frequency of the filibuster, a supermajority is needed to pass almost anything. As a result the Senate is arguably more dysfunctional than at any time in recent history.'b'People give lots of reasons for not reforming the filibuster. The minority often claims that it needs the filibuster to ensure that its voice is heard, even though the filibuster is now used to prevent debate from ever beginning. What really gets me, though, is when opponents to reform point to the provision left in Rule 22 after 1975 saying that the Senate cannot change any of its rules without a two-thirds supermajority to end debate.'b'This requirement cannot constrain any future Senate. A long-standing principle of common law holds that one legislature cannot bind its successors. If changing Senate rules really required a two-thirds supermajority, it would effectively prevent a simple majority of any Senate from ever amending its own rules, which would be unconstitutional.  Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution states: \xe2\x80\x9cEach House may determine the rules of its proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d The document is very explicit about the few instances where a supermajority vote is needed \xe2\x80\x94 and changing the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s procedural rules is not among them. In all other instances it must be assumed that the Constitution requires only a majority vote.'b'In other words, the fact that one Senate, decades ago, passed the two-thirds majority rule does not mean that all future Senates are bound by it. This year\xe2\x80\x99s new Senate could use this \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional option\xe2\x80\x9d to force a vote on any change to Senate rules, including Rule 22, and change them with a simple majority.'b'At the very opening of Congress in 1975, my colleagues and I announced our proposal to amend Rule 22, and threatened to force a majority vote to end a filibuster on the change if the minority tried to block it. In the end, we reached the 60-vote compromise, and never had to use the constitutional option after all. A similar strategy would likely work today.'b'Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, has said that in a few days, at the beginning of the 112th Congress, he will call on the Senate to exercise its constitutional right to change its rules of procedure, including Rule 22, by a simple majority vote.  I wholeheartedly support his effort and encourage both Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with him. The filibuster need not be eliminated, but it must no longer be so easy to use.'b'To the Editor:'b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'Hurdles Emerge in Rising Effort to Rate Teachers'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Dec. 27):'b'The year-to-year ratings of teachers, based on student test scores, are not consistent enough to use in personnel decisions.

Chief Justice John Roberts reasoned that a terrorist group might use human rights advocacy training to file harassing claims, that it might use peacemaking assistance as a cover while re-arming itself, and that such speech could contribute to the group\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clegitimacy,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus increase its ability to obtain support elsewhere that could be turned to terrorist ends. Under the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, former President Jimmy Carter\xe2\x80\x99s election monitoring team could be prosecuted for meeting with and advising Hezbollah during the 2009 Lebanese elections.'b'The government has similarly argued that providing legitimate humanitarian aid to victims of war or natural disasters is a crime if provided to or coordinated with a group labeled as a \xe2\x80\x9cforeign terrorist organization\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 even if there is no other way to get the aid to the region in need.

But Pixar and Lucasfilm agreed not to cold-call each other\xe2\x80\x99s employees and to notify each other when making an offer to the other company\xe2\x80\x99s employee. They also agreed that if one tried to poach one of the other\xe2\x80\x99s employees and the rival counteroffered, the poacher would not increase the pay package above the initial bid.'b'Workers have a hard enough time making it in this economy without their bosses colluding to keep them from better job opportunities elsewhere. Without competitive bidding by employers, many workers would have little chance of getting a raise. The deal between the studios was, in effect, an anticompetitive tool to keep a lid on digital animators\xe2\x80\x99 pay.'b'This is by no means an isolated case. In September, the Justice Department settled another suit over similar no-solicitation agreements involving Adobe Systems, Apple, Google, Intel, Intuit and Pixar.'b'Both cases were settled under similar terms: forbidding the companies to cut deals to refrain from competing for employees \xe2\x80\x94 either cold-calling or using other recruitment techniques. We hope the settlements will also serve as a reality check for these companies. They are supposed to be laying the technological groundwork for a better future. That future can\xe2\x80\x99t be built with exploitive labor practices.'b'The new Senate will face one of its most momentous decisions in its opening hours on Wednesday: a vote on whether to change its rules to prohibit the widespread abuse of the filibuster. Americans are fed up with Washington gridlock. The Senate should seize the opportunity.'b'A filibuster \xe2\x80\x94 the catchall term for delaying or blocking a majority vote on a bill by lengthy debate or other procedures \xe2\x80\x94 remains a valuable tool for ensuring that a minority of senators cannot be steamrollered into silence. No one is talking about ending the practice.'b''b'Every returning Democratic senator, though, has signed a letter'b' demanding an end to the almost automatic way the filibuster has been used in recent years. By simply raising an anonymous objection, senators can trigger a 60-vote supermajority for virtually every piece of legislation. The time has come to make senators work for their filibusters, and justify them to the public.'b'Critics will say that it is self-serving for Democrats to propose these reforms now, when they face a larger and more restive Republican minority. The facts of the growing procedural abuse are clearly on their side. In the last two Congressional terms, 'b'Republicans have brought 275 filibusters'b' that Democrats have been forced to try to break. That is by far the highest number in Congressional history, and more than twice the amount in the previous two terms.'b'These filibusters are the reason there was no budget passed this year, and why as many as 125 nominees to executive branch positions and 48 judicial nominations were never brought to a vote. They have produced public policy that we strongly opposed, most recently preserving the tax cuts for the rich, but even bipartisan measures like the food safety bill are routinely filibustered and delayed.'b'The key is to find a way to ensure that any minority party \xe2\x80\x94 and the Democrats could find themselves there again \xe2\x80\x94 has leverage in the Senate without grinding every bill to an automatic halt. 'b'The most thoughtful proposal'b' to do so was developed by Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, along with Tom Udall of New Mexico and a few other freshmen. It would make these major changes:'b''b'NO LAZY FILIBUSTERS'b' At least 10 senators would have to file a filibuster petition, and members would have to speak continuously on the floor to keep the filibuster going. To ensure the seriousness of the attempt, the requirements would grow each day: five senators would have to hold the floor for the first day, 10 the second day, etc. Those conducting the filibuster would thus have to make their case on camera. (A cloture vote of 60 senators would still be required to break the blockade.)'b''b'FEWER BITES OF THE APPLE'b' Republicans now routinely filibuster not only the final vote on a bill, but the initial motion to even debate it, as well as amendments and votes on conference committees. Breaking each of these filibusters adds days or weeks to every bill. The plan would limit filibusters to the actual passage of a bill.'b''b'MINORITY AMENDMENTS'b' Harry Reid, the majority leader, frequently prevents Republicans from offering amendments because he fears they will lead to more opportunities to filibuster. Republicans say they mount filibusters because they are precluded from offering amendments. This situation would be resolved by allowing a fixed number of amendments from each side on a bill, followed by a fixed amount of debate on each one.'b'Changing these rules could be done by a simple majority of senators, but only on the first day of the session. Republicans have said that ramming through such a measure would reduce what little comity remains in the chamber.'b'Nonetheless, the fear of such a vote has led Republican leaders to negotiate privately with Democrats in search of a compromise, possibly on amendments. Any plan that does not require filibustering senators to hold the floor and make their case to the public would fall short. The Senate has been crippled long enough.'b'If there\xe2\x80\x99s one piece of economic wisdom I hope people will grasp this year, it\xe2\x80\x99s this: Even though we may finally have stopped digging, we\xe2\x80\x99re still near the bottom of a very deep hole.'b'Why do I need to point this out? Because I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed many people overreacting to recent good economic news. What particularly concerns me is the risk of self-denying optimism \xe2\x80\x94  that is, I worry that policy makers will look at a few favorable economic indicators, decide that they no longer need to promote recovery, and take steps that send us sliding right back to the bottom.'b'So, about that good news: various economic indicators, ranging from relatively good holiday sales to new claims for unemployment insurance (which have finally fallen below 400,000 a week), suggest that the great post-bubble retrenchment may finally be ending.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re not talking Morning in America here. Construction shows no sign of returning to bubble-era levels, nor are there any indications that debt-burdened families are going back to their old habits of spending all they earned. But all we needed for a modest economic rebound was for construction to stop falling and saving to stop rising  \xe2\x80\x94  and that seems to be happening. Forecasters have been marking up their predictions; growth as high as 4 percent this year now looks possible.'b'Hooray! But then again, not so much. Jobs, not G.D.P. numbers, are what matter to American families. And when you start from an unemployment rate of almost 10 percent, the arithmetic of job creation \xe2\x80\x94  the amount of growth you need to get back to a tolerable jobs picture  \xe2\x80\x94  is daunting.'b'First of all, we have to grow around 2.5 percent a year just to keep up with rising productivity and population, and hence keep unemployment from rising. That\xe2\x80\x99s why the past year and a half was technically a recovery but felt like a recession: G.D.P. was growing, but not fast enough to bring unemployment down.'b'Growth at a rate above 2.5 percent will bring unemployment down over time. But the gains aren\xe2\x80\x99t one for one: for a variety of reasons, it has historically taken about two extra points of growth over the course of a year to shave one point off the unemployment rate.'b'Now do the math. Suppose that the U.S. economy were to grow at 4 percent a year, starting now and continuing for the next several years. Most people would regard this as excellent performance, even as an economic boom; it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly higher than almost all the forecasts I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.'b'Yet the math says that even with that kind of growth the unemployment rate would be close to 9 percent at the end of this year, and still above 8 percent at the end of 2012. We wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get to anything resembling full employment until late in Sarah Palin\xe2\x80\x99s first presidential term.'b'Seriously, what we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at over the next few years, even with pretty good growth, are unemployment rates that not long ago would have been considered catastrophic  \xe2\x80\x94  because they are. Behind those dry statistics lies a vast landscape of suffering and broken dreams. And the arithmetic says that the suffering will continue as far as the eye can see.'b'So what can be done to accelerate this all-too-slow process of healing? A rational political system would long since have created a 21st-century version of the Works Progress Administration  \xe2\x80\x94  we\xe2\x80\x99d be putting the unemployed to work doing what needs to be done, repairing and improving our fraying infrastructure. In the political system we have, however, Senator-elect Kelly Ayotte, 'b'delivering'b' the Republican weekly address on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, declared that \xe2\x80\x9cJob one is to stop wasteful Washington spending.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Realistically, the best we can hope for from fiscal policy is that Washington doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actively undermine the recovery. Beware, in particular, the Ides of March: by then,  the federal government will probably have hit its debt limit and the G.O.P. will try to force President Obama into economically harmful spending cuts.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m also worried about monetary policy. Two months ago, the Federal Reserve announced a new plan to promote job growth by buying long-term bonds; at the time, many observers believed that the initial $600 billion purchase was only the beginning of the story. But now it looks like the end, partly because Republicans are trying to bully the Fed into pulling back, but also because a run of slightly better economic news provides an excuse to do nothing.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s even a significant chance that the Fed will raise interest rates later this year  \xe2\x80\x94  or at least that\xe2\x80\x99s what the futures market seems to think. Doing so in the face of high unemployment and minimal inflation would be crazy, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it won\xe2\x80\x99t happen.'b'So back to my original point: whatever the recent economic news, we\xe2\x80\x99re still near the bottom of a very deep hole. We can only hope that enough policy makers understand that point.'b'Large, oceangoing commercial fish like tuna and swordfish have been in steady decline for years, victims of poor regulation and rapacious overfishing by big industrial fleets. But one relentlessly hunted fish \xe2\x80\x94 sharks \xe2\x80\x94 may finally be catching a break.'b'Each year, commercial and recreational fishing kills more than 100 million sharks globally (the number of humans killed by sharks in 2008: four). Of these, an estimated 73 million are slaughtered solely for their fins to provide the shark fin soup that is so popular in Asia. The fins are sliced off and the sharks dumped back in the water; unable to swim, they sink to the bottom and die.'b'A 2000 law banned finning off the Atlantic Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico. Last month, Congress approved a bill prohibiting shark finning in all United States waters. It requires boats to bring sharks to port with the fins attached. This limits each vessel\xe2\x80\x99s catch, since a whole shark takes up a lot more room than the fins alone.'b'The bill\xe2\x80\x99s immediate impact on the global market will be modest. But it gives the United States credibility to push other big fishing nations to follow its lead.'b'In November, an international commission banned fishing for whitetip sharks and six types of hammerheads. True to form, the commission waited until the fish were at death\xe2\x80\x99s door before acting. The whitetips have declined by 99 percent in the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean, and hammerheads by 99 percent in the Mediterranean.'b'Sharks have been around for 400 million years, and as top predators in the food chain have played an important role in the complex web of ocean life. Fully one-third of about 1,000 shark and ray species are thought to be in serious trouble or nearing extinction. Any help they can get is good news for the entire ecosystem.'b'UTICA, N.Y.'b'Across the country a tide is reversing. Soldiers deployed to two long wars are coming back, bringing some of the anguish home with them. Those who leave the service are trying to restart civilian lives, rejoining their families, going to college, trying to find jobs. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always work out.'b'The challenges for returning veterans are particularly visible in upstate New York, around Fort Drum, home to the Army\xe2\x80\x99s 10th Mountain Division, and some of the most frequently deployed combat units anywhere. Since 9/11, tens of thousands of Drum soldiers have seen two or three, sometimes even four tours of duty. Most who return disperse around the country, but a significant percentage stay nearby. Veterans are 13 percent of the population in the Fort Drum area, compared with 9 percent in the rest of the state.'b'In that band of fading cities and rural communities, the governmental safety net is stretched thin. With more veterans needing help, a growing network of nonprofit organizations is rising to meet the demand.'b'Business is booming in the veterans outreach center in downtown Utica. The center, once a YMCA, was bright and bustling on a recent gray, snow-dusted day. Staff members proudly showed the strands of a new safety net being woven into place: dormitory rooms upstairs that will soon be converted to transitional housing, a basement full of donated clothing, housewares and furniture. Classrooms. A boxing ring and exercise room. An Internet cafe.'b'On Dec. 10, the center celebrated the ribbon-cutting for a new program in which veterans meet other veterans for outings, conversation, friendship. The simple idea behind it: if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been there, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know.'b'The peer program\xe2\x80\x99s coordinator is Michael Sportello, who served in Iraq. He returned to the worst recession in decades, an ocean of debt and an unhappy home. His wife left. He kept his sons. He almost gave up, but then found the center and a focus for his life.'b'He is working with people like William Lavier, an Army master sergeant who is striving to reinvent himself for life after warfare. Sergeant Lavier is unemployed and has a college degree and no interest in working for the minimum wage. Because the available jobs upstate are mainly in health care and education, he is studying to be a registered nurse, hoping his finances hold out long enough.'b'He and his wife, who works for a medical-billing company, are many tens of thousands of dollars in debt. They are one layoff away from a disaster. He is also considering leaving his family for a job in Virginia. Or signing up for another deployment \xe2\x80\x94 war may be hell, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also a paycheck.'b'The world of troubled veterans is still dominated by the Vietnam era, by men in their 60s. But the veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, young men and women in their prime, survivors of bomb blasts and bearers of brutal memories, are catching up. When they get in trouble, they are said to do so quicker and more deeply.'b'Mr.  Sportello and Sergeant  Lavier are luckier than many. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t homeless or in prison. But both men speak emphatically of how difficult the re-entry to life is after combat. Over there, on patrol,  Mr.  Sportello said, the adrenaline is so thick the pounding in your neck makes it hard to breathe. Back home, Sergeant Lavier usually can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep. Once, he dozed off to a war movie blasting in his home, the speakers shaking the house and waking everyone else up. The sounds of combat were a lullaby for his jangled nerves.'b'The pace of civilian life confounds many veterans. They see it as a world of slow-moving civilians who frustrate and terrify them. If a driver resents your tailgating and slows down, and another pulls up beside you \xe2\x80\x94 suddenly you\xe2\x80\x99re boxed in, back in Baghdad. People on overpasses look like snipers. Trash on road shoulders like I.E.D.\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'Veterans and their advocates in Utica and elsewhere had good words for the Veterans Affairs Department, which they said has begun realizing that one of the best ways to help veterans, especially the many who live far from V.A. hospitals, is through community-based services. The agency is steering money to local nonprofits and beginning its own efforts, like a pilot program in nearby Watertown and towns near other military bases around the country, to seek out veterans at risk of homelessness. This is a sharp change of attitude.'b'Someday the country will recognize that the population of veterans is growing, and that yellow-ribbon magnets aren\xe2\x80\x99t enough to help them. Unfortunately, Congress hasn\xe2\x80\x99t figured it out. Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki has a welcome campaign to end the problem of veterans\xe2\x80\x99 homelessness in five years. But a bill to give the V.A. $50 million more to address homelessness  went nowhere in the lame-duck session. The next Congress must do better.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'New York Medical Schools Fight to End Caribbean Schools\xe2\x80\x99 Path'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Dec. 23):'b'As a country, we are dependent on graduates from Caribbean medical schools to provide competent care for our citizens.

It should therefore yield more than the usual boilerplate professions of mutual esteem. It should aim for a definition of the relationship between the two countries  that does justice to the  global promise of constructive cooperation between them.'b'I remember Deng\xe2\x80\x99s visit well, as I was national security adviser at the time. It took place  in an era of Soviet expansionism, and crystallized  United States-Chinese  efforts to oppose it. It also marked the beginning of China\xe2\x80\x99s  three-decades-long economic transformation  \xe2\x80\x94 one facilitated by its new diplomatic ties to the United States.'b'President Hu\xe2\x80\x99s visit takes place in a different climate. There are  growing uncertainties regarding the  state of the bilateral  relationship, as well as  concerns in Asia over China\xe2\x80\x99s longer-range geopolitical aspirations. These uncertainties are casting a shadow over the upcoming meeting.'b'In recent months there has been a steady increase in  polemics  in the United States and China, with each side  accusing the other of  pursuing economic  policies that  run contrary to  accepted international rules. Each has described the other as  selfish. Longstanding differences between the American and the Chinese notions of human rights were accentuated by the awarding of  the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize to a Chinese dissident.'b'Moreover, each side has unintentionally intensified the suspicions of the other. Washington\xe2\x80\x99s  decisions 'b'to help  India with  nuclear energy'b' have stimulated China\xe2\x80\x99s  unease, prompting  increased Chinese support for Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s desire to expand its own nuclear energy potential.

The United States\xe2\x80\x99 need for comprehensive domestic renewal, for instance,  is in many respects the price of having  shouldered the burdens of waging the 40-year cold war, and it is in part the price of having neglected for the last 20 years mounting evidence of its own domestic obsolescence. Our weakening infrastructure is merely a symptom of the country\xe2\x80\x99s slide backward into the 20th century.'b'China, meanwhile, is struggling to manage an overheated economy within an inflexible political system.  Some pronouncements by Chinese commentators smack of premature  triumphalism regarding both China\xe2\x80\x99s domestic transformation and its global role.

A failure to consolidate and widen their cooperation would  damage not just both nations but the world as a whole.  Neither side should delude itself that it can avoid the harm  caused by  an increased mutual antagonism; both should understand that a crisis in one country can hurt the other.'b'For the visit to be more than symbolic, Presidents Obama and Hu should make a serious effort to codify in a joint declaration the historic potential of productive American-Chinese  cooperation. They should outline  the principles that should guide it. They should declare their commitment to the concept that the American-Chinese partnership should have a wider mission than national self-interest. That partnership should be guided by the moral imperatives of the 21st century\xe2\x80\x99s unprecedented global interdependence.'b'The declaration should set in motion a process for  defining common political, economic and social goals. It should acknowledge frankly the reality of some disagreements as well as register a shared determination to seek ways of narrowing the ranges of such disagreements. It should also take note of potential threats to security in areas of mutual concern, and commit both sides to enhanced consultations and  collaboration in coping with them.'b'Such a joint charter should, in effect, provide the framework not only for avoiding what under some circumstances could become a hostile rivalry but also for expanding a realistic collaboration between the United States and China.

(Recent unplanned-pregnancy movies like \xe2\x80\x9cJuno\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cKnocked Up\xe2\x80\x9d made abortion seem not only unnecessary but repellent.)

Durham and her boyfriend are the kind of young people our culture sets adrift  \xe2\x80\x94  working-class and undereducated, with weak support networks, few authority figures, and no script for sexual maturity beyond the easily neglected admonition to always use a condom. Their televised agony was a case study in how abortion can simultaneously seem like a moral wrong and the only possible solution  \xe2\x80\x94  because it promised to keep them out of poverty, and to let them give their first daughter opportunities they never had.'b'The show was particularly wrenching, though, when juxtaposed with two recent dispatches from the world of midlife, upper-middle-class infertility. Last month there was Vanessa Grigoriadis\xe2\x80\x99s provocative New York Magazine story \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Waking Up From the Pill'b',\xe2\x80\x9d which suggested that a lifetime on chemical birth control has encouraged women \xe2\x80\x9cto forget about the biological realities of being female ... inadvertently, indirectly, infertility has become the Pill\xe2\x80\x99s primary side effect.\xe2\x80\x9d Then on Sunday, The   Times Magazine provided a more intimate 'b'look at'b'  the same issue, in which a midlife parent, the journalist Melanie Thernstrom, chronicled what it took to bring her children  into the world: six failed in vitro cycles, an egg donor and two surrogate mothers, and an untold fortune in expenses.'b'In every era, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a tragic contrast between the burden of unwanted pregnancies and the burden of infertility. But this gap used to be bridged by adoption far more frequently than it is today. Prior to 1973, 20 percent of births to white, unmarried women (and 9 percent of unwed births over all) led to an adoption. Today, just 1 percent of babies born to unwed mothers are adopted, and would-be adoptive parents face a waiting list that has lengthened beyond reason.'b'Some of this shift reflects the growing acceptance of single parenting. But some of it reflects the impact of Roe v. Wade. Since 1973, countless lives that might have been welcomed into families like Thernstrom\xe2\x80\x99s  \xe2\x80\x94  which looked into adoption, and gave it up as hopeless  \xe2\x80\x94  have been cut short in utero instead.'b'And lives are what they are. On the MTV special, the people around Durham swaddle abortion in euphemism. The being inside her is just \xe2\x80\x9cpregnancy tissue.\xe2\x80\x9d After the abortion, she recalls being warned not to humanize it: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you think of it like [a person], you\xe2\x80\x99re going to make yourself depressed.\xe2\x80\x9d Instead, \xe2\x80\x9cthink of it as what it is: nothing but a little ball of cells.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s left to Durham herself to cut through the evasion. Sitting with her boyfriend afterward, she begins to cry when he calls the embryo a \xe2\x80\x9cthing.\xe2\x80\x9d Gesturing to their infant daughter, she says, \xe2\x80\x9cA \xe2\x80\x98thing\xe2\x80\x99 can turn out like that. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I remember ... \xe2\x80\x98Nothing but a bunch of cells\xe2\x80\x99 can be her.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When we want to know this, we know this. Last week\xe2\x80\x99s New Yorker carried a poem by Kevin Young about expectant parents, early in pregnancy, probing the mother\xe2\x80\x99s womb for a heartbeat:'b'The doctor trying again to find you, fragile,'b'fern, snowflake. Nothing.'b'After, my wife will say, in fear,'b'impatient, she went beyond her body,'b'this tiny room, into the ether\xe2\x80\x94'b'...

At the very least, the act must be expressly limited to situations in which the spread of the classified information poses a clear and imminent danger of grave harm to the nation.'b'The clear and present danger standard has been a central element of our First Amendment jurisprudence ever since Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.\xe2\x80\x99s 1919'b' opinion in Schenk v. United States'b'.  In the 90 years since, the precise meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cclear and present danger\xe2\x80\x9d has evolved, but the animating principle was stated brilliantly by Justice Louis D. Brandeis in his 1927 concurring opinion in 'b'Whitney v. California'b'. The founders \xe2\x80\x9cdid not exalt order at the cost of liberty,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Brandeis; on the contrary, they  understood that \xe2\x80\x9conly an emergency can justify repression. Such must be the rule if authority is to be reconciled with freedom. Such ... is the command of the Constitution. It is, therefore, always open to Americans to challenge a law abridging free speech and assembly by showing that there was no emergency justifying it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'On the other hand, the First Amendment does not compel government transparency. It leaves the government extraordinary autonomy to protect its own secrets. It does not accord anyone the right to have the government disclose information about its actions or policies, and it cedes to the government considerable authority to restrict the speech of its own employees. What it does not do, however, is allow the government to suppress the free speech of others when it has failed to keep its own secrets.'b'We might think of this like the attorney-client privilege. If a lawyer reveals his client\xe2\x80\x99s confidences to a reporter, he can be punished for violating that privilege \xe2\x80\x94 but the newspaper cannot constitutionally be punished for publishing the information.'b'There are very good reasons why it makes sense to give the government so little authority to punish the circulation of unlawfully leaked information.'b'First, the mere fact that such information might \xe2\x80\x9cprejudice the interests of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d does not mean that that harm outweighs the benefit of publication; in many circumstances, it may be extremely valuable to public understanding. Consider, for example, classified information about the absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.'b'Second, the reasons that government officials want secrecy are many and varied. They range from the truly compelling to the patently illegitimate. As we have learned from 'b'our own history'b', it is often very tempting for government officials to overstate their need for secrecy, especially in times of national anxiety. A strict clear and present danger standard \xe2\x80\x94 rather than an unwieldy and unpredictable case-by-case balancing of harm against benefit \xe2\x80\x94 establishes a high bar to protect us against this danger.'b'And finally, a central principle of the First Amendment is that the suppression of free speech must be the government\xe2\x80\x99s last rather than its first resort in addressing a problem. The most obvious way for the government to prevent the danger posed by the circulation of classified material is by ensuring that information that must be kept secret is not leaked in the first place.'b'Indeed, the Supreme Court made this point quite clearly in its 2001 decision in 'b'Bartnicki v. Vopper,'b' which held that when an individual receives information \xe2\x80\x9cfrom a source who obtained it unlawfully,\xe2\x80\x9d  that individual may not be punished for publicly disseminating the information \xe2\x80\x9cabsent a need ... of the highest order.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The court explained that if the sanctions now attached to the underlying criminal act \xe2\x80\x9cdo not provide sufficient deterrence,\xe2\x80\x9d then perhaps they should be \xe2\x80\x9cmade more severe\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 but \xe2\x80\x9cit would be quite remarkable to hold\xe2\x80\x9d that an individual can constitutionally be punished merely for publishing information because the government failed to \xe2\x80\x9cdeter conduct by a non-law-abiding third party.\xe2\x80\x9d  This is a sound solution.'b'If we grant the government too much power to punish those who disseminate information, then we risk too great a sacrifice of public deliberation; if we grant the government too little power to control confidentiality at the source, then we risk too great a sacrifice of secrecy. The answer is thus to reconcile the irreconcilable values of secrecy and accountability by guaranteeing 'b'both 'b'a strong authority of the government to prohibit leaks 'b'and 'b'an expansive right of others to disseminate information to the public.'b'Cullowhee, N.C.'b'A  DOG or cat owner spends roughly $10,000 on the care and feeding of his pet over its lifetime.

What does he get for this investment?'b'Surveys indicate that what most pet owners mainly want is companionship, unconditional love and a play pal. In recent years, however, we have also begun to regard pets as furry physicians and four-legged psychotherapists.'b'The idea that domestic animals are beneficial to human health and happiness has been fueled by books like \xe2\x80\x9cThe Healing Power of Pets: Harnessing the Amazing Ability of Pets to Make and Keep People Happy and Healthy,\xe2\x80\x9d by the veterinarian Marty Becker, and by news reports claiming that having a dog helps you live longer or that swimming with dolphins can cure autism, bad backs, attention deficit disorder and even cancer. But is there any truth to these claims?'b'The task of distinguishing hype from reality on this question falls to anthrozoology, the new science of human-animal relationships. In 1980, Erika Friedmann, a scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, found the first evidence that animals might provide medical benefits: 'b'a survey of 92 heart attack victims'b' revealed that those who had pets were nearly five times more likely to be alive a year later than those without them.'b'Since then, research has shown that stroking an animal lowers blood pressure, that AIDS patients living with pets are less depressed  and that pet owners have lower cholesterol levels, sleep more soundly, exercise more and take fewer sick days than non-pet owners. Indeed, I have a stack of articles in my office supporting the hypothesis that pets are healthy for us.'b'Unfortunately, however, I also have another stack of articles, almost as high, showing that pets have either no long-term effects or have even adverse effects on physical and mental health.'b'A 2006 survey of Americans by the Pew Research Center, for instance, reported that 'b'living with a pet did not make people any happier'b'. Similarly, a 2000 Australian study of mortality rates found no evidence that pet owners lived any longer than anyone else. And last year 'b'Dutch researchers concluded'b' that companion animals had no effect on their owners\xe2\x80\x99 physical or mental well-being. Worse, in 2006, 'b'epidemiologists in Finland reported'b' that pet owners were more likely than non-pet owners to suffer from sciatica, kidney disease, arthritis, migraines, panic attacks, high blood pressure and depression.'b'This pattern of mixed results also holds true for the widely heralded notion that animals can cure various physical afflictions. For example,'b' a study of people with chronic fatigue syndrome'b' found that while pet owners believed that interacting with their pets relieved their symptoms, objective analysis revealed that they were just as tired, stressed, worried and unhappy as sufferers in a control group who had no pets. Similarly, a clinical trial of cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy found that interacting with therapy dogs did no more to enhance the participants\xe2\x80\x99 morale than reading a book did.'b'As for the presumed curative powers of swimming with dolphins, researchers at Emory University who reviewed the dolphin therapy studies concluded that every one purporting to document positive health effects 'b'was methodologically flawed'b'.'b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to disparage animal companionship; pets are central to my life, too. But the truth is that we know little about how pets could affect us biologically, or why a health benefit accrues to some people but not others. Answering these questions will require the same rigorous methods that scientists use to test the effectiveness of drugs and medical procedures.'b'Despite the importance of pets in our lives, researchers in the health and behavioral sciences have, until recently, largely neglected the study of human-animal relationships. But this is changing. In 2008, the National Institutes of Health (in conjunction with Mars, the corporate giant whose products include pet food) began a multimillion-dollar research initiative that will eventually help separate fact from wishful thinking on how pets influence human health and happiness.'b'No doubt, the talk in some medical circles of prescribing puppies and kittens for the chronically ill is well intentioned. But until the research is complete, pet lovers should probably keep taking their Lipitor and Prozac.'b'Unless something big and unexpected happens, 2011 will be consumed by a debate over the size of government. Republicans will launch a critique of big government as part of their effort to cut spending. Democrats will surge to the barricades to defend federal programs.'b'This debate will be contentious, but I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s not rude to mention that it will be largely beside the point. National destinies are not shaped by what percentage of G.D.P. federal spending consumes. They are shaped by the character and behavior of citizens. The crucial issue is not whether the federal government takes up 19 percent or 23 percent of national income. The crucial question is: How does government influence how people live?'b'There have been cases when big government has encouraged virtuous behavior (in the U.S. during World War II), and cases when big government has encouraged self-indulgence and irresponsibility (modern Greece). There have been cases when small government was accompanied by enterprise and development, and cases when small government has led to lawlessness, corruption and distrust.'b'The size of government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you what you need to know;  the social and moral content of government action does.  The budgeteers and the technicians may not like it, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the values inculcated by policies that matter most.'b'The best way to measure government is not by volume, but by what you might call the Achievement Test. Does a given policy arouse energy, foster skills, spur social mobility and help people transform their lives? Over the years, America has benefited from policies that passed this test, like the Homestead Act and the G.I. Bill. Occasionally, the U.S. government has initiated programs that failed it. The welfare policies of the 1960s gave people money without asking for work and personal responsibility in return, and these had to be replaced. The welfare reforms of the 1990s involved big and intrusive government, but they did the job because they were in line with American values, linking effort to reward.'b'Over the past few decades, Americans have waged political war as if all that matters is the amount of money going into federal coffers. The fights have been about \xe2\x80\x9ccutting government\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9craising revenue.\xe2\x80\x9d But amid this season of distraction the entire society suffered a loss of values and almost nobody noticed until it was too late. Both business and government started favoring consumption and short-term comfort and neglecting investment and long-term growth.'b'This hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a case of government corrupting capitalism or vice versa. The two have worked hand-in-hand. The government has erected a welfare state that, as Matthew Continetti of The Weekly Standard has pointed out, spends vast  amounts on consumption (Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, interest on the debt) and much less on investment (education, research, infrastructure), while pushing the costs on future generations. Meanwhile, the private sector has encouraged a huge increase in personal debt to fuel a consumption bubble. The geniuses flock to finance, not industry.'b'If we\xe2\x80\x99re going to reverse this tide, it might be useful to put the Achievement Test back at the center of politics.  This would help focus the national mind on the fundamental challenge: moving from a consumption-dominated economy oriented around satisfying immediate needs toward a more balanced investment and consumption economy. It might also cut through the gridlocked trench warfare between big-government liberals and small-government conservatives.'b'Reframing the argument around achievement wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t end partisan division. Democrats and Republicans differ  on what makes an economy productive. But it would allow for horse-trading.'b'As part of the budget process, Republicans could champion the things they believe will enhance productivity and mobility. Many of these will mean making sure people have the incentives to take risks and the freedom to adjust to foreign competition: a flatter, simpler tax code with lower corporate rates, a smaller debt burden, predictable regulations, affordable entitlements.'b'Democrats could champion the things 'b'they'b' believe will enhance productivity and mobility. Many of these will mean making sure everybody has the tools to compete: early childhood education, infrastructure programs to create jobs, immigration policies that recruit talent, incentives for energy innovation.'b'The two agendas sit in tension, but they are not contradictory. The exciting thing about this moment is that everything is on the table. Thousands of policy proposals are floating around, thanks to the various deficit commissions and policy entrepreneurs. As the parties argue about the debt limit and the rest, it should be possible to take items from both and ram them into a package that cuts consumption spending in order to make investment spending more affordable.'b'How big will the resulting government be? That is a secondary issue. If a policy enhances achievement, we should be for that thing. If it displaces investment, we should be skeptical of it. Quality, not quantity, matters most.'b'You just can\xe2\x80\x99t close the door on this crowd. The party that brought us the worst economy since the Great Depression, that led us into Iraq and the worst foreign policy disaster in American history, that would like to take a hammer to Social Security and a chisel to Medicare, is back in control of the House of Representatives with the expressed mission of undermining all things Obama.'b'Once we had Dick Cheney telling us that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and belligerently asserting that deficits don\xe2\x80\x99t matter. We had Phil Gramm, Enron\xe2\x80\x99s favorite senator and John McCain\xe2\x80\x99s economic guru, blithely assuring us in 2008 that we were suffering from a \xe2\x80\x9cmental recession.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'(Mr. Gramm was some piece of work. A champion of deregulation, he was disdainful of ordinary people. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re the only nation in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d he once said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere all of our poor people are fat.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'Maybe the voters missed the entertainment value of the hard-hearted, compulsively destructive G.O.P. headliners. Maybe they viewed them the way audiences saw the larger-than-life villains in old-time melodramas. It must be something like that because it\xe2\x80\x99s awfully hard to miss the actual policies of a gang that almost wrecked the country.'b'In any event, the G.O.P. has taken its place once again as the House majority and is vowing to do what it does best, which is make somebody miserable \xe2\x80\x94 in this case, President Obama. Representative Darrell Issa, the California Republican who is now chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said recently on the Rush Limbaugh program that Mr. Obama was \xe2\x80\x9cone of the most corrupt presidents in modern times.\xe2\x80\x9d He backed off a little on Sunday, saying that what he really thinks is that Mr. Obama is presiding over \xe2\x80\x9cone of the most corrupt administrations.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is the attitude of a man who has the power of subpoena and plans to conduct hundreds of hearings  into the administration\xe2\x80\x99s activities.'b'The mantra for Mr. Issa and the rest of the newly empowered Republicans in the House, including the new Budget Committee chairman, Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, is to cut spending and shrink government. But what\xe2\x80\x99s really coming are patented G.O.P. efforts to spread misery beyond Mr. Obama and the Democrats to ordinary Americans struggling in what are still very difficult times.'b'It was ever thus. The fundamental mission of the G.O.P. is to shovel ever more money to those who are already rich. That\xe2\x80\x99s why you got all that disgracefully phony rhetoric from Republicans about attacking budget deficits and embracing austerity while at the same time they were fighting like mad people to pile up the better part of a trillion dollars in new debt by extending the Bush tax cuts.'b'This is a party that has mastered the art of taking from the poor and the middle class and giving to the rich. We should at least be clear about this and stop being repeatedly hoodwinked \xe2\x80\x94 like Charlie Brown trying to kick Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s football \xe2\x80\x94 by G.O.P. claims of fiscal responsibility.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a reason the G.O.P. reveres Ronald Reagan and it\xe2\x80\x99s not because of his fiscal probity. As Garry Wills wrote in \xe2\x80\x9cReagan\xe2\x80\x99s America\xe2\x80\x9d:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cReagan nearly tripled the deficit in his eight years, and never made a realistic proposal for cutting it. As the biographer Lou Cannon noted, it was unfair for critics to say that Reagan was trying to balance the budget on the backs of the poor, since \xe2\x80\x98he never seriously attempted to balance the budget at all.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ll see and hear a lot of populist foolishness from the Republicans as 2011 and 2012 unfold, but their underlying motivation is always the same. They are about making the rich richer. Thus it was not at all surprising to read on Politico that the new head of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Fred Upton of Michigan, had hired a former big-time lobbyist for the hospital and pharmaceuticals industries to oversee health care issues.'b'I remember President Bush going on television in September 2008, looking almost dazed as he said to the American people, \xe2\x80\x9cOur entire economy is in danger.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Have we forgotten already who put us in such grave peril? Republicans benefit from the fact that memories are short and statutes of limitations shorter. It was the Republican leader in the House, Tom DeLay, who insisted against all reason and all the evidence of history that \xe2\x80\x9cnothing is more important in the face of war than cutting taxes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But that\xe2\x80\x99s all water under the bridge. The Republicans are back in control of the House, ready to run interference for the rich as recklessly and belligerently as ever.'b'The annual report on the federal judiciary by the chief justice of the United States is not a place you would normally go for political agitation. But that is just what Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. offered by using a portion of his year-end review to deplore the \xe2\x80\x9cacute difficulties\xe2\x80\x9d created for the justice system by the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s slowness in approving President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s nominees for federal judgeships.'b'Justice Roberts is right to be concerned that mounting federal court vacancies are creating crushing caseloads in some jurisdictions and hampering courts\xe2\x80\x99 ability to fulfill their vital role. Given his office, we understand why he did not point a partisan finger in his report. But he diluted his message a bit by suggesting that blame for this undermining of the judicial branch rests evenly with both parties. The main culprit is an unprecedented level of Republican obstructionism.'b'Democrats sought to block a handful of President George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s controversial nominees for circuit court seats,  but were open about stating their objections, and promptly allowed up or down votes on other nominees once approved by the Judiciary Committee.'b'In the last Congress, Republicans typically refused to publicly explain their opposition to individual nominees and their prolonged blockade of candidates who had cleared the committee either unanimously or with just a couple of negative votes. Between Congress\xe2\x80\x99s return from its August recess and the start of the lame duck session, Senate Republicans consented to vote on just a single judicial nomination.'b'Before adjourning, Senate Republicans allowed action on 19 well-qualified nominees \xe2\x80\x94 some of whom had been left in limbo for nearly a year after clearing the Judiciary Committee. That was welcome progress. But apart from partisan gamesmanship, there was no reason that Republicans held up these nominations for months only to unanimously approve nearly all of them in the waning days of the lame duck session.'b'Partisan obstruction was also the only plausible reason that Republicans declined to allow confirmation of 15 other nominees who were considered noncontroversial and were cleared by the committee after the November election. Those nominations have been returned to the president, ensuring further delays in filling seats when those individuals are renominated and a newly reconstituted Judiciary Committee must hold new hearings.'b'Four other nominees approved by the committee by a party-line vote were also denied Senate consideration. That list includes Goodwin Liu, a well-qualified law professor and legal scholar whose main problem for Republicans, it seems, is his potential to fill a future Supreme Court vacancy.'b'The dismal net result, laments Senator Patrick Leahy, the Judiciary Committee chairman, is that the Senate confirmed just 60 district and circuit court judges \xe2\x80\x94 the smallest number of judges for the first two years of a presidency in more than three decades.'b'The Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to give prompt consideration to noncontroversial nominees sets a terrible precedent. It gives Democrats something to consider as they weigh possible rules changes in the Senate to curb the auto-pilot filibusters and secret holds that mindlessly delay essential business, like the confirmation  of federal judicial nominees.'b'First there was the fresh snow, lying white and undisturbed all across New York. Then \xe2\x80\x94 if you were lucky \xe2\x80\x94 came the plowing, followed by the big melt last weekend, which turned the city into an archipelago surrounded by slush ponds. Now, where massive mounds of snow once rose, there are rising mounds of black garbage bags awaiting pickup by many of the same trucks that have been busy plowing streets.'b'Lying beside those curbside bags, abandoned, is a forest of firs, spruces and pines, for this is the week when the annual eviction of Christmas trees takes place. The trees looks utterly disconsolate \xe2\x80\x94 stripped of their lights, ornaments and tinsel and given the bum\xe2\x80\x99s rush to the curb. They even seem to have come unscented, so unlike the way they smelled when they stood in dense colonnades along the sidewalk only a few weeks ago. They announce emphatically that Christmas is over, New Year\xe2\x80\x99s is past. All that\xe2\x80\x99s missing is someone shouting \xe2\x80\x9cBring out your dead!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Christmas trees, that is.'b'In fact, these trees are good news. All the trees the city collects \xe2\x80\x94 nearly 125,000 last year \xe2\x80\x94 will be turned into compost and mulch for the city\xe2\x80\x99s parks, gardens  and playing fields. And if abandoning your tree on the curb feels too impersonal, you can take it to be chipped at one of dozens of city parks this weekend and walk away with a bag full of mulch.  Depressing as they look, those coniferous relics of this Christmas past may be the most environmentally sound part of the holidays. They ate carbon dioxide while they were growing, and now they carry it with them, into their new lives as mulch.'b'As of today, seven people have been charged in an insider-trading investigation focused on investors and consultants connected to Primary Global Research, an expert-network firm. The cases, brought by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, paint a disturbing picture of how some hedge funds have used this company to illegally procure information and distort the workings of a healthy financial market.'b'The prosecutions charge that insiders at major technology companies have masqueraded as consultants and \xe2\x80\x9csold out their employers by stealing and then peddling their valuable inside information\xe2\x80\x9d to hedge funds. In the complaints, Mr. Bharara charges that Primary Global has paid employees or their friends for inside tips, and charged hedge funds for making the match.'b'A decade ago, the Securities and Exchange Commission barred publicly traded companies from disclosing information selectively to favored investors. That regulation led to the growth of expert-network firms, with some providing access not only to outside experts but to employees of publicly traded companies with inside information.'b'Insider trading has always been hard to prove, and this middleman approach makes it even harder \xe2\x80\x94 providing plausible deniability to clients. A winning prosecution depends on establishing not only who knew what and when but also who knew that a tip came from a source breaching a duty of confidentiality.'b'Since October 2009, however, Mr. Bharara has secured guilty pleas from 21 people for insider trading and charged 18 others. He has used wiretaps, recordings, witness testimony and a lot of other evidence.'b'The case of Richard Choo-Beng Lee is particularly instructive. Mr. Lee, the founder of a once modestly profitable California hedge fund,  pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud and has cooperated with the prosecution since April 2009.'b'Mr. Lee has admitted using Primary Global to gain access to \xe2\x80\x9cconsultants\xe2\x80\x9d who had inside information about publicly traded companies. Through Primary Global, he established a tie to Mark Anthony Longoria, part of its network, who got financial information about Advanced Micro Devices from a friend who worked there, prosecutors say.'b'For the government, Mr. Lee recorded a call with Mr. Longoria in which he asked for \xe2\x80\x9ca quick rundown\xe2\x80\x9d on not-yet-public quarterly financials. Mr. Lee later told Primary Global that Mr. Longoria\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cestimate was spot on.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Longoria was paid $700 for that particular call, prosecutors say, and from January 2008 to March 2010, Primary Global paid \xe2\x80\x9cTony L.\xe2\x80\x9d over $200,000.'b'In the past, the government relied mainly on whistleblowers to warn them of insider-trading abuses,  and successful prosecutions were rare. Mr. Bharara\xe2\x80\x99s aggressive pursuit is welcome. A healthy financial market needs clear \xe2\x80\x94 and vigilantly enforced \xe2\x80\x94 rules on what\xe2\x80\x99s fairly researched information and what\xe2\x80\x99s an illegal tip.'b'Hungarians are justly proud of the way their country stood up to Soviet tanks in 1956 and helped breach the Iron Curtain with freer emigration in 1989. But they can take no pride in a new media law that took effect this week, just as Hungary took over the rotating presidency of the European Union.'b'The law, enacted by Prime Minister Viktor Orban\xe2\x80\x99s Fidesz Party, marks a sorry step back toward the kind of political censorship Hungary suffered under Communist rule. It should have no place in a democratic Europe. It creates a press supervision council, all members named by Fidesz, with authority to oversee all broadcast, print and Internet outlets and decide whether their coverage is \xe2\x80\x9cunbalanced,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cimmoral\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9coffensive to human dignity.\xe2\x80\x9d If the council disapproves, it can impose crippling fines of up to $1 million.'b'Mr. Orban\xe2\x80\x99s party, which won a two-thirds parliamentary majority last year, is not stopping there in its grab for power. It has been waging all-out war on the institutional checks and balances designed to protect democracy from domination by a single party.'b'Fidesz has already passed legislation limiting the powers of Hungary\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional court to review financial measures, including Mr. Orban\xe2\x80\x99s appropriation of pension funds to balance the budget. It has cut funding for the country\xe2\x80\x99s independent fiscal council and packed other important oversight posts with reliable party loyalists. Not content to stop there, Mr. Orban has named a council to rewrite Hungary\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution. Mr. Orban made his name in the late 1980s with his resistance to Soviet repression and his championing of an independent political life. Two decades later, he and his party appear to have forgotten those ideals.'b'The new press law has rightly drawn criticism from many other European leaders, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, leading members of the European Parliament, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the continent\xe2\x80\x99s monitor of electoral fairness. Mr. Orban, sounding like an old-style Soviet-bloc leader, dismissively retorted that "criticism from afar or from Western Europe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t frighten us."'b'Hungarians have refused to quietly fall in line. After Parliament passed the media law last month, several newspapers protested by publishing blank front pages. They deserve strong, continued international support. Mr. Orban may have forgotten, but Hungary\xe2\x80\x99s tragic history has taught its people that a free press \xe2\x80\x94 and a checked government \xe2\x80\x94 cannot be taken for granted.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Boomers Hit Another Milestone of Self-Absorption: Turning 65'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 1):'b'As a baby boomer, I object to your characterization of my generation.

And in one particularly self-important flourish, the new speaker, John Boehner, arranged to have his office staff \xe2\x80\x9csworn in\xe2\x80\x9d on Tuesday by the chief justice of the United States.'b'Those who had hoped to see a glimpse of the much-advertised Republican plan to revive the economy and put Americans back to work will have to wait at least until party leaders finish their Beltway insider ritual of self-glorification. Then, they may find time for governing.'b'The empty gestures are officially intended to set a new tone in Washington, to demonstrate \xe2\x80\x94 presumably to the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 Tea Party supporters \xe2\x80\x94 that things are about to be done very differently. But it is far from clear what message is being sent by, for instance, reading aloud the nation\xe2\x80\x99s foundational document. Is this group of Republicans really trying to suggest that they care more deeply about the Constitution than anyone else and will follow it more closely?'b'In any case, it is a presumptuous and self-righteous act, suggesting that they alone understand the true meaning of a text that the founders wisely left open to generations of reinterpretation. Certainly the Republican leadership is not trying to suggest that African-Americans still be counted as three-fifths of a person.'b'There is a similar air of vacuous fundamentalism in requiring that every bill cite the Constitutional power given to Congress to enact it. The new House leadership says this is necessary because the health care law and other measures that Republicans do not like have veered from the Constitution. But it is the judiciary that ultimately decides when a law is unconstitutional, not the transitory occupant of the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s chair.'b'All of this, though, is simply eyewash \xe2\x80\x94 the equivalent of a flag-draped background to a speech \xe2\x80\x94 compared with the actual legislation the Republicans plan to pass.

The bill tauntingly titled the \xe2\x80\x9cRepealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act\xe2\x80\x9d has nothing to do with increasing employment and will never reach the Senate floor, but shows that the leadership is willing to threaten the hard-fought access to health care for millions of the uninsured, just to make a political point.'b'On budgetary issues, the House Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 new rules bypass the chamber and even their own Budget Committee to give all power to set spending levels to the committee\xe2\x80\x99s new chairman, Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.

But there are far too many unanswered questions: Did the suspect act alone? Why did the Punjab police assign a religious conservative to protect Mr. Taseer? News reports first said nine bullets were fired into Mr. Taseer, and hospital officials later said he was hit 24 times. Yet other members of the security detail did not shoot to stop Mr. Qadri, who surrendered with his hands up.'b'Pakistani authorities need to investigate thoroughly and share their full findings with the Pakistani people.'b'The United States and the international community  must make clear their outrage over this killing. So must every Pakistani. The country\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders and the Pakistani media also need to consider whether the way they have shaped the debate on the blasphemy law \xe2\x80\x94 some have argued that mentioning reform is blasphemy punishable by death \xe2\x80\x94 is further fueling conflict.'b'Ultimately, only Pakistanis can save their nation, and they must answer the more profound questions: Do they want a country in which Muslims and non-Muslims can peacefully co-exist? Or one in which religious zealots, espousing the most intolerant interpretation of Islam, kill anyone brave enough to defend the defenseless? That would be the true blasphemy.'b'Justice Antonin Scalia has a knack for drawing unflattering light to himself and the Supreme Court. Recall, for example, when he refused to recuse himself from a case involving the energy task force run by Dick Cheney, his friend and duck-hunting companion, when Mr. Cheney was   vice president.'b'Justice Scalia is now getting attention for his outlandish view, expressed in an interview in the magazine California Lawyer, that the promise of equal protection in the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s 14th Amendment does not extend to protecting women against sex discrimination. Legislatures may outlaw sex discrimination, Justice Scalia suggested, but if they decided to enact laws sanctioning such unfair treatment, it would not be unconstitutional.'b'This is not the first time Justice Scalia has espoused this notion, and it generally tracks his jurisprudence in the area. Still, for a sitting member of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s highest court to be pressing such an antiquated view of women\xe2\x80\x99s rights is jarring, to say the least.'b'No less dismaying is his notion that women, gays  and other emerging minorities should be left at the mercy of the prevailing political majority when it comes to ensuring fair treatment. It is an \xe2\x80\x9coriginalist\xe2\x80\x9d approach wholly antithetical to the framers\xe2\x80\x99 understanding that vital questions of people\xe2\x80\x99s rights should not be left solely to the political process. It also disrespects the wording of the Equal Protection Clause, which is intentionally broad, and its purpose of ensuring a fairer society.'b'Fortunately, Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s views on women are not the law of the land.'b'In a slew of rulings since 1971, often with conservative justices in the majority, the Supreme Court has consistently rejected Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s constricted view of what the Constitution requires. It would be nice if he underscored that fact the next time he spoke out on the subject.'b'Manaf Hashim did not know who was threatening to kill him in the note left on the front door of his Baghdad home or in a message left on his cellphone two days later.

By preventing countries from testing smaller warheads and developing multiple-warhead missiles, the treaty makes defenses against such missiles easier.'b'The other concern, about sufficient financing for the United States nuclear establishment, was addressed in the context of New Start, and senators are therefore not likely to seek even more money when considering the test ban.'b'Dinshaw Mistry'b'\nCincinnati, Dec. 29, 2010'b''b''b'The writer is an associate professor of political science at the University of Cincinnati and the author of \xe2\x80\x9cContaining Missile Proliferation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'AS we all move forward with our New Year\xe2\x80\x99s resolutions, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good time to remember the promises our politicians have been making about the American mortgage market. The Obama administration, 'b'at a conference last August on the future of housing finance'b', pledged to have, come January, a plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage giants that are now wards of the government. Congressional Republicans, in their recent position paper, made an even bolder resolution: to build a mortgage market that \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not rely on government guarantees\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not make private investors and creditors wealthy while saddling taxpayers with losses.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This latter promise is pleasing populist rhetoric. The problem is, it may be neither politically nor practically feasible. Even if we forget about the gigantic near-term problem \xe2\x80\x94 namely, that the federal government is in the housing market mainly because most banks simply won\xe2\x80\x99t issue mortgages that can\xe2\x80\x99t be guaranteed by  Fannie, Freddie or the Federal Housing Administration \xe2\x80\x94 there\xe2\x80\x99s the fact that federal involvement in housing has been a constant since the 1930s. A market without government support  would almost certainly involve the demise (for most of middle-class America) of that populist favorite, the low-cost 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.'b'For a homeowner, a mortgage with a 30-year fixed rate (especially one that he can pay off early without a penalty) is a wonderful thing. For lenders and investors, however, it is a financial Frankenstein\xe2\x80\x99s monster, an unnatural product filled with the potential for losses. Absorbing some of the risk of those losses is a large part of what the government does in the housing market.'b'Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for instance, were created by the federal government to buy up mortgages from lenders, thereby enabling them  to turn around and issue more mortgages. Among other things, this allowed  the lenders  to get off their books the two kinds of risk that a mortgage carries. We\xe2\x80\x99re all now sadly familiar with one kind, credit risk \xe2\x80\x94 that is, the danger that a borrower won\xe2\x80\x99t pay back the mortgage. The second is interest-rate risk,   the danger that interest rates will rise sharply after the mortgage has been made, thereby burdening  the bank with money-losing loans. (Interest-rate risk was the root cause of the savings and  loan crisis.) The longer a mortgage lasts, the more difficult it is to manage both of these risks. And 30 years is an awfully long time.'b'With the advent of securitization, or the ability to package up mortgages and sell them off as securities, the market found some investors \xe2\x80\x94 bond funds, insurance companies and others \xe2\x80\x94 that were willing  to take on interest-rate risk. But even in those halcyon days when credit risk wasn\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to be an issue, the majority of investors still didn\xe2\x80\x99t want it. So Fannie and Freddie solved the problem by guaranteeing the payment on mortgages before the securities were sold off to investors. (In the non-government market, the ratings agencies provided a solution,  by stamping large pieces of securitizations with the supposedly ultrasafe triple-A rating.)'b'Today, credit risk is anathema, and by shouldering  it, Fannie and Freddie are propping up the housing market. The banks that make the mortgages don\xe2\x80\x99t want credit risk, and neither do investors. Indeed, William Gross, the co-founder and managing director of the investment firm Pimco, has said his funds wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t buy pools of so-called private label mortgages \xe2\x80\x94 those lacking a government guarantee \xe2\x80\x94 unless the homeowners involved had  made a down payment of at least  30 percent.'b'The proposed Fannie-Freddie reform that has gotten the most traction recently \xe2\x80\x94 various iterations of this have been endorsed by Hank Paulson, the former Treasury secretary, among others \xe2\x80\x94 calls for new private-sector entities that would continue to provide credit guarantees on mortgages. These guarantees would not be entirely private, however, because they would be explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.'b'There are various proposals for how this could be done with less risk to taxpayers than Fannie and Freddie pose,  but, obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99re still talking government involvement. And there\xe2\x80\x99s  something  perverse about creating  companies that would be saddled with exactly the same kind of risk \xe2\x80\x94 credit risk \xe2\x80\x94 that took down Fannie and Freddie in 2008. Furthermore,  we\xe2\x80\x99re kidding ourselves if we don\xe2\x80\x99t think that once the memory of the housing bubble begins to fade, these new creatures won\xe2\x80\x99t find themselves under political pressure to keep the price of their credit guarantees low, in order to help keep the price of the 30-year  mortgage low as well.'b'Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t a better solution be for banks and other financial institutions to offer mortgage products that they actually want to keep on their own books? Maybe these would take the form of 15-year mortgages with a rate that would be adjusted after five years so that the banks wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about long-term interest-rate risk. This might not even mean the disappearance of 30-year fixed-rate mortgages \xe2\x80\x94 the private market has historically provided them to consumers whose mortgages are too big to qualify for a Fannie and Freddie guarantee. But these are usually issued only to the  wealthiest, most credit-worthy consumers.'b'And therein lies the rub. Almost certainly, any 30-year product would be offered on a more limited basis and at a higher price than it is today. How much higher, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say. In the pre-crisis days, Fannie used to argue that its guarantee enabled consumers to pay one quarter to one half  of a percentage point less in annual interest on their mortgages;  today, Mr. Gross says that mortgages without a government guarantee would cost at least several percentage points more. If his numbers are right, then mortgages \xe2\x80\x94 and 30-year mortgages in particular \xe2\x80\x94 would be far more expensive, and the pool of American homebuyers would shrink.'b'This may well be the right long-term answer. After all, other countries manage fine without the widespread availability of 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. But is there an American politician alive who would accept responsibility for depressing the housing market further?'b'In any case, even a willingness to have more expensive mortgages would not  get the government out of the housing market completely. Recall that, before the bubble burst in 2007, the private sector didn\xe2\x80\x99t do much better than the government-sponsored entities at monitoring mortgage risk. What would happen years down the road if one of our increasingly large banks, one that is critical to the mortgage business, ran into trouble? Even assuming that we\xe2\x80\x99d solved the issue of allowing such banks to be too big to fail, there\xe2\x80\x99d still be deposit insurance. Taxpayers would still be on the hook.'b'So be wary of politicians bearing promises of a perfect world where average Americans can get the mortgages to which we now all feel entitled and the government is nowhere to be seen. It\xe2\x80\x99s a mirage.'b'John Boehner, the new speaker, promised the incoming House members of the 112th Congress on Wednesday to \xe2\x80\x9cgive the government back to the American people.\xe2\x80\x9d But away from the camera, the chamber\xe2\x80\x99s new Republican leadership is busy doing the opposite.'b'Darrell Issa of California, the new chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, 'b'has sent out letters'b' to 150 businesses and trade groups, asking them for suggestions on loosening what he called \xe2\x80\x9cjob-killing\xe2\x80\x9d corporate regulations.'b'This, of course, has nothing to do with Mr. Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s tearful populism and everything to do with the tens of millions in corporate dollars that helped propel the Republicans to power in the House. Businesses have complained about the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s expanded, and necessary, oversight of finance, health care and food production, among other areas. Now they have helped elect a House leadership that is eager to do their bidding.'b'Mr. Issa did not have to wait long for answers to his query. To cite just a few: Financial companies have protested the new controls on debit-card fees, which were enacted to save small businesses billions of dollars and to lower prices. Manufacturers said they did not like the proposed E.P.A. limits on greenhouse gas emissions, intended to begin addressing global warming. There were even complaints about the cost to business of proposed federal limits on how long truck drivers can be behind the wheel, which would save lives on the highway.'b'None of this should be surprising, especially coming from Mr. Issa, who has already made clear his intention to harass the Obama administration with \xe2\x80\x9cseven hearings a week, times 40 weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'One of his targets, he has said, would be the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is intended to curb some of the financial industry\xe2\x80\x99s worst practices and help head off another meltdown. Apparently he required no hearings or the slightest smidgen of evidence to declare that President Obama is \xe2\x80\x9cone of the most corrupt presidents in modern times,\xe2\x80\x9d even if he now claims that corrupt does not mean criminal.'b'The new Republican leaders love to insert the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cjob-killing\xe2\x80\x9d in front of everything they oppose, hoping it might mask their true intentions. Mr. Boehner has been speaker for just one day.

As a result, foreclosures continue to mount; many homeowners can\xe2\x80\x99t make their payments and are tempted to simply walk away from their debt. Meanwhile, the lenders and investors who own the loans are unwilling to work out a deal if, as is usually the case, it means losing money.'b'Fortunately, there is a solution. Rather than be at odds, homeowners and investors should partner in long-term equity-sharing arrangements.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s how it would work. Let\xe2\x80\x99s say a homeowner purchased a house in 2004 for $300,000 with no money down, and the property is now worth $150,000 \xe2\x80\x94 a 50 percent drop in value.'b'In an equity-sharing arrangement, the lender would write a new loan for $150,000, retire the original $300,000 loan and, to make up for that loss, take a 50 percent deeded ownership interest in the property. The homeowner would also agree to split 50 percent of the net proceeds of any future sale of the property with the lender. The new arrangement would also include a buyout provision, so that if the homeowner ever wanted to take over the lender\xe2\x80\x99s share, he would simply pay the lender a predetermined amount of cash.'b'Such a plan would be relatively easy to put in place, assuming the lender held the loan in its own portfolio. In most cases, however, lenders immediately sold their loans to investors and merely performed loan-servicing duties like collecting monthly payments and sending statements.'b'In those instances, the lender would have already made its money when the loan was originated, the proceeds from the new loan and the 50 percent deeded interest in the property would go to the investor, not the lender. The investor would also benefit from any future sale or when the homeowner exercised the buyout provision.'b'Equity-sharing would be a boon for everyone involved. Homeowners could stay in their houses and preserve their credit (assuming they stay current on the new loan). The neighborhood would avoid a foreclosure, which can depress property values. And the lender or investor could participate in the upside potential when the house eventually sells. Best of all, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cost taxpayers a dime.'b'A major reason the mortgage mess has gone on so long is that homeowners, lenders and investors assume their interests are at odds. An equity-sharing arrangement would bring all three onto the same side \xe2\x80\x94 and help solve America\xe2\x80\x99s foreclosure crisis.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Public Workers Facing Outrage in Budget Crisis'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 2):'b'Anyone who thinks unionized public employees are getting outrageous pay and benefits, and that this is the chief cause of state and municipal budget crises, should try living on a typical public employee\xe2\x80\x99s salary \xe2\x80\x94 or pension, for that matter.'b'Trust me, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t that great.

But he has also stuck to his vow to impose a property tax cap and a cap on increases in the state budget at the national inflation rate.'b'These caps sound frugal and sensible, but artificial caps on state spending are bad long-term policies, and the real estate tax cap will punish poorer communities where facilities deteriorate because homeowners will not agree to pay more taxes.'b'Mr. Cuomo cut his own salary by 5 percent, and asked for a wage freeze for most state workers for a year. That would make more budgetary sense if he did not seem so inclined to eliminate the income tax surcharge on people making more than $200,000 a year.'b'Mr. Cuomo has been talking a lot about returning to a time when New York\xe2\x80\x99s government was the model for other states. As he well knows, that is a high bar.'b'To the Editor:'b'Thanks to The New York Times for its longstanding editorial support of ridding the Hudson River of PCBs discharged by General Electric, including your Dec. 28 editorial \xe2\x80\x9c'b'A Great Day for the River'b',\xe2\x80\x9d recognizing the benefits of G.E.\xe2\x80\x99s long-overdue commitment to complete the project.'b'The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 95 percent of the health-threatening chemical will be removed from areas targeted for dredging, making the river healthier for all and promising a rebirth of the upriver economy.'b'We salute our partners \xe2\x80\x94 including the Natural Resources Defense Council, Riverkeeper, Clearwater, Sierra Club, state, federal and local officials, and citizens \xe2\x80\x94 who have fought along with us for a cleaner river for three decades.'b'We will remain vigilant until this phase is complete and until G.E. cleans up the contaminated flood plains, for which a remedial plan has yet to be defined.'b'Remarkably G.E. has just taken formal action to continue its longstanding challenge of the constitutionality of the federal Superfund law by asking the Supreme Court to hear its appeal of the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of its claim.'b'The Supreme Court should refuse to hear the case, and G.E. should drop it \xe2\x80\x94 to save taxpayer dollars better spent ensuring that the E.P.A.\xe2\x80\x99s cleanup goals are met.'b'Ned Sullivan'b' President, Scenic Hudson'b' Poughkeepsie, N.Y., Dec. 30, 2010'b''b''b'Nearly a year after the earthquake in Haiti, more than one million people are still living in tents and reconstruction has barely begun  \xe2\x80\x94 and that\xe2\x80\x99s a useful reminder of the limitations of charity and foreign aid.'b'Private and public donations saved lives in Haiti, no question. But it\xe2\x80\x99s also true that well-meaning bleeding-hearts tend to exaggerate the impact aid typically has on a country. Those nations that have managed to lift themselves out of poverty have done so mostly with trade, not aid  \xe2\x80\x94 with giving people jobs and a ladder, not handouts and an elevator.'b'On the other hand, stony-hearts mistakenly surrender hope. They see Haiti  \xe2\x80\x94 or Africa  \xe2\x80\x94 as a bottomless pit, a perennial hell impervious to progress. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t match reality either.'b'So let me guide you to a village in the Haitian interior where I recently saw an aid program making a difference  \xe2\x80\x94 by helping people help themselves. There are many variants of such programs around the world, but this one is run by 'b'Fonkoze'b', a peasant bank that is one of the most admired aid organizations in Haiti. It was founded by a local Catholic priest, Father Joseph Philippe, who then recruited an American management consultant, Anne Hastings, to run it. Ms. Hastings went to Haiti for a temporary visit in 1995.  She is still there.'b'On a hillside in central Haiti, I met Odecile Jean, a 35-year-old woman with five children, ages 5 to 15. When she entered the Fonkoze program, none of her children were in school, and she had no farm animals. The family lived day to day, surviving on odd jobs.'b'Yet after 13 months in the 18-month-long program, Ms. Jean beamed as she showed off her brand new cow, discussed her thriving lumber business and boasted that her children were all in school. Her husband, Lionel, hinted of ambitions for them to go to college.'b'This transformation began when the couple\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccaseworker,\xe2\x80\x9d a stern young Haitian named Pascale Joseph, insisted that the family start three separate businesses so as to have a reliable way of making a living. They discussed several possibilities and decided to focus on buying logs and sawing them into lumber. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard work, but profitable.'b'The family also entered the livestock business, with a couple of goats, and the chicken industry, starting with four newborn chicks. Mr. Joseph helped them build pens and advised them on caring for the animals. He also helped them plant 15 mango trees so they could sell fruit in the market.'b'I asked Ms. Jean how her chicken eggs tasted, and she looked scandalized. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to eat these eggs,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to use them to raise more chicks.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ms. Hastings beamed when she heard that. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s getting in the habit of reinvesting, which is good.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In exchange for the help they receive, participants like Ms. Jean must show that they can save money and invest it wisely to grow their businesses. Participants also must send children to school and adopt family planning.'b'To reduce malnutrition, participants are obliged to feed their children at least two hot meals a day. My kids were with me on this trip to Haiti, and they looked with interest at Ms. Jean\xe2\x80\x99s list of obligations posted on her door.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDad,\xe2\x80\x9d my 16-year-old son pointed out, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t always get two hot meals a day.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Whether in America or Haiti, poverty is sometimes linked to self-destructive behaviors that lock families into unending cycles of penury. Caseworkers shatter those cycles, partly by ensuring that earnings go to education rather than  alcohol.'b'Mr. Joseph, the caseworker, explained: \xe2\x80\x9cI say, \xe2\x80\x98Every day you go out and drink and smoke, that\xe2\x80\x99s another day that your child can\xe2\x80\x99t go to school or eat.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Granted, things don\xe2\x80\x99t always work smoothly. In a different village, I met a 20-year-old single mother in the program who had let baby goats die of negligence, and who celebrated her first earnings by buying a makeup kit. But after hounding by the caseworker, the young woman has gotten the hang of supporting her children, and is exhilarated by new possibilities.'b'What Haiti needs above all these days is these kinds of livelihoods for its people, not just shipments of food and clothing. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to think of a charitable project that will be as beneficial as the Coca-Cola Company\xe2\x80\x99s decision to build up the mango juice industry in Haiti, supporting 25,000 farmers. The same is true of the move by South Korean garment companies to open factories in Haiti.'b'I strongly believe that we have a moral obligation to address extreme poverty around the world. But sometimes the best way to discharge that obligation isn\xe2\x80\x99t charity in the old-fashioned sense of handouts, but rather helping people like Ms. Jean find their own ways to support their families.'b'They\xe2\x80\x99re back! As has been frequently noted, the first day of a new Congress is very much like the first day of school. Except for the part where it\xe2\x80\x99s on TV and the fate of the largest economy on the planet hangs in the balance.'b'But when the 112th Congress opened on Wednesday, you definitely had a lot of excited new faces. The House of Representatives is flooded with freshmen, some of whom will embark upon a career of service that will allow them to remain in office for the next 20 years without ever impinging on our consciousness a single time.'b'Others are pretty clearly gunning to become household names, like Representative Allen West, a Republican from Florida, who began his Congressional career by picking, for his top aide, a radio talk show host known for her colorful gift of gab. (\xe2\x80\x9cIf ballots don\xe2\x80\x99t work, bullets will.\xe2\x80\x9d) Her employment was very brief, very stormy, and filled with questions about whether it was really a good idea to suggest that illegal immigrants be hanged and sent home in a box. Looking back on the episode, West assured a Fox interviewer, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t learn anything from it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The House on Wednesday was all about change, change, change, beginning, of course, with the new speaker. \xe2\x80\x9cBe it providence or destiny, a man of uniquely American values has been called,\xe2\x80\x9d intoned Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas in a nominating speech for John Boehner. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has lived the American dream and will protect it for our posterity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Nononono'b', Representative Hensarling! You do not want to talk about John Boehner and the American dream, because he will start to cry and we\xe2\x80\x99ll never get through this.'b'Sure enough, Boehner pulled out a handkerchief. But decorum was maintained.'b'Boehner began his tenure by promising more transparency, \xe2\x80\x9ca free exchange of ideas,\xe2\x80\x9d the chance to offer amendments on the floor and \xe2\x80\x9copen debate.\xe2\x80\x9d Also, of course, there would be lots of budget-cutting, and sponsors of bills are going to have to show how to pay for them.'b'His speech was noninflammatory, in keeping with his new role as a guy who everyone is beginning, in desperation, to tag as a potential bridge-builder. As Politico recently reported, Boehner hopes to model himself after Nicholas Longworth, a powerful speaker from the 1920s who also came from Ohio. Longworth is best remembered for having an office building named after him, and definitely not at all remembered for allowing a free exchange of ideas and open debate. But at least Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s not promising to be like Ronald Reagan.'b'After the reform rules are approved, the House will move on to the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 first order of business, repeal of the health care reform law. The new rules would, in theory, require that the sponsors explain how to replace the $100 billion that the Congressional Budget Office says the law will save over the next 10 years. But this one does not have to be paid for, because the new majority feels the Congressional Budget Office is wrong. Anyhow, they won the election.'b'Also, there will be no amendments.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to cut the new leadership a little slack. If you\xe2\x80\x99re going to bring up a wildly partisan and totally symbolic bill, there really isn\xe2\x80\x99t any point in fooling around with cost estimates and opposition amendments. It would be like putting up warning signs for the wolves before you shoot them from a small plane.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s wait to see what the new House majority does on its much-vaunted promise to immediately cut $100 billion  \xe2\x80\x94 or up to 30 percent  \xe2\x80\x94 of discretionary domestic spending this very year.'b'Although, House aides told The Times\xe2\x80\x99s Jackie Calmes, maybe you should make that $50 billion. Whatever. Boehner has definitely gotten the ball rolling by cutting Congress\xe2\x80\x99s own budget by 2.6 percent.'b'Meanwhile, over in the Senate, the thought of change was also in the air. \xe2\x80\x9cThey say you can never step in the same river twice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Majority Leader Harry Reid, who went on to assure his listeners that it was also not possible to step in the same Senate twice.'b'There was lots of discussion of reform in the Senate, too, and the chamber jumped into a vigorous debate on Democratic proposals to change the rules. The plan would decimate several venerable traditions, like the one that allows one senator to bring all progress on a bill or a nomination to a screeching halt without having to reveal his or her identity.'b'Everybody is now going home for two weeks to think about it.'b'This sort of change can only be made on the first day of business, but fortunately, Reid has invoked a special rule that allows him to keep the chamber at opening day until the end of the month. This is something that happens only in the United States Senate and early episodes of \xe2\x80\x9cStar Trek.\xe2\x80\x9d We are waiting to see if the senators continue to age while time stands still.'b'Christians are increasingly under siege in Egypt and Iraq. Over the past year, hundreds have been killed or wounded in attacks, and the violence is further raising political and sectarian tensions in the two countries. All people, regardless of their beliefs, should be outraged.'b'The latest incident in Egypt occurred in Alexandria on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day. Twenty-three  people were killed and nearly 100 wounded in a bombing after a midnight Mass at a Coptic Christian church. Since then, there have been three days of unrest as Coptic Christians have taken  to the street to protest and demand government protection.'b'Egypt often tries to keep a lid on things by blaming foreign actors for Muslim-on-Christian violence, and President Hosni Mubarak quickly pinned the attack on \xe2\x80\x9cforeign fingers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Officials later said local Egyptians might also have been involved. Authorities need to find and prosecute all who were responsible.'b'Unfortunately, extremists have fertile ground in Egypt, where tolerance and diversity were once prized. The Mubarak government has a longstanding policy of repressing Muslim fundamentalists, further radicalizing these groups. And, as its political support has waned, it has sought to pander to the Muslim majority by discriminating against other religions \xe2\x80\x94 especially Coptic Christians, who are about 10 percent of the population, and the smaller Bahai community.'b'Meanwhile, thousands of Christians have fled Iraq since an October siege at a Baghdad church that killed 51 worshipers and two priests, and a subsequent series of bombings and assassinations singling out Christians. The Islamic State of Iraq, a group affiliated with Al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for the church attack and has threatened more to come.'b'Iraqi leaders, including Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, have pledged to tighten security and have appealed for tolerance for minority faiths. They also need to ensure that the attackers are brought to justice. Extremist attacks must not become an excuse for more authoritarianism in either Iraq or Egypt. But if the two governments do not bring things under control and provide security for all of their citizens, their once richly diverse societies will suffer. Mr. Mubarak and Mr. Maliki need to find the right balance, quickly.'b'Next month, you will be able to buy the single- volume NewSouth Edition of Mark Twain\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAdventures of Huckleberry Finn,\xe2\x80\x9d edited by Professor Alan Gribben of Auburn University at Montgomery. It differs from other editions of those books because Mr. Gribben has turned the word \xe2\x80\x9cnigger\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 as used by Tom and Huck \xe2\x80\x94 into \xe2\x80\x9cslave.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Gribben has also changed \xe2\x80\x9cInjun\xe2\x80\x9d to Indian.'b'Mr. Gribben says he wants to make these American classics readable again \xe2\x80\x94 for young readers and for anyone who is hurt by the use of an epithet that would have been ubiquitous in Missouri in the 1830s and 1840s, which is when both books are set. He says he discovered how much Twain\xe2\x80\x99s language offended readers when he began giving talks about \xe2\x80\x9cTom Sawyer\xe2\x80\x9d all across Alabama in 2009. He has also acknowledged that what he calls \xe2\x80\x9ctextual purists\xe2\x80\x9d will be horrified by his sanitized versions of the two classics.'b'We are horrified, and we think most readers, textual purists or not, will be horrified too. The trouble isn\xe2\x80\x99t merely adulterating Twain\xe2\x80\x99s text. It\xe2\x80\x99s also adulterating social, economic and linguistic history. Substituting the word \xe2\x80\x9cslave\xe2\x80\x9d makes it sound as though all the offense lies in the \xe2\x80\x9cn-word\xe2\x80\x9d and has nothing to do with the institution of slavery. Worse, it suggests that understanding the truth of the past corrupts modern readers, when, in fact, this new edition is busy corrupting the past.'b'When \xe2\x80\x9cHuckleberry Finn\xe2\x80\x9d was published, Mark Twain appended a note on his effort to reproduce \xe2\x80\x9cpainstakingly\xe2\x80\x9d the dialects in the book, including several backwoods dialects and \xe2\x80\x9cthe Missouri negro dialect.\xe2\x80\x9d What makes \xe2\x80\x9cHuckleberry Finn\xe2\x80\x9d so important in American literature isn\xe2\x80\x99t just the story, it\xe2\x80\x99s the richness, the detail, the unprecedented accuracy of its spoken language. There is no way to \xe2\x80\x9cclean up\xe2\x80\x9d Twain without doing irreparable harm to the truth of his work.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Looking Back'b',\xe2\x80\x9d by Verlyn Klinkenborg (The Rural Life, Jan. 2):'b'As the daughter of a Swiss farrier growing up in a tiny village in the 1940s, I felt a deep nostalgia to hear again my father\xe2\x80\x99s precise sound of shoeing the large draft horses standing patiently in front of his forge.

Next year, why not spare them the trouble, and give cash instead?'b'It makes economic sense \xe2\x80\x94 many economists see cash as the most efficient gift, because it allows recipients to choose exactly what they want.'b'But this horrifies traditionalists, who see giving cash for Christmas as the ultimate commodification of a sacred ritual. Money is acceptable for charitable donations or bonuses, but certainly not for friends or family.'b'It turns out that both the economic realists who give money as presents and the traditionalists have history on their side, because this is a debate that began back in the early 20th century. As the consumer society expanded and Americans began giving more Christmas presents to more people, money emerged as an acceptable gift. Christmas money, according to a 1912 issue of Ladies\xe2\x80\x99 Home Journal, \xe2\x80\x9csupplies dearly cherished wishes, adds small luxuries, prevents worriment and gives opportunities for helpfulness as no other gift does.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But how was a recipient to know that a dollar was a gift dollar? That something made of the same legal tender used to buy the daily newspaper, tip waiters and bribe politicians was in fact a gift expressing personal affection?'b'The challenges of giving money were captured by this 1920s vaudeville act:'b''b'HE'b' It\xe2\x80\x99s bad form for a person to leave the price mark on a gift, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?'b''b'SHE'b' Yes, and I knew a woman who was so absent-minded that when she gave a $50 bill for a Christmas gift, she tried to rub the price mark off of it. ... She was giving the $50 bill to her married daughter, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t want her to know how much it was worth.'b''b'HE'b' And what did her married daughter do with the $50 bill, when she got it?'b''b'SHE'b' She took the money, and paid the grocer what she owed him.'b''b'HE'b' And what did her mother do?'b''b'SHE'b' Her mother cried, and said, although she loved to give a Christmas present, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much fun in paying her son-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s grocery bill.'b'The key to the problem, early 20th-century gift-givers found, was to camouflage money inside a traditional gift. This took effort and it had nothing to do with efficiency, but it enabled people to elevate the gift of cash.'b'In the December 1909 Ladies\xe2\x80\x99 Home Journal, for instance, the writer Lou Eleanor Colby said she had found a way to \xe2\x80\x9cdisguise the money so that it would not seem just like a commercial transaction.\xe2\x80\x9d    She explained how she had incorporated $10 for her mother into artwork. She inserted dollar bills into two posters; one showed five sad bills not knowing where to go, and the other depicted the happy ending: \xe2\x80\x9cfive little dollars speeding joyfully\xe2\x80\x9d toward her mother\xe2\x80\x99s purse.'b'Housewives hid gold coins in cookies and boxes of candies; dollar bills could decorate belt-buckles or picture frames. Women boasted when the recipient failed to realize that the actual present was money. Men also disguised the money they gave to their wives as gifts, to distinguish it from their allowances. If you give her a check, The Ladies\xe2\x80\x99 Home Journal advised, \xe2\x80\x9cput it in an embroidered purse, or a leather sewing basket or a jewel box which will be a little gift in itself.\xe2\x80\x9d The better the disguise, the more successful the gift.'b'Then, in 1910, American Express began advertising money orders as an \xe2\x80\x9cacceptable Christmas gift.\xe2\x80\x9d Western Union improved on the idea by creating distinctive telegrams for sending money for special occasions,  while greeting card companies started selling decorative money holders for birthdays and holidays.'b'After 1905, department stores even designed a new currency: gift certificates. Also called merchandise coupons or gift bonds, these were for a specific sum of money to be spent either on a designated type of merchandise \xe2\x80\x94 gloves and shoes were popular items \xe2\x80\x94 or, as today, on anything at all at a particular store.'b'We can\xe2\x80\x99t all be as clever as Lou Eleanor Colby, but buying a gift card that restricts what the money can be used for is just another way of distinguishing gift money from regular money, and a way for givers to demonstrate their intimate knowledge of what the recipient likes and cares about.'b'Nostalgic traditionalists and hard-nosed realists both get it wrong. For over a century, Americans have been demonstrating remarkable ingenuity in turning money into meaningful personal gifts. Let\xe2\x80\x99s keep it up. Next year, perhaps take a lesson from the pages of The Ladies\xe2\x80\x99 Home Journal and hide cash in a gift of your own creation.'b'The health care reform law was signed 10 months ago, and what\xe2\x80\x99s striking now is how vulnerable it looks. Several threats have emerged \xe2\x80\x94 some of them scarcely discussed before passage \xe2\x80\x94 that together or alone could seriously endanger the new system. These include:'b''b'The courts.'b' So far, one judge has struck down the individual mandate, the plan\xe2\x80\x99s centerpiece. Future decisions are likely to break down on partisan lines. Given the makeup of the Supreme Court, this should concern the law\xe2\x80\x99s defenders.'b''b'False projections.'b' The new system is based on a series of expert projections on how people will behave. In the first test case, these projections were absurdly off base. According to the Medicare actuary, 375,000 people should have already signed up for the new high-risk pools for the uninsured, but only 8,000 have.'b'More seriously, cost projections are way off. For example, New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s plan has only about 80 members, but the state has already burned through nearly double the $650,000 that the federal government allotted to help run the program. If other projections are off by this much, the results will be disastrous.'b''b'Employee dumping.'b' This is the most serious threat. Companies and unions across America are running the numbers and discovering they would be better off if, after 2014, they induced poorer and sicker employees to move to public insurance exchanges, where subsidies are much higher.'b'The number of people in those exchanges could thus skyrocket, especially as startup companies undermine their competitors with uninsured employees and lower costs. The Congressional Budget Office projects that 19 million people will move to the exchanges at a cost of $450 billion between 2014 and 2019. But according to the economists Douglas Holtz-Eakin and James C. Capretta, costs could soar to $1.4 trillion if those who would be better off in the exchanges actually moved to them. The price of the health care law could double. 'b'C. Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute'b', who has been among those raising the alarms about this, calls the law\xe2\x80\x99s structure \xe2\x80\x9cunworkable and unfair.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Health care oligarchy.'b' Since the law passed, there has been a frenzy of mergers and acquisitions, as hospitals, clinics and doctor groups have joined together into bigger and bigger entities. The drafters encourage this, believing large outfits would be more efficient. The downside to this economic concentration is there could be less competition and cost control. In many places, the political power of these quasi-monopolies would be huge, with unforeseeable results. The law bans doctors from starting up hospitals to increase competition.'b''b'Public hostility.'b' Right now about 53 percent of Americans oppose the health care law and 43 percent support it, according to an average of the recent polls. Complaints are especially high among doctors. According to a survey by the Physicians Foundation, 60 percent of private practice doctors say the law will force them to close their practices or to restrict them to certain categories of patients.'b'Given this level of unhappiness, people will blame the Obama law for everything they hate about the health care system. Political opposition was fierce last November, and it could easily shape the 2012 election and lead to changes or repeal.'b'Over all, there is a strong likelihood that the current health care law will face an existential threat over the next five years. Each party should be preparing contingency plans.'b'When the crisis comes, Democrats will face an interesting choice \xe2\x80\x94 to patch the Obama system or try to replace it with something bigger. The administration may want a patch, but by a ratio of nearly 2 to 1, according to a CNN poll, Democratic voters would prefer a more ambitious law. Liberals could logically say that the mistake was trying to create a hybrid system, rather than moving straight to a single-payer one.'b'Republicans are going to have to move beyond their current \xe2\x80\x9cRepeal!\xe2\x80\x9d posture and cohere behind a positive alternative. One approach, which Tyler Cowen of George Mason University has written about, is to allow more state experimentation. Another approach, championed by Capretta, 'b'Yuval Levin'b' of National Affairs and 'b'Thomas P. Miller'b' of the American Enterprise Institute, revolves around the words \xe2\x80\x9cdefined contribution.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Under this approach, Republicans would say that the federal government has a role in subsidizing health insurance \xe2\x80\x94 a generous role, but not unlimited. The government would provide needy citizens with a predefined amount of money to spend on insurance and allow them to shop in a transparent, regulated, but not micromanaged marketplace.'b'After the trauma of the last two years, many people wish the issue would go away. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not going away, especially since costs will continue to rise.'b'Some Congresses achieve health care; members of this Congress or the next one will have health care thrust upon them.'b'New Haven'b'FIFTY years ago this week, President Dwight D. Eisenhower\xe2\x80\x99s administration 'b'broke off diplomatic relations'b' with Fidel Castro\xe2\x80\x99s government, placing Cuba in the middle of the cold war and changing my life, and that of many of my fellow Cubans, forever.'b'By January 1961, I had spent a year and a half in Tampa, Fla., where relatives of mine had lived since the 1930s, and where my parents had settled us in 1959, planning to spend as much time as it took for life to return to normal in Cuba, or perhaps to stay.'b'I was 17 and had gone back to the island about six times. This was because I had left behind my girlfriend, Mercy, and also because I could not get used to American life, particularly teenage mores, which I found silly. (\xe2\x80\x9cTeenager\xe2\x80\x9d did not exist as a role in Cuban culture.) I saved every penny from my various jobs as dishwasher and bag-boy to buy those plane tickets.'b'But with the diplomatic rupture, my travels were over. Though I did not know it at the time, Eisenhower\xe2\x80\x99s decision turned me into an exile. I would not set foot on Cuba again for 18 years, when I went with a committee of exiles to discuss the release of political prisoners.'b'Though many Cubans in circumstances similar to mine became American citizens at the first opportunity, wisely aware that their displacement was permanent, I refused to do so because I na\xc3\xafvely associated citizenship and nationality. I clung to my Cuban citizenship, though my Cuban passport soon expired, and as a \xe2\x80\x9cpermanent resident\xe2\x80\x9d of the United States had to travel abroad using a re-entry permit, an awkward document that gave proof, among other things, that I had paid my taxes. Travel through Europe and Latin America required an assortment of visas, but I thought the difficulties were worth it because they allowed me to preserve my identity.'b'I also latched on to my native culture by making the study of Spanish and Latin American literature my life\xe2\x80\x99s work, and in a sense I relived my traumatic acquisition of English as a teenager by learning French and Italian at the University of South Florida with pathological zeal. When I spoke those languages I assumed new personae; they were shields against an American culture I still could not quite absorb. Instead of freezing me into a role, the 1961 break in relations between my two countries transformed me into a man with several voices within my own head, a perspective that has informed my literary criticism, I believe.'b'Now I am safely far from what I derisively call (to tease my American children and grandchildren) \xe2\x80\x9cteenagehood in America.\xe2\x80\x9d I am a citizen of the United States, rejoicing in this country\xe2\x80\x99s democracy which, for all its faults, is the best form of government to which we can aspire. Fifty years after the break in relations, while Cuba is still ruled by a male, white, militaristic, totalitarian gerontocracy, Barack Obama is the president of the United States and Hillary Clinton the secretary of state. Which of my two countries is the revolutionary one?'b'In that half-century, Fidel and Ra\xc3\xbal Castro have managed to run into the ground what was a prosperous country, to drive a million and a half of its citizens into exile and to fill the jails with political and common prisoners. Recent changes in the Cuban economy, conciliatory gestures toward the church and the release and deportation of some political prisoners show that the Castros are aware of the instability of their system \xe2\x80\x94 which Fidel Castro not long ago 'b'blurted out'b' does not even work in Cuba.'b'The one change that they have not dared to make, however, is to remove fear from Cuban life, because it is the glue that holds together their government. Fear of being accused by a neighbor who belongs to one of the vigilante Committees for the Defense of the Revolution; fear that the secret police will find something to incriminate you; fear that you will be jailed without charges for months or even years; fear that the government-sponsored mobs called Rapid Response Brigades will stage a violent rejection rally in front of your house (as has happened to the mother of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, 'b'the dissident who died during his prison hunger strike'b' last February); fear that you will be denied your request to travel abroad; fear that you will lose your job; fear, in short, that the long arm of power will reach down to you and smite you.'b'I am very happy to be here, free from all of those fears and hoping against reason that the next historical break in Cuba will not be a violent one, and that it will bring about a future of peace, prosperity and democracy.'b'With no more flights to Havana, and having met other girls, I wrote Mercy a letter in 1961 breaking up. I still feel shame for having done this. She came to Miami with her family shortly thereafter and we had an emotional meeting in Tampa when they visited us. But it was over. I have been told that this delicate, petite piano player who wanted to be a kindergarten teacher married a pilot, learned to fly a plane (coincidentally, so did I) and even does sky diving (I would never).'b'It is a constant of history: political decisions affect ordinary lives in unexpected and often permanent ways.'b'These are tough times for state governments. Huge deficits loom almost everywhere, from California to New York, from New Jersey to Texas.'b'Wait  \xe2\x80\x94 Texas? Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Texas supposed to be thriving even as the rest of America suffered? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t its governor declare, during his re-election campaign, that \xe2\x80\x9cwe have billions in surplus\xe2\x80\x9d? Yes, it was, and yes, he did. But reality has now intruded, in the form of a deficit expected to run as high as $25 billion over the next two years.'b'And that reality has implications for the nation as a whole. For Texas is where the modern conservative theory of budgeting  \xe2\x80\x94 the belief that you should never raise taxes under any circumstances, that you can always balance the budget by cutting wasteful spending  \xe2\x80\x94 has been implemented most completely. If the theory can\xe2\x80\x99t make it there, it can\xe2\x80\x99t make it anywhere.'b'How bad is the Texas deficit? Comparing budget crises among states is tricky, for technical reasons. Still, data from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities suggest that the Texas budget gap is worse than New York\xe2\x80\x99s, about as bad as California\xe2\x80\x99s, but not quite up to New Jersey levels.'b'The point, however, is that just the other day Texas was being touted as a role model (and still is by commentators who haven\xe2\x80\x99t been keeping up with the news). It was the state the recession supposedly passed by, thanks to its low taxes and business-friendly policies. Its governor boasted that its budget was in good shape thanks to his \xe2\x80\x9ctough conservative decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Oh, and at a time when there\xe2\x80\x99s a full-court press on to demonize public-sector unions as the source of all our woes, Texas is nearly demon-free: less than 20 percent of public-sector workers there are covered by union contracts, compared with almost 75 percent in New York.'b'So what happened to the \xe2\x80\x9cTexas miracle\xe2\x80\x9d many people were talking about even a few months ago?'b'Part of the answer is that reports of a recession-proof state were greatly exaggerated. It\xe2\x80\x99s true that Texas job losses haven\xe2\x80\x99t been as severe as those in the nation as a whole since the recession began in 2007. But Texas has a rapidly growing population \xe2\x80\x94 largely, suggests Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s Edward Glaeser, because its liberal land-use and zoning policies have kept housing cheap. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong with that; but given that rising population, Texas needs to create jobs more rapidly than the rest of the country just to keep up with a growing work force.'b'And when you look at unemployment, Texas doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem particularly special: its unemployment rate is below the national average, thanks in part to high oil prices, but it\xe2\x80\x99s about the same as the unemployment rate in New York or Massachusetts.'b'What about the budget? The truth is that the Texas state government has relied for years on smoke and mirrors to create the illusion of sound finances in the face of a serious \xe2\x80\x9cstructural\xe2\x80\x9d budget deficit \xe2\x80\x94 that is, a deficit that persists even when the economy is doing well. When the recession struck, hitting revenue in Texas just as it did everywhere else, that illusion was bound to collapse.'b'The only thing that let Gov. Rick Perry get away, temporarily, with claims of a surplus was the fact that Texas enacts budgets only once every two years, and the last budget was put in place before the depth of the economic downturn was clear. Now the next budget must be passed \xe2\x80\x94 and Texas may have a $25 billion hole to fill. Now what?'b'Given the complete dominance of conservative ideology in Texas politics, tax increases are out of the question. So it has to be spending cuts.'b'Yet Mr. Perry wasn\xe2\x80\x99t lying about those \xe2\x80\x9ctough conservative decisions\xe2\x80\x9d: Texas has indeed taken a hard, you might say brutal, line toward its most vulnerable citizens. Among the states, Texas ranks near the bottom in education spending per pupil, while leading the nation in the percentage of residents without health insurance. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine what will happen if the state tries to eliminate its huge deficit purely through further cuts.'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how the mess in Texas will end up being resolved. But the signs don\xe2\x80\x99t look good, either for the state or for the nation.'b'Right now, triumphant conservatives in Washington are declaring that they can cut taxes and still balance the budget by slashing spending. Yet they haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to do that even in Texas, which is willing both to impose great pain (by its stinginess on health care) and to shortchange the future (by neglecting education). How are they supposed to pull it off nationally, especially when the incoming Republicans have declared Medicare, Social Security and defense off limits?'b'People used to say that the future happens first in California, but these days what happens in Texas is probably a better omen. And what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing right now is a future that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work.'b'Members of the House might have thought they were bringing the Constitution alive by reading it aloud on Thursday. But they made a crucial error by excising its history. When they chose to deliberately drop the sections that became obsolete or offensive, and which were later amended, they missed a chance to demonstrate that this document is not nailed to the door of the past. It remains vital precisely because it can be reimagined.'b'Having decided to spend their first moments in power proclaiming their devotion to the Constitution, Republican leaders might at least have read the whole thing. The part, for instance, where slaves \xe2\x80\x9cbound to service\xe2\x80\x9d are counted as three-fifths of a person. The part where fugitive slaves cannot gain their freedom by escaping to a free state. Or the part where ordinary citizens do not  actually get a direct vote for their senator.'b'All these provisions were written by a group of men that many in the Tea Party and elsewhere seem to consider infallible and nearly divine. The Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s words are a stirring proclamation of freedom across the ages. But some passages are artifacts of their time.'b'Incensed by this rewriting of history, Representative Jesse Jackson Jr., Democrat of Illinois, arose just before the reading to remind the House of what it was redacting. African-Americans and women struggled for decades to be granted the right to vote, he said, and those struggles are clearly reflected in the text. \xe2\x80\x9cMany of us don\xe2\x80\x99t want that to be lost upon the reading of our sacred document,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'But imperfection and change were not the point. The reading was conceived so that Republicans could demonstrate their fidelity to the document and make it seem as though Democrats had abandoned it. After protests, the leadership invited Democrats to join them, and many of them did. It was a stirring moment when John Lewis of Georgia, an icon of the civil rights movement, read to great applause the 13th Amendment, abolishing slavery.'b'That was about all that was stirring. Because so many members wanted a piece of the action, the text\xe2\x80\x99s momentum was broken up by an endless parade of flat, one-sentence recitations, and many lawmakers later returned to their BlackBerrys or left the chamber.'b'The Constitution deserves better than this airless exercise. It was a work of political genius, largely because its authors handed its interpretation to the open minds of posterity. The effect of Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s reading, in case anyone was actually paying attention, was to wrongly suggest that the document was seamless and perfect, as if carved in marble rather than stained with sweat and American blood.'b'Gov. Andrew Cuomo struck just the right tone on both adult prison reform and juvenile justice reform in his first State of the State address on Wednesday. He said that New York could no longer afford to keep hugely expensive but unneeded facilities open to serve as \xe2\x80\x9can employment program\xe2\x80\x9d for upstate residents.'b'To get the Legislature to agree to shut these facilities, Mr. Cuomo will have to push back hard against the corrections workers\xe2\x80\x99 unions that have thwarted sound closure proposals from all three of his predecessors.'b'The case for closures is laid out in a new analysis by the Correctional Association of New York, a nonprofit group. New York\xe2\x80\x99s prison population has dropped from about 71,500 at its peak in 1999 to around 56,000 today. This has left more than 8,000 empty beds, meaning that the state could close or significantly downsize eight to 10 of the 67 units in the system and still have ample room to handle any unexpected spike in the population. The savings would be $220 million in the first year.'b'The state could also save money by reversing misguided criminal-justice policies. In 1995, Gov. George Pataki prohibited people convicted of violent crimes from participating in work-release programs. That order cut the number of participants from nearly 28,000 in 1994 to about 2,500 in 2007, the most recent year for which the association has data.'b'The point of Mr. Pataki\xe2\x80\x99s order was to protect the public from violent offenders, but it may well have had the opposite effect. Once they had done their time, inmates were dumped onto the streets without any chance to reacclimate and find their place in the community. Work-release programs cost about $7,500 per participant annually, as opposed to about $55,000 to keep one person behind bars. Increasing the number of participants to  just 5,000 would save more than $80 million a year.'b'The state also needs to reform a parole system that returns as many as 8,000 inmates a year to prison for technical violations like breaking curfew. Other states have shown that they can keep the prison count down, at no risk to the public, by increasing supervision of violators instead of reflexively bouncing them back to jail.'b'These will be tough political fights. But for the sake of both fiscal sanity and sound public policy, they are ones that Governor Cuomo needs to fight and win.'b'MORRIS, the name of the online catalog of the Yale Law School Library, is not an acronym. It\xe2\x80\x99s a tribute to Morris Cohen, the school\xe2\x80\x99s longtime librarian and law professor, who died in December at 83 and was one of America\xe2\x80\x99s great scholarly librarians.'b'In its whimsy and pithiness \xe2\x80\x94 and as a link to a powerful tool of legal research \xe2\x80\x94 the name conveys his core values. He became a librarian after seven not very satisfying years as a lawyer. The late start led to an insistent focus on law librarianship as a service to legal practice and scholarship, and an insistence on providing that service his own way.'b'One of his most creative efforts was his collection of children\xe2\x80\x99s books related to law. What began in the 1960s as a hobby for Professor Cohen and his young son would eventually become the Yale Law Library\xe2\x80\x99s noteworthy collection of 200 publications described as \xe2\x80\x9cjuvenile jurisprudence.\xe2\x80\x9d It includes a noirish Classics Illustrated comic book of Dostoevsky\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCrime and Punishment\xe2\x80\x9d;  engrossing stories about pirates combining terror and adventure; and beautifully illustrated, moralizing accounts of trials conducted by animals, like \xe2\x80\x9cWho Killed Cock Robin?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Professor Cohen saw law, its study and its practice, as a bountiful, all-encompassing, humanistic field. As the librarians he trained explain, he was delighted by nearly all legal writings because they contain important codes to be deciphered about how different eras and societies viewed the role of law.'b'Professor Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s other extraordinary contribution is his magnum opus, the \xe2\x80\x9cBibliography of Early American Law,\xe2\x80\x9d which took him and a large team three decades to compile. Seven volumes, and breathtakingly rigorous, it allows users to find virtually any of the 15,000 or so law texts published in America before 1860. Along with statutes and court opinions, it includes ballads, sermons and fiction as well as children\xe2\x80\x99s books, underscoring Professor Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s conviction that law is transmitted through channels far outside the law.'b'In an age when the Internet, including MORRIS, gives many the illusion they are scholarly detectives, the meticulous, old-fashioned research he put into the bibliography is almost unfathomable. It yielded a resource that is matchless, brilliant and of eternal value.'b'To the Editor:'b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'Giving Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s Patients Their Way, Even Doses of Chocolate'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Vanishing Mind\xe2\x80\x9d series, front page, Jan. 1) is both heartening and maddening.'b'It is heartening to know that attention is being paid to the most fundamental ways to make the lives of Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s patients in nursing homes less anxiety-filled and stressful.'b'It is maddening because everything the Beatitudes nursing home in Phoenix is doing has been required by federal law since 1990: allowing residents to eat, sleep and bathe on their own schedules; keeping people out of diapers; minimizing the use of physical and chemical restraints and offering activities that relate to the individual\xe2\x80\x99s past life interests.'b'The reduction in use of antipsychotic drugs is particularly noteworthy: nearly 40 percent of nursing home residents with dementia and behavior issues are given antipsychotic drugs with no diagnosis appropriate to their use.

But the chapter it decided to release early is, by itself, a powerful summons to the Obama administration to press rapidly forward with stronger regulations, and to the industry as a whole to behave far more responsibly than it has.'b'Another tragedy like the one in the Gulf of Mexico could well occur, the report suggests, unless there is \xe2\x80\x9csignificant reform in both industry practices and government policies.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The panel traced the blowout to three main factors:'b''b''b'MANAGERIAL FOUL-UPS:'b''b' The most significant failure and \xe2\x80\x9croot cause\xe2\x80\x9d of the blowout was a seemingly endless series of fateful missteps and oversights by BP and its partners \xe2\x80\x94 Transocean and Halliburton \xe2\x80\x94 that, in retrospect, could have been avoided. These decisions included not installing enough devices to stabilize the well, not waiting for the results of tests on the foam used to seal the well, and ignoring the results of an important  pressure test. Taken together, these and other blunders allowed gases to enter the well and rise with explosive and ultimately disastrous force to the drilling rig.'b''b''b'SYSTEMIC FAILURE:'b''b' Though BP in particular has been accused of putting profit before safety, the report avoided linking any individual decision to cost considerations. Even so, BP and its partners repeatedly chose the riskier, speedier course instead of a slower and safer alternative. As Bob Graham, the commission co-chairman, noted in a separate statement, \xe2\x80\x9cThis disaster likely would not have happened had the companies involved been guided by an unrelenting commitment to safety first.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The report further asserted that this risk-taking was not unique to BP or its partners in the well, that the blowout was \xe2\x80\x9cnot the product of a series of aberrational decisions\xe2\x80\x9d made by a rogue company, but, instead, reflected an industrywide proclivity for risky behavior. \xe2\x80\x9cDo we have a single company, BP, that blundered with fatal consequences,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the other co-chairman, William Reilly, \xe2\x80\x9cor a more pervasive problem of a complacent industry?\xe2\x80\x9d Sadly, Mr. Reilly said, it is the latter.'b''b''b'REGULATORY WEAKNESS:'b''b' As expected, the panel took federal regulators in the old Minerals Management Service to task for a range of mistakes, like rubber-stamping drilling permits and failing to oversee operations on the rig. These failures are hardly new. For years, the service has had neither the will nor the resources to police the industry.'b'Since the blowout, the Obama administration has reorganized the regulatory apparatus to give it greater independence. It has also issued and is now enforcing specific safety regulations and increased surveillance on individual rigs. All this is welcome, but the administration has a long way to go. What is at issue here is nothing less than remaking the culture of an entire industry.'b'On Sunday, southern Sudan is expected to vote to secede from Sudan, creating two states. The referendum is part of a 2005 agreement, which ended two decades of fighting between the Arab Muslim north and the largely Christian south that killed two million people.'b'International activists were so concerned that the referendum could set off a new war that they posted a live satellite feed of Sudan on the Internet so the world can see if troops begin massing. Their fears are understandable, especially with Omar Hassan al-Bashir \xe2\x80\x94 the author of the murderous war in Darfur \xe2\x80\x94 still Sudan\xe2\x80\x99s president. But months of mediation by the Obama administration and African leaders seem to have persuaded Mr. Bashir to forgo confrontation, for now. The United States and others must stay involved to ensure that the difficult post-referendum transition remains peaceful.'b'More than 3.5 million southerners have registered to vote and a United Nations panel has endorsed the process. This week, Mr. Bashir visited Juba, the south\xe2\x80\x99s capital, to espouse peace. \xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot deny the desire and the choice of the people of the south,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Mr. Bashir, indicted by the International Criminal Court at The Hague, is not a credible character and regional leaders are concerned that members of his ruling party are still pressing him to thwart independence.'b'Even with a peaceful, credible vote, there will be many post-secession issues to resolve, including borders, citizenship protections (for southerners in the north and northerners in the south), and division of the earnings from the south\xe2\x80\x99s huge oil reserves. Southern Sudan has 75 percent of the oil, but needs the north\xe2\x80\x99s pipeline to get it to market.'b'The two sides failed to resolve an impasse over the oil-rich border region of Abyei, so another referendum that had been set for Sunday \xe2\x80\x94 on whether it should join the south or stay with the north \xe2\x80\x94  has been delayed. There is now talk of trying to settle things through negotiations. What is most important is that leaders in the north and south explain to their citizens what is happening and work toward a swift, sustainable solution.'b'The United States, the United Nations and the African Union will have to remain deeply engaged, prodding both states to compromise on these difficult issues. United Nations peacekeepers, sent to Sudan in 2005, should stay in southern Sudan temporarily to maintain security.'b'Washington has tough sanctions on Sudan, as a result of its early harboring of Osama bin Laden and then Mr. Bashir\xe2\x80\x99s genocidal war in Darfur. To encourage a successful referendum, President Obama offered to remove Sudan from Washington\xe2\x80\x99s terrorism list and eventually loosen other sanctions. He showed good will already by allowing some agricultural sales to the north.'b'Going forward, Washington must reassure Khartoum that it understands the hardship that secession will cause. If secession is peaceful, Washington should help the north by facilitating debt relief and foreign investment. If Sudan resorts to force, sanctions must be tightened. A recent rise in violence in Darfur is worrisome.'b'Washington must also use its diplomatic influence and aid to encourage southern Sudan to build a responsible and pluralistic government. Since 2005, the south\xe2\x80\x99s government has set up more than two dozen ministries and built schools and roads. But it will still need a lot more international aid and advice to create a truly functioning state. A peaceful, credible referendum is an important start, but only a start.'b'For almost 40 years, the New Jersey Supreme Court has tried to fulfill its duty to enforce the education clause in the state Constitution by compelling the governor and Legislature to provide equal educational opportunity for public school students. In 2009, the court decided the state had finally devised a way to do that, through a formula that would give each student, especially in poor districts, a chance at \xe2\x80\x9can unhindered start in life.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This week the matter was back before the court because New Jersey is spending 13.6 percent less on education than the state said was required. The governor is presenting this as an \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d consequence of \xe2\x80\x9cdire fiscal circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d but it is in fact a matter of choice. Eliminating a billion-dollar tax break for the state\xe2\x80\x99s wealthiest residents would all but solve the problem, but Gov. Chris Christie chose not to do that.'b'The Education Law Center has shown how the shortfall has reduced teaching, learning and, in some schools, safety, because of cutbacks in security. It means the state cannot provide \xe2\x80\x9ca constitutional education to all public school students.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The center took the issue back to the court. The right decision is clear. The shortfall in money and other defaults amount to \xe2\x80\x9cdeficiencies of a constitutional dimension,\xe2\x80\x9d which the court had warned would lead it to step in again. The justices should order the state to fully finance education as it committed to do.'b'In 1975, the court seemed to anticipate today\xe2\x80\x99s financing challenge. It found that any \xe2\x80\x9ctheoretical conflict\xe2\x80\x9d in the state Constitution between \xe2\x80\x9cthe strictures of the Appropriations Clause and the mandate of the Education Clause\xe2\x80\x9d must be resolved in education\xe2\x80\x99s favor. When the state failed to finance education at the level required, the court cut off state financing altogether.'b'The court now faces a politically charged decision. As bombastically as he seems to do everything, Mr. Christie is waging a battle against the court and what he calls its activism. (That has nothing to do with actual activism, but applies only to judges who rule in ways Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t like.) If the governor were a student of the court instead of its heckler, he would know the court\xe2\x80\x99s role here is judicially modest.'b'The state set the education standards that students must meet. The state decided how much money was needed to give each student the chance to meet them. The court\xe2\x80\x99s role is simply to assess whether, by those measures, current financing is adequate.'b'It would be natural for the justices to seek a unanimous ruling in a case this important, to underscore that the decision is being made by a coequal branch of government. The appeal of a unanimous ruling is most likely greater because of the governor\xe2\x80\x99s attack on the court. But the best reason for a unanimous ruling is the law. The court should order the state to solve this problem.'b'To keep the Defense Department running, President Obama was forced to sign a spending bill on Friday with a particularly harmful provision that bars spending to transfer detainees at Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay, Cuba, to the United States for trial. As wrongheaded as this prohibition is, the president was right not to declare his intention to defy it'b' in an accompanying statement'b'. By doing so, he demonstrated a greater respect for the law than did President George W. Bush.'b'The defense bill passed in the final hours of last year\xe2\x80\x99s lame-duck Congressional session with little objection from most Democrats. Many seemed to have bought into the irrational fear that trying Guant\xc3\xa1namo prisoners in the United States is somehow more dangerous than trying other mass murderers, like the scores of terrorists already convicted by the federal courts.'b'Much of the public and most politicians seem to feel that as long as these suspects are held out of sight on the island of Cuba, they can be held indefinitely without trial, in violation of basic constitutional protections and international treaties.'b'President Obama could have pushed harder on this issue, but he has at least vowed to close the Guant\xc3\xa1namo camp and try some of its inmates in federal courts. In the signing statement, Mr. Obama called the ban \xe2\x80\x9ca dangerous and unprecedented challenge\xe2\x80\x9d to the executive branch\xe2\x80\x99s authority to decide when and where to prosecute detainees. It could undermine counterterrorism efforts and harm national security, he said.'b'Despite his objections, Mr. Obama did not say he would defy the law and try to transfer prisoners anyway. That was the right position. As a candidate, he often objected to Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s cavalier use of signing statements to assert that his interpretation of the law trumped that of Congress and the courts. Mr. Bush routinely and contemptuously disregarded laws that he himself signed, most famously stating that he was not bound by the ban on torturing prisoners.'b'The 'b'American Civil Liberties Union argues'b' that the bill only restricts the use of Defense Department money for transferring prisoners to the United States. The administration, it argues, is free to use funds from other departments. But such a cramped reading of the law would be seen by most Americans as a defiance of Congressional intent. Taking the high ground puts President Obama in a better position to argue for the rule of law.'b'The new year is barely a week old, but the nation has already recorded its first deadly school shooting.'b'On Wednesday, a 17-year-old student opened fire at Millard South High School in Omaha, sending students rushing to the kitchen to seek safety. The vice principal, Vicki Kaspar, was killed and the principal, Curtis Case, was seriously injured. The gunman, Robert Butler Jr., was later found dead in a car not far from the school, an apparent suicide.'b'It would be comforting to believe that this latest outbreak of gun violence will also be the year\xe2\x80\x99s last. Comforting but unrealistic.'b'In 2010, there were at least 15 shootings at educational institutions from elementary to college level, according to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. While not all resulted in injuries, some did. In one shooting last February at Deer Creek Middle School in Littleton, Colo. \xe2\x80\x94 the same town at which the massacre at Columbine High School took place \xe2\x80\x94 a man shot and injured two students.'b'Such incidents rarely make much news, unless the death and injury toll is large, as at Columbine and Virginia Tech. Even then, the public\xe2\x80\x99s attention quickly turns away, while the gun lobby keeps pushing more outlandish strategies to expand the threatening presence of guns in society.'b'For example, a lawsuit filed in September and supported by the National Rifle Association  is challenging the longstanding federal law prohibiting licensed gun dealers from selling handguns to anyone under 21 years old. A second  filing seeks to overturn a Texas law setting 21 as the minimum age for carrying a concealed weapon.'b'This week\xe2\x80\x99s killing at Millard South is a horrifying reminder that politicians must stop cowering before the gun lobby and its reckless agenda to make it easier for volatile young people and troubled adults to obtain  guns.'b'Years ago, my oldest son told me that he thought those in our small Baptist church had all been brainwashed. How else could they believe in the unbelievable? At the time, I was shocked.'b'He later softened that position. Although he said that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t accept all things biblical, he explained, quite eloquently I thought, that he \xe2\x80\x9cwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to live in a world where a God didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist.\xe2\x80\x9d I was impressed.'b'Then, a few months ago, he told me  that he was a deist. I was confused. This time I had to turn to the all-knowing and omnipresent  \xe2\x80\x94 Google.'b'Through it all, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been very sympathetic about my son\xe2\x80\x99s spiritual quest, in part because my own religious beliefs are evolving. I have gone from the most devout born-again Christian to a more nebulous, nondoctrinal set of beliefs that do not necessarily align with organized religion. When people ask about my faith, I often reply, \xe2\x80\x9cunresolved.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is increasingly the face of religion in America  \xe2\x80\x94 fluid, fluctuant, questioning, nonconformist and in many cases unaffiliated.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why a report this week by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life about 'b'the religious composition of the 112th Congress'b' caught my eye. According to the report, the unaffiliated (atheists, agnostics, the unchurched, uncommitted, etc.), at 16.1 percent of the population, is the largest religious group in America without representation in Congress. (Six members, about 1 percent, did not specify a religious category.)'b'For perspective, there are almost two-thirds as many unaffiliated people as there are Catholics in this country and nearly as many as there are Baptists. Their number is  more than twice that of Methodists, and more than nine times the numbers of Jews or Mormons. Yet, no unaffiliated representation. Why?'b'First, let me get this out of the way: I don\xe2\x80\x99t for a second believe that all those members are religious. I believe some are trapped in the religious closet of American politics where nonbelief is a nonstarter. It\xe2\x80\x99s not only seen as unholy, it\xe2\x80\x99s also seen as un-American. (Although Pete Stark, a California Democrat and a Unitarian, has said that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in a Supreme Being. One out!)'b'Second, and perhaps more important, the unaffiliated are simply not unified. They have few advocacy groups or high-profile faces. They don\xe2\x80\x99t congregate, organize or petition like members of organized religions. Politicians don\xe2\x80\x99t feel the need to court them, let alone identify as one of them. Part of the problem is that the unaffiliated are a jumbled lot. Only about a fourth are atheists or agnostics. Many of the others feel strongly connected to religion, but choose not to participate. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a protest vote.'b'Whether they are organized, cohesive or disgruntled, the unaffiliated are the fastest-growing religious category in America. Nonaffiliation is not un-American. Increasingly, it is America. Eventually, our politics will have to catch up.'b'Next week the House Republicans are going to vote to repeal the health care reform law. It\xe2\x80\x99s a symbolic gesture they got the right to make when they won the majority, but it would be nice if they could leave God out of it.'b'I am thinking about you, Representative Steve King of Iowa. On Friday, King gave a 58-minute-and-20-second speech on the floor of the House in which he made it abundantly clear that God did not want more federal regulation of health insurance companies. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will carry on this struggle until in God\xe2\x80\x99s good time, with all his power and might, he steps forth to the rescue and liberation of our God-given American liberty,\xe2\x80\x9d King declared.'b'The Republicans have set aside seven hours for debating the repeal, but once one side has announced that God is their co-signer, there\xe2\x80\x99s really not a whole lot more to say.'b'We are going to be hearing a lot about Representative King in the coming year. \xe2\x80\x9cI have more words in the Congressional Record than anyone else,\xe2\x80\x9d he bragged during an interview with a newspaper in his district. And he is one quotable fella. Just the other day he jumped into the health care fray to defend his party\xe2\x80\x99s leadership against a Democratic attack, declaring that Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor had \xe2\x80\x9cestablished their integrity and their mendacity for years in this Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'King also got into an argument about whether insurance could be regulated as interstate commerce, claiming that some people are born, live their lives and die in one state without ever having one single encounter with health care. When a Democrat demanded to know where you could find a baby born outside a hospital without a midwife\xe2\x80\x99s assistance and with no inoculations, King retorted: \xe2\x80\x9cI hate to tell you, but they show up in garbage cans around this country, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'King was in line to be chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration this year, but the Judiciary chairman, Lamar Smith, decided he\xe2\x80\x99d rather go for someone who did not walk into the Capitol on Day 1 waving a bill to eliminate citizenship rights for children born in this country to parents who are illegal immigrants. Score one for the new civility.'b'And kudos to Representative Darrell Issa, the incoming head of the powerful House Oversight Committee. This week Issa turned over a new, more collegial leaf by taking back, sort of, his recent claim that Barack Obama is \xe2\x80\x9cone of the most corrupt presidents of modern times.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Which was certainly not charitable. Particularly from the party that gave us Watergate, the Iran-Contra Affair and Warren Harding.'b'What he actually meant to say, Issa explained, was not that Obama was on the take, but that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you hand out $1 trillion in TARP just before this president came in, most of it unspent, $1 trillion nearly in stimulus that this president asked for, plus this huge expansion in health care and government, it has a corrupting effect.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'So it was all about big government! Much less appalling. Although, did you notice that the first trillion came while somebody else was in office? Issa could at least have added, \xe2\x80\x9cand obviously, when you look at it that way, George W. Bush and Barack Obama were two of the most corrupt presidents in modern times.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Kudos to the Democrats for their spirit of charity in the matter of the two House Republicans who missed the swearing-in ceremony because they were at a celebration elsewhere. Which they insisted was not a fund-raiser, but simply a gathering of 500 constituents who paid $30 apiece to get there.'b'The lawmakers, Pete Sessions of Texas and Mike Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, did raise their hands and recite the oath of office in front of the televised version of the event. But really, what if we\xe2\x80\x99d all done that? If I\xe2\x80\x99d known it was an option, I would definitely have sworn myself in and then gotten my picture taken with John Boehner.'b'Plus, Sessions and Fitzpatrick violated the parliamentary rules set down by Thomas Jefferson. If Jefferson had wanted representatives swearing in front of a flat-screened TV, he would have said so. Those founding fathers knew what they were doing.'b'Things got more complicated when it turned out that Sessions, unsworn, had gone to a committee hearing and voted to set rules for the debate on repealing the health care law. (Fitzpatrick went to the House and took part in the reading of the Constitution.)'b'To make sure the rules were still legal, the House had to vote to straighten everything out, which it did very speedily and  \xe2\x80\x94 this is the important part  \xe2\x80\x94 without all that much Democratic sniping about what had come to be called \xe2\x80\x9cthe undocumented members.\xe2\x80\x9d This was obviously because people have decided that in times of great conflict and stress, it is better to be collegial.'b'Also, the Republicans permitted only four minutes of debate.'b'Consider the extremes. President Obama is redesigning his administration to make it even friendlier toward big business and the megabanks, which is to say the rich, who flourish no matter what is going on with the economy in this country. (They flourish even when they\xe2\x80\x99re hard at work destroying the economy.) Meanwhile, we hear not a word  \xe2\x80\x94 not so much as a peep  \xe2\x80\x94 about the poor, whose ranks are spreading like a wildfire in a drought.'b'The politicians and the media behave as if the poor don\xe2\x80\x99t exist. But with jobs still absurdly scarce and the bottom falling out of the middle class, the poor are becoming an ever more significant and increasingly desperate segment of the population.'b'How do you imagine a family of four would live if its annual income was $11,000 or less?'b'During a conversation I had this week with Peter Edelman, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center and a longtime expert on issues related to poverty, he pointed out that the number of people in that tragically dismal category has grown to more than 17 million. These are the folks trying to make it on incomes below half of the official poverty line, which is $22,000 annually for a family of four.'b'No one talks about these families and individuals living in extreme poverty. Certainly not the Republicans who were having a dandy time this week deliberately misreading the Constitution and promising budget cuts and other initiatives that will hurt the poor even more.'b'If you\xe2\x80\x99re still having trouble deciding whose side the Republicans are on, just keep in mind that the House G.O.P. bigwig Darrell Issa sent a letter to 150 businesses, trade groups and think tanks asking them to spell out which federal regulations they dislike the most. These are lifeguards on the side of the sharks.'b'Scared to death of being outdone, President Obama and his sidekicks climbed into their spiffy new G.O.P. costumes and promised in humiliatingly abject tones to shower the business world with whatever government largess they could lay their hands on. The first order of business (pun intended) was the announcement that William Daley, the Chicago wheeler-dealer and former Clinton administration official who landed a fat gig at JPMorgan Chase, would become the president\xe2\x80\x99s chief of staff. Mr. Daley was a loud critic of recent financial regulatory reforms and has been obsessed with getting Democrats to be more subservient to business.'b'The poor, who have been hurt more than anyone else in this recession, don\xe2\x80\x99t stand a heartbeat\xe2\x80\x99s chance in this political environment. The movers and shakers in government don\xe2\x80\x99t even give a thought to being on the side of the angels anymore  \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99re on the side of the millionaires and billionaires.'b'Nearly 44 million people were living in poverty in 2009, which was more than 14 percent of the American population and a jump of four million from the previous year. Anyone who thinks things are much better now is delirious. More than 15 million children are poor  \xe2\x80\x94 one of every five kids in the United States. More than a quarter of all blacks and a similar percentage of Hispanics are poor.'b'Are we doing anything about this? No. Our government officials, from the president on down, are too busy kissing the bejeweled fingers of the megarich.'b'Professor Edelman broke the poor into two categories: the new poor, who have lost jobs and homes and otherwise been clobbered by the recession; and the old poor, who in many cases had previously been working, sometimes sporadically or part time, at jobs that didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay much. Many of those low-paying jobs have since vanished and the old poor have just been crushed.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is this astonishing number of people all the way down there at the bottom that we just don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Edelman said, \xe2\x80\x9cand they\xe2\x80\x99re in very big trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Welfare, even for the poorest of the poor, is not much help. More than 17 million people may be living in extreme poverty, but welfare, for most of the people who need it, was \xe2\x80\x9creformed\xe2\x80\x9d right out of existence. TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families), which is what welfare is called now, helps far fewer people than welfare used to, even though the poor have been laid low by the worst economy since the Depression.'b'Hardly anyone cares. Hardly anyone even notices.'b'With the tax cuts for the rich saved and William Daley coming on board, the atmosphere is being readied for Obama &amp; Co. to tap the fat cats for the zillions necessary for next year\xe2\x80\x99s re-election run. And that, of course, is the only thing that really matters.'b'WHEN the new House of Representatives convened on Thursday, the Republican leadership kept its promise to start the session 'b'by reading the text of the Constitution aloud.'b' This break from Congressional tradition had a polemical purpose: Representative Robert Goodlatte, the Virginia Republican who came up with the idea, remarked that \xe2\x80\x9clots of my constituents have said that Congress has gone beyond its powers granted in the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If the reading was meant to be a win for originalism, however, it stumbled out of the gate, over the text of Article I, Section 2. This deals with the apportionment of House seats among the states, which is said to be based on \xe2\x80\x9cthe whole number of free persons\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthree-fifths of all other persons.\xe2\x80\x9d Rather than draw attention to this infamous euphemism for slaves, the Congressional readers decided to omit those portions, on the grounds that they had been superseded by the 14th Amendment.'b'It just so happened this conspicuous omission came days after a small publisher, NewSouth Books, announced 'b'a new edition of Mark Twain\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cHuckleberry Finn\xe2\x80\x9d'b' that will replace its uses of the word \xe2\x80\x9cnigger\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cslave.\xe2\x80\x9d Here, again, was a historic text clashing with contemporary sensibilities, and forced to submit.'b'Taken together, the two cases show the comedy of euphemism: trying to distract us from something ugly only makes the ugliness harder to miss. To the book\xe2\x80\x99s new editor, the Twain scholar Alan Gribben, \xe2\x80\x9cslave\xe2\x80\x9d is less offensive than \xe2\x80\x9cnigger\xe2\x80\x9d; to the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s drafters, \xe2\x80\x9call other persons\xe2\x80\x9d was less offensive than \xe2\x80\x9cslave.\xe2\x80\x9d By refusing to utter even that legalism, the House showed that euphemism can end only in embarrassed silence.'b'The censored edition of \xe2\x80\x9cHuckleberry Finn\xe2\x80\x9d has been loudly condemned. Certainly, as a writer, I see the strength of all the arguments against tinkering with the original, not least because it would be a terrible precedent \xe2\x80\x94 start eliminating everything offensive in literary history, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll have little left. But once I returned to the actual novel, I began to feel torn, because I could imagine the effect that its deluge of epithets would have on a young reader, especially a young black reader. (Open the book to the passage in the second chapter that begins, \xe2\x80\x9cStrange niggers would stand with their mouths open,\xe2\x80\x9d and see if you would be able to read it to a room full of ninth graders.)'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHuckleberry Finn\xe2\x80\x9d was intended, of course, as an attack on racism. In its most famous scene, Huck hides the runaway slave Jim from a party of slave-hunters, and then feels guilty for having done so. \xe2\x80\x9cI knowed very well I had done wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, though the reader, and Twain, know he has done right. It\xe2\x80\x99s a searching demonstration of the way conscience is not just innate but also learned, and how confusing it can be to do right in a society dedicated to wrong \xe2\x80\x94 the same kinds of questions that bedeviled Hannah Arendt at the Eichmann trial.'b'Yet all those racial epithets are a reminder that, when Twain wrote it, the audience he had in mind \xe2\x80\x94 the America for which he wrote \xe2\x80\x94 was segregated. He did not worry about constantly writing \xe2\x80\x9cnigger,\xe2\x80\x9d because he was writing about blacks, not for them. And for many readers, encountering classic literature means sometimes finding yourself excluded, or insulted, in this way. For blacks reading Twain, certainly, but also for Jews reading Shakespeare or Dickens, and for women reading, say, Plato (among countless others).'b'But the books we cherish, which deserve the name of classics, feel essentially humane to us, despite their limitations, even their bigotry. \xe2\x80\x9cI sit with Shakespeare and he winces not,\xe2\x80\x9d W. E. B. DuBois said. We feel that the exclusion of whole classes of humanity from the author\xe2\x80\x99s imagined audience \xe2\x80\x94 which means, from his idea of the fully human \xe2\x80\x94 is due to ignorance or carelessness; that if he were to think and feel more freely, more deeply, he would acknowledge that all people are equally human.'b'This is also the promise of American history, and above all of the Constitution. Unlike Twain\xe2\x80\x99s novel, that classic American text was written in the expectation that it would be corrected. And it needed correction, or amendment, for the same essential reason: the framers\xe2\x80\x99 imagination of the people they led was not full enough. It took a devastating civil war, whose sesquicentennial we are now observing, to revise the Constitution in the direction of justice. When the House readers decided to skip the parts of the Constitution that reveal its original limitations, they were minimizing that history, pretending that our founding document was flawless from the beginning.'b'No, Congress may not go \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond its powers granted in the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d as Representative Goodlatte insisted. But to believe that American institutions were ever perfect makes it too easy to believe that they are perfect now. Both assumptions, one might say, are sins against the true spirit of the Constitution, which demands that we keep reimagining our way to a more perfect union.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Families Bear Brunt of Deployment Strains'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cA Year at War\xe2\x80\x9d series, front page, Dec. 31):'b'The pattern of multiple deployments imposed on a small segment of enlistment-age individuals in the United States is inequitable and discriminatory.

Yet today \xe2\x80\x94 after 50 years of civil wars that have killed two million people and turned millions more into refugees \xe2\x80\x94 this is the opportunity before the people of southern Sudan.'b'Over the next week, 'b'millions of southern Sudanese will vote'b' on whether to remain part of Sudan or to form their own independent nation.  This process \xe2\x80\x94 and the actions of Sudanese leaders \xe2\x80\x94 will help determine whether people who have known so much suffering will move toward peace and prosperity, or slide backward into bloodshed. It will have consequences not only for Sudan, but also for sub-Saharan Africa and the world.'b'The historic vote is an exercise in self-determination long in the making, and it is a key part of the 2005 peace agreement that ended the civil war in Sudan. Yet just months ago, with preparations behind schedule, it was uncertain whether this referendum would take place at all. It is for this reason that 'b'I gathered with leaders from Sudan'b' and around the world in September to make it clear that the international community was united in its belief that this referendum had to take place and that the will of the people of southern Sudan had to be respected, regardless of the outcome.'b'In an important step forward, leaders from both northern and southern Sudan \xe2\x80\x94 backed by more than 40 nations and international organizations \xe2\x80\x94 agreed to work together to ensure that the voting would be  timely, peaceful, free and credible and would reflect the will of the Sudanese people. The fact that the voting appears to be starting on time is a tribute to those in Sudan who fulfilled their commitments. Most recently, the government of Sudan said that it would be the first to recognize the south if it voted for independence.'b'Now, the world is watching, united in its determination to make sure that all parties in Sudan live up to their obligations. As the referendum proceeds, voters must be allowed access to polling stations; they must be able to cast their ballots free from intimidation and coercion. All sides should refrain from inflammatory rhetoric or provocative actions that could raise tensions or prevent voters from expressing their will.'b'As the ballots are counted, all sides must resist prejudging the outcome. For the results to be credible, the commission that is overseeing the referendum must be free from pressure and interference. In the days ahead, leaders from north and south will need to work together to prevent violence and ensure that isolated incidents do not spiral into wider instability. Under no circumstance should any side use proxy forces in an effort to gain an advantage while we wait for the final results.'b'A successful vote will be cause for celebration and an inspiring step forward in Africa\xe2\x80\x99s long journey toward democracy and justice. Still, lasting peace in Sudan will demand far more than a credible referendum.'b'The 2005 peace agreement must be fully implemented \xe2\x80\x94 a goal that will require compromise. Border disputes, and the status of the Abyei region, which straddles north and south,  need to be resolved peacefully. The safety and citizenship of all Sudanese, especially minorities \xe2\x80\x94 southerners in the north and northerners in the south \xe2\x80\x94 have to be protected. Arrangements must be made for the transparent distribution of oil revenues, which can contribute to development. The return of refugees needs to be managed with extraordinary care to prevent another humanitarian catastrophe.'b'If the south chooses independence, the international community, including the United States, will have an interest in ensuring that the two nations that emerge succeed as stable and economically viable neighbors, because their fortunes are linked. Southern Sudan, in particular, will need partners in the long-term task of fulfilling the political and economic aspirations of its people.'b'Finally, there can be no lasting peace in Sudan without lasting peace in the western Sudan region of Darfur. The deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent Darfuris \xe2\x80\x94 and the plight of refugees like those I met in a camp in neighboring Chad five years ago \xe2\x80\x94 must never be forgotten.  Here, too, the world is watching. The government of Sudan must live up to its international obligations. Attacks on civilians must stop. United Nations peacekeepers and aid workers must be free to reach those in need.'b'As I told Sudanese leaders in September, the United States will not abandon the people of Darfur. We will continue our diplomatic efforts to end the crisis there once and for all. Other nations must use their influence to bring all parties to the table and ensure they negotiate in good faith. And we will continue to insist that lasting peace in Darfur include accountability for crimes that have been committed, including genocide.'b'Along with our international partners, the United States will continue to play a leadership role in helping all the Sudanese people realize the peace and progress they deserve. Today, I am repeating my offer to Sudan\xe2\x80\x99s leaders \xe2\x80\x94 if you fulfill your obligations and choose peace, there is a path to normal relations with the United States, including the lifting of economic sanctions and beginning the process, in accordance with United States law, of removing Sudan from the list of states that sponsor terrorism. In contrast, those who flout their international obligations will face more pressure and isolation.'b'Millions of Sudanese are making their way to the polls to determine their destiny. This is the moment when leaders of courage and vision can guide their people to a better day. Those who make the right choice will be remembered by history \xe2\x80\x94 they will also have a steady partner in the United States.'b'BARACK OBAMA\xe2\x80\x99S Christmas resurrection was so miraculous that even a birther or two may start believing the guy is a Christian.'b'Nothing captured the president\xe2\x80\x99s sudden reversal of fortune more vividly than the Linda Blair-like head spin of the conservative pundit Charles Krauthammer, who 'b'pronounced the Obama agenda \xe2\x80\x9cdead\xe2\x80\x9d on Fox News on Nov. 3'b' only to lead the bipartisan media hordes 'b'anointing him \xe2\x80\x9cthe new comeback kid\xe2\x80\x9d six weeks later'b'. Last week Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Gallup job approval rating fleetingly 'b'hit 50 percent'b' for the first time in eight months.

Reagan, of course, was also pummeled (though a bit less so) in his maiden midterms of 1982, then carried 49 states in his 1984 re-election landslide. In January 1983, Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s approval rating was much worse than Obama\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 35 percent. So was the unemployment rate ('b'10.4 percent'b' vs. our current 'b'9.4 percent'b') as Americans struggled to recover from what was 'b'then'b' the deepest economic downturn since the Great Depression.'b'My poll-crunching Times colleague 'b'Nate Silver has already poured cold water'b' on the fantasy that history is fated to repeat itself in 2012. His numbers show zero correlation between presidents\xe2\x80\x99 post-midterms popularity and their fates two years later. But if Obama actually read Cannon, his comeback could have legs. It\xe2\x80\x99s full of leadership lessons that will be particularly useful in outfoxing political adversaries who seem not to have consulted so much as a picture book about the president they claim as their patron saint.'b'The right\xe2\x80\x99s Stepford fetishization of Reagan reached a farcical apotheosis last week when a moderator of 'b'a  debate for the Republican National Committee chairmanship'b' tried to curtail the ritualistic bloviation by asking aspirants to name their political hero \xe2\x80\x9c'b'aside'b' from President Reagan.\xe2\x80\x9d This trick question so nonplussed one candidate that he coughed up \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Ludwig von Mises of FreedomWorks'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d  Another flustered respondent chose Margaret Thatcher, perhaps fearing it would be politically incorrect to venture an answer more than one degree of separation from the big Gipper.'b'The present-day radicals donning Reagan drag, led by Sarah Palin, seem not to know, as Cannon writes, that their hero lurched \xe2\x80\x9cfrom excessive tax cuts to corrective tax increases disguised as tax reform\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csubmitted eight unbalanced budgets to Congress in succession.\xe2\x80\x9d Reagan made no promise whatsoever of a balanced budget in the document that codified Reaganomics, his White House\xe2\x80\x99s 281-page message to Congress in February 1981. The historian Gil Troy has calculated that spending on entitlement programs more than doubled on Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s watch. America slid into debtor-nation status, and Americans \xe2\x80\x9cwent from owing 16 cents for every dollar in national income in 1981\xe2\x80\x9d to owing 44 cents per dollar in 1988.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s also likely that Reagan would have drifted off \xe2\x80\x94 like most Americans \xe2\x80\x94 during the pretentious recitation of the Constitution in the House. He prided himself on serving as a true citizen-politician and, as Cannon writes, saw no problem in being \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely ignorant of even civics-book information about how bills were passed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What Reagan did know was how to deliver a message, even if that message belied his policies or actions or the facts. While perhaps no politician can ever duplicate Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s  brand of sunny and homespun (if Hollywood-honed) geniality, Obama has his own radiance when he wants to turn it on \xe2\x80\x94 a quality Reagan opponents like Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale lacked and that is beyond the imagination of frothing-at-the-mouth Tea Partiers. But Obama is less adept at keeping his messages simple, consistent and crystal-clear.'b'In a particularly instructive passage, Cannon tells of Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s habit of endlessly recycling an inspirational World War II anecdote that, as the press discovered, was a movie-spawned fiction. His White House spokesman, Larry Speakes, was only half-joking when he deflected critics with the old saw \xe2\x80\x9cif you tell the same story five times, it\xe2\x80\x99s true.\xe2\x80\x9d Unlike Reagan, Obama doesn\xe2\x80\x99t invent or fantasize. But he has trouble telling even some true stories five times \xe2\x80\x94 and telling them well \xe2\x80\x94 which is why he now has to 'b'resell the health care bill'b' more than nine months after he signed it.'b'Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s talents also included an ability to pick adversaries and hammer them relentlessly  \xe2\x80\x94  without losing his cool  \xe2\x80\x94  whether air-traffic controllers or the \xe2\x80\x9cevil empire.\xe2\x80\x9d Though Obama ultimately stopped vilifying the Bush administration  for the economic disaster he  inherited, Reagan never backed off bashing the Democrats and the 30-year Great Society \xe2\x80\x9cbinge\xe2\x80\x9d for the fiscal woes of his America. Reagan got away with it because he never sounded like a whiner, and because he paired his invective with an optimism that bleached out any pettiness. A former Democrat, after all, he wisely chose F.D.R. as his political model.'b'That pitch-perfect showmanship, timing and salesmanship (his father was a salesman) were in Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 and bones. Obama doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have that training, but he was a great communicator when it came to selling his own story in the campaign, heaven knows. He has rarely rekindled  that touch in the White House  \xe2\x80\x94  even during his December run of good fortune. His recent Congressional victories should not obscure the reality that, the tax-cut deal notwithstanding, he still disappeared at key moments when he should have led the charge.'b'Nowhere was he more AWOL than in the battle over aiding 9/11 emergency workers poisoned  by the toxic debris at ground zero. Supporting a bill to reward brave Americans who paid with their health or their lives to serve others was tantamount to voting for the flag  \xe2\x80\x94  a far more patriotic gesture than, say, reading aloud the Constitution. Yet Republicans in Congress 'b'caricatured it'b' as a \xe2\x80\x9cslush fund\xe2\x80\x9d inviting \xe2\x80\x9cabuse, fraud and waste\xe2\x80\x9d (Lamar Smith of Texas, the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee) and \xe2\x80\x9c'b'an expansive new health care entitlement program'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma). All 41 Republicans present in the Senate 'b'voted to block its passage'b' while giving top priority to protecting tax cuts for the superrich. But rather than lead this easily winnable battle from uncontestable high ground, the White House remained largely silent, 'b'releasing only a written statement of support for the bill'b'. The president never spoke publicly about it at all.'b'Obama didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to demagogue the issue. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to pitch a fit, as Anthony Weiner, the New York congressman, 'b'did for the benefit of C-Span cameras last summer'b'. But it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine a more clear-cut teaching moment for a president to explain how intransigent right-wing ideology can violate fundamental American values of fairness and sacrifice. Instead, that job fell to others, which is why a novice senator, Kirsten Gillibrand, and a late-night television star, Jon Stewart, 'b'could be found taking a victory lap'b' over the bill\xe2\x80\x99s passage on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Daily Show\xe2\x80\x9d last week: they had stepped into the leadership vacuum left by Obama.'b'With his vastly reduced Capitol Hill cohort, Obama\xe2\x80\x99s next two years are going to be less about pushing bills  through Congress and more about pushing the presidency to the max. Win or lose, he\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be more vocal in other fights, starting with immigration reform, where bedrock American principles of fairness are at stake. He\xe2\x80\x99ll also have to finally find a unifying story to unite his economic philosophy, for if he never defines Obamanomics, his opponents will keep labeling  it as tax-and-spend socialism instead.'b'And surely he must start wielding Reaganesque humor at the rapidly thickening blizzard of Tea Party hypocrisies. A \xe2\x80\x9cthere you go again\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x94  or two or three or four  \xe2\x80\x94  will come in handy when mocking antigovernment zealots like the newly elected Representative Vicky Hartzler of Missouri, who last week 'b'repeatedly ducked Diane Sawyer\xe2\x80\x99s simple inquiry'b' as to whether she would end federal farm subsidies (her family farm has collected some $775,000) now that she\xe2\x80\x99s in Washington.'b'In the 1984 election, 'b'The Times\xe2\x80\x99s exit poll found'b' that by far the single biggest factor in Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s landslide was the perception that the economy had turned around and that unemployment, though still high (7.2 percent), was falling rapidly. The second most important factor was leadership. A 'b'September poll'b' had showed that Americans gave Mondale more credit for caring about people and for having a vision for America\xe2\x80\x99s future. But the perception that Reagan was a strong leader, \xe2\x80\x9cforceful\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9ccautious,\xe2\x80\x9d  trumped all else. He was affable, sure, and made compromises to get legislation on the scoreboard, but he was not a bipartisan wuss. Voters rewarded his campaign slogan, \xe2\x80\x9cLeadership That\xe2\x80\x99s Working,\xe2\x80\x9d even though his Morning-in-America agenda was a Madison Avenue homily, not a program for leading America anywhere specific in his second term.'b'At this point the speed of our own halting recovery is not in the president\xe2\x80\x99s hands. The ability to remake his style of leadership still is. But that makeover can come only from him, not from old Clinton hands in a reshuffled West Wing. Without it, the miracle of his Christmas resurrection could be over by Easter.'b'BEIJING'b'If there\xe2\x80\x99s a human face on Rising China, it belongs not to some Politburo chief, not to an Internet tycoon, but to a quiet, mild-mannered teenage girl named Hou Yifan.'b'Ms. Hou (whose name is pronounced Ho Ee-fahn) is an astonishing phenomenon: at 16, she is the new women\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'world chess champion'b', the youngest person, male or female, ever to win a world championship. And she reflects the way China  \xe2\x80\x94 by investing heavily in education and human capital, particularly in young women  \xe2\x80\x94 is increasingly having an outsize impact on every aspect of the world.'b'Napoleon is famously said to have declared, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen China wakes, it will shake the world.\xe2\x80\x9d That is becoming true even in spheres that China historically has had little connection with, like chess, basketball, rare earth minerals, cyber warfare, space exploration and nuclear research.'b'This is a process that Miss Hou exemplifies. Only about 1 percent of Chinese play chess, and China has never been a chess power. But since 1991, China has produced four women\xe2\x80\x99s world chess champions, and Ms. Hou is the one with by far the most promise.'b'At this point, I have to put my sensitive male ego aside. You see, Ms. Hou gamely agreed to play me after I interviewed her. She had just flown into Beijing after winning the world championship, and she was exhausted  \xe2\x80\x94 and she shredded me in 21 moves.'b'Most dispiriting, when I was teetering at the abyss near the end of the game, her coach nudged her and suggested mischievously that we should switch sides. Ms. Hou would inherit my impossible position  \xe2\x80\x94 and the gleam in her coach\xe2\x80\x99s eye suggested that she would still win.'b'I protested that I could survive being beaten on the chess board by a schoolgirl. But to be toyed with, like a mouse by a cat  \xe2\x80\x94 that would be too much. Ms. Hou nodded compassionately and checkmated me a few moves later.'b'At 14 she became the youngest female grandmaster ever. She\xe2\x80\x99s still so young that it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear just how remarkable she will become.'b'Women in general haven\xe2\x80\x99t been nearly as good at chess as men, and the world\xe2\x80\x99s top women are mostly ranked well below the top men  \xe2\x80\x94 but Ms. Hou could be an exception. She is the only female chess player today considered to have a shot at becoming one of the top few players in the world, male or female.'b'Cynics sometimes suggest that China\xe2\x80\x99s rise as a world power is largely a matter of government manipulation of currency rates and trade rules, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of rigging or cheating going on in every sphere. But China has also done an extraordinarily good job of investing in its people and in spreading opportunity across the country. Moreover, perhaps as a legacy of Confucianism, its citizens have shown a passion for education and self-improvement  \xe2\x80\x94 along with remarkable capacity for discipline and hard work, what the Chinese call \xe2\x80\x9cchi ku,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ceating bitterness.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ms. Hou dined on plenty of bitterness in working her way up to champion.  She grew up in the boondocks, in a county town in Jiangsu Province, and her parents did not play chess. But they lavished attention on her and spoiled her, as parents of only children (\xe2\x80\x9clittle emperors\xe2\x80\x9d) routinely do in China.'b'China used to be one of the most sexist societies in the world  \xe2\x80\x94 with female infanticide, foot binding, and concubinage  \xe2\x80\x94 but it turned a corner and now is remarkably good at giving opportunities to girls as well as boys. When Ms. Hou\xe2\x80\x99s parents noticed her interest in a chess board at a store, they promptly bought her a chess set  \xe2\x80\x94 and then hired a chess tutor for her.'b'Ye Jiangchuan, the chief coach of the national men\xe2\x80\x99s and women\xe2\x80\x99s teams, told me that he played Ms. Hou when she was 9 years old  \xe2\x80\x94 and was stunned. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw that this kid was special,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me, and he invited her to move to Beijing to play with the national teams. Three years later she was the youngest girl ever to compete in the world chess championships.'b'It will be many, many decades before China can challenge the United States as the overall \xe2\x80\x9cNo. 1\xe2\x80\x9d in the world, for we have a huge lead and China still must show that it can transition to a more open and democratic society. But already in discrete areas  \xe2\x80\x94 its automobile market, carbon emissions and now women\xe2\x80\x99s chess  \xe2\x80\x94 China is emerging as No. 1 here and there, and that process will continue.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a lesson for us as well. China\xe2\x80\x99s national commitment to education, opportunity and eating bitterness  \xe2\x80\x94 those are qualities that we in the West might emulate as well. As you know after you\xe2\x80\x99ve been checkmated by Hou Yifan.'b'It has been four months since John Boehner, now speaker of the House, first proposed to cut $100 billion from this year\xe2\x80\x99s budget, an idea that was later elevated to a \xe2\x80\x9cpledge to America\xe2\x80\x9d in the 2010 campaign. Last week, Mr. Boehner finally specified his first actual cut:  $35 million from House lawmakers\xe2\x80\x99 office budgets.'b'Precisely because it is puny and painless, the cut passed the House with broad support, showing once again that the path to bipartisanship in Washington is paved with giveaways (like deficit-increasing tax cuts) and grandstanding (like trivial spending cuts dressed up as deficit reduction).'b'The road to fiscal responsibility is a harder one. Even as Republican leaders tout the $100 billion goal, aides have said it will be $50 billion to $60 billion, to adjust for the fact that the fiscal year is already under way. Whatever the sum, the public needs to know from Mr. Boehner what specific programs and services Republicans are willing to cut. The question is pressing, but not because the cuts are pressing. On the contrary, cutting billions would be foolish at a time when joblessness is high and the recovery needs stimulus, not tightening.'b'The question is important because without specifics, there can be no real debate on the best ways to reduce the deficit. Spending cuts need not and should not start today, but the nation needs to put a credible plan in place now to reduce the deficit as the economy recovers.'b'Campaigning is not the same as governing, and this prolonged state of political posture invites budget gimmicks and, worse, portends dangerous deadline-driven showdowns over who seems most willing to cut spending. This spring, for instance, Republicans could try to attach a demand for unspecified, across-the-board cuts to must-pass legislation to raise the nation\xe2\x80\x99s debt limit.'b'If successful, that would allow them to take credit for spending reductions without ever having to explain what, specifically, they want to cut, or defend those decisions. Why the reluctance to specify?'b'While House Republican leaders have not said what they would cut, they have said what they would spare: defense. They have also pledged to shield seniors from spending cuts, apparently to please recipients of entitlements like Medicare and Social Security. They also zealously defend the huge sums the country spends to give tax breaks to people who do not need them.'b'That leaves programs totaling $477 billion \xe2\x80\x94 14 percent of the $3.5 trillion federal budget \xe2\x80\x94 to absorb the promised cuts, including education, environment, transportation, diplomacy, disease control, scientific research, investor protection, and all other basic government programs on which the quality of American life depends.'b'Spread evenly, the cuts would come to more than 20 percent in each broad category. Cuts that deep in a single year have occurred only once, from 2009 to 2010, when the temporary increase from the stimulus reverted to more normal levels. Otherwise they are unprecedented, and no wonder. A 20 percent cut in education, for instance, would take some $8 billion out of federal money for schools, deepening the teacher layoffs and other cutbacks already enacted by states.'b'And for what? Cutting any arbitrary amount \xe2\x80\x94 like $100 billion \xe2\x80\x94 from discretionary spending will not result in meaningful long-term deficit reduction because deficits are not driven by discretionary spending. They are driven by rising health care costs and chronic tax shortfalls. Such cuts are even unlikely to result in near-term deficit reduction, because lawmakers would have to vote each year to keep spending at the newly depressed levels, an unlikely \xe2\x80\x94 and undesirable \xe2\x80\x94 prospect.'b'House Republicans claim that voters elected them in November to cut spending. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hear the specifics, and then see what the people want.'b'Handing the Pentagon blank checks backed with borrowed money never impressed us as wise. So we applaud Defense Secretary Robert Gates for making clear last week that those profligate days are over. The $78 billion, five-year reduction in projected spending plans he proposed is the biggest dose of austerity to hit the Pentagon since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.'b'It is especially striking that Mr. Gates is ready to cut, since far less responsible Republicans on Capitol Hill are putting the defense budget off limits for political reasons. But in overall budget terms, it is not big enough.'b'Mr. Gates has managed to contain further real growth in his baseline budget by eliminating costly and unworkable weapons like the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle, cutting future troop strength for the Army and the Marines, increasing health insurance payments for working-age military retirees, and squeezing out bloat and inefficiency across the board. (This does not include combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, which are funded separately.)'b'That will still leave next year\xe2\x80\x99s nonwar military spending at $553 billion, higher in real terms than at the cold war\xe2\x80\x99s peak. And, under Mr. Gates\xe2\x80\x99s plan, it will inch upward for two more years after that before flattening out in fiscal 2015.'b'Even that slowed rate of increase, which depends on uncertain Congressional approval, is fiscally unsustainable. Military spending consumes more than 50 cents of every dollar of federal government discretionary spending.  And the Pentagon spends those dollars with more waste and less economic bang for the buck than other federal departments.'b'President Obama exempted the Pentagon from his announced freeze on most other discretionary spending. His bipartisan budget committee rightly called for ending that exemption. The Pentagon budget has more fat than any other area of federal spending. Mr. Obama must recognize that shielding that fat means savaging vital domestic programs to make up the difference.'b'Mr. Gates has been the Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s best fiscal manager in decades. He brought some discipline to a procurement process notorious for fudging strategic choices and not matching weapons to combat needs. It overspent on fanciful air and sea weapons irrelevant to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, while neglecting desperately needed basics like defensive armor and drones.'b'The Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle that Mr. Gates now wants to eliminate is a $14.4 billion beach-storming amphibious tank dangerously vulnerable to improved anti-ship weapons. Some procurement savings will be shifted to more vital weapons programs, like a new long-range bomber. The rest will be used to slow the growth rate of future military spending.'b'To start chipping into the deficit, the Pentagon must come up with far deeper procurement cuts \xe2\x80\x94 like slashing orders for thousands of new short-range tactical fighters in favor of the new Air Force bomber and unpiloted long-range naval strike aircraft. Tactical fighters are not designed for fighting Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Longer-range aircraft are a smarter response to China\xe2\x80\x99s new emphasis on submarines and anti-ship missiles.'b'Significant budget savings can eventually be reaped from further negotiated nuclear arms reductions with Russia, provided Congressional Republicans do not insist on squandering the money on new nuclear weapons and fantasy-based missile defense shields.'b'The Army and Marine troop cuts, of 27,000 and 20,000, would still leave both forces larger than at the start of Mr. Gates\xe2\x80\x99s tenure four years ago. They are timed to phase in starting in 2015, when the administration presumes that the need for outside military forces in Afghanistan will be significantly reduced. But ground force needs are hard to predict, and an all-volunteer force is hard to build up quickly in wartime. The projected personnel cuts will have to be revisited annually.'b'The only certainty is that nonwar military spending will have to be drastically reduced to leave room for unexpected military missions and to make deficit reduction realistic. If Congressional Republicans are serious about lowering the deficit, they cannot exempt the Pentagon.'b'Lahore, Pakistan'b'TWENTY-SEVEN. That\xe2\x80\x99s the number of bullets a police guard fired into my father before surrendering himself with a sinister smile to the policemen around him. Salmaan Taseer, governor of Punjab, Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s most populous province, 'b'was assassinated on Tuesday'b' \xe2\x80\x94 my brother Shehryar\xe2\x80\x99s 25th birthday \xe2\x80\x94 outside a market near our family home in Islamabad.'b'The guard accused of the killing, Mumtaz Qadri, was assigned that morning to protect my father while he was in the federal capital. According to officials, around 4:15 p.m., as my father was about to step into his car after lunch, Mr. Qadri opened fire.'b'Mr. Qadri and his supporters may have felled a great oak that day, but they are sadly mistaken if they think they have succeeded in silencing my father\xe2\x80\x99s voice or the voices of millions like him who believe in the secular vision of Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah.'b'My father\xe2\x80\x99s life was one of struggle. He was a self-made man, who made and lost and remade his fortune. He was among the first members of the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party when it was founded by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in the late 1960s. He was an intellectual, a newspaper publisher and a writer; he was jailed and tortured for his belief in democracy and freedom. The vile dictatorship of Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq did not take kindly to his pamphleteering for the restoration of democracy.'b'One particularly brutal imprisonment was in a dungeon at Lahore Fort, this city\xe2\x80\x99s Mughal-era citadel. My father was held in solitary confinement for months and was slipped a single meal of half a plate of stewed lentils each day. They told my mother, in her early 20s at the time, that he was dead. She never believed that.'b'Determined, she made friends with the kind man who used to sweep my father\xe2\x80\x99s cell and asked him to pass a note to her husband. My father later told me he swallowed the note, fearing for the sweeper\xe2\x80\x99s life. He scribbled back a reassuring message to my mother: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not made from a wood that burns easily.\xe2\x80\x9d That is the kind of man my father was. He could not be broken.'b'He often quoted verse by his uncle Faiz Ahmed Faiz, one of Urdu\xe2\x80\x99s greatest poets. \xe2\x80\x9cEven if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got shackles on your feet, go. Be fearless and walk. Stand for your cause even if you are martyred,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Faiz. Especially as governor, my father was the first to speak up and stand beside those who had suffered, from the thousands of people displaced by the Kashmir earthquake in 2005 to the family of two teenage brothers who were lynched by a mob last August in Sialkot after a dispute at a cricket match.'b'After 86 members of the Ahmadi sect, considered blasphemous by fundamentalists, were murdered in attacks on two of their mosques in Lahore last May, to the great displeasure of the religious right my father visited the survivors in the hospital. When the floods devastated Pakistan last summer, he was on the go, rallying businessmen for aid, consoling the homeless and building shelters.'b'My father believed that the strict blasphemy laws instituted by General Zia have been frequently misused and ought to be changed. His views were widely misrepresented to give the false impression that he had spoken against Prophet Mohammad. This was untrue, and a criminal abdication of responsibility by his critics, who must now think about what they have caused to happen. According to the authorities, my father\xe2\x80\x99s stand on the blasphemy law was what drove Mr. Qadri to kill him.'b'There are those who say my father\xe2\x80\x99s death was the final nail in the coffin for a tolerant Pakistan. That Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s liberal voices will now be silenced. But we buried a heroic man, not the courage he inspired in others. This week two leading conservative politicians \xe2\x80\x94 former Prime Minister Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain and the cricket-star-turned-politician Imran Khan  \xe2\x80\x94 have taken the same position my father held on the blasphemy laws: they want amendments to prevent misuse.'b'To say that there was a security lapse on Tuesday is an understatement. My father was brutally gunned down by a man hired to protect him. Juvenal once asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWho will guard the guards themselves?\xe2\x80\x9d It is a question all Pakistanis should ask themselves today: If the extremists could get to the governor of the largest province, is anyone safe?'b'It may sound odd, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine my father dying in any other way. Everything he had, he invested in Pakistan, giving livelihoods to tens of thousands, improving the economy. My father believed in our country\xe2\x80\x99s potential. He lived and died for Pakistan. To honor his memory, those who share that belief in Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s future must not stay silent about injustice. We must never be afraid of our enemies. We must never let them win.'b'Sometime in 1611, a new English Bible was published. It was the work of an almost impossibly learned team of men laboring since 1604 under royal mandate. Their purpose, they wrote, was not to make a new translation of the Bible but \xe2\x80\x9cto make a good one better, or out of many good ones, one principal good one.\xe2\x80\x9d What was published, 400 years ago, was indeed one principal good one: the King James Version of the Bible.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s barely possible to overstate the significance of this Bible. Hundreds of millions have been sold. In 1611, it found a critical balance in a world of theological conflict, and it has been beloved since of Protestant churches and congregations of every stripe. By the end of the 17th century it was, simply, the Bible. It has been superseded by translations in more modern English, translations based on sources the King James translators couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have known. But to Christians all around the world, it is still the ancestral language of faith.'b'To modern readers, the English of the King James Version sounds archaic, much as Shakespeare does. But there would have been an archaism for readers even in 1611 because the King James Bible draws heavily from a version of William Tyndale\xe2\x80\x99s New Testament published in 1534 and from translations by Miles Coverdale also published in the 1530s.'b'Tyndale\xe2\x80\x99s aspiration was to make his New Testament accessible to \xe2\x80\x9cthe boy that driveth the plough.\xe2\x80\x9d Though readers often talk about the majesty of the King James Bible, what has made it live is in fact the simplicity of its language.'b'Scholars have often debated just how much the King James Bible has influenced the English language. They count the number of idioms \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cthe powers that be,\xe2\x80\x9d for instance \xe2\x80\x94 that entered the language from the Bible. They look at how often it\xe2\x80\x99s cited in the Oxford English Dictionary.'b'T. S. Eliot and C. S. Lewis deplored the idea of considering the secular literary or linguistic influence of the King James Bible. Eliot said it had such a profound effect because it was \xe2\x80\x9cthe Word of God.\xe2\x80\x9d Lewis went further. He argued that the King James Bible had little influence on the rhythms of English and that many of the Bible\xe2\x80\x99s characteristic rhythms were simply \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable in the English language.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But Lewis missed the point. The King James Bible has had an enormous impact on English for the very reason that it captures and preserves \xe2\x80\x94 and communicates down through the centuries \xe2\x80\x94 the unavoidable rhythms of good English. Its words are almost never Latinate, and its rhythms are never hampered by the literalism that afflicts other translations.'b'It would have been so easy to get that wrong, to let scholarship overwhelm common sense, to let theology engulf plainness. We owe an enormous debt to William Tyndale\xe2\x80\x99s imaginary plowboy. All who speak this wonderful language still speak in the shadow of the King James Bible.'b''b' 'b''b'FOUR months as public editor has given me a working list, perhaps only that, of the challenges The Times faces and the faults readers find in this most important of American newspapers. As a representative of the reader, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to post that list today and invite you to consider it, then add to it as you will.'b'The 'b'blending of opinion with news'b' is a good place to start. Although there is a distinct separation between the Editorial Page operation headed by 'b'Andrew Rosenthal'b' and the news operation headed by 'b'Bill Keller'b', the news pages are laced with analytical and opinion pieces that work against the premise that the news is just the news.'b'The most glaring recent example that drew my eye was the 'b'Dec. 15 front-page column by David Leonhardt analyzing the debate over health care reform.'b' The piece, a day-two follow-up to the news that a federal judge in Virginia had overturned the health care law\xe2\x80\x99s central provision, drew complaints from readers like Sheila R. Markin of Sarasota, Fla., who wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Times does itself no good by putting these articles on the front page. It loses its status as an objective newspaper.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She added, \xe2\x80\x9cI want my newspaper to be known for its unbiased articles on the front page.\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Markin nailed it with this last sentence. I have no problem with 'b'Mr. Leonhardt\xe2\x80\x99s'b' analysis; he\xe2\x80\x99s an accomplished economics writer and is entitled to his view. It was The Times\xe2\x80\x99s  decision to place it on Page 1 that posed the difficulty, sending the message that The Times\xe2\x80\x99s take on health care is synonymous with Mr. Leonhardt\xe2\x80\x99s, which some see as progressive or liberal.'b'The issue of opinion versus news in the news pages is, I think, one of boundaries. In my experience, people value boundaries, rely on them and grow uncomfortable when they move.'b'And here\xe2\x80\x99s another form of boundary-slippage that readers complain about, one that is technology-driven. Once upon a time, the final print edition set a final, definitive version of a story and headline, leaving for posterity an immutable document of record, albeit one gathering dust in the newspaper morgue. No more. Now, appearing online, stories often undergo 'b'more frequent updates'b' and 'b'headline changes'b'. The same story often appears under distinctly different headlines in print, on the Web and on the other digital devices the Times feeds.'b'Amy Goldstein, a reader from Princeton, N.J., wrote to me that she found all this versioning problematic. \xe2\x80\x9cHow does the newspaper of record handle this?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, referring to changing versions of 'b'an obituary of the movie director Arthur Penn'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cI read something, and now poof, it\xe2\x80\x99s gone without a trace.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'While the requirements of digital publishing sometimes make things go \xe2\x80\x9cpoof,\xe2\x80\x9d in other ways the digital environment commits things to a kind of immortality that itself is sometimes unwelcome.'b'In one case I wrote about, 'b'I argued that the paper had run roughshod in using the names of a 4-year-old and a 5-year-old who were named in a civil suit.'b' But there is no fix for a problem like this after-the-fact. When it comes to the notion of expunging the identities, Times policy is strict: the electronic record is not to be changed. To me, this argues for taking far more care in protecting individuals\xe2\x80\x99 privacy in the first place.'b'Indeed, taking sufficient care on the front end of reporting and publishing is one of the most difficult challenges for The Times as news consumption shifts rapidly to digital venues like the Web, tablets and cellphones. The newspaper scored a clear victory in this respect with its handling of the 'b'WikiLeaks material.'b' With its deep roster of experienced reporters and computer-aided reporting expertise, The Times carefully mounted a responsible assemblage of coverage.'b'Floyd Abrams, the prominent First Amendment lawyer, gives The Times\xe2\x80\x99s WikiLeaks work very high marks. And he notes that the stakes are huge, given the peril that news organizations face when dealing with secret material \xe2\x80\x94 dealings that could potentially subject them to prosecution under the Espionage Act.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOnce the legislature or the judiciary gets the notion that the entities before it are reckless,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Abrams warns, \xe2\x80\x9cthe less likely they are to give them the benefit of the doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Unfortunately, though, the pressure at The Times to produce in a high-speed news environment sometimes leads to much less careful work. You could ask Greg Brock, the senior editor who handles corrections for The Times. In 2010, he told me, The Times corrected 3,500 errors, most commonly spellings, dates and historical facts.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat leads to these type errors?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Brock said. \xe2\x80\x9cReporters and editors are rushed on deadline; they simply fail to double-check; the reporter misreads her notes. But many of these errors stem from Googling a name and taking the spelling \xe2\x80\x94 or historical fact \xe2\x80\x94 as gospel.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Speed has other ill effects. For journalists charged with feeding the digital news flow, life is a barely sustainable cycle of reporting, blogging, tweeting, Facebooking and, in some cases, moderating the large volume of readers who comment online. I applaud these journalists for their commitment but worry that the requirements of the digital age are translating into more errors and eventual burnout.'b'Certainly, as Mr. Brock also notes, the digital age has spawned a growing chorus of bloggers who closely monitor The Times. \xe2\x80\x9cA blogger points out an error, challenges something The Times has published and urges its followers to write The Times,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo they do so by the hundreds \xe2\x80\x94 particularly on politically charged issues.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Looking ahead, the twin demands of digital and print will remain for the foreseeable future (and p.s., it\xe2\x80\x99s not readily foreseeable).

In doing so, Mr. Douthat ignores the serious health risks that pregnancies sometimes incur. Should women with unwanted pregnancies be compelled to take those risks?'b'Consider New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve, a typical night on my obstetrics floor. Several pregnant women were suffering from complications. Two needed emergency surgery. One was 19 years old and 20 weeks pregnant with an abnormal fetus. She had decided to see the pregnancy through. But the amniotic sac ruptured five months early. We had to stop the heavy bleeding and infection that followed. Her baby didn\xe2\x80\x99t survive.'b'Abortion opponents would impose all the risks of pregnancy on women who wish to end their pregnancies.

What if one or both of us were unemployed?'b'How might our thrill at the short-term changes in my body and the long-term changes in our lives transform into dread, depression and anxiety?'b'Moreover, just because expectant parents are able to think of the fetus as a baby does not mean it actually is one, and that abortion is the same as the taking of an actual life, rather than a fantasized one.'b'Sarah E.

And yet, the circumstances of conception don\xe2\x80\x99t change the fact that a child in the womb is a separate and unique human being, morally and ethically entitled to the same rights as you and I.'b'Mr. Douthat also points out that adoption has become an unlikely choice for young mothers like Markai Durham, the subject of an MTV show, who says she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to give up a child she carried in her womb for nine months, and opts, instead, to kill that child.'b'Did anyone along the way point out the deadly flaw in her thinking?

Many studies in fact suggest that, in a culture that treasures biological children, prospective parents opt first for fertility treatments and then, if at all, pursue adoption.'b'A thoughtful look at reproductive decision-making is always welcome, but a broadside that once again seeks to demonize and make guilty those women who elect to terminate their pregnancies is not adding to the civil discourse.'b'Conflating fertility, adoption and abortion in no way alleviates the myriad challenges involved in deciding whether or not to become a parent.'b'Joan Malin'b'\nPresident and C.E.O.'b'\nPlanned Parenthood of New York City'b'\nNew York, Jan. 3, 2011'b''b''b''b'\xc2\x95'b'To the Editor:'b'I disagree with Ross Douthat\xe2\x80\x99s appraisal of adoption as an answer to unplanned pregnancies and infertility.

His paranoid Internet ravings about government mind control place him well beyond usual ideological categories.'b'But he is very much a part of a widespread squall of fear, anger and intolerance that has produced violent threats against scores of politicians and infected the political mainstream with violent imagery. With easy and legal access to semiautomatic weapons like the one used in the parking lot, those already teetering on the edge of sanity can turn a threat into a nightmare.'b'Last spring, 'b'Capitol security officials'b' said threats against members of Congress had  tripled over the previous year, almost all from opponents of health care reform. An effigy of Representative Frank Kratovil Jr., a Maryland Democrat, was hung from a gallows outside his district office. Ms. Giffords\xe2\x80\x99s  district office door was smashed after the health vote, possibly by a bullet.'b'The federal judge who was killed, John Roll, had received 'b'hundreds of menacing phone calls and death threats'b', especially after he allowed a case to proceed  against a rancher accused of assaulting 16 Mexicans as they tried to cross his land. This rage, stirred by talk-radio hosts, required marshals to give the judge and his family 24-hour protection for a month. Around the nation, threats to federal judges have soared for a decade.'b'It is facile and mistaken to attribute this particular madman\xe2\x80\x99s act directly to Republicans or Tea Party members. But it is legitimate to hold Republicans and particularly their most virulent supporters in the media responsible for the gale of anger that has produced the vast majority of these threats, setting the nation on edge. Many on the right have exploited the arguments of division, reaping political power by demonizing immigrants, or welfare recipients, or bureaucrats. They seem to have persuaded many Americans that the government is not just misguided, but the enemy of the people.'b'That whirlwind has touched down most forcefully in Arizona, which Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik described after the shooting as  the capital of  \xe2\x80\x9cthe anger, the hatred and the bigotry that goes on in this country.\xe2\x80\x9d Anti-immigrant sentiment in the state, firmly opposed by Ms. Giffords, has reached the point where Latino studies programs that advocate ethnic solidarity 'b'have actually been made illegal.'b''b'Its gun laws are'b' among the most lenient'b', allowing even a disturbed man like Mr. Loughner to buy a pistol and carry it concealed without a special permit.

Now, having seen first hand the horror of political violence, Arizona should lead the nation in quieting the voices of intolerance, demanding an end to the temptations of bloodshed, and imposing sensible controls on its instruments.'b'When John F. Kennedy visited Dallas in November of 1963, Texas was awash in right-wing anger \xe2\x80\x94 over perceived cold-war betrayals, over desegregation, over the perfidies of liberalism in general. Adlai Stevenson, then ambassador to the U.N., had been spit on during his visit to the city earlier that fall.

Instead, he was a 'b'Marxist of sorts'b' (albeit one disillusioned by his experiences in Soviet Russia), an activist on behalf of Castro\xe2\x80\x99s Cuba, and a man whose previous plot had been aimed at a far-right ex-general named Edwin Walker. The anti-Kennedy excesses of Texas conservatives were real enough, but the president\xe2\x80\x99s assassin acted on a far more obscure set of motivations.'b'Nine years after Kennedy was killed, George Wallace embarked on his second campaign for the presidency. This was the early 1970s, the high tide of far-left violence  \xe2\x80\x94  the era of the Black Panthers, the Weathermen, the Symbionese Liberation Army  \xe2\x80\x94  and Wallace\xe2\x80\x99s race-baiting politics made him an obvious target for protests. On his final, fateful day of campaigning, he faced  a barrage of coins, oranges, rocks and tomatoes, amid shouts of \xe2\x80\x9cremember Selma!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHitler for vice president!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But Arthur Bremer, who shot Wallace that afternoon, paralyzing him from the waist down, had only a tenuous connection to left-wing politics. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t care much about Wallace\xe2\x80\x99s views on race: he just wanted to assassinate somebody (Richard Nixon had been his original target), as \xe2\x80\x9ca statement of my manhood for the world to see.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s possible that Jared Lee Loughner, the young man behind Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s rampage in Tucson, will have a more direct connection to partisan politics than an earlier generation\xe2\x80\x99s gunmen did. Indeed, many observers seem to be taking a kind of comfort from that possibility: there\xe2\x80\x99s been a rush to declare this tragedy a teachable moment  \xe2\x80\x94  an opportunity for people to cool their rhetoric, abandon their anger, and renounce the kind of martial imagery that inspired Sarah Palin\xe2\x80\x99s PAC to place a target over Gabrielle Giffords\xe2\x80\x99s district just months before Loughner gunned down the Arizona congresswoman.'b'But chances are that Loughner\xe2\x80\x99s motives will prove as irreducibly complex as those of most of his predecessors in assassination. Violence in American politics tends to bubble up from a world that\xe2\x80\x99s far stranger than any Glenn Beck monologue  \xe2\x80\x94  a murky landscape where worldviews get cobbled together from a host of baroque conspiracy theories, and where the line between ideological extremism and mental illness gets blurry fast.'b'This is the world that gave us Oswald and Bremer. More recently, it\xe2\x80\x99s given us figures like James W. von Brunn, the neo-Nazi who opened fire at  the Holocaust Museum in 2009, and James Lee, who took hostages at the Discovery Channel last summer to express his displeasure over population growth. These are figures better analyzed by novelists than pundits: as Walter Kirn 'b'put it'b' Saturday,  they\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x9cself-anointed knights templar of the collective shadow realm, not secular political actors in extremis.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This won\xe2\x80\x99t stop partisans from making hay out of Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s tragedy, of course. The Democratic operative who was quoted in 'b'Politico'b' saying that his party needs \xe2\x80\x9cto deftly pin this on the Tea Partiers\xe2\x80\x9d was just stating the obvious: after a political season rife with overheated rhetoric from conservative \xe2\x80\x9crevolutionaries,\xe2\x80\x9d the attempted murder of a Democratic congresswoman is a potential gift to liberalism.'b'But if overheated rhetoric and martial imagery really led inexorably to murder, then both parties would belong in the dock. (It took conservative bloggers about five minutes to come up with Democratic campaign materials  that employed 'b'targets'b' and 'b'crosshairs'b' against Republican politicians.) When our politicians and media loudmouths act like fools and zealots, they should be held responsible for being fools and zealots. They shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be held responsible for the darkness that always waits to swallow up the unstable and the lost.'b'We should remember, too, that there are places where mainstream political movements really are responsible for violence against their rivals. (Last week\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'assassination'b' of a Pakistani politician who dared to defend a Christian is a stark reminder of what that sort of world can look like.) Not so in America: From the Republican leadership to the Tea Party grass roots, all of Gabrielle Giffords\xe2\x80\x99s political opponents were united in horror at the weekend\xe2\x80\x99s events. There is no faction in American politics that actually wants its opponents dead.'b'That may seem like a small blessing, amid so much tragedy and loss. But it is a blessing worth remembering nonetheless.'b'Brisbane, Australia'b'THERE was cricket in Sydney last week. The crowd wore pink fluorescent wigs and hats cut from watermelons. Shirts were optional. Australians are fun-loving when there is fun to be had. It\xe2\x80\x99s part of our national character. So is our disregard for authority, which we celebrate, while at the same time being one of the most law-abiding nations on earth.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s what the rest of the world sees, and it\xe2\x80\x99s all true. But we want to see something more in ourselves, a hard-working stoicism \xe2\x80\x94 and right now it\xe2\x80\x99s the northeast state of Queensland, where 'b'once-in-a-century flooding'b' has devastated countless communities, that shows it most clearly.'b'All maps of Queensland are deceptive. They show inland plains crossed by rivers, always colored blue. It\xe2\x80\x99s tempting to imagine riverboats hauling freight, green fields stretching out from either bank, industrial towns and cities drawing water for their factories.'b'What the maps don\xe2\x80\x99t reveal is that the rivers are often only possibilities. Many are dry for years, their waters long since soaked up by the parched ground and left as a chain of water holes.'b'The maps also don\xe2\x80\x99t say that, every few years, the rivers flood. Once in a generation, they cover the land. And sometimes, like now, they tear the state apart.'b'To the north and west of Brisbane, the state capital and my hometown, Queensland faces a flood affecting an area the size of Texas and Oklahoma combined. The mines that supply one-third of the world\xe2\x80\x99s coking coal are shut down. Crops have been destroyed and the soil that grew them has been carried away. Mercifully few lives have been lost so far, but the economic impact has been estimated at $5 billion. Some 200,000 people have been affected, many of them forced from their homes by water and mud.'b'Nevertheless, there is none of the clamor of disaster, none of the chaos one might expect. Crisis management plans have been activated. Townships, towns and cities are hard at work, not only as governments but as communities. Neighbors are helping neighbors, and then helping people they have never met. When the hard-hit coastal city of Rockhampton put a call out over the radio for people to fill sandbags, 70 volunteers turned up within minutes.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a calm resilience too. Rockhampton\xe2\x80\x99s Fitzroy Hotel, surrounded by floodwaters that have risen to an inch or so below its floorboards, has rebranded itself as the Fitzroy Float-El. Its customers now arrive by boat. Inside, on the widescreen TVs normally tuned to sports, the Fitzroy is showing footage of the last inundation, 19 years ago. Veterans of that flood are turning up to watch themselves filling sandbags, back when they were thinner and had more hair.'b'Even after the rain stops, we\xe2\x80\x99re told, it will be weeks before all the water is gone. As the less-fortunate evacuees return home, they will find mud everywhere: in their filing cabinets, their kitchen cupboards, their photo albums. As I learned in the aftermath of the Brisbane flood of 1974, the smell will remain for years \xe2\x80\x94 a swampy stench that comes out of the walls and down from the ceiling on hot days.'b'Those people will need room for grief and anger. Most of them, though, when interviewed standing in the wreckage, talk about how life goes on.'b'Events like this flood not only show our stoicism, but create it. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to Queenslanders, like all Australians, that we see ourselves as people who look adversity in the eye, stare it down and band together to overcome it.'b'Houses will be repaired, and new ones will be built. Businesses will get back to work. In ground that was baked dry but is now soaked deep, eggs will hatch, seeds will germinate and hidden species will reveal themselves and make the most of this change in their luck before the next drought sets in. Life will go on and, for farmers and those dependent on the land, the next crop should be a good one, if the weather holds.'b'In 2009, Gabrielle Giffords was holding a \xe2\x80\x9cCongress on Your Corner\xe2\x80\x9d meeting at a Safeway supermarket in her district when a protester, who was waving a sign that said \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t Tread on Me,\xe2\x80\x9d waved a little too strenuously. The pistol he was carrying under his armpit fell out of his holster.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt bounced. That concerned me,\xe2\x80\x9d Rudy Ruiz, the father of one of Giffords\xe2\x80\x99s college interns at the time, told me then. He had been at the event and had gotten a larger vision than he had anticipated of what a career in politics entailed. \xe2\x80\x9cI just thought, \xe2\x80\x98What would happen if it had gone off? Could my daughter have gotten hurt?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'b'Giffords brushed off the incident. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you represent a district  \xe2\x80\x94  the home of the O.K. Corral and Tombstone, the town too tough to die \xe2\x80\x94  nothing\xe2\x80\x99s a surprise,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. At the time, it struck me as an interesting attempt to meld crisis control with a promotion of local tourist attractions.'b'Now, of course, the district has lost more people in a shooting in a shopping center parking lot than died at the gunfight of the O.K. Corral, and the story  of the dropped pistol has a tragically different cast.'b'In soft-pedaling that  2009  encounter, Giffords was doing a balancing act that she\xe2\x80\x99d perfected during her political career as a rather progressive Democrat in a increasingly conservative state. She was the spunky Western girl with a populist agenda mixed with down-home values, one of which was opposition to gun control. But those protesters had been following her around for a while. Her staff members were clearly scared for her, and they put me in touch with Ruiz, who told me the story.'b'Back then, the amazing thing about the incident in the supermarket parking lot was that the guy with a handgun in his armpit was not arrested. Since then, Arizona has completely eliminated the whole concept of requiring a concealed weapon permit. Last year, it got 2 points out of a possible 100 in the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence state score card, avoiding a zero only because its Legislature has not \xe2\x80\x94  so far \xe2\x80\x94  voted to force colleges to let people bring their guns on campuses.'b'Today, the amazing thing about the reaction to the Giffords shooting is that virtually all the discussion about how to prevent a recurrence has been focusing on improving the tone of our political discourse. That would certainly be great. But you do not hear much about the fact that Jared Loughner came to Giffords\xe2\x80\x99s sweet gathering with a semiautomatic weapon that he was able to buy legally because the law restricting their sale expired in 2004 and Congress did not have the guts to face up to the National Rifle Association and extend it.'b'If Loughner had gone to the Safeway carrying a regular pistol, the kind most Americans think of when they think of the right to bear arms, Giffords would probably still have been shot and we would still be having that conversation about whether it was a sane idea to put her Congressional district in the cross hairs of a rifle on the Internet.'b'But we might not have lost a federal judge, a 76-year-old church volunteer, two elderly women, Giffords\xe2\x80\x99s 30-year-old constituent services director and a 9-year-old girl who had recently been elected to the student council at her school and went to the event because she wanted to see how democracy worked.'b'Loughner\xe2\x80\x99s gun, a 9-millimeter Glock, is extremely easy to fire over and over, and it can carry a 30-bullet clip. It is \xe2\x80\x9cnot suited for hunting or personal protection,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul Helmke, the president of the Brady Campaign. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat it\xe2\x80\x99s good for is killing and injuring a lot of people quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'America has a long, terrible history of political assassinations and attempts at political assassination. What we did not have until now is a history of attempted political assassination that took the lives of a large number of innocent bystanders. The difference is not about the Second Amendment. It\xe2\x80\x99s about a technology the founding fathers could never have imagined.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf this was the modern equivalent of what Sirhan Sirhan used to shoot Robert Kennedy or Arthur Bremer used to shoot George Wallace, you\xe2\x80\x99d be talking about one or two victims,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helmke.'b'Giffords represents a pragmatic, interest-balancing form of politics that\xe2\x80\x99s out of fashion. But, in that spirit, we should be able to find a way to accommodate the strong desire in many parts of the country for easy access to firearms with sane regulation of the kinds of weapons that make it easiest for crazy people to create mass slaughter. Most politicians won\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it because they\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of the N.R.A., whose agenda is driven by the people who sell guns and want the right to sell as many as possible.'b'Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it seem like the least we can do?'b'As Mayor Michael Bloomberg went to red alert for the small snowstorm that swept into New York City on Friday, it was fairly evident that the fuss over snow removal wasn\xe2\x80\x99t only, or even mostly, about snow. It was about the mayor.'b'One year into his third term, Mr. Bloomberg has a dismal 37 percent approval rating, according to the Marist poll released on Thursday. Every New Yorker knows that Mr. Bloomberg has had better economic news to peddle, and has been making quite a name for himself on the national scene promoting big solutions to big issues.'b'The unease is about how he is doing back home, a concern that has been boiling for some time and spilled over after the post-Christmas blizzard, which overwhelmed the city and city government alike.'b'It did not help that the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s first advice to New Yorkers was essentially to quit whining, get out and go to a Broadway show. He later apologized and quickly reorganized how the Sanitation Department operated when this second snowstorm arrived.'b'But Mr. Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s problems with New Yorkers predated the storm. His choice of a non-educator, Cathleen Black, as schools chancellor felt idiosyncratic to many people. His Police Department, troubled about whether its famous statistics are valid, has finally found the need for  a review by three former prosecutors.'b'Then there is the scandal involving CityTime, a system that was supposed to streamline employee timekeeping in the city. Federal prosecutors recently charged consultants in the project with an $80 million fraud scheme. And, as Comptroller John Liu has been saying for over a year, the project is years behind schedule and 10 times over its original budget of about $68 million.'b'Here we have a technology mix-up overseen by the mayor who made several sizable fortunes in technology, a management glitch for the mayor known as a management guru. Even his fuming about misplaced trust and \xe2\x80\x9cno tolerance for this whatsoever\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t explain enough about how so much of this slipshod work slipped past his desk unnoticed. Last week  Mr. Liu canceled a $286 million contract for emergency communications \xe2\x80\x9cto prevent CityTime 2.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It is far too soon to write off the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s third term.

The prospects may be even grimmer this year, with nearly every important committee chair in the now Republican-controlled House dismissing the threat of global warming or the human contribution to it.'b'As Congress dawdles and denies, some states are moving forward. Massachusetts recently  announced a plan to curb emissions from homes, cars and factories by one-fourth below 1990 levels over 10 years \xe2\x80\x94 considerably more aggressive than President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s commitment in Copenhagen to reduce emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels. The plan relies on existing technologies to produce more power from renewable sources like wind, tougher energy-efficiency standards for buildings and more investments in mass transit.'b'Massachusetts will also benefit from its participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a 2008 agreement among 10 Eastern states, including New York, to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. These emissions have already dropped dramatically in the region, in part because utilities have been switching from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas.'b'The Massachusetts announcement follows California\xe2\x80\x99s approval of a cap-and-trade program requiring 360 large enterprises, including refineries and power plants, to gradually reduce emissions to help achieve a statewide reduction of 15 percent from current levels by 2020 \xe2\x80\x94 just under Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s target.'b'As in other cap-and-trade programs \xe2\x80\x94 including proposals that stalled in Congress \xe2\x80\x94 the plan will require each facility to reduce emissions or buy allowances to pollute. This should encourage industry to invest in cleaner technologies while raising money for the state and local communities to improve energy efficiency.'b'The trading program was the last missing piece of a broad initiative signed into law by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006. Among other things, it requires that an increasing percentage of California\xe2\x80\x99s energy be generated by wind and solar power. It also meshes neatly with the state\xe2\x80\x99s strict greenhouse gas limits on vehicles, which paved the way for the national standards adopted by the Obama administration.'b'Other states and cities, including New York City, have embraced one or more aggressive strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. None of this is enough; a national policy would be much better. One hopes that Washington will get the message \xe2\x80\x94 before it\xe2\x80\x99s too late.'b'To the Editor:'b'The federal court decision to reject the regulation requiring all New York City businesses selling tobacco products to post tobacco health warnings is a huge disappointment (\xe2\x80\x9c'b'Judge Rejects City Law on Antismoking Posters'b',\xe2\x80\x9d news article, Dec. 30).'b'The city\xe2\x80\x99s warning signs serve as a reminder for consumers about the harm caused by tobacco products.

I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach ever 'b'since the final stages of the 2008'b' campaign. I remembered the upsurge in political hatred after Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s election in 1992 \xe2\x80\x94 an upsurge that culminated in the Oklahoma City bombing. And you could see, just by watching the crowds at McCain-Palin rallies, that it was ready to happen again. The Department of Homeland Security reached the same conclusion: in April 2009 an internal 'b'report'b' warned that right-wing extremism was on the rise, with a growing potential for violence.'b'Conservatives denounced that report. But there has, in fact, been a rising tide of threats and vandalism aimed at elected officials, including both Judge John Roll, who was killed Saturday, and Representative Gabrielle Giffords. One of these days, someone was bound to take it to the next level. And now someone has.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s true that the shooter in Arizona appears to have been mentally troubled. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that his act can or should be treated as an isolated event, having nothing to do with the national climate.'b'Last spring Politico.com reported on a surge in threats against members of Congress, which were already up by 300 percent. A number of the people making those threats had a history of mental illness \xe2\x80\x94 but something about the current state of America has been causing far more disturbed people than before to act out their illness by threatening, or actually engaging in, political violence.'b'And there\xe2\x80\x99s not much question what has changed. As Clarence Dupnik, the sheriff responsible for dealing with the Arizona shootings, put it, it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cthe vitriolic rhetoric that we hear day in and day out from people in the radio business and some people in the TV business.\xe2\x80\x9d The vast majority of those who listen to that toxic rhetoric stop short of actual violence, but some, inevitably, cross that line.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s important to be clear here about the nature of our sickness. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a general lack of \xe2\x80\x9ccivility,\xe2\x80\x9d the favorite term of pundits who want to wish away fundamental policy disagreements. Politeness may be a virtue, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a big difference between bad manners and calls, explicit or implicit, for violence; insults aren\xe2\x80\x99t the same as incitement.'b'The point is that there\xe2\x80\x99s room in a democracy for people who ridicule and denounce those who disagree with them; there isn\xe2\x80\x99t any place for eliminationist rhetoric, for suggestions that those on the other side of a debate must be removed from that debate by whatever means necessary.'b'And it\xe2\x80\x99s the saturation of our political discourse \xe2\x80\x94 and especially our airwaves \xe2\x80\x94 with eliminationist rhetoric that lies behind the rising tide of violence.'b'Where\xe2\x80\x99s that toxic rhetoric coming from? Let\xe2\x80\x99s not make a false pretense of balance: it\xe2\x80\x99s coming, overwhelmingly, from the right. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine a Democratic member of Congress urging constituents to be \xe2\x80\x9carmed and dangerous\xe2\x80\x9d without being ostracized; but Representative Michele Bachmann, who did just that, is a rising star in the G.O.P.'b'And there\xe2\x80\x99s a huge contrast in the media. Listen to Rachel Maddow or Keith Olbermann, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear a lot of caustic remarks and mockery aimed at Republicans. But you won\xe2\x80\x99t hear jokes about shooting government officials  or beheading a journalist  at The Washington Post. Listen to Glenn Beck or Bill O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly, and you will.'b'Of course, the likes of Mr. Beck and Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly are responding to popular demand. Citizens of other democracies may marvel at the American psyche, at the way efforts by mildly liberal presidents to expand health coverage are met with cries of tyranny and talk of armed resistance. Still, that\xe2\x80\x99s what happens whenever a Democrat occupies the White House, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a market for anyone willing to stoke that anger.'b'But even if hate is what many want to hear, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t excuse those who pander to that desire. They should be shunned by all decent people.'b'Unfortunately, that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been happening: the purveyors of hate have been treated with respect, even deference, by the G.O.P. establishment. As David Frum, the former Bush speechwriter, has put it, \xe2\x80\x9cRepublicans originally thought that Fox worked for us and now we\xe2\x80\x99re discovering we work for Fox.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'So will the Arizona massacre make our discourse less toxic?

Some $80 billion was withdrawn in 2010, on top of nearly $240 billion in the three years before that.'b'Why the retreat? One explanation is reasonable doubt about the economy. Of late, profits, and related stock-market gains, have been fueled not by increased revenues but by layoffs and other cuts \xe2\x80\x94  an unsustainable pattern. Another explanation is a loss of faith in financial markets. The Dodd-Frank reform law could help restore that faith, but the new Republican majority in the House has vowed to try to block the law\xe2\x80\x99s implementation, including regulations to make deal-making by banks more transparent. Some Democrats may join in.'b'Without reform, investors are right to be leery.

In the debate on financial reform, Senator Tim Johnson, a Democrat of South Dakota, fought a provision that would have required stockbrokers who give investment advice to act in their clients\xe2\x80\x99 best interest and not in their own interest in selling expensive products. Instead, Congress told the Securities and Exchange Commission to study the issue \xe2\x80\x94 and report back this month. Mr. Johnson now leads the Banking Committee. We fear that means a tough road ahead for even this basic protection.'b'Industry lobbyists are also fighting investor protections.

The central bank has increased interest rates twice since October, and in recent months it has boosted banks\xe2\x80\x99 reserve requirements three times and introduced price controls on food.'b'Annual inflation still hit 5.1 percent in November, the highest in more than two years, while higher interest rates are pulling in more money from abroad, fueling a housing bubble and further complicating economic management. Price controls and crackdowns on hoarding might temporarily ease the inflation rate, but they cannot provide a lasting solution. They tend to push businesses to the black market and depress production of regulated staples, leading to shortages \xe2\x80\x94 and often more inflation.'b'Allowing the renminbi to rise substantially would be far more effective. It would reduce the domestic price of imports, pressuring local producers to keep prices low. And it would temper money inflows by introducing a dose of uncertainty to the exchange rate. A rising currency could ultimately prove far less damaging, in terms of lost growth and employment, than the raft of conflicting policies that the Chinese government is deploying, so far unsuccessfully, to keep rising prices at bay.'b'So why won\xe2\x80\x99t China let the renminbi rise? The most plausible answer is that powerful interests in the export sector are swaying its decisions. Cheap exports have turbo-charged China\xe2\x80\x99s growth, but these days it is generating very few new jobs. And the policies supporting the export sector are detrimental to many Chinese, who earn little and pay more than they might for imports.'b'A more expensive renminbi would cool inflation.

The government could deploy some of the hundreds of billons of dollars of reserves it has amassed (now parked in American Treasury bonds in order to keep a cheap currency) to pay for pensions and health insurance for ordinary people.

Washington imposed sanctions on Belarus after the fraudulent 2006 vote and should consider whether they should be tightened.'b'The European Union has greater leverage and must re-evaluate its effort to encourage reform in Belarus with offers of improved relations, credit and economic aid.

It has announced plans to abolish national visa fees for Belarussian citizens, open universities to independent-thinking Belarussians who can no longer study at home and create a center in Warsaw for the Belarussian opposition. Poland, Sweden, Germany, Britain and the Czech Republic are also pushing the European Union to reinstate a travel ban that was imposed on Mr. Lukashenko and other officials after the 2006 vote.'b'Mr. Lukashenko clearly thinks that his improving relations with Russia means he can thumb his nose at the West.

Congressional bullies pressed their advantage, using threats and violence to steer debate, silence opposition and influence votes.'b'In 1842, Representative Thomas Arnold of Tennessee, a member of the Whig Party, learned the hard way that these bullies meant business. After he reprimanded a pro-slavery member of his own party, two Southern Democrats stalked toward him, at least one of whom was armed with a bowie knife \xe2\x80\x94 a 6- to 12-inch blade often worn strapped to the back. Calling Arnold a \xe2\x80\x9cdamned coward,\xe2\x80\x9d his angry colleagues threatened to cut his throat \xe2\x80\x9cfrom ear to ear.\xe2\x80\x9d But Arnold wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a man to back down.  Ten years earlier, he had subdued an armed assassin on the Capitol steps.'b'As alarming as these outbursts were, until the 1840s, reporters played them down, in part to avoid becoming embroiled in fights themselves. (A good many reporters received beatings from outraged congressmen; one nearly had his finger bitten off.) So Americans knew relatively little of congressional violence.'b'That changed with the arrival of the telegraph. Congressmen suddenly had to confront the threat \xe2\x80\x94 or temptation \xe2\x80\x94 of \xe2\x80\x9cinstant\xe2\x80\x9d nationwide publicity. As Senator John Parker Hale of New Hampshire reminded his colleagues within minutes of the Foote-Benton clash, reports were \xe2\x80\x9calready traveling with lightning speed over the telegraph wires to the remotest borders of the Republic.\xe2\x80\x9d He added,  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not impossible that even now it may have been rumored in the city of St. Louis that several senators are dead and weltering in their blood on the floor of the Senate.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Violence was news, and news could spawn violence. Something had to be done, but what? To many, the answer was obvious: watch your words. As one onlooker wrote to the speaker of the House shortly after Sumner\xe2\x80\x99s caning, \xe2\x80\x9cgentlemen\xe2\x80\x9d who took part in the  debate over slavery should \xe2\x80\x9cscrupulously avoid the utterance of unnecessarily harsh language.\xe2\x80\x9d There was no other way to prevent the \xe2\x80\x9calmost murderous feeling\xe2\x80\x9d that could lead to \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrations upon the floor, which in the present state of excitement, would almost certainly lead to a general melee and perhaps a dozen deaths in the twinkling of an eye.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Unfortunately, such admonitions had little effect. The violence in Congress continued to build until the outbreak of the Civil War.'b'Today, in the wake of an episode of violence against a member of Congress, we\xe2\x80\x99re again lamenting  the state of political rhetoric, now spread faster than ever via Twitter, Web sites, text messaging and e-mail. Once again, politicians are considering bearing arms \xe2\x80\x94  not to use against one another, but potentially against an angry public.'b'And once again we\xe2\x80\x99re reminded that words matter. Communication is the heart and soul of American democratic governance, but there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been much fruitful discourse of late \xe2\x80\x94 among members of Congress, between the people and their representatives or in the public sphere. We need to get better at communicating not only quickly, but civilly.'b'After a strong and well-financed campaign by socially conservative groups, voters in Iowa in November removed three sitting State Supreme Court justices who had participated in 2009\xe2\x80\x99s unanimous ruling permitting same-sex marriage. Now several freshman Republican members of the Iowa House are readying a bill calling for the impeachment of the court\xe2\x80\x99s four other justices whose terms were not up for renewal.'b'For more than 200 years, no state or federal judge has been impeached to punish a judicial opinion \xe2\x80\x94 a record that has helped preserve the fair functioning of the courts. That isn\xe2\x80\x99t stopping these politicians, nor is the fact that issuing a controversial ruling does not amount to the \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor or malfeasance in office\xe2\x80\x9d required for impeachment under the Iowa Constitution.'b'Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s new Republican governor, Terry Branstad, has voiced opposition to the impeachment effort. Although he disagrees with the court\xe2\x80\x99s marriage decision, he says the appropriate remedy is to defeat the justices in a retention vote. The Republican leader of the Iowa House, Kraig Paulsen, is bobbing and weaving, suggesting that impeachment is not one of his priorities, but that he will not stand in the way. The Democratic minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, has made clear his determination to tie up the chamber with dozens of amendments if necessary to block a vote on impeachment.'b'Meantime, a leader of the November ouster campaign, Bob Vander Plaats, plans to travel throughout Iowa in coming weeks to rally support for his call for the resignation of the four remaining justices. His group, the Family Leader, has already begun raising money to carry on the fight.'b'It is unlikely that Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic-controlled Senate would go along with removing the judges, but an impeachment trial would be disruptive and intentionally intimidating. The nation\xe2\x80\x99s democracy and cherished rights rely on keeping court decision-making above the fickle tugs of ordinary politics. Ousting judges to register disagreement with a particular court decision is a dangerous road to go down.'b'We welcome the announcement of a permanent cease-fire by the Basque separatist group ETA. After taking more than 800 lives since the late-1960s, ETA\xe2\x80\x99s senseless violence cannot end one day too soon. But what should have been an unequivocal renunciation of terrorism fell far short of what the Spanish, and Basque, people were entitled to expect.'b'The announcement was implicitly linked to political concessions, and it contained no commitment to dispose of ETA\xe2\x80\x99s lethal arsenal. The government of Prime Minister Jos\xc3\xa9 Luis Rodr\xc3\xadguez Zapatero of Spain rightly declared the announcement inadequate and demanded an unconditional cease-fire and disarmament.'b'ETA has announced \xe2\x80\x9cpermanent\xe2\x80\x9d cease-fires before, notably in March 2006. Mr. Zapatero opened peace talks, but nine months later ETA claimed that political progress had been too slow and returned to its murderous violence. Mr. Zapatero\xe2\x80\x99s tougher stand this time means that, for now, there will be no easing of the legal ban that prevents ETA\xe2\x80\x99s political allies from running for office and no slackening of the police pressure that has put top ETA leaders in jail or on the run.'b'During the Franco dictatorship, ETA\xe2\x80\x99s separatist goals, though not its terrorist methods, enjoyed support among Basques who had suffered decades of oppression. Those days are long past. The Basque region is now one of Spain\xe2\x80\x99s most affluent and enjoys substantial autonomy. ETA\xe2\x80\x99s killing sprees have turned former sympathizers into bitter enemies.'b'Spanish leaders have to wrestle with wrenching economic problems and cannot afford to tie themselves in knots over equivocally worded cease-fire declarations. If ETA is serious about peace, it must prove it by dropping all political conditions and verifiably disarming.'b'Washington'b'AS millions of us try to lose the weight we gained over the holidays, the Food and Drug Administration is due to make a decision with implications for those tipping the scales into obesity: whether to approve gastric lap bands for people who are just slightly obese. These devices are now approved only for dangerously obese adults, with a body mass index of at least 35.'b'Like gastric bypass surgery, a lap band reduces the size of the stomach so that eating a large meal is impossible. As a result, patients sometimes lose 100 pounds or more within a year, and that weight often stays off at least another year.'b'The surgery is more effective for most people than diet, exercise or diet pills. And since lap bands are less invasive, expensive and risky than gastric bypass, it is reasonable to ask whether the F.D.A. should approve the product for people seeking less drastic weight loss. Last month,'b' an advisory panel said it should'b'.'b'If the agency bases its decision on science rather than sympathy, however, it will reject the recommendation \xe2\x80\x94 because there is no research proving that a lap band provides slightly obese patients with long-term health benefits that are greater than its risks.'b'Some experts, including most bariatric surgeons, say the benefits are obvious even if the research is skimpy. And although most of them have financial ties to the lap-band industry, they also have an important fact on their side: weight loss during the first year after the procedure is often impressive.'b'But what matters for most patients is whether a lap band is more effective than diet and exercise for years and years after the surgery \xe2\x80\x94 and unfortunately we don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it is.'b'Under the proposed change, lap bands would be approved, for example, for a 5-foot-6-inch woman weighing 186 pounds (a body mass index of 30) who does not have diabetes or heart disease but does have joint pain that might be relieved by weight loss. Under the current rules, this woman could get a lap band only if she was willing to pay $12,000 to $30,000 for the 30-minute surgery. Because the procedure does not have F.D.A. approval, insurance plans and Medicare usually do not cover it.'b'Theoretically, lap bands could save lives and billions of health care dollars that would otherwise be spent to treat diabetes or heart disease, replace hip or knee joints or pay for often-ineffective weight loss strategies. But potential benefits are not the same as proven ones. And the reality is, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know how safe and effective lap-band surgery is for most people, whether they are 30 or 300 pounds overweight.'b'How could we lack such basic information? The F.D.A. approved Inamed\xe2\x80\x99s Lap-Band for the dangerously obese almost 10 years ago. But it did so based on the company\xe2\x80\x99s study of fewer than 200 very obese patients who had lap bands for three years. As a condition of approval, the agency required a follow-up study, but in 2006 Inamed was bought by Allergan, and the study was not completed. Last year, when Allergan asked the F.D.A. to expand approval to the not-so-obese (essentially doubling the potential patient pool), the request was based on a clinical trial of only 149 patients who had lap bands for one to two years.'b'In this study, the operations were done by carefully selected surgeons on relatively healthy patients, all under the age of 55 \xe2\x80\x94 which gave the study its best chance of producing favorable results. Even so, there were many adverse reactions. The most common were vomiting, difficulty swallowing, pain and gastroesophageal reflux. Five percent of subjects required additional surgery one to nine months after getting their lap bands, and in most cases this meant permanent removal. One of the devices that was removed had already eroded \xe2\x80\x94 raising concern about how long lap bands last. And unlike the initial surgery, often an outpatient procedure, the revisions and removals meant hospitalizations lasting up to a week.'b'The men in the Allergan study had worse outcomes than the women; 20 percent had their devices removed in the first year. This is not surprising, given an earlier report by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality that men were almost three times as likely as women to die from bariatric surgery. But the poor outcome for men needs further investigation, because the Allergan trial included only 14 men.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s more, there were only two Asians, 14 African-Americans and 16 Hispanics among all the men and women in the study. Clearly, more research is needed on more people of both sexes and all ages and races.'b'Most important, we need studies of people who have had lap bands for longer than a few years to learn if the weight loss is lasting, if patients will tolerate the devices in the long run and what risks may accrue from living with one inside the body. The earlier three-year study of very obese patients found that one in four had their lap bands removed and not replaced.'b'The F.D.A.\xe2\x80\x99s job is to make sure that the lap band is safe and effective, but it cannot do this without long-term data on a more diverse group of patients. Moreover, if the F.D.A. approves the lap band for people who are only 30 or 40 pounds overweight, taxpayers may soon be paying billions of Medicare dollars for these procedures, and for fixing the potential complications. Health insurance companies would be pressured to follow Medicare\xe2\x80\x99s lead, which could add to the cost of insurance for all of us.'b'Obesity can kill, but when people are not at immediate risk of fatal illness, the F.D.A. does them no favors by giving its approval to an implanted medical device before it has been adequately tested.'b'Representative Peter King, a Republican of Long Island, 'b'has proposed a bill'b' that would prohibit the carrying of a gun within 1,000 feet of a member of Congress or other high-profile government official. That\xe2\x80\x99s a worthy notion, so far as it goes. But how about going a step further and prohibiting the carrying of a semiautomatic weapon around 9-year-old girls? Or 79-year-old women? Or any of the other victims who were shot down in the Tucson parking lot on Saturday?'b'Members of Congress are understandably worried about their own safety in the wake of the shooting rampage that was centered around Representative Gabrielle Giffords. It makes sense for the Capitol Police 'b'to work more closely'b' with local law enforcement agencies to enhance security at lawmakers\xe2\x80\x99 public events. But some of the ideas being proposed would have the effect of further distancing lawmakers from the people they represent \xe2\x80\x94 and elevate their safety above 'b'the 100,000 Americans'b' who are shot or killed with a gun every year.'b'Representative James Clyburn, a Democrat of South Carolina, said that lawmakers should no longer be treated like everyone else at airport security checkpoints, though that inconvenience seems to have nothing to do with the shooting. Representative Robert Brady, a Democrat of Pennsylvania, has proposed making it a federal crime to use language or symbols that could be perceived as threatening violence against all federal officials, an idea dangerously full of potential First Amendment violations. Representative Dan Burton, a Republican of Indiana, even wants to enclose the public gallery above the House chamber in Plexiglas. These ideas are unlikely to make lawmakers or the public any safer. But if members are concerned that some of the 283 million guns now in the hands of American civilians might one day be turned on them \xe2\x80\x94 and they should be \xe2\x80\x94 there are many things they can do.'b'They can follow the advice given on Tuesday by Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City, along with 10 other mayors, and begin restoring the nation\xe2\x80\x99s gun control laws to sanity \xe2\x80\x94  for the protection of everyone. The most obvious first steps are to ban the extended-round magazines used in the Arizona shooting and tighten a nearly useless system of background checks.'b'They also can ensure that federal and state financing for outreach to the mentally ill is increased, not cut, in the budget battles to come. Jared Loughner, the man accused of the Arizona shootings, apparently received no mental health treatment, even though officials at his college were very concerned about his mental state.'b'Instead of hiding, lawmakers must reach out to their constituents and help calm a troubled political environment without fear or self-absorbed overreaction.'b'The most important new message contained in the final report of the presidential commission investigating the gulf oil spill is aimed squarely at Congress: If lawmakers hope to win popular support for ramped-up oil drilling in America\xe2\x80\x99s coastal waters then they must make sure that every possible precaution is taken to reduce the chances of another catastrophe like the spill.'b'The question is whether the newly constituted Congress is in a mood to listen. What the commission is asking for are tough new rules and money to strengthen federal oversight at a time when the House is controlled by politicians who broadly oppose new spending and seem hostile to regulation of any sort.'b'Yet Congress must act, and President Obama should use some of what leverage he has in this new political alignment to see that it does. As the commission co-chairman, Bob Graham, noted, without dramatic action another deep-water disaster will inevitably occur, leaving the public to \xe2\x80\x9cwonder why Congress, the administration and industry stood by and did nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The commission\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'380-page report'b' is the most exhaustive accounting so far of what happened on the Deepwater Horizon. As it forecast in a preliminary summary, the commission  blames the accident largely on poor decisions  and other \xe2\x80\x9cmanagement failures\xe2\x80\x9d by three companies involved: BP, Transocean and Halliburton.'b'It also strongly reinforces its earlier indictments of industry for failing to prepare adequate response plans and of government regulators for allowing themselves to be captured by an industry they were meant to oversee.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s new are 'b'the recommendations'b'. All are sound, and most will require Congressional help.'b''b'SAFETY'b' The commission recommended much tougher rules governing basic drilling issues like well design and vital equipment like blowout preventers. Some of these have already been put in place by the Interior Department. More broadly, it urged Congress to create an independent safety agency within the department free of any political influence and with enforcement authority to oversee all aspects of offshore drilling.'b''b'FINANCING 'b'Though it did not specify a figure, the commission implored Congress to provide \xe2\x80\x9cadequate and predictable\xe2\x80\x9d financing for regulatory oversight. It noted that money for federal regulators had remained static for 20 years while the risks associated with drilling increased dramatically as rigs moved into deeper and deeper waters.'b''b'LIABILITY 'b'The commission noted that the present $75 million liability cap for individual accidents is hardly enough to deter sloppy behavior. It recommended a much higher figure, without identifying one.'b''b'SCIENCE 'b'The Deepwater Horizon explosion revealed that both industry and federal regulators had given environmental reviews short shrift. The commission recommends that Congress amend the various laws governing offshore drilling to make sure that government scientists and fish and wildlife experts are consulted at every step of the process \xe2\x80\x94  from the leasing of areas for exploration to the actual drilling of individual wells.'b''b'RESTORATION 'b'Congress is urged to dedicate 80 percent of the penalties assessed under the Clean Water Act \xe2\x80\x94 they could be as high as $20 billion \xe2\x80\x94 to restoring the fragile Mississippi Delta ecosystem. The commission\xe2\x80\x99s other co-chairman, William Reilly, noted that the delta  had been badly degraded over the years and \xe2\x80\x9cis likely to continue silently washing away unless decisive action is taken.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This by no means exhausts the commission\xe2\x80\x99s list of useful ideas. The House of Representatives endorsed several of them in an oil bill it passed last year (the Senate did nothing). Representative Edward Markey, a Democrat of Massachusetts, said that he would hold hearings and introduce an even stronger bill this year.

President Obama did that on Wednesday evening at the memorial service in Tucson for the six people who died in last weekend\xe2\x80\x99s terrible  shooting. It was one of his most powerful and uplifting speeches.'b'Mr. Obama called on ideological campaigners to stop vilifying their opponents.  The only way to move forward after such a tragedy, he said, is to cast aside \xe2\x80\x9cpoint-scoring and pettiness.\xe2\x80\x9d He rightly focused primarily on the lives of those who died and the heroism of those who tried to stop the shooter and save the victims. He urged prayers for the 14 wounded, including Representative Gabrielle Giffords, the target of the rampage. Their stories needed to be told, their lives celebrated and mourned.'b'It was important that Mr. Obama transcend the debate about whose partisanship has been excessive and whose words have sown the most division and dread. This page and many others have identified those voices and called on them to stop demonizing their political opponents. The president\xe2\x80\x99s role in Tucson was to comfort and honor, and instill hope.'b'This horrific event, he said, should be a turning point for everyone \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cnot because a simple lack of civility caused this tragedy \xe2\x80\x93 it did not\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x93 but rather because only a more civil and honest public discourse can help us face up to our challenges as a nation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He also said that after a senseless tragedy it is natural to try to impose some meaning. Wisely, he did not try. But he was right to warn that any proposals to reduce this kind of bloodshed will remain out of reach if political discourse remains deeply polarized. Two of those essential proposals, we believe, are gun safety laws and improvement to the mental health system, and it was heartening to hear the president bring them up.'b'Mr. Obama noted that several of Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s victims were struck down as they performed public service. Ms. Giffords was engaging in the most fundamental act of a representative: meeting with her constituents to hear their concerns. Gabriel Zimmerman, her murdered aide, had set up the \xe2\x80\x9cCongress on Your Corner\xe2\x80\x9d event. John Roll, the murdered federal judge who lived nearby, came into the line of fire while thanking Ms. Giffords for helping to ease his court\xe2\x80\x99s crowded legal calendar.'b'Many of the other victims were performing one of citizenship\xe2\x80\x99s most basic duties: listening to and questioning one of their political representatives.

There was the call for civility, followed by the rapidly escalating rhetoric over whose fault the incivility was, which climbed ever upward until Wednesday when you had a congressman from Texas claiming that the F.B.I. was hiding information on the gunman\xe2\x80\x99s political beliefs because the truth would embarrass the White House.'b'For me, Obama\xe2\x80\x99s best moment came when he warned that \xe2\x80\x9cwhat we can\xe2\x80\x99t do is use this tragedy as one more occasion to turn on one another.\xe2\x80\x9d In his honor, I am not saying a word about Sarah Palin\xe2\x80\x99s video.'b'But, politically, there\xe2\x80\x99s a challenge about where we go from here. You can\xe2\x80\x99t expect the Republican majority in Congress to give up on killing the health care reform law, although it might be a nice step if the leadership urged its members to stop saying that God wants to see repeal.'b'The president, who was going for great, universal themes, didn\xe2\x80\x99t make any suggestions.'b'Let me offer one really, really modest one. Congress should have an actual debate about Representative Carolyn McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s bill to reduce gun violence.'b'You will notice I just said have a debate. And the bill does not even control guns. It simply bans the sale of the special bullet clip that allowed the Tucson gunman to shoot 20 people without reloading.'b'McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s husband was killed and her son permanently injured when a gunman using a pistol with a similar  \xe2\x80\x94  but less powerful  \xe2\x80\x94  kind of clip opened fire on the Long Island Rail Road in 1993. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why I came to Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d she said on Wednesday. But so far she has collected co-sponsors only from the same small band of members who always support this kind of legislation.'b'Members of Congress are so terrified of the political power of the National Rifle Association that the Democrats, when they were in power, declined even to give McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s bill a hearing. This is the chance for the Republicans to prove that they\xe2\x80\x99re braver.'b'All John Boehner, the speaker of the House, has to do is say that in the wake of the Tucson tragedy he wants to demonstrate that Congress is open to a serious and mature discussion of ways that it might have been avoided, or mitigated.'b'That might include proposals to better identify people with potentially violent mental illnesses. And it certainly would also have to involve a conversation over a technology that can turn a pistol into the equivalent of a somewhat slow-moving machine gun.'b'McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s bill might not have saved Representative Gabrielle Giffords from being shot. But it has to be worth talking about whether it could have saved some of her constituents.'b'So far, most of the proposals from members of Congress for practical action to reduce gun violence have been directed at protecting themselves. Representative Peter King of New York introduced a bill to ban anyone from carrying a gun in the vicinity of a federal official. Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. of Illinois suggested reversing a recent cut in members\xe2\x80\x99 office budgets and tacking on another 10 percent increase to pay for improved security. Representative Dan Burton of Indiana urged enclosing the House gallery in Plexiglas. And two members vowed to carry their pistols with them when they go about the people\xe2\x80\x99s business back in their districts.'b'Following the president\xe2\x80\x99s lead, I would argue that Congress has the capacity for higher purpose.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI believe we can be better,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThose who died here \xe2\x80\x94  those who saved lives here \xe2\x80\x94  they help me believe. We may not be able to stop all evil in the world, but I know that how we treat one another is entirely up to us.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In that light, I believe members of Congress can have a hearing and a civilized debate on a bill that is modest and relevant but that is opposed by a hyperpowerful lobbying group that scares the daylight out of them.'b'Maybe they could do it just to prove it to themselves that they can.'b'Just a thought.'b'Arlington, Va.'b'A  NATO oil tanker truck 'b'was blown up'b' by insurgents at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border last week, and while no one was injured, the incident temporarily closed the Khyber Pass, the main supply artery for Western troops in the Afghan theater. This has become an all-too-routine occurrence; in the last nine years some 1,000 Americans have been killed on fuel-related missions in Iraq and Afghanistan.'b'Until the Defense Department develops battlefield policies recognizing that energy efficiency contributes to military effectiveness, more blood will be shed, billions of dollars will be wasted, our enemies will have thousands of vulnerable fuel trucks for targets and our commanders will continue to be distracted by the task of overseeing fuel convoys.'b'As the military\xe2\x80\x99s senior logistician in Iraq for 15 months in 2006 and 2007, I tracked the tremendous amounts of fuel needed to power the generators providing electricity for air-conditioning and other essential uses in shelters hastily constructed of canvas, plywood and sheet metal. Today our troops in Afghanistan are furiously building more of the same. Nine years into that war, they are living more or less as Alexander the Great\xe2\x80\x99s men did 23 centuries ago \xe2\x80\x94 in often dangerous and always inefficient tents and shacks.'b'For many in the military, improving the situation isn\xe2\x80\x99t a priority. \xe2\x80\x9cTo hell with efficiency, effectiveness is all I care about,\xe2\x80\x9d a finger-wagging superior once told me in Iraq. But keeping our bases and units supplied with fuel endangers not just the lives of many soldiers manning the tanker convoys, it also drains $24 billion a year from the Pentagon budget. The solution: a Defense Department policy requiring all structures in the combat zone be energy-efficient.'b'Upgrading the efficiency at our bases and outposts would not require any new technology. Watch almost any home renovation show and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see spray foam being used to cut energy use significantly. Cured spray foam is nontoxic, fire-resistant and waterproof. (Disclosure: until last month, I was the chief operating officer of an energy consulting company, but I have no financial stake in the issue.)'b'In 2007, an Army study found that spraying foam insulation on the exterior of inefficient structures would reduce their energy requirements by over 80 percent and improve the quality of life for the troops living in them. Accordingly, we obtained the necessary safety, fire and disposal certifications and began a $95 million effort in Iraq; a study last year confirmed this initiative was saving about $1 billion a year and taking more than 11,000 fuel trucks off the road.'b'Yet, despite three years of quantitative proof that insulated structures in extreme climates tremendously reduce fuel requirements, there has been little effort to broaden the scope of the initiative.'b'An across-the-board Pentagon efficiency mandate would have many benefits. First, it would save many lives: there are casualties in one out of every 24 fuel supply convoys in Afghanistan; 47 drivers were killed there last year. It would save money; it costs taxpayers about $66 million a day for air-conditioning in the war zones.'b'It would also reduce opportunities for the enemy. Some soldiers jokingly call the fuel trucks \xe2\x80\x9cTaliban targets,\xe2\x80\x9d and for good reason \xe2\x80\x94 they are a high-payoff quarry for insurgents using nothing but homemade bombs. In addition, having fewer fuel shipments would allow NATO to take highly trained troops off convoy duty and use them in combat or, even better, send them home.'b'Why has the Defense Department dragged its feet on energy efficiency? Chalk it up to the impediments to change found in any large organization: passive leadership, lack of accountability, competing priorities. In this case, add skepticism over the data, calls for additional studies and unfounded environmental concerns.'b'But strong leadership can overcome these obstacles, as Secretary of Defense Robert Gates demonstrated in 2008 when he oversaw the acquisition and deployment in Iraq of a new generation of mine-resistant, ambush-protected fighting vehicles, which brought about a decline of up to 90 percent in the deaths of American troops from roadside bombs.'b'A new energy efficiency policy would not only save lives and cut costs, it would make a powerful statement regarding the Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to lowering our dependence on foreign oil. We have the finest troops in history; improving the insulation in their structures would not only keep them more comfortable, it would also go a long way to bringing more of them home safely.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Wilderness Underfoot'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (news article, Jan. 2):'b'Though there is considerable interest in learning about New York City\xe2\x80\x99s 7,400 miles of sewer lines, entering them is not only illegal, but it is also potentially fatal.'b'Sewers pose a series of life-threatening risks: pockets of poisonous gas can build up; temperature changes can reach extreme levels of hot and cold; infectious bacteria and pathogens can immediately affect one\xe2\x80\x99s immune system; and even a few minutes of hard rain can potentially flood the entire system with little or no warning. On average, there are 92 deaths a year from improper entries into confined spaces in the United States.'b'Only the most highly trained and authorized individuals, with emergency escape air packs, communication and air monitoring equipment and work to do in connection with their jobs, should ever enter sewers.'b'Instead of breaking the law and placing yourself in extreme danger, stop by and visit the Department of Environmental Protection\xe2\x80\x99s Newtown Creek Visitor Center in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, which includes information and displays about the city\xe2\x80\x99s wastewater system. It\xe2\x80\x99s safe, fun and free.'b'Cas Holloway'b' Commissioner, New York City'b' Dept. of Environmental Protection'b' Flushing, Queens, Jan. 4, 2011'b''b''b''b'THE 'b'collapse of Lebanon\xe2\x80\x99s government'b' on Tuesday signaled the final stage in Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s rise from resistance group to ruling power. While Hezbollah technically remains the head of the political opposition in Beirut, make no mistake: the Party of God has fully consolidated its control in Lebanon, and will stop at nothing \xe2\x80\x94 including civil war \xe2\x80\x94 to protect its position.'b'The crisis was precipitated by Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to a United Nations-backed tribunal investigating the 'b'2005 assassination of a former prime minister'b', Rafik Hariri. Some analysts speculate that the current Lebanese government \xe2\x80\x94 led by Prime Minister Saad Hariri, the assassinated man\xe2\x80\x99s son \xe2\x80\x94 could stabilize the political situation by rejecting the legitimacy of the tribunal.'b'Mr. Hariri really has no choice but to stand firm in Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s game of chicken: even if he could stymie Hezbollah in the short term by giving in, he would eventually have no authority at all were he to abandon the rule of law. He will have to insist on accountability for his father\xe2\x80\x99s assassins, even if he loses his position in the process. His coalition remains a viable alternative to Hezbollah only as long as it sticks to the pluralistic and law-based values that distinguish it from its theocratic and belligerent enemies.'b'Today\xe2\x80\x99s predicament in Lebanon mirrors that of much of the Arab world, where stability often comes at the price of justice. Furthermore, it highlights America\xe2\x80\x99s limited influence. Washington lent strong rhetorical support to the Hariri coalition when it came first to power in 2005, but was unable to stop Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s troops and their supporters from taking over the streets of Beirut and forcibly acquiring veto power over the government by gaining \xe2\x80\x9cthe blocking third\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 10 of the cabinet\xe2\x80\x99s 30 ministerial seats.'b'It was Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s exercising of that power, with the resignation of the 10 opposition ministers along with one independent, that toppled the government this week just when Prime Minister Hariri was meeting with President Obama in Washington.'b'To an outsider, the crisis might appear baffling. More than five years after the car-bomb murder of Rafik Hariri, the international tribunal is still meandering its way toward indicting suspects. Hezbollah, re-armed and resurgent after the war with Israel in the summer of 2006, has had a string of political and popular victories. The influence of its sponsors, Syria and Iran, has only grown. And talks between Syria and Saudi Arabia that might have stabilized the government fell apart this week.'b'Why, then, would Hezbollah change the political dynamic now?'b'Simply put, Hezbollah cannot afford the blow to its popular legitimacy that would occur if it is pinned with the Hariri killing. The group\xe2\x80\x99s power depends on the unconditional backing of its roughly 1 million supporters. Its constituents are the only audience that matters to Hezbollah, which styles itself as sole protector of Arab dignity from humiliation by Israel and the United States.'b'These supporters will be hard-pressed to understand, much less forgive, their party if it is proved to have killed a leader who was loved by the nation\xe2\x80\x99s Sunni Muslims and also respected by Christians, Druze and even many Shiites,  who form Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s core support. That is why Hezbollah denies any role in the assassination even though it has unabashedly taken responsibility for destabilizing moves like setting off the 2006 war with Israel or pushing Lebanon to the brink of civil war in 2008.'b'But its excuses are wearing thin. 'b'Leaked evidence based on cellphone records'b' has placed a Hezbollah team at the scene of the assassination. Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s leaders insist that its men were trying to protect Rafik Hariri, and that Israel was behind the killing. But if it is proved to have taken part in the Hariri hit and assassination campaigns against other moderate Lebanese figures, Hezbollah will look to many civilians like just another power-drunk militant movement.'b'What options remain for the younger Mr. Hariri? He leads a fractious and shrinking coalition that in 2009 won a majority of seats in Parliament but got fewer votes than Hezbollah and its allies. Yet his best strategy is simple, if he has the stomach for it: stick with the tribunal and let it air its evidence at trial.'b'It will be up to the international prosecutors to furnish compelling evidence that Hezbollah (or its Syrian backers) killed Rafik Hariri. For now, the prime minister must insist more convincingly that he trusts the process to be fair: If Hezbollah is innocent, it will be exonerated at trial; if it is guilty, then why should it escape?'b'The odds of this strategy succeeding are not great: Hezbollah is likely to emerge the end winner because it is willing to sacrifice the Lebanese state to maintain its standing in the Middle East and its perpetual war against Israel. But Lebanon\xe2\x80\x99s lonely prime minister has no better choice than to play the long shot for a just resolution; otherwise, he\xe2\x80\x99ll become a steward of Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s impunity.'b'Jared Loughner was considered too mentally unstable to attend community college. He was rejected by the Army. Yet buy a Glock handgun and a 33-round magazine? No problem.'b'To protect the public, we regulate cars and toys, medicines and mutual funds. So, simply as a public health matter, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we take steps to reduce the toll from our domestic arms industry?'b'Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m an Oregon farm boy who was given a .22 rifle for my 12th birthday. I still shoot occasionally when visiting the family farm, and I understand one appeal of guns: they\xe2\x80\x99re fun.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s also true that city slickers sometimes exaggerate the risk of any one gun. 'b'The authors of Freakonomics noted'b' that a home with a swimming pool is considerably more dangerous for small children than a home with a gun. They said that 1 child drowns annually for every 11,000 residential pools, but 1 child is shot dead for every 1 million-plus guns.'b'All that said, guns are far more deadly in America, not least because there are so many of them. There are about 85 guns per 100 people in the United States, and we are particularly awash in handguns.'b'(The only country I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that is more armed than America is Yemen. Near the town of Sadah, I dropped by a gun market where I was offered grenade launchers, machine guns, antitank mines, and even an anti-aircraft weapon. Yep, an N.R.A. dream! No pesky regulators. Just terrorism and a minor civil war.)'b'Just since the killings in Tucson, another 320 or so Americans have been killed by guns  \xe2\x80\x94  anonymously, with barely a whisker of attention. By tomorrow it\xe2\x80\x99ll be 400 deaths. Every day, about 80 people die from guns, and several times as many are injured.'b'Handgun sales in Arizona soared by 60 percent on Monday, according to Bloomberg News, as buyers sought to beat any beefing up of gun laws. People also often buy guns in hopes of being safer. But the evidence is overwhelming that firearms actually endanger those who own them. One scholar, John Lott Jr., published 'b'a book suggesting that more guns lead to less crime'b', but many studies 'b'have now debunked'b' that finding (although it\xe2\x80\x99s also true that a boom in concealed weapons didn\xe2\x80\x99t lead to the bloodbath that liberals had forecast).'b'A careful article forthcoming in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine by David Hemenway, 'b'a Harvard professor'b' who wrote a brilliant book a few years ago reframing the gun debate as a public health challenge, makes clear that a gun in the home makes you much more likely to be shot  \xe2\x80\x94  by accident, by suicide or by homicide.'b'The chances that a gun will be used to deter a home invasion are unbelievably remote, and dialing 911 is more effective in reducing injury than brandishing a weapon, the journal article says. But it adds that American children are 11 times more likely to die in a gun accident than in other developed countries, because of the prevalence of guns.'b'Likewise, suicide rates are higher in states with more guns, simply because there are more gun suicides. Other kinds of suicide rates are no higher. And because most homicides in the home are by family members or acquaintances  \xe2\x80\x94  not by an intruder  \xe2\x80\x94  the presence of a gun in the home increases the risk of a gun murder in that home.'b'So what can be done? I asked Professor Hemenway how he would oversee a public health approach to reducing gun deaths and injuries. He suggested:'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 Limit gun purchases to one per month per person, to reduce gun trafficking. And just as the government has cracked down on retailers who sell cigarettes to minors, get tough on gun dealers who sell to traffickers.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 Push for more gun safes, and make serial numbers harder to erase.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 Improve background checks and follow Canada in requiring a 28-day waiting period to buy a handgun. And ban oversize magazines, such as the 33-bullet magazine allegedly used in Tucson. If the shooter had had to reload after firing 10 bullets, he might have been tackled earlier. And invest in new technologies such as \xe2\x80\x9csmart guns,\xe2\x80\x9d which can be fired only when near a separate wristband or after a fingerprint scan.'b'We can also learn from Australia, which in 1996 banned assault weapons and began buying back 650,000 of them. The impact is controversial and has sometimes been distorted. But the Journal of Public Health Policy notes that after the ban, the firearm suicide rate dropped by half in Australia over the next seven years, and the firearm homicide rate was almost halved.'b'Congress on Wednesday echoed with speeches honoring those shot in Tucson. That\xe2\x80\x99s great \xe2\x80\x94  but hollow. The best memorial would be to regulate firearms every bit as seriously as we regulate automobiles or toys.'b'For 23 years, President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia has kept a tight clamp on his country\xe2\x80\x99s political life, marketing Tunisia as a tourist oasis while dangerous tensions built up beneath the surface. Now deadly riots have erupted over the bleak economic prospects facing the country\xe2\x80\x99s young people. Mr. Ben Ali\xe2\x80\x99s response has been to clamp down even harder, a course sure to lead to more unrest and bloodshed.'b'The protests began last month  after an unemployed university graduate set himself on fire after police prevented him from eking out a living selling fruits and vegetables on the street because he lacked a permit. Word of his suicide and subsequent protests spread rapidly by new social media, end-running Mr. Ben Ali\xe2\x80\x99s heavy censorship. The government then reportedly hacked into the accounts of Tunisian users of Facebook, Yahoo and Google. The unrest has spread to Tunis, the capital.'b'With as many as 30 people dead and the country in an uproar, criticism has been pouring in from Washington, the European Union and the United Nations. France, Mr. Ben Ali\xe2\x80\x99s most influential ally, has so far remained shamefully silent.'b'Mr. Ben Ali is now, predictably, blaming unnamed foreign instigators for the riots. And even as he tries to quiet things with promises of new jobs for young Tunisians, he has ordered every school and university in the country to be shut down indefinitely. That will generate more anger and further damage the country\xe2\x80\x99s economic future.'b'Not so long ago, the United States and other Western countries considered Mr. Ben Ali, and other secular tyrants, indispensable allies in the fight against extremists. Washington now appears to recognize that Mr. Ben Ali\xe2\x80\x99s repression and deafness to his people\xe2\x80\x99s needs only add to the anger and make it more combustible. The challenge is to make Mr. Ben Ali see that truth.'b'Alston Anderson was buried on Saturday for the second time \xe2\x80\x94 or the third, if you count the slow sinking that constituted his long but unrewarded life. He was an African-American short-story writer, poet, novelist and jazz critic. He spent three years in the Army in World War II and three months of 1955 at Yaddo, the writers\xe2\x80\x99 colony in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. He studied philosophy at Columbia and the Sorbonne.'b'He had sharp talent and famous friends: Richard Wright, Terry Southern, Robert Graves. His work was chosen for anthologies of \xe2\x80\x9cjazz fiction\xe2\x80\x9d and of the best \xe2\x80\x9cNegro writers.\xe2\x80\x9d He had a story in The New Yorker and an interview with Nelson Algren in The Paris Review.'b'What he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have were money, lasting acclaim and, evidently, family. When he died in Manhattan on July 15, 2008, at 84, no one claimed his remains. The government buried him in the potter\xe2\x80\x99s field at Hart Island.'b'The next two and a half years would have extended into forever but for a program that tracks down the remains of indigent veterans and provides them proper military burials. That was how Mr. Anderson came to join 19 other veterans buried on Saturday at Calverton National Cemetery on Long Island.'b'No one could say much about them. The eulogist did what he could, reading everyone\xe2\x80\x99s name and years of service, and then a poem about going to the arms of Jesus. He did not say that the coffin in the first row on his far right held the author of \xe2\x80\x9cLover Man,\xe2\x80\x9d stories of Southern black life, told in a voice jazz-inflected and rural, and a novel, \xe2\x80\x9cAll God\xe2\x80\x99s Children.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I found him myself only through chance. Googling \xe2\x80\x9cAnderson Alston\xe2\x80\x9d from the funeral press release led to the suspicion that the name was backward. The author\xe2\x80\x99s Internet trail matched the soldier\xe2\x80\x99s exactly: born 1924, Panama Canal Zone; lived in Kingston, Jamaica, and Oxford, N.C.; 1943 to 1946 in the Army, private to master sergeant; then Germany, France, New York.'b'On Friday, I e-mailed Micki McGee, a Fordham University professor who wrote a book about Yaddo that led to an exhibition at the New York Public Library. She called back instantly. She told me that it had been Mr. Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s sad file that convinced her to tell the Yaddo story. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to cry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said when she heard about his reburial.'b'Mr. Anderson was at Yaddo with James Baldwin. He left under a cloud; notes in his files tell of bad behavior and his mixing with \xe2\x80\x9cobjectionable characters.\xe2\x80\x9d He was dunned for months after for an unpaid $13.36 phone bill.'b'He tried to explain. \xe2\x80\x9cI find it impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote to Yaddo\xe2\x80\x99s executive director, Elizabeth Ames, \xe2\x80\x9cto work eight hours a day and write at the same time.\xe2\x80\x9d He survived on \xe2\x80\x9cbaby-sitting and odd typing jobs, just enough to provide one meal a day. It would be a very simple thing for me to get a job and pay my debts, and I\xe2\x80\x99m very much aware that this is what I should do. But I feel that once I make such a compromise I\xe2\x80\x99ll become an $80-a-week clerk and that will be the end of me. I am determined that that shall not happen.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He changed addresses six times that year, and later told Graves that he nearly froze to death that winter. His request to return to Yaddo was rejected. \xe2\x80\x9cLover Man,\xe2\x80\x9d however, got great reviews. \xe2\x80\x9cPerfect ear, warm heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said The Times. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst-class,\xe2\x80\x9d said Time magazine.'b'Graves wrote its foreword. He said he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine how his young friend with the \xe2\x80\x9cnervous smile, tall, spare body and soft voice,\xe2\x80\x9d had been a master sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cBehaviour too mild, sense of humour too keen, habits too vague,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. But an officer Mr. Anderson was, at 21. He served in Bandar Shahpur, Iran, editing the post newspaper.'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the rest of his story, but I saw the last bit of it. It was in a big white tent, on a gray day after a snowstorm. The honor guards maneuvered 20 coffins with crisp dignity. Veterans, in embroidered jackets and baseball caps, stood at attention and saluted and applauded. Politicians gave speeches; this consecration far above their power to add or detract.'b'Mr. Anderson, like the others, had an engraved nameplate on his silver coffin and was given a flag, a volley of gunfire, taps. Twenty men received an overdue wave of respect and admiration, even though it was too late for them to accept it, and nobody knew who they were.'b'The report that first triggered scares that a vaccine to prevent 'b'measles'b', 'b'mumps'b' and 'b'rubella'b' might cause 'b'autism'b' in children has received another devastating blow to its credibility. The British Medical Journal has declared that the research was not simply bad science, as has been known for years, but a deliberate fraud.'b'The study, led by Dr. 'b'Andrew Wakefield'b', was published in The Lancet in 1998. It was based on just 12 children with supposedly autismlike disorders and purported to find a link between the vaccine, the gastrointestinal problems found in many autistic children, and autism.'b'While parents around the world were understandably alarmed, many scientists rejected the claims, including, eventually, 10 of Dr. Wakefield\xe2\x80\x99s co-authors. A high-level British medical group, after an exhaustive fitness-to-practice hearing, found Dr. Wakefield guilty of dishonesty and misconduct. The Lancet retracted the article in part, it said, because the authors had made false claims about how the study was conducted.'b'Now the British Medical Journal has taken the extraordinary step of publishing a lengthy report by Brian Deer, the British investigative journalist who first brought the paper\xe2\x80\x99s flaws to light \xe2\x80\x94 and has put its own reputation on the line by endorsing his findings.'b'After seven years of studying medical records and interviewing parents and doctors, Mr. Deer concluded that the medical histories of all 12 children had been misrepresented to make the vaccine look culpable. Time lines, for example, were fudged to make it seem as though autismlike symptoms developed shortly after vaccination, while in some cases problems developed before vaccination and in others months after vaccination.'b'Dr. Wakefield has accused Mr. Deer of being a hit man. But the medical journal compared the claims with evidence compiled in the voluminous transcript of official hearings and declared that flaws in the paper were not honest mistakes but rather an \xe2\x80\x9celaborate fraud.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some parents still consider Dr. Wakefield a hero, and others have moved on to other theories, equally unsupported by scientific evidence, as to how vaccines might cause autism.'b'They need to recognize that failure to vaccinate their children leaves them truly vulnerable to diseases that can cause enormous harm.'b'On Wednesday, President Obama called on Americans to \xe2\x80\x9cexpand our moral imaginations, to listen to each other more carefully, to sharpen our instincts for empathy, and remind ourselves of all the ways our hopes and dreams are bound together.\xe2\x80\x9d Those were beautiful words; they spoke to our desire for reconciliation.'b'But the truth is that we are a deeply divided nation and are likely to remain one for a long time. By all means, let\xe2\x80\x99s listen to each other more carefully; but what we\xe2\x80\x99ll discover, I fear, is how far apart we are. For the great divide in our politics isn\xe2\x80\x99t really about pragmatic issues, about which policies work best; it\xe2\x80\x99s about differences in those very moral imaginations Mr. Obama urges us to expand, about divergent beliefs over what constitutes justice.'b'And the real challenge we face is not how to resolve our differences  \xe2\x80\x94  something that won\xe2\x80\x99t happen any time soon  \xe2\x80\x94  but how to keep the expression of those differences within bounds.'b'What are the differences I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about?'b'One side of American politics considers the modern welfare state  \xe2\x80\x94  a private-enterprise economy, but one in which society\xe2\x80\x99s winners are taxed to pay for a social safety net  \xe2\x80\x94  morally superior to the capitalism red in tooth and claw we had before the New Deal. It\xe2\x80\x99s only right, this side believes, for the affluent to help the less fortunate.'b'The other side believes that people have a right to keep what they earn, and that taxing them to support others, no matter how needy, amounts to theft. That\xe2\x80\x99s what lies behind the modern right\xe2\x80\x99s fondness for violent rhetoric: many activists on the right really do see taxes and regulation as tyrannical impositions on their liberty.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s no middle ground between these views. One side saw health reform, with its subsidized extension of coverage to the uninsured, as fulfilling a moral imperative: wealthy nations, it believed, have an obligation to provide all their citizens with essential care. The other side saw the same reform as a moral outrage, an assault on the right of Americans to spend their money as they choose.'b'This deep divide in American political morality  \xe2\x80\x94  for that\xe2\x80\x99s what it amounts to  \xe2\x80\x94  is a relatively recent development. Commentators who pine for the days of civility and bipartisanship are, whether they realize it or not, pining for the days when the Republican Party accepted the legitimacy of the welfare state, and was even willing to contemplate expanding it. As many analysts have noted, the Obama health reform  \xe2\x80\x94  whose passage was met with vandalism and death threats against members of Congress  \xe2\x80\x94  was modeled on Republican plans from the 1990s.'b'But that was then. Today\xe2\x80\x99s G.O.P. sees much of what the modern federal government does as illegitimate; today\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic Party does not. When people talk about partisan differences, they often seem to be implying that these differences are petty, matters that could be resolved with a bit of good will. But what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here is a fundamental disagreement about the proper role of government.'b'Regular readers know which side of that divide I\xe2\x80\x99m on. In future columns I will no doubt spend a lot of time pointing out the hypocrisy and logical fallacies of the \xe2\x80\x9cI earned it and I have the right to keep it\xe2\x80\x9d crowd. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll also have a lot to say about how far we really are from being a society of equal opportunity, in which success depends solely on one\xe2\x80\x99s own efforts.'b'But the question for now is what we can agree on given this deep national divide.'b'In a way, politics as a whole now resembles the longstanding politics of abortion  \xe2\x80\x94  a subject that puts fundamental values at odds, in which each side believes that the other side is morally in the wrong. Almost 38 years have passed since Roe v. Wade, and this dispute is no closer to resolution.'b'Yet we have, for the most part, managed to agree on certain ground rules in the abortion controversy: it\xe2\x80\x99s acceptable to express your opinion and to criticize the other side, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not acceptable either to engage in violence or to encourage others to do so.'b'What we need now is an extension of those ground rules to the wider national debate.'b'Right now, each side in that debate passionately believes that the other side is wrong. And it\xe2\x80\x99s all right for them to say that. What\xe2\x80\x99s not acceptable is the kind of violence and eliminationist rhetoric encouraging violence that has become all too common these past two years.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not enough to appeal to the better angels of our nature. We need to have leaders of both parties  \xe2\x80\x94  or Mr. Obama alone if necessary  \xe2\x80\x94  declare that both violence and any language hinting at the acceptability of violence are out of bounds. We all want reconciliation, but the road to that goal begins with an agreement that our differences will be settled by the rule of law.'b'After two years of threats and attacks, North Korea may be pulling back from the brink. Or not. North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s leadership is so erratic \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s not even clear who is in charge right now \xe2\x80\x94 that it is impossible to tell.'b'There are a few hopeful signs. On Monday, the North formally invited South Korea to talks on economic ties. On Wednesday, for the first time in seven months, the North used a diplomatic hot line to call the South.'b'The North\xe2\x80\x99s main patron, China, has also been pushing for a resumption of the six-party talks that the big powers and North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors say are intended to end the North\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program. (The North walked out of the last round in 2008.)'b'North Korea has a long history of making promises, collecting economic rewards and then failing to deliver \xe2\x80\x94 or manufacturing crises and demanding more payoffs in return for calming tensions. The United States, South Korea and Japan are understandably reluctant to get fooled again.'b'But recent events, including the shelling of a South Korean island, have been so alarming that the Obama administration has now decided to nudge the South back to bilateral talks. American officials are also considering their own bilateral dialogue with the North and an eventual return to six-party talks.'b'These moves are necessary. But there is also a real danger that the North Korean government will misread any opening as weakness and an invitation to act out even more. The only country with any chance of getting through is China, the North\xe2\x80\x99s main supplier of food and fuel. Beijing needs to end its cynical diplomacy-as-usual and use all of its influence to ensure that Pyongyang arrives at the table ready to deal.'b'Since taking office, President Obama has practiced what aides call \xe2\x80\x9cstrategic patience\xe2\x80\x9d when it comes to the North. He promised engagement, tightened sanctions, strengthened regional alliances and waited for the North to return to serious denuclearization talks.'b'The North has only gotten more belligerent. It expelled nuclear monitors, conducted a second nuclear test and ginned up production of nuclear fuel. In March, it torpedoed a South Korean navy ship, killing 46 sailors; in November, four South Koreans were killed during the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island. Seoul has reacted with extraordinary restraint, but the risk of a wider confrontation grows with each incident.'b'American officials say that Chinese leaders have recently tried to get North Korea to back away from confrontation. But how much pressure China \xe2\x80\x94 which fears a collapse of the North above all else \xe2\x80\x94 is prepared to bring is anyone\xe2\x80\x99s guess.'b'When President Obama and President Hu Jintao of China meet next week in Washington, this must be one of the top items on their agenda. Mr. Obama will have to forcefully argue the case that an erratic neighbor armed with nuclear weapons is anything but a recipe for the stability Beijing so prizes, or for an American military drawdown in the region.'b'The United States, China, South Korea, Japan and Russia need to vigilantly enforce sanctions on North Korea and find new ways to increase the pressure. It also makes sense to test the North\xe2\x80\x99s intentions, so long as Washington and its allies go in with their eyes open.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear. Getting the North to give up its nuclear program is a very long shot. But two years of stalemate have only made things more dangerous.'b'FOR a long time, I relied on my Brooklyn neighbors\xe2\x80\x99 generosity \xe2\x80\x94 that is, their unsecured wireless networks \xe2\x80\x94 every time I connected to the Web.'b'So, to linksys of Park Slope, in 2005, for allowing me to do my first freelance work from home; to Netgear 1 and Netgear 2 of the same neighborhood, in 2006, for supporting my electronic application to several graduate schools; to DHoffma, from 2007 to 2008, for letting me pay my taxes online and stream new episodes of \xe2\x80\x9cFriday Night Lights\xe2\x80\x9d each evening for a whole winter; to belkin54g, Cooley and, above all, to the blessed Belkin_G-Plus_MIMO of Ditmas Park, from 2009 to 2010, for the ability to speedily reply to student e-mails, video-chat with my sister, keep abreast of the latest literary hoo-ha, \xe2\x80\x9clike\xe2\x80\x9d as many of my friends\xe2\x80\x99 Facebook posts as I liked and learn all about lentil-sprouting or Prometheus whenever the mood struck: Thank you. And may you rest in peace.'b'A few months ago, the Belkin_G-Plus_MIMO network changed its name and gained a padlock icon in my computer\xe2\x80\x99s list of available connections. Then \xe2\x80\x94 crickets. The era of unintentional, unasked-for or simply unacknowledged Internet sharing, it seemed, had come to an end.'b'Suddenly disconnected, I realized how lucky I\xe2\x80\x99d been all those years, having that tremendous body of information and awesome communication technology at my fingertips, all basically free. It may have been unfair, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe I was stealing: the owners\xe2\x80\x99 leaving their networks password-free was essentially a gift, an ethereal gesture of kindness. Sometimes I\xe2\x80\x99d imagine my anonymous benefactors, those people behind Netgear 1 or belkin54g, thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have Internet to spare.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And, really, who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t? Home wireless networks can usually support five or more computers,  yet there are only about 1.4 computers per American household.'b'For a few blindered weeks, I debated whether or not to finally \xe2\x80\x9cbuy\xe2\x80\x9d the Internet. The whole system, though, seemed wasteful: paying a company to come wire my apartment, then paying a monthly fee so that I could maintain my own private territory within the cloud of 20 or so wireless networks that were already humming around my apartment. It would be all the more wasteful given the likelihood that, just as cellphones made landlines optional, smartphones and tablets will soon replace the need for home networks at all.'b'Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t I instead shell out a nominal fee \xe2\x80\x94 to someone, anyone \xe2\x80\x94 to partake of the riches that were all around me in abundance?'b'Paying for Internet access, after all, isn\xe2\x80\x99t like paying for cable TV, where cable providers pay cable networks in turn. My establishing a new network instead of sharing with neighbors does nothing to benefit the Web sites whose content benefits me and whose value to advertisers is based on views and visits.'b'Nor is it like paying for phone service, where the physical object that makes and receives calls is inseparable from your unique number. My e-mail address is utterly portable: it\xe2\x80\x99s not bound to an I.P. address or one computer \xe2\x80\x94 and, like the vast majority of the Internet\xe2\x80\x99s services and information, it\xe2\x80\x99s free.'b'Which is part of why getting online free felt so natural. During my Internet-less weeks, in desperate moments, I checked e-mail on my Kindle\xe2\x80\x99s wireless connection, which is complimentary (to encourage e-book purchases). But that was a painfully slow experience akin to surfing the Web on an Etch a Sketch.'b'In an ideal world, the Internet would be universally available to anyone able to receive it. Promisingly, the Federal Communications Commission in September announced that it 'b'would open up unused analog airwaves for high-speed public wireless use'b', which could lead to gratis hotspots spreading across cities and through many rural areas.'b'But an Internet as freely obtainable as broadcast TV hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet arrived. And so I recently found myself watching as a technician strung a wire from a tall pole in the backyard to my third-floor apartment so I could have my own connection (wired, to ease myself into the world of paid Internet). It was a process that took nearly three hours, and meant the addition of another long cable to the fistful already circling the building.'b'When he finished, I had to ask: \xe2\x80\x9cShouldn\xe2\x80\x99t this all be wireless? Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that be much easier?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cToo much interference,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cToo many networks affect the signal.\xe2\x80\x9d I thought again about all the people close by with all their overlapping networks.'b'Perhaps the solution is a simple, old-fashioned gesture. Just knock on a neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s door, and ask if she might be able to spare some wireless.'b'Eleven years after gross injustice compelled a moratorium on capital punishment in Illinois, the State Legislature has concluded that the only way to guard against execution of the innocent is to outlaw the death penalty. Gov. Pat Quinn, who has sent mixed signals in the past, should quickly sign the legislation into law.'b'Former Gov. George Ryan declared the moratorium in 2000 in the face of a running scandal of faulty trials that cost innocent inmates their lives. Three years later, Mr. Ryan stunned the nation by commuting 167 death row felons to life terms and calling for a hard look at the business of state-sanctioned death. (Mr. Ryan subsequently went to prison for statehouse corruption, but the flaws of capital punishment remained clear, as dramatically confirmed now by the Legislature.)'b'Under prodding from outside investigators, the state has had to free 20 inmates from death row since 1987. It has also enacted some commendable reforms. These included mandatory taping of interviews with homicide suspects \xe2\x80\x94 a measure that followed tales of torture in notorious Chicago precinct houses.'b'But other vital reforms to clean up forensic lab abuses and stage-managed witness identifications were rejected. And for all the official study, caution and reforms of the past decade, the Legislature found the system still riddled with risk and doubt.'b'Fifteen inmates are now on death row under the open-ended moratorium as prosecutors continue to pursue capital punishment. Most recently, two condemned men convicted on the basis of confessions were exonerated by DNA evidence.'b'Governor Quinn said last fall that he supported the moratorium as well as capital punishment \xe2\x80\x9capplied carefully and fairly.\xe2\x80\x9d Illinois\xe2\x80\x99s own experience has shown why that is not possible. Most modern nations, and 15 states in this country, have rightly abandoned the barbarism of state executions. The sanctity of human life and the honor of the state require Governor Quinn to lead Illinois beyond its wrenching history of wrongful death-row convictions.'b'After the financial meltdown, is it really possible a company argued at the Supreme Court that too much information for investors is as bad as too little?'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s what Matrixx Initiatives did on Monday 'b'in a case'b' about whether it should have disclosed complaints regarding Zicam, its homeopathic cold remedy. Twenty-three people claimed that they took Zicam and lost their sense of smell, a condition known as anosmia.'b'The case arose after ABC\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cGood Morning America\xe2\x80\x9d aired a piece questioning Zicam\xe2\x80\x99s safety. The price of Matrixx\xe2\x80\x99s stock fell 24 percent. Shareholders sued in a class action, saying Matrixx should have warned investors about the problems and related lawsuits.'b'The company claimed that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to, arguing that the complaints had no scientific basis, that any loss of smell should be blamed on illness and that the number of complaints was not statistically significant.'b'Justice Stephen Breyer seemed to surprise himself when he dismissed the \xe2\x80\x9cstatistical\xe2\x80\x9d claim: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to take a position yet. But, look, Albert Einstein had the theory of relativity without any empirical evidence, O.K.?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, ruled in favor of the shareholders, saying the case should go back to the trial court. The Supreme Court should do the same. The appeals court said a jury should answer these legal questions: Was the information at issue \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial\xe2\x80\x9d? Would a reasonable shareholder \xe2\x80\x9cconsider it important\xe2\x80\x9d?'b'In a friend of the court filing, the government argued that the court has long held that if an investor would have viewed a new piece of information as \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningfully\xe2\x80\x9d altering \xe2\x80\x9cthe total mix\xe2\x80\x9d of information available, it has been considered material. Instead, Matrixx is proposing an isolated yes-or-no rule: unless a claim about a product is shown to be statistically significant, there is no reason to tell investors about it.'b'As some professors put it in a brief supporting the shareholders, requiring that high a standard to shield investors from unproven allegations would treat them as \xe2\x80\x9cnitwits\xe2\x80\x9d unable to make their own judgments about good and bad information. The information in this case was spot on. Matrixx recalled Zicam in 2009, after the Food and Drug Administration warned consumers not to use it.'b'On Monday, Justice Elena Kagan posed this hypothetical: 10 users of a new contact lens solution go blind. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no way that anybody would tell you that these 10 cases are statistically significant,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Would Matrixx\xe2\x80\x99s counsel stop using the product? Would a reasonable investor want to know about the 10 cases?'b'Matrixx\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, predictably, said he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want the information. A show of hands in the packed courtroom would likely have yielded enough yeses to feel statistically significant.'b'For a moment, it seemed as if the new year might just deliver us from spam. Last summer, spam volumes started declining around the world, from about 250 billion messages a day in July \xe2\x80\x94 almost 40 for each woman, man and child in the world \xe2\x80\x94 to about 100 billion a day in November. Then, on Dec. 25, the Rustock botnet, the biggest spam generator, vanished from the Internet. (Two other smaller ones dropped off, too, a few days later.) Volume plummeted to fewer than 30 billion a day.'b'We are sorry to shatter your hopes. Rustock kicked back into operation on Monday, bombarding the world with 14 billion pieces of spam, mostly about pharmaceuticals, through a vast network of infected computers that generate spam without their owners knowing.'b'Internet safety experts caution that the rebound will probably continue. In 2008, spam plunged by three-quarters when McColo, a hosting company in California, was shut down. But the hosting was simply moved to other servers and spam levels recovered quickly. This time security experts don\xe2\x80\x99t understand quite what was driving the decline. Some suggested the controllers of Rustock might have just gone on vacation.'b'Governments are struggling against this nuisance. In December, Canada was the last of the wealthy nations in the Group of 8 to pass legislation that would penalize businesses that distributed unsolicited commercial e-mail in Canada. The problem is that products pitched with spam are often as shady as the networks, and everyone involved is unlikely to fear such fines.'b'Spam is hard to stamp out because it is so cheap to send. In 2008, researchers estimated that it cost $80 for each million messages. The trick is how to make it more expensive. In April 2002, the South Korean Internet portal Daum created an online stamp system to charge bulk e-mailers up to 0.8 cents per message to send e-mail to its subscribers. Inbound bulk e-mail fell by more than half in the first few months of the fee. Service providers responded by boycotting Daum\xe2\x80\x99s service until it dropped the bulk e-mail fee a few years later. And spam returned.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Obama Calls Americans to a New Era of Civility'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 13) and \xe2\x80\x9c'b'As We Mourn'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 13):'b'Students years from now should read President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s speech before thousands in Arizona for its wisdom.'b'He was psychologically astute; devoid of egotistical use of political leverage; practical in his references to gun safety and mental health; direct in professing ignorance about the gunman\xe2\x80\x99s mental processes; authentic in his use of citizen heroes as models of sacrifice and generosity.'b'He was balanced in his call for a national return to mutual respect; tender and compelling in his words on behalf of the child victim and of children everywhere; graceful in uniting us to the holy, to each other and to our better angels; profoundly right in his appeal for humility.'b'Absolving in tone yet profoundly challenging, the president took the nation to the mountaintop.

Perhaps one day a lactation room will be used by a member of Congress herself.'b'Mary Ann Hill'b'\nNewton, Mass., Jan. 3, 2011'b''b'President Obama gave a wonderful speech in Tucson on Wednesday night. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t try to explain the rampage that occurred there. Instead, he used the occasion as a national Sabbath \xe2\x80\x94 as a chance to step out of the torrent of events and reflect. He did it with an uplifting spirit. He not only expressed the country\xe2\x80\x99s sense of loss but also celebrated the lives of the victims and the possibility for renewal.'b'Of course, even a great speech won\xe2\x80\x99t usher in a period of civility. Speeches about civility will be taken to heart most by those people whose good character renders them unnecessary. Meanwhile, those who are inclined to intellectual thuggery and partisan one-sidedness will temporarily resolve to do better but then slip back to old habits the next time their pride feels threatened.'b'Civility is a tree with deep roots, and without the roots, it can\xe2\x80\x99t last. So what are those roots? They are failure, sin, weakness and ignorance.'b'Every sensible person involved in politics and public life knows that their work is laced with failure. Every column, every speech, every piece of legislation and every executive decision has its own humiliating shortcomings. There are always arguments you should have made better, implications you should have anticipated, other points of view you should have taken on board.'b'Moreover, even if you are at your best, your efforts will still be laced with failure. The truth is fragmentary and it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to capture all of it. There are competing goods that can never be fully reconciled. The world is more complicated than any human intelligence can comprehend.'b'But every sensible person in public life also feels redeemed by others. You may write a mediocre column or make a mediocre speech or propose a mediocre piece of legislation, but others argue with you, correct you and introduce elements you never thought of. Each of these efforts may also be flawed, but together, if the system is working well, they move things gradually forward.'b'Each individual step may be imbalanced, but in succession they make the social organism better.'b'As a result, every sensible person feels a sense of gratitude for this process. We all get to live lives better than we deserve because our individual shortcomings are transmuted into communal improvement. We find meaning \xe2\x80\x94 and can only find meaning \xe2\x80\x94 in the role we play in that larger social enterprise.'b'So this is where civility comes from \xe2\x80\x94 from a sense of personal modesty and from the ensuing gratitude for the political process. Civility is the natural state for people who know how limited their own individual powers are and know, too, that they need the conversation. They are useless without the conversation.'b'The problem is that over the past 40 years or so we have gone from a culture that reminds people of their own limitations to a culture that encourages people to think highly of themselves. The nation\xe2\x80\x99s founders had a modest but realistic opinion of themselves and of the voters. They erected all sorts of institutional and social restraints to protect Americans from themselves. They admired George Washington because of the way he kept himself in check.'b'But over the past few decades, people have lost a sense of their own sinfulness. Children are raised amid a chorus of applause. Politics has become less about institutional restraint and more about giving voters whatever they want at that second. Joe DiMaggio didn\xe2\x80\x99t ostentatiously admire his own home runs, but now athletes routinely celebrate themselves as part of the self-branding process.'b'So, of course, you get narcissists who believe they or members of their party possess direct access to the truth. Of course you get people who prefer monologue to dialogue. Of course you get people who detest politics because it frustrates their ability to get 100 percent of what they want. Of course you get people who gravitate toward the like-minded and loathe their political opponents. They feel no need for balance and correction.'b'Beneath all the other things that have contributed to polarization and the loss of civility, the most important is this: The roots of modesty have been carved away.'b'President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s speech in Tucson was a good step, but there will have to be a bipartisan project like comprehensive tax reform to get people conversing again. Most of all, there will have to be a return to modesty.'b'In a famous passage, Reinhold Niebuhr put it best: \xe2\x80\x9cNothing that is worth doing can be achieved in our lifetime; therefore, we must be saved by hope. ... Nothing we do, however virtuous, can be accomplished alone; therefore, we are saved by love. No virtuous act is quite as virtuous from the standpoint of our friend or foe as it is from our standpoint. Therefore, we must be saved by the final form of love, which is forgiveness.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'THE new Congress is less than two weeks old, but pundits from across the political spectrum are already urging the newly empowered Republicans to take on Medicare and Social Security.'b'Conservatives argue it\xe2\x80\x99s the only way to make good on the party\xe2\x80\x99s limited-government rhetoric. Centrists say it\xe2\x80\x99s the only plausible way to bring the budget into sustainable balance. Even some liberals are telling the Republicans to demonstrate the courage of their anti-spending convictions.'b'Reforming these programs is vital to our nation\xe2\x80\x99s long-term fiscal health \xe2\x80\x94 which is why Republicans should resist this advice and leave the issue alone. Reform is impossible this year or next unless President Obama takes the lead on it. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, Republicans have no mandate for reform, and a failed attempt will only set back the cause.'b'Some Republicans are understandably eager to take on these entitlements. \xe2\x80\x9cThe third rail is not the third rail anymore,\xe2\x80\x9d Representative Paul Ryan, a Republican from Wisconsin,'b' said in December.'b''b'Maybe he\xe2\x80\x99s right. But Republicans have gotten a painful shock every time they have decided it\xe2\x80\x99s finally safe to take on entitlements. Ronald Reagan suffered a defeat in his first year when he tried cutting Social Security\xe2\x80\x99s early retirement benefits. Newt Gingrich\xe2\x80\x99s 1995 Republican revolution fizzled when President Bill Clinton fought him over Medicare cuts. President George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s effort to reform Social Security in 2005 ended any political momentum he brought to his second term.'b'Would-be reformers should draw two lessons from this history. The first is that reform can\xe2\x80\x99t be sprung on the electorate. Reagan hadn\xe2\x80\x99t campaigned on cutting Social Security in 1980, nor did the Gingrich Republicans promise to reduce the growth of Medicare.'b'Today is no different: while some Republican candidates in the last election spoke forthrightly about the need to rein in these programs \xe2\x80\x94 notably Representative Ryan himself, but also new Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky \xe2\x80\x94 most of them didn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'As a result, if Republicans spend much of the next two years fighting over these programs, voters who depend on them are going to be unpleasantly surprised. Keep in mind that most voters oppose cuts to Social Security and Medicare, so they are likely to be very nervous about any proposals to restrain their growth, especially if opponents portray such cuts as excessive. Even worse, most members of Congress are not well informed about these programs, so they\xe2\x80\x99ll have a hard time soothing public anxieties.'b'The second lesson is that presidential support for reform is a necessary, though not a sufficient, condition for success. As John Boehner, the new speaker of the House, said himself on election night, governing from Capitol Hill doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work \xe2\x80\x94 the president has to set the agenda.'b'If Mr. Obama delivers a good-faith proposal for Social Security, for example in this month\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union address, then by all means Republicans should offer a serious counterproposal and, depending on their differences, negotiate. If he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, then Republicans should wait on a new president in 2013.'b'But they should do more than wait: in the event of presidential inaction, reformers should blame Mr. Obama for the lack of progress and work to make entitlements a litmus-test issue in the Republican presidential primaries. The goal should be to nominate someone willing to make a strong case for reducing entitlement growth as part of a larger strategy to restore American prosperity.'b'True, reform won\xe2\x80\x99t generate the near-term budget savings the federal government needs to avoid a fiscal crisis this decade. Even the boldest plans phase their cuts in gradually, and they exempt people who are at or near retirement.'b'But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that all action on entitlements can be deferred. Medicaid is wrecking state budgets and is set to expand thanks to the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 new health care law. It is also more politically vulnerable than Social Security or Medicare, which offer benefits to everyone who reaches old age. As they try to undo the health care law, Republicans might also consider capping Medicaid\xe2\x80\x99s growth and sending the savings back to the states. It would be a mistake, however, for Republicans to take the same approach to Social Security or Medicare.'b'Instead, they should show their budget-hawk bona fides by making spending cuts elsewhere.'b'They should begin by freezing or cutting government payrolls, including in the legislative branch \xe2\x80\x94 something Republicans have already started doing. Message: the federal government is not just imposing sacrifices but sharing them. Then they should get control of the discretionary, or non-entitlement, portions of the budget, which are small only in comparison with entitlements. Only after winning those fights, and probably electing a new president, should the old-age entitlements be up for reform.'b'There are times when it is admirable for a politician to support legislation for the public good even if it will cost him his own re-election. Some of the Democrats who voted for the new health care law and then lost in November probably feel that way. But that tradeoff made sense only because they knew they could actually pass the law.'b'There is no point to Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 endangering their seats for legislation, however worthy, unless they have a good shot at getting a presidential signature on it. They will get their answer in the next State of the Union address.'b'Dhaka, Bangladesh'b'IN the 1970s, when I began working here on what would eventually be called \xe2\x80\x9cmicrocredit,\xe2\x80\x9d one of my goals was to eliminate the presence of loan sharks who grow rich by preying on the poor. In 1983, I founded Grameen Bank to provide small loans that people, especially poor women, could use to bring themselves out of poverty. At that time, I never imagined that one day microcredit would give rise to its own breed of loan sharks.'b'But it has. And as a result, 'b'many borrowers in India have been defaulting on their 'b'microloans'b','b' which could then result in lenders being driven out of business.  India\xe2\x80\x99s crisis points to a clear need to get microcredit back on track.'b'Troubles with microcredit began around 2005, when many lenders started looking for ways to make a profit on the loans by shifting from their status as nonprofit organizations to commercial enterprises. In 2007, Compartamos, a Mexican bank, became Latin America\xe2\x80\x99s first microcredit bank to go public. And this past August, SKS Microfinance, the largest bank of its kind in India,   raised $358 million in an initial public offering.'b'To ensure that the small loans would be profitable for their shareholders, such banks needed to raise interest rates  and engage in aggressive marketing and loan collection. The kind of empathy that had once been shown toward borrowers when the lenders were nonprofits disappeared. The people whom microcredit was supposed to help were being harmed. In India, borrowers came to believe lenders were taking advantage of them, and stopped repaying their loans.'b'Commercialization has been a terrible wrong turn for microfinance, and it indicates a worrying \xe2\x80\x9cmission drift\xe2\x80\x9d in the motivation of those lending to the poor. Poverty should be eradicated, not seen as a money-making opportunity.'b'There are serious practical problems with treating microcredit as an ordinary profit-maximizing business. Instead of creating wholesale funds dedicated to lending money to microfinance institutions, as Bangladesh has done,  these commercial organizations raise larger sums in volatile international financial markets, and then transmit financial risks to the poor.'b'Furthermore, it means commercial microcredit institutions are subject to demands for ever-increasing profits, which can only come in the form of higher interest rates charged to the poor, defeating the very purpose of the loans.'b'Some advocates of commercialization say it\xe2\x80\x99s the only way to attract the money that\xe2\x80\x99s needed to expand the availability of microcredit and to \xe2\x80\x9cliberate\xe2\x80\x9d the system from dependence on foundations and other charitable donors. But it is possible to harness investment in microcredit \xe2\x80\x94 and even make a profit \xe2\x80\x94 without working through either charities or global financial markets.'b'Grameen Bank, where I am managing director, has 2,500 branches in Bangladesh. It lends out more than $100 million a month, from loans of less than $10 for beggars in our \xe2\x80\x9cStruggling Members\xe2\x80\x9d program, to micro-enterprise loans of about $1,000.  Most branches are financially self-reliant, dependent only on deposits from ordinary Bangladeshis.   When borrowers join the bank, they open a savings account. All borrowers have savings accounts at the bank, many with balances larger than their loans. And every year, the bank\xe2\x80\x99s profits are returned to the borrowers \xe2\x80\x94 97 percent of them poor women \xe2\x80\x94 in the form of dividends.'b'More microcredit institutions should adopt this model. The community needs to reaffirm the original definition of microcredit, abandon commercialization and turn back to serving the poor.'b'Stricter government regulation could help. The maximum interest rate should not exceed the cost of the fund \xe2\x80\x94 meaning the cost that is incurred by the bank to procure the money to lend \xe2\x80\x94 plus 15 percent of the fund. That 15 percent goes to cover operational costs and contribute to profit. In the case of Grameen Bank, the cost of fund is 10 percent. So, the maximum interest rate could be 25 percent. However, we charge 20 percent to the borrowers. The ideal \xe2\x80\x9cspread\xe2\x80\x9d between the cost of the fund and the lending rate should be close to 10 percent.'b'To enforce such a cap, every country where microloans are made needs a microcredit regulatory authority. Bangladesh, which has the most microcredit borrowers per square mile in the world, 'b'has had such an authority'b' for several years,  and it is devoted to ensuring transparency in lending and prevented excessive interest rates and collection practices. In the future, it may be able to accredit microfinance banks. India, with its burgeoning microcredit sector, is most in need of a similar agency.'b'There are always people eager to take advantage of the vulnerable. But credit programs that seek to profit from the suffering of the poor should not be described as \xe2\x80\x9cmicrocredit,\xe2\x80\x9d and investors who own such programs should not be allowed to benefit from the trust and respect that microcredit banks have rightly earned.'b'Governments are responsible for preventing such abuse. In 1997, then First Lady Hillary Clinton and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh met with other world leaders to commit to providing 100 million poor people with microloans and other financial services by 2005. At the time, it looked like an utterly impossible task, but by 2006 we had achieved it. World leaders should come together again to provide the powerful and visionary leadership to help steer microcredit back on course.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Organize This!'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (news article, Jan. 9):'b'I like to think I keep an organized home, but the home-organizing philosophy of Barbara Reich deserves an argument.

Such laws and practices would not be tolerated here, and they have no place in Jerusalem, irrespective of any future peace arrangements.'b'Morton A.

Despite all of the pledges of help, and vows to do things differently, there are more than a million displaced people still living in camps and a cholera epidemic rages. An immense relief effort has saved tens of thousands of lives, but reconstruction is only just beginning.'b'This year must be better. Looking resolutely forward to the next 12 months, here are some of the things Haiti needs to achieve, with the world\xe2\x80\x99s help. Some are difficult, but all are possible:'b''b'A CREDIBLE NEW GOVERNMENT 'b'President Ren\xc3\xa9 Pr\xc3\xa9val has failed to provide desperately needed leadership. Many basic policy questions, such as where to build new housing, have still not been made. That leadership crisis was made even worse by November\xe2\x80\x99s chaotic presidential election and charges that an electoral council, handpicked by Mr. Pr\xc3\xa9val, may have cooked the results.'b'Observers led by the Organization of American States have just re-examined vote tallies and reported that the second-place finisher, Mr. Pr\xc3\xa9val\xe2\x80\x99s prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 Jude C\xc3\xa9lestin, was, in fact, out of the running, as many Haitians and observers believed. Mr. Pr\xc3\xa9val and Mr. C\xc3\xa9lestin should accept that result and urge the country forward to a swift, better organized, runoff between the top two candidates: Mirlande Manigat and Michel Martelly.'b''b'ENERGIZE THE RECOVERY COMMISSION 'b'The Interim Haiti Recovery Commission, set up to unite donors and Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s leaders, was also very slow off the mark. It has now approved $3 billion in projects, $1.6 billion of them financed. It needs to develop and implement more comprehensive strategies for housing, health care, government reform and agriculture. Former President Bill Clinton and Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s prime minister, Jean-Max Bellerive, have provided important direction but need to push harder.'b''b'CONTAIN CHOLERA 'b'The epidemic is a horrifying reminder of why Haiti so urgently needs clean water and access to medical care \xe2\x80\x94 two of the yet-to-be-delivered-on promises. More than 3,000 people have been killed and thousands more are threatened.'b'Aid has been slow to arrive and the response \xe2\x80\x94 despite valiant relief efforts \xe2\x80\x94 has been hobbled by poor coordination and overconcentration in the capital, Port-au-Prince. The epidemic must be contained, and relief organizations need to learn from this flawed effort.'b''b'CLEAR MORE RUBBLE AND HOUSE THE DISPLACED 'b'These are inextricably linked. The country is drowning in its own rubble, and needs space to rebuild. Many main roads in the capital are now clear, and every day the government removes debris that residents gather from local streets. Even with the best coordination, this task may take another year or more.'b'Building homes for more than one million displaced people could take two or three years. The next president must quickly make important land-use decisions and employ all of his or her legal and persuasive powers against entrenched landowners and the bureaucratic status quo to get construction moving.'b''b'PROMOTE JOBS AND INVESTMENT'b' Here, too, there are glimmers of progress. The Haitian government, the United States and Inter-American Development Bank have signed a deal on an industrial park in northern Haiti. A South Korean textile company will be an anchor tenant and expects to hire 20,000 people. The project includes improvements in the port of Cap Haitien and in water supply, sewage treatment and electrification.'b'Haiti obviously needs more than one showcase project. But this is the kind of sensible planning and long-term commitment that will help build stability and bring more investment. It recognizes that new industrial development also needs houses, roads, schools and services, so that factories do not become surrounded by shantytowns. And that as the economy is rebuilt, it must also be relocated out of badly crowded Port-au-Prince.'b'While Haiti remains traumatized by the worst urban disaster in history, it has a lot going for it: new structures to promote sustainable development and investment, large pledges of money and the enduring patience and energy of its people. This is no time to give up. Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders, and the world, promised this time would be different. They must deliver.'b''b'Tragedy in Tucson. Six Dead. Democratic congresswoman shot in the head at rally.'b''b'Immediately after the news broke, the air became thick with conjecture, speculation and innuendo. There was a giddy, almost punch-drunk excitement on the left.  The prophecy had been fulfilled: \xe2\x80\x9cwords have consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d And now, the right\xe2\x80\x99s rhetorical chickens had finally come home to roost.'b'The dots were too close and the temptation to connect them too strong. The target was a Democratic congresswoman. There was the map of her district in the cross hairs. There were her own prescient worries about overheated rhetoric.'b'Within hours of the shooting, there was a full-fledged witch hunt to link the shooter to the right.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI saw Goody Proctor with the devil! Oh, I mean Jared Lee Loughner! Yes him. With the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The only problem is that there was no evidence then, and even now, that overheated rhetoric from the right had anything to do with the shooting. (In fact, a couple of people who said they knew him have described him as either 'b'apolitical'b' or \xe2\x80\x9c'b'quite liberal'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d) The picture emerging is of a sad and lonely soul slowly, and publicly, slipping into insanity.'b''b'I have written about violent rhetoric'b' before, and I\xe2\x80\x99m convinced that it\xe2\x80\x99s poisonous to our politics, that the preponderance of it comes from the right, and that it has the potential to manifest in massacres like the one in Tucson.'b'But I also know that potential, possibility and even plausibility are not proof.'b'The American people know it, too. According to'b' a USA Today/Gallup poll released Wednesday'b', 42 percent of those asked said that political rhetoric was not a factor at all in the shooting, 22 percent said that it was a minor factor and 20 percent said that it was a major factor. Furthermore, most agreed that focusing on conservative rhetoric as a link in the shooting was \xe2\x80\x9cnot a legitimate point but mostly an attempt to use the tragedy to make conservatives look bad.\xe2\x80\x9d And nearly an equal number of people said that Republicans, the Tea Party and Democrats had all \xe2\x80\x9cgone too far in using inflammatory language\xe2\x80\x9d to criticize their opponents.'b'Great. So the left overreacts and overreaches and it only accomplishes two things: fostering sympathy for its opponents and nurturing a false equivalence within the body politic. Well done, Democrats.'b'Now we\xe2\x80\x99ve settled into the by-any-means-necessary argument: anything that gets us to focus on the rhetoric and tamp it down is a good thing. But a wrong in the service of righteousness is no less wrong, no less corrosive, no less a menace to the very righteousness it\xe2\x80\x99s meant to support.'b'You can\xe2\x80\x99t claim the higher ground in a pit of quicksand.'b'Concocting connections to advance an argument actually weakens it. The argument for tonal moderation has been done a tremendous disservice by those who sought to score political points in the absence of proof.'b'The second semester French class began a little after 9 on the morning of April 16, 2007. The weather that day was unusually cold for April. A light snow was falling.'b'One of the students, Colin Goddard, now 25, recalled what happened that morning in a new documentary film, \xe2\x80\x9cLiving for 32.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe started hearing loud banging noises outside of our classroom,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe teacher went to the door to look into the hallway to see what was going on. ... As soon as she opened it, she shut it back again and said, \xe2\x80\x98Everyone get underneath your desk and somebody call 911.\xe2\x80\x99 I pulled out my phone and dialed 911, and I said, \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99re in Norris Hall. There\xe2\x80\x99s a shooting going on.\xe2\x80\x99 And as soon as I basically got that out, we saw bullets coming through the door.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Norris Hall is one of the main academic buildings on the campus of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, known as Virginia Tech. The gunman was a crazed student named Seung-Hui Cho, who was armed with a pair of semiautomatic pistols. It was not the first class he had visited that day.'b'Goddard remembered being shot in his left knee and feeling the blood, warm, seeping down his leg. The gunmen apparently left the panicked classroom momentarily. But the sound of gunfire continued.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then,\xe2\x80\x9d Goddard said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe bangs just got much louder again, and you could tell he was back in our room. This time he more methodically came down each of the rows, and he was still firing. At one point he was standing at my feet, and that\xe2\x80\x99s when I was shot a second time, in my left hip. Then he shot me a third time, in my right shoulder, and it flipped my whole body around and exposed my right side. And I was shot a fourth time, in my right hip.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In case we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t noticed, 'b'a photo'b' and a headline on the front page of The New York Times this week gave us some insight into just how sick our society has become. The photo showed 11-year-old Dallas Green weeping and using his left arm to wipe his eyes during the funeral for his sister, Christina-Taylor Green, who was 9 years old and was killed in the attack in Tucson that took the lives of five other people and left Representative Gabrielle Giffords gravely wounded.'b'Beneath the photo was the headline: \xe2\x80\x9cSadness Aside, No Shift Seen On Gun Laws.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What is the matter with us? Are we really helpless in the face of the astounding toll that guns take on this society?'b'More than 30,000 people die from gunfire every year. Another 66,000 or so are wounded, which means that nearly 100,000 men, women and children are shot in the United States annually. Have we really become so impotent as a society, so pathetically fearful in the face of the extremists, that we can\xe2\x80\x99t even take the most modest of steps to begin curbing this horror?'b'Where is the leadership? We know who\xe2\x80\x99s on the side of the gun crazies. Where is the leadership on the side of sanity?'b'For starters, assault weapons should be banned. Their raison d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xaatre is to kill the maximum number of people  \xe2\x80\x94  people, not animals  \xe2\x80\x94  in the shortest amount of time.'b'In \xe2\x80\x9cLiving for 32,\xe2\x80\x9d the 32 refers to the 32 students and faculty members who were killed by Cho at Virginia Tech. Goddard, during a filmed visit to the site of the shooting, remembered that when the police showed up, they had to call out to the survivors inside the classroom for help in opening the door, which was blocked by bodies piled in front of it.'b'He said it was only when the police cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cShooter down!\xe2\x80\x9d that he realized that Cho had killed himself. Then came the awful process of triage: \xe2\x80\x9cI remember hearing them walk up to people, saying, \xe2\x80\x98This person\xe2\x80\x99s yellow. This person\xe2\x80\x99s red.\xe2\x80\x99 And then I heard, \xe2\x80\x98Black tag. Black tag.

He is now working with the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence.'b'Goddard does not want guns banned and has no desire to deny people their constitutional rights. But he believes there are sensible steps that could be taken that would make the U.S. a safer and better place, a place where college students and their professors do not have to worry about getting shot to death in the classroom.'b'In an ugly power play against justice and accountability, Hezbollah has withdrawn from Lebanon\xe2\x80\x99s cabinet, bringing down the unity government of Prime Minister Saad Hariri. It must be resisted by all responsible Lebanese politicians and Arab governments, with strong support from the international community.'b'Hezbollah says it will give its support only to a Lebanese government that abandons and denounces the international tribunal investigating the 2005 assassination of Rafik Hariri, the former prime minister and Saad Hariri\xe2\x80\x99s father. The tribunal is preparing indictments, and Hezbollah members are expected to be among those charged.'b'The elder Mr. Hariri, a Sunni Muslim, was widely respected for helping rebuild Lebanon after its civil war. If Hezbollah, a Shiite militia and political party, is implicated in his murder, it would damage the group\xe2\x80\x99s claims to be a champion of broader Lebanese and Arab causes.'b'The tribunal, backed by the United Nations and partly financed by the Lebanese government, is an important part of a multiyear effort to strengthen Lebanese institutions and re-establish the rule of law. Undermining it risks plunging Lebanon back into the era of assassinations and impunity that nearly destroyed it.'b'Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s move was timed to coincide with Mr. Hariri\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the White House this week where he sought President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s assurance of continued American support for the tribunal\xe2\x80\x99s work. He got that assurance, and the president\xe2\x80\x99s message was conveyed directly to Arab capitals by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.'b'President Nicolas Sarkozy of France also declared his strong support. More international support for the tribunal, and Mr. Hariri, is needed, especially from the Arab world. Saudi Arabia, recently stepped back from its efforts to persuade Syria to rein in Hezbollah and help resolve the crisis.'b'Syria\xe2\x80\x99s leaders are no longer prime suspects in the Hariri inquiry. But they need to understand that any further effort to undermine Lebanon\xe2\x80\x99s fragile democracy \xe2\x80\x94 by Syria or its client Hezbollah \xe2\x80\x94 will only lead to more isolation for Syria.'b'The Syrian government needs to press Hezbollah to end its political extortion and rejoin a national unity government. Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s huge Lebanese-Shiite electoral constituency makes it hard to ignore. But impunity for assassination is too high a price to pay for its support.'b'Hezbollah depends on Syrian money and arms and responds to pressure from Damascus. Enlisting Syrian cooperation will be the first challenge facing Robert Ford, the new United States ambassador, who arrives in Damascus next week.'b'The New York State prison system has greatly improved mental health services since 2007 when it settled a lawsuit that had accused it of mistreating mentally ill inmates.  A troubling increase in prison suicides suggests that all of the problems have not been solved.'b'State records show that there were 20 suicides in 2010, double the number in 2009 and the highest since 1978, the first year for which records were released. The figures inched higher in the 1980s, then even higher in the \xe2\x80\x9990s. The decade that just ended was the worst on record, with more than 125 inmates taking their own lives.'b'The increase is both troubling and puzzling, especially since the prison population has declined by 20 percent in the last 10 years. In addition, the Department of Corrections has improved conditions for the mentally ill, creating new therapeutic programs and retraining staff. It has also placed fewer severely disturbed inmates in solitary confinement where they were at a much greater risk of taking their own lives. Most important, entering inmates are screened by mental health professionals.'b'Advocates for the mentally ill say that suicide prevention programs are being poorly implemented. Others have even suggested that prison officials in some locations may be encouraging staff members to misdiagnose the most severely disturbed people since they would be entitled to intensive \xe2\x80\x94 and costly \xe2\x80\x94 therapy. The fact that some who had committed suicide were not even listed on the mental health caseload as needing close attention is certainly worrying.'b'The rising suicide rate must be investigated and remedies quickly found. A prison sentence for a mentally ill person should not be a sentence to death.'b'To the Editor:'b'In reading \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Sadness Aside, No Shift Seen on Gun Laws'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 14), I am despondent.'b'We are becoming a nation of wimps, with members of Congress who refuse to stand up to the National Rifle Association.'b'There is no reason for private ownership of guns, especially automatic and semiautomatic ones.

In the north, there remain at least another 1.5 million displaced southern Sudanese, and hundreds of thousands more are uprooted in the south by interethnic violence, while in Darfur, more than two million displaced persons have been languishing in destitute camps since 2004. One of the reasons for this oversight is that there is no clearly defined senior focal point in the United States government for those internally displaced \xe2\x80\x94 not in the State Department, the United States Mission to the United Nations or the Agency for International Development.'b'A 2004 internally displaced persons policy of the United States aid agency is unknown to most of the government and is not uniformly applied.

In order to understand this bewildering, beautiful continent \xe2\x80\x94 and to grasp the complexity that is my home country, Nigeria, Africa\xe2\x80\x99s most populous nation \xe2\x80\x94 I think it is absolutely important that we examine the story of African people.'b'In my mind, there are two parts to the story of the African peoples ... the rain beating us obviously goes back at least half a millennium. And what is happening in Africa today is a result of what has been going on for 400 or 500 years, from the \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d of Africa by Europe, through the period of darkness that engulfed the continent during the trans-Atlantic slave trade and through the Berlin Conference of 1885. That controversial gathering of the leading European powers, which precipitated the \xe2\x80\x9cscramble for Africa,\xe2\x80\x9d we all know took place without African consultation or representation. It created new boundaries in ancient kingdoms, and nation-states resulting in disjointed, inexplicable, tension-prone countries today.'b'During the colonial period, struggles were fought, exhaustingly, on so many fronts \xe2\x80\x94 for equality, for justice, for freedom \xe2\x80\x94 by politicians, intellectuals and common folk alike. At the end of the day, when the liberty was won, we found that we had not sufficiently reckoned with one incredibly important fact: If you take someone who has not really been in charge of himself for 300 years and tell him, \xe2\x80\x9cO.K., you are now free,\xe2\x80\x9d he will not know where to begin.'b'This is how I see the chaos in Africa today and the absence of logic in what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing. Africa\xe2\x80\x99s postcolonial disposition is the result of a people who have lost the habit of ruling themselves, forgotten their traditional way of thinking, embracing and engaging the world without sufficient preparation. We have also had difficulty running the systems foisted upon us at the dawn of independence by our colonial masters. We are like the man in the Igbo proverb who does not know where the rain began to beat him and so cannot say where he dried his body.'b'People don\xe2\x80\x99t like this particular analysis, because it looks as if we want to place the blame on someone else. Let me be clear, because I have inadvertently developed a reputation (some of my friends say one I relish) as a provocateur: because the West has had a long but uneven engagement with Africa, it is imperative that it also play an important role in forging solutions to Africa\xe2\x80\x99s myriad problems. This will require good will and concerted effort on the part of all those who share the weight of Africa\xe2\x80\x99s historical albatross.'b'In Nigeria, in the years before we finally gained independence in 1960, we had no doubt about where we were going: we were going to inherit freedom; that was all that mattered. The possibilities for us were endless, or so it seemed. Nigeria was enveloped by a certain assurance of an unbridled destiny, by an overwhelming excitement about life\xe2\x80\x99s promise, without any knowledge of providence\xe2\x80\x99s intended destination.'b'While the much-vaunted day of independence arrived to much fanfare, it rapidly became a faded memory. The years flew past. By 1966, Nigeria was called a cesspool of corruption and misrule. Public servants helped themselves freely to the nation\xe2\x80\x99s wealth. Elections were blatantly rigged. The national census was outrageously stage-managed to give certain ethnic groups more power; judges and magistrates were manipulated by the politicians in power. The politicians themselves were corrupted by foreign business interests.'b'The political situation deteriorated rapidly and Nigeria was quickly consumed by civil war. The belligerents were an aggrieved people in the southeast of the nation, the Biafrans, who found themselves fleeing pogroms and persecution at the hands of the determined government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, which had been armed to the teeth by some of the major international powers. My fellow Biafrans spent nearly three years fighting for a cause, fighting for freedom. But all that collapsed and Biafra stood defeated.'b'It had been a very bitter experience that led to the hostilities in the first place. And the big powers got involved in prolonging it. You see, we, the little people of the world, are constantly expendable. The big powers can play their games, even if millions perish in the process. And perish they did. In the end, more than a million people (and possibly as many as three million), mainly children, died either in the fighting or from starvation because of the Nigerian government\xe2\x80\x99s economic blockade.'b'After the civil war, we saw a \xe2\x80\x9cunified\xe2\x80\x9d Nigeria saddled with an even more insidious reality. We were plagued by a home-grown enemy: the political ineptitude, mediocrity, indiscipline, ethnic bigotry and corruption of the ruling class. Compounding the situation was the fact that Nigeria was now awash in oil boom petrodollars. The country\xe2\x80\x99s young, affable head of state, Gen. Yakubu Gowon, ever so cocksure following his civil war victory, was proclaiming to the entire planet that Nigeria had more money than it knew what to do with. A new era of great decadence and decline was born. It continues to this day.'b'What can Nigeria do to live up the promise of its postcolonial dream? First, we will have to find a way to do away with the present system of political godfatherism. This archaic practice allows a relative handful of wealthy men \xe2\x80\x94 many of them half-baked, poorly educated thugs \xe2\x80\x94 to sponsor their chosen candidates and push them right through to the desired political position, bribing, threatening and, on occasion, murdering any opposition in the process. We will have to make sure that the electoral body overseeing elections is run by widely respected and competent officials, chosen by a nonpartisan group free of governmental influence or interference.'b'And we have to find a way to open up the political process to every Nigerian. Today, we have a system where only those individuals who can pay an exorbitant application fee and finance a political campaign can vie for the presidency. It would not surprise any close observer to discover that in this inane system, the same unsavory characters who have destroyed the country and looted the treasury are the ones able to run for the presidency.'b'But we must also remember that restoring democratic systems alone will not, overnight, make the country a success. Let me borrow from the history of the Igbo ethnic group. The Igbo have long been a very democratic people. They express a strong anti-monarchy sentiment with the common name Ezebuilo, which translates to \xe2\x80\x9ca king is an enemy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There is no doubt that they experienced the highhandedness of kings, so they decided that a king cannot be a trusted friend of the people without checks and balances. And they tried all kinds of arrangements to whittle down the menace of those with the will to power, because such people exist in large numbers in every society. So the Igbo created all kinds of titles which cost very much to acquire. In the end, the aspirant to titles becomes impoverished in the process and ends up with very little. So that individual begins again, and by the time his life is over, he has a lot of prestige, but very little power.'b'This is not a time to bemoan all the challenges ahead. It is a time to work at developing, nurturing and sustaining democracy. But we also must realize that we need patience and cannot expect instant miracles. Building a nation is not something a people do in one regime, in a few years, even. The Chinese had their chance to emerge as the leading nation in the world in the Middle Ages, but were consumed by interethnic political posturing and wars, and had to wait another 500 years for another chance. America did not arrive at its much admired democracy overnight. When President Abraham Lincoln famously defined democracy as \xe2\x80\x9cthe government of the people, by the people, for the people\xe2\x80\x9d he was drawing upon classical thought and at least 100 years of American rigorous intellectual reflection on the matter.'b'Sustaining democracy in Nigeria will require more than just free elections. It will also mean ending a system in which corruption is not just tolerated, but widely encouraged and hugely profitable. It is estimated that about $400 billion has been pilfered from Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s treasury since independence. One needs to stop for a moment to wrap one\xe2\x80\x99s mind around that incredible figure. It is larger than the annual gross domestic products of Norway and Sweden. This theft of national funds is one of the factors essentially making it impossible for Nigeria to succeed. Nigerians alone are not responsible. We all know that the corrupt cabal of Nigerians has friends abroad who not only help it move the billions abroad but also shield the perpetrators from persecution.'b'Many analysts see a direct link between crude oil and the corruption in Nigeria, that creating a system to prevent politicians from having access to petrodollars is needed to reduce large-scale corruption. For most people, the solution is straightforward: if you commit a crime, you should be brought to book. But in a country like Nigeria, where there are no easy fixes, one must examine the issue of accountability, which has to be a strong component of the fight against corruption.'b'Some feel that a strong executive should be the one to hold people accountable. But if the president has all the power and resources of the country in his control, and he is also the one who selects who should be probed or not, clearly we will have an uneven system where those who are favored by the emperor have free rein to loot the treasury.'b'Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s story has not been, entirely, one long, unrelieved history of despair. At the midcentury mark of the state\xe2\x80\x99s existence, Nigerians have begun to ask themselves the hard questions. How does the state of anarchy become reversed? What measures can be taken to prevent corrupt candidates from recycling themselves into positions of leadership? Young Nigerians have often come to me desperately seeking solutions to several conundrums: How do we begin to solve these problems in Nigeria where the structures are present but there is no accountability?'b'ONE initial step is to change the nation\xe2\x80\x99s Official Secrets Act. Incredible as it may seem, it is illegal in Nigeria to publish official government data and statistics \xe2\x80\x94 including accounts spent by or accruing to the government. This, simply, is inconsistent with the spirit and practice of democracy. There is now a freedom of information bill before the National Assembly that would end this unacceptable state of affairs. It should be passed, free from any modifications that would render it ineffectual, and assented to by President Goodluck Jonathan. This can and should be achieved before the presidential election in April.'b'In the end, I foresee that the Nigerian solution will come in stages. First we have to nurture and strengthen our democratic institutions \xe2\x80\x94 and strive for the freest and fairest elections possible. That will place the true candidates of the people in office. Within the fabric of a democracy, a free press can thrive and a strong justice system can flourish. The checks and balances we have spoken about and the laws needed to curb corruption will then naturally find a footing.'b'And there has to be the development of a new patriotic consciousness, not one simply based on the well-worn notions of the \xe2\x80\x9cUnity of Nigeria\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cFaith in Nigeria\xe2\x80\x9d often touted by our corrupt leaders; but one based on an awareness of the responsibility of leaders to the led and disseminated by civil society, schools and intellectuals. It is from this kind of environment that a leader, humbled by the trust placed upon him by the people, will emerge, willing to use the power given to him for the good of the people.'b'Madison, Wis.'b'EVER since NewSouth Books 'b'announced it would publish a version'b' of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\xe2\x80\x9d with the \xe2\x80\x9cn-word\xe2\x80\x9d removed, reaction has split between traditionalists outraged at censorship and those who feel this might be a way to get teenagers, especially African-American boys, comfortable reading a literary classic. From a mother\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, I think both sides are mistaken.'b'No parent who is raising a black teenager and trying to get him to read serious fiction for his high school English class would ever argue that \xe2\x80\x9cHuckleberry Finn\xe2\x80\x9d is not a greatly problematic work.

The remedy is to refuse to teach this novel in high school and to wait until college \xe2\x80\x94 or even graduate school \xe2\x80\x94 where it can be put in proper context.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHuckleberry Finn\xe2\x80\x9d is not an appropriate introduction to serious literature, and anyone who cannot see that has never tried putting an audio version of it on during a long car trip while an African-American teenager sits beside her and slowly, slowly slips on his noise-canceling earphones in order to listen to hip-hop.'b'The derogatory word is part of the problem, but not the entirety of it \xe2\x80\x94 hip-hop music uses the same word. Of course, the speakers are different in each case, and the worlds they are speaking of and from are very distant from one another. The listener can tell the difference in a second. The listener knows which voice is speaking to him and which is not getting remotely close.'b'No novel with the word \xe2\x80\x9ckike\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cbitch\xe2\x80\x9d spelled out 200 times could or should be separated \xe2\x80\x94  for purposes of irony or pedagogy \xe2\x80\x94 from the attitudes that produced those words. It\xe2\x80\x99s also impossible that such a novel would be taught in a high school classroom. And if it were taught, student alienation might very well contribute to another breed of achievement gap.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHuckleberry Finn\xe2\x80\x9d is suited to a college course in which Twain\xe2\x80\x99s obsession with the 19th-century theater of American hucksterism \xe2\x80\x94 the wastrel West, the rapscallion South, the economic strays and escapees of a harsh new country \xe2\x80\x94 can be discussed in the context of Jim\xe2\x80\x99s particular story (and Huck\xe2\x80\x99s).'b'An African-American 10th grader, in someone\xe2\x80\x99s near-sighted attempt to get him newly appreciative of novels, does not benefit by being taken back right then to a time when a young white boy slowly realizes, sort of, the humanity of a black man, realizes that that black man is more than chattel even if that black man is also full of illogic and stereotypical superstitions.'b'Huck Finn refers to himself as an idiot and still finds Jim more foolish than himself. Although Twain has compassion for the affectionate Jim, he has an interest in burlesque; although he is sensitive to Jim\xe2\x80\x99s heartbreaking losses, he is always looking for comedy and repeatedly holds Jim up as a figure of howling fun, ridicule that is specific to his condition as a black man.'b'The young black American male of today, whose dignity in our public schools is not always preserved or made a priority, does not need at the start of his literary life to be immersed in an even more racist era by reading a celebrated text that exuberantly expresses everything crazy and wicked about that time \xe2\x80\x94 not if one\xe2\x80\x99s goal is to get that teenager to like books. Huck\xe2\x80\x99s voice is a complicated amalgam of idioms and perspectives and is not for the inexperienced contemporary reader.'b'There are other books more appropriate for an introduction to serious reading.

But what would be helpful are school administrators who will break with tradition and bring more flexibility, imagination and social purpose to our high school curriculums. College, where the students have more experience with racial attitudes and literature, can do as it pleases.'b'IN a great many fields, researchers would give their eyeteeth to have a direct glimpse of the past. Instead, they generally have to piece together remote conditions using remnants like weathered fossils, decaying parchments or mummified remains. Cosmology, the study of the origin and evolution of the universe, is different. It is the one arena in which we can actually witness history.'b'The pinpoints of starlight we see with the naked eye are photons that have been streaming toward us for a few years or a few thousand. The light from more distant objects, captured by powerful telescopes, has been traveling toward us far longer than that, sometimes for billions of years. When we look at such ancient light, we are seeing \xe2\x80\x94 literally \xe2\x80\x94 ancient times.'b'During the past decade, as observations of such ancient starlight have provided deep insight into  the universe\xe2\x80\x99s past,  they have also, surprisingly,  provided deep insight into the nature of the future. And the future that the data suggest is particularly disquieting \xe2\x80\x94 because of something called 'b'dark energy'b'.'b'This story of discovery begins a century ago with 'b'Albert Einstein'b', who realized that space is not an immutable stage on which events play out, as 'b'Isaac Newton'b' had envisioned. Instead, through his general theory of relativity, Einstein found that space, and time too, can bend, twist and warp, responding much as a trampoline does to a jumping child. In fact, so malleable is space that, according to the math, the size of the universe necessarily changes over  time: the fabric of space must expand or contract \xe2\x80\x94 it can\xe2\x80\x99t stay put.'b'For Einstein, this was an unacceptable conclusion. He\xe2\x80\x99d spent 10 grueling years developing the general theory of relativity, seeking a better understanding of gravity, but to him the notion of an expanding or contracting cosmos seemed blatantly erroneous. It flew in the face of the prevailing wisdom that, over the largest of scales, the universe was fixed and unchanging.'b'Einstein responded swiftly. He modified the equations of general relativity so that the mathematics 'b'would 'b'yield an unchanging cosmos. A static situation, like a stalemate in a tug of war, requires equal but opposite forces that cancel  each other. Across large distances, the force that shapes the cosmos is the attractive pull of gravity. And so, Einstein reasoned, a counterbalancing force would need to provide a repulsive push. But what force could that be?'b'Remarkably, he found that a simple modification of general relativity\xe2\x80\x99s equations entailed something that would have, well, blown Newton\xe2\x80\x99s mind: antigravity \xe2\x80\x94 a gravitational force that pushes instead of pulls. Ordinary matter, like the 'b'Earth'b' or Sun, can generate only attractive gravity, but the math revealed that a more exotic source \xe2\x80\x94 an energy that uniformly fills space, much as steam fills a sauna, only invisibly \xe2\x80\x94 would generate gravity\xe2\x80\x99s repulsive version. Einstein called this space-filling energy the cosmological constant, and he found that by finely adjusting its value, the repulsive gravity it produced would precisely cancel the usual attractive gravity coming from stars and galaxies, yielding a static cosmos. He breathed a sigh of relief.'b'A dozen years later, however, Einstein rued the day he introduced the cosmological constant. In 1929, the American astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that distant galaxies are all rushing away from us. And the best explanation for this cosmic exodus came directly from general relativity: much as poppy seeds in a muffin that\xe2\x80\x99s baking move apart as the dough swells, galaxies move apart as the space in which they\xe2\x80\x99re embedded expands. Hubble\xe2\x80\x99s observations thus established that there was no need for a cosmological constant; the universe is not static.'b'Had Einstein only trusted the original mathematics of general relativity, he would have made one of the most spectacular predictions of all time \xe2\x80\x94 that the universe is expanding \xe2\x80\x94 more than a decade before it was discovered. Instead, he was left to lick his wounds, summarily removing the cosmological constant from the equations of general relativity and, according to one of his trusted colleagues, calling it his greatest blunder.'b'But the story of the cosmological constant was far from over.'b'Fast forward to the 1990s, when we find two teams of astronomers undertaking painstakingly precise observations of distant supernovae \xe2\x80\x94 exploding stars so brilliant they can be seen clear across the cosmos \xe2\x80\x94 to determine how the expansion rate of space has changed over the history of the universe. These researchers anticipated that the gravitational attraction of matter dotting the night\xe2\x80\x99s sky would slow the expansion, much as Earth\xe2\x80\x99s gravity slows the speed of a ball tossed upward. By bearing witness to distant supernovae, cosmic beacons that trace the universe\xe2\x80\x99s expansion rate at various moments in the past, the teams sought to make this quantitative. Shockingly, however, when the data were analyzed, the teams found that the expansion rate has not been slowing down. It\xe2\x80\x99s been speeding up.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s as if that tossed ball shot away from your hand, racing upward faster and faster. You\xe2\x80\x99d conclude that something must be driving the ball away. Similarly, the astronomers concluded that something in space must be pushing galaxies apart ever more quickly. And after scrutinizing the situation, they have found that the push is most likely the repulsive gravity produced by a cosmological constant.'b'When Einstein introduced the cosmological constant, he envisioned its value being finely adjusted to exactly balance ordinary attractive gravity. But for other values the cosmological constant\xe2\x80\x99s repulsive gravity can beat out attractive gravity, and yield the observed accelerated spatial expansion, spot on. Were Einstein still with us, his discovery that repulsive gravity lies within nature\xe2\x80\x99s repertoire would have likely garnered him another 'b'Nobel prize'b'.'b'As remarkable as it is that even one of Einstein\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbad\xe2\x80\x9d ideas has proven prophetic, many puzzles still surround the cosmological constant: If there is a diffuse, invisible energy permeating space, where did it come from? Is this dark energy (to use modern parlance) a permanent fixture of space, or might its strength change over time? Perhaps most perplexing of all is a question of quantitative detail. The most refined attempts to calculate the amount of dark energy suffusing space miss the measured value by a gargantuan factor of 10'b'123'b'  (that is, a 1 followed by 123 zeroes) \xe2\x80\x94 the single greatest mismatch between theory and observation in the history of science.'b'THESE are vital questions that rank among today\xe2\x80\x99s deepest mysteries. But standing beside them is an unassailable conclusion, one that\xe2\x80\x99s particularly unnerving. If the dark energy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t degrade over time, then the accelerated expansion of space will continue unabated, dragging away distant galaxies ever farther and ever faster. A hundred billion years from now, any galaxy that\xe2\x80\x99s not resident in our neighborhood will have been swept away by swelling space for so long that it will be racing from us at faster than the speed of light. (Although nothing can move 'b'through'b' space faster than the speed of light, there\xe2\x80\x99s no limit on how fast space itself can expand.)'b'Light emitted by such galaxies will therefore fight a losing battle to traverse the rapidly widening gulf that separates us. The light will never reach Earth and so the galaxies will slip permanently beyond our capacity to see, regardless of how powerful our telescopes may become.'b'Because of this, when future astronomers look to the sky, they will no longer witness the past. The past will have drifted beyond the cliffs of space. Observations will reveal nothing but an endless stretch of inky black stillness.'b'If astronomers in the far future have records handed down from our era, attesting to an expanding cosmos filled with galaxies, they will face a  peculiar choice: Should they believe \xe2\x80\x9cprimitive\xe2\x80\x9d knowledge that speaks of a cosmos very much at odds with what anyone has seen for billions and billions of years? Or should they focus on their own observations and valiantly seek explanations for an island universe containing a small cluster of galaxies floating within an unchanging sea of darkness \xe2\x80\x94 a conception of the cosmos that we know definitively to be wrong?'b'And what if future astronomers have no such records, perhaps because on their planet scientific acumen developed long after the deep night sky faded to black? For them, the notion of an expanding universe teeming with galaxies would be a wholly theoretical construct, bereft of empirical evidence.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ve grown accustomed to the idea that with sufficient hard work and dedication, there\xe2\x80\x99s no barrier to how fully we can both grasp reality and confirm our understanding. But by gazing far into space we\xe2\x80\x99ve captured a handful of starkly informative photons, a cosmic telegram billions of years in transit. And the message, echoing across the ages, is clear. Sometimes nature guards her secrets with the unbreakable grip of physical law. Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons from just beyond the horizon.'b'BEIJING'b'An international study published last month looked at how students in 65 countries performed in math, science and reading. The winner was: Confucianism!'b'At 'b'the very top of the charts'b', in all three fields and by a wide margin, was Shanghai. Three of the next top four performers were also societies with a Confucian legacy of reverence for education: Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea. The only non-Confucian country in the mix was Finland.'b'The United States? We came in 15th in reading, 23rd in science and 31st in math.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve been visiting schools in China and Asia for more than 20 years (and we sent our own kids briefly to schools in Japan, which also bears a Confucian imprint), and I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent much of that time either envious or dumbfounded. I\xe2\x80\x99ll never forget pulling our 2-year-old son out of his Tokyo nursery school so we could visit the States and being handed a form in which we had to list: \xe2\x80\x9creason for proposed vacation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Education thrives in China and the rest of Asia because it is a top priority  \xe2\x80\x94  and we\xe2\x80\x99ve plenty to learn from that.'b'Granted, 'b'Shanghai\xe2\x80\x99s rise to the top of the global charts'b' is not representative of all China, for Shanghai has the country\xe2\x80\x99s best schools. Yet it\xe2\x80\x99s also true that China has made remarkable improvements in the once-awful schools in peasant areas.'b'Just 20 years ago, children often dropped out of elementary school in rural areas. Teachers sometimes could barely speak standard Mandarin,  which, in theory, is the language of instruction.'b'These days, even in backward rural areas, most girls and boys alike attend high school. College isn\xe2\x80\x99t unusual. And the teachers are vastly improved. In my Chinese-American wife\xe2\x80\x99s ancestral village  \xe2\x80\x94  a poor community in southern China  \xe2\x80\x94  the peasant children are a grade ahead in math compared with my children at an excellent public school in the New York area. That seems broadly true of math around the country.'b'For a socialist system that hesitates to fire people, China has also been surprisingly adept  \xe2\x80\x94  more so than America  \xe2\x80\x94  at dealing with ineffective teachers. Chinese principals can\xe2\x80\x99t easily dismiss teachers, but they can get extra training for less effective teachers, or if that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work, push them into other jobs.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBad teachers can always be made gym teachers,\xe2\x80\x9d a principal in the city of Xian explained to me as she showed me around her kindergarten. In China, school sports and gym just don\xe2\x80\x99t matter.'b'(That kindergarten exemplified another of China\xe2\x80\x99s strengths: excellent early childhood education, typically beginning at age 2. Indeed, the only element of China\xe2\x80\x99s education system that really falters badly is the university system. Colleges are third-rate and should be a national disgrace.)'b'But this is the paradox: Chinese themselves are far less impressed by their school system. Almost every time I try to interview a Chinese about the system here, I hear grousing rather than praise. Many Chinese complain scathingly that their system kills independent thought and creativity, and they envy the American system for nurturing self-reliance  \xe2\x80\x94  and for trying to make learning exciting and not just a chore.'b'In Xian, I visited Gaoxin Yizhong, perhaps the city\xe2\x80\x99s best high school,  and the students and teachers spoke wistfully of the American emphasis on clubs, arts and independent thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to encourage more creativity,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Hua Guohong, a chemistry teacher. \xe2\x80\x9cWe should learn from American schools.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'One friend in Guangdong Province says he will send his children to the United States to study because the local schools are a \xe2\x80\x9ccreativity-killer.\xe2\x80\x9d Another sent his son to an international school to escape what he likens to \xe2\x80\x9cprograms for trained seals.\xe2\x80\x9d Private schools are sprouting everywhere, and many boast of a focus on creativity.'b'For my part, I think the self-criticisms are exactly right, but I also deeply admire the passion for education and the commitment to making the system better. And while William Butler Yeats was right that \xe2\x80\x9ceducation is not filling a bucket but lighting a fire,\xe2\x80\x9d it\xe2\x80\x99s also true that it\xe2\x80\x99s easier to ignite a bonfire if there\xe2\x80\x99s fuel in the bucket.'b'The larger issue is that the greatest strength of the Chinese system is the Confucian reverence for education that is steeped into the culture. In Chinese schools, teachers are much respected, and the most admired kid is often the brain rather than the jock or class clown.'b'Americans think of China\xe2\x80\x99s strategic challenge in terms of, say, the new Chinese stealth fighter aircraft. But the real challenge is the rise of China\xe2\x80\x99s education system and the passion for learning that underlies it. We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to become Confucians, but we can elevate education on our list of priorities without relinquishing creativity and independent thought.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s what we did in 1957 after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik.

After 2014, it will be illegal for insurers to set annual limits on the amount they will pay for medical care or deny coverage to adults with pre-existing conditions.'b'Young people are now allowed to remain on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 policies until age 26. And insurers are now required to cover preventive care in new policies without cost-sharing, and to spend at least 80 percent of their premium income on medical care and quality improvements, not profits or administrative costs. Repeal would eliminate all of these new protections.'b'Repeal would also eliminate federal tax credits that are helping small businesses provide coverage to employees as well as a reinsurance program that is helping more than 4,700 employers, large and small, provide health coverage to early retirees.'b'Republicans are getting considerable traction with their claims that the reform law will drive up the price of insurance, and some are blaming the law for recent premium increases primarily caused by medical inflation. Once again, the official analysts and other experts disagree.'b'In fact, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that repeal would cause premiums for coverage obtained through large employers to rise by a bit in future years, while premiums at small employers, on average, would be little affected. Projected premiums for people who buy their own policies would come down somewhat with repeal, mostly because the policies would provide skimpier coverage than required under reform. Many people in this group would end up paying more out of their own pockets for health insurance, because they would not get the subsidies provided under the reform law.'b'Until now, the Republicans have dominated this debate with scare tactics and posturing. Democratic political leaders say they are finally ready to mount a vigorous campaign arguing the case for reform. They should be prepared for a long fight.'b'In December, the Obama administration signaled a welcome new resolve to block the torrent of illegal guns moving into Mexico and the hands of the drug cartels.'b'The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives announced it was seeking emergency authority to require 8,000 gun dealers near the border to report multiple purchases by any individual of high-firepower semiautomatic rifles that use a detachable magazine.'b'The bureau  asked the Office of Management and Budget, which must sign off on the plan, to do so by Jan. 5.

About three-quarters of those weapons originated from gun shops in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California, the four states covered by the A.T.F. plan.'b'Administration officials insist that approval will be coming soon, and we hope that is the case. But the delay is worrying. (Before the A.T.F. spoke up, the idea had languished at the Justice Department for months.)'b'The gun lobby and some vocal allies on Capitol Hill have denounced the proposal, claiming that this reasonable effort to track down gun traffickers threatens Americans\xe2\x80\x99 gun rights and exceeds the A.T.F.\xe2\x80\x99s mandate. The bureau\xe2\x80\x99s authority to demand information from a limited group of dealers shown to present elevated risks of crime has been upheld by courts in other cases.'b'The budget office needs to approve the A.T.F. initiative. And the White House needs to press Congress to provide the bureau with funding for more inspectors, as well as more authority to identify and shut down see-no-evil gun dealers. Not just at the border, but everywhere.'b''b'JIM ROBERTS'b', the assistant managing editor who has helped create today\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'NYTimes.com'b', likes to call it the 1440/7 news cycle \xe2\x80\x94 1,440 minutes every day, seven days a week, each one of those minutes demanding news for delivery to a networked world.'b'Unfortunately, during a few of those minutes on Jan. 8, The Times had the story wrong. In that brief window of time, NYTimes.com was reporting that Representative Gabrielle Giffords was dead of gunshot wounds. The error and some other aspects of the coverage of the Tucson shootings illustrate how difficult it is in the current environment to be both timely and authoritative.'b'The circumstances were these: A major breaking news event, occurring on a Saturday afternoon with a small staff on duty, with print deadlines to worry about and a Web site that needed to be fed as fast and as frequently as possible.'b'The Times\xe2\x80\x99s first online posting came at 1:47 p.m., followed by two quick updates \xe2\x80\x94 at 1:53 and 2:16. These stories, pieced together from other news organizations that were on the ground in Tucson, reported the shootings and other basic facts, attributing word of the shooting to the congresswoman\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman, C. J. Karamargin. At this point, her condition was described as \xe2\x80\x9cunclear.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At 2:27, though, the story was revised to say Ms. Giffords had been shot and killed, attributing the information to Mr. Karamargin and \xe2\x80\x9cnews reports.\xe2\x80\x9d Lower in the story, those news reports were identified as coming from NPR and CNN. As it turned out, the information was incorrect. The Times compounded the error by appearing to attribute it in part to Ms. Giffords\xe2\x80\x99s own spokesman, who was not the source of the error.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s how the error was made. It was hectic in the newsroom with many news reports flowing in as Kathleen McElroy, the day Web news editor, was trying to decide whether The Times was ready to report Giffords\xe2\x80\x99s death. She decided against it and was telling Web producers to hold off reporting it in a news alert when J. David Goodman, who was writing the story, told her he had a few changes he wanted to make.'b'Ms. McElroy said, \xe2\x80\x9cI should have looked at every change,\xe2\x80\x9d but she thought Mr. Goodman was referring to small stuff. Mr. Goodman told me he then erred by reporting Representative Giffords\xe2\x80\x99s death in the lead as though The Times itself were standing behind the information. In any event, Ms. McElroy had said O.K. without seeing that change, so Mr. Goodman pushed the button.'b'The result was a news story with changes that were not edited. Less than 10 minutes later, a new story appeared with the words \xe2\x80\x9cand killed\xe2\x80\x9d stricken.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNobody should self-publish,\xe2\x80\x9d said 'b'Philip B. Corbett'b', standards editor for The Times. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything should go through an editor. Ideally, it should go through two editors.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I agree with him, but that takes time. In the 1440/7 news cycle, and in the environment of the newsroom on Jan. 8, time seemed unavailable. On this particular day, things were happening quickly and simultaneously, and a mistake was made.'b''b'The Tucson shootings'b' afforded another, quite different illustration of the pressure of time in news coverage \xe2\x80\x94 not pressure measured in seconds and minutes, but pressure that news organizations feel to define the context of a story, to set up a frame for it, sometimes before the facts can be fully understood.'b'The Times\xe2\x80\x99s day-one coverage in some of its Sunday print editions included a strong focus on the political climate in Arizona and the nation. For some readers \xe2\x80\x94 and I share this view to an extent \xe2\x80\x94 placing the violence in the broader political context was problematic.'b'C. Wenk, a reader in Alexandria, Va., criticized \xe2\x80\x9can egregious rush to judgment in the Times coverage of the Arizona shooting, specifically aimed at linking the shooting to various conservative or Republican political rhetoric.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A second reader, Kevin O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell of Greenbrae, Calif., saw it as a case of The Times jumping too quickly: \xe2\x80\x9cI understand the larger point about coarse speech raising the potential for violence. By offering that debate within hours of events, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t The Times risk starting at the conclusion end of the argument?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Times had a lot of company, as news organizations, commentators and political figures shouldered into an unruly scrum battling over whether the political environment was to blame. Meanwhile, opportunities were missed to pick up on evidence \xe2\x80\x94 quite apparent as early as that first day \xe2\x80\x94 that 'b'Jared Lee Loughner'b', who is charged with the shootings, had a mental disorder and might not have been motivated by politics at all.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were a reporter on this story, my very first call would have been to a mental health professional willing to consider the nature of Mr. Loughner\xe2\x80\x99s illness,\xe2\x80\x9d Max Etchemendy of East Palo Alto, Calif., wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98political\xe2\x80\x99 angle has been beaten to death, and \xe2\x80\x98medical\xe2\x80\x99 angle has been ignored completely.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'So why does a story get framed this way? Journalism educators characterize this kind of framing as a storytelling habit \xe2\x80\x94 one of relating new facts to an existing storyline \xe2\x80\x94 and also as a reflex of news organizations that are built to handle some topics well, and others less well.'b''b'Jerry Ceppos'b', dean of 'b'the journalism school'b' at the University of Nevada, Reno, said journalists\xe2\x80\x99 impulse to quickly impose a frame on a story is \xe2\x80\x9cgenetic.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cJournalists developed automatic framing protocols generations ago because of the need to report quickly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x99s hyper-deadlines, requiring journalists to report all day long and all night long, made that genetic disposition even more dominant.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To be fair, there were some good reasons to steer the coverage initially in this direction. As 'b'Rick Berke'b', the national editor, said: \xe2\x80\x9cOur coverage early on was broad and touched everything from the possible shooter to the victims to the reaction to, yes, the political climate in Arizona. By our count, there were 49 stories in the paper the first six days after the tragedy, of which only 14 were political in nature. But it would be ridiculous for us to neglect that. After all, a politician was shot in the head while meeting with constituents. That same lawmaker had her office vandalized during an especially rancorous campaign. And after the shooting the sheriff called his state the capital of hatred and bigotry.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Still, I think the intense focus on political conflict \xe2\x80\x94 not just by The Times \xe2\x80\x94 detracted from what has emerged as the salient story line, that of a mentally ill individual with lawful access to a gun.'b'Whether covering the basic facts of a breaking story or identifying more complex themes, the takeaway is that time is often the enemy. Sometimes the best weapon against it is to ignore it, and use a moment to consider the alternatives.'b'OF the many truths in President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'powerful Tucson speech'b', none was more indisputable than his statement that no one can know what is in a killer\xe2\x80\x99s mind. So why have we spent so much time debating exactly that?'b'The answer is classic American denial. It was easier to endlessly parse Jared Lee Loughner\xe2\x80\x99s lunatic library  \xe2\x80\x94  did he favor \xe2\x80\x9cThe Communist Manifesto\xe2\x80\x9d or Ayn Rand?  \xe2\x80\x94  than confront the larger and harsher snapshot of our current landscape that emerged after his massacre. A week on, that denial is becoming even more entrenched. As soon as the president left the podium Wednesday night, we started shifting into our familiar spin-dry post-tragedy cycle of the modern era  \xe2\x80\x94  speedy \xe2\x80\x9cclosure,\xe2\x80\x9d followed by a return to business as usual, followed by national amnesia.'b'If we learn nothing from this tragedy, we are back where we started. And where we started was with two years of accelerating political violence  \xe2\x80\x94  actual violence, not to be confused with violent language  \xe2\x80\x94  that struck fear into many, not the least of whom was Gabrielle Giffords.'b'For the sake of this discussion, let\xe2\x80\x99s stipulate that Loughner was a \xe2\x80\x9clone nutjob\xe2\x80\x9d who had never listened to Glenn Beck or been a card-carrying member of either the Tea or Communist parties. Let\xe2\x80\x99s also face another tragedy: The only two civic reforms that might have actually stopped him  \xe2\x80\x94  tighter gun control and an effective mental health safety net  \xe2\x80\x94  won\xe2\x80\x99t materialize even now.'b'Gun and ammunition sales 'b'spiked last week'b', especially for the specific  varieties given the Loughner imprimatur. No editorial  \xe2\x80\x94  or bloodbath  \xe2\x80\x94  will move Congress 'b'to enact serious gun control'b' (which Giffords herself 'b'never advocated'b' and Obama has rarely pushed since 2008). Enhanced mental health coverage is also a nonstarter   when the highest G.O.P. priority is to repeal the federal expansion of health care. In Arizona, cutbacks are already so severe that terminally ill patients are 'b'being denied life-saving organ transplants'b'.'b'The other inescapable reality was articulated by Sarah Palin, believe it or not, 'b'in her \xe2\x80\x9cblood libel\xe2\x80\x9d video'b'. Speaking of acrimonious partisan debate, she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen was it less heated  \xe2\x80\x94  back in those calm days when political figures literally settled their differences with dueling pistols?\xe2\x80\x9d She\xe2\x80\x99s right. Calls for civility will have no more lasting impact on the \xe2\x80\x9ctone\xe2\x80\x9d of American discourse now than they did after the J.F.K. assassination or Oklahoma City. Especially not in an era when technology allows all 300 million Americans a cost-free megaphone for unmediated rants.'b'Did Loughner see Palin\xe2\x80\x99s own most notorious contribution to the rancorous tone  \xe2\x80\x94  'b'her March 2010 Web graphic'b' targeting Congressional districts? We have no idea  \xe2\x80\x94  nor does it matter. But Giffords did. Her reaction to it  \xe2\x80\x94  captured in 'b'an interview she did back then with Chuck Todd of MSNBC'b'  \xe2\x80\x94  was the most recycled, if least understood, video of last week.'b'The  week of that interview began  with 'b'the House passing the health care bill'b' on Sunday. Within hours, on  Monday morning, vandals 'b'smashed the front door'b' of Giffords\xe2\x80\x99s office in Tucson. The Palin \xe2\x80\x9ctarget\xe2\x80\x9d map (and the accompanying 'b'Twitter dictum to \xe2\x80\x9cRELOAD\xe2\x80\x9d'b') went up on Tuesday, just one day after that vandalism  \xe2\x80\x94  timing that was at best tone-deaf and at worst nastily provocative. Not just Giffords, but 'b'at least'b' 'b'three'b' 'b'other'b' of the 20 members of Congress on the Palin map were  also hit with vandalism or death threats.'b'In her MSNBC interview that  Wednesday, Giffords said  that Palin had put the \xe2\x80\x9ccrosshairs of a gun sight over our district,\xe2\x80\x9d adding that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen people do that, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got to realize there\xe2\x80\x99s consequences to that action.\xe2\x80\x9d Chuck Todd then asked Giffords if \xe2\x80\x9cin fairness, campaign rhetoric and war rhetoric have been interchangeable for years.\xe2\x80\x9d She responded that colleagues who had been in the House \xe2\x80\x9c20, 30 years\xe2\x80\x9d had never seen vitriol this bad. But Todd moved on, and so did the Beltway. What\xe2\x80\x99s the big deal about a little broken glass? Few wanted to see what Giffords saw \xe2\x80\x94 that the vandalism and death threats were  the latest consequences of a tide of ugly insurrectionism that had been rising since the final weeks of the 2008 campaign and that had threatened to turn violent from the start.'b'Giffords\xe2\x80\x99s first brush with that reality had occurred some seven months before her office was vandalized  \xe2\x80\x94  in the red-hot health care fever of August 2009. She had held another \xe2\x80\x9cCongress on Your Corner\xe2\x80\x9d meeting, at a Safeway in the town of Douglas. There the crowd\xe2\x80\x99s rage and 'b'the dropping of a gun by one attendee'b' prompted  aides worried about her safety to summon the police.  The Tucson Tea Party co-founder, Trent Humphries, told The Arizona Daily Star afterward that this was a lie,  that \xe2\x80\x9cnobody was threatening Gabby.\xe2\x80\x9d After Loughner\xe2\x80\x99s massacre, Humphries was 'b'still faulting her'b'  \xe2\x80\x94  this time for holding \xe2\x80\x9can event in full view of the public with no security whatsoever.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Others on the right spent last week loudly protesting the politicization of tragedy. What was most revealing was how often they tried to rewrite the history of previous incidents having nothing to do with Loughner. 'b'A Palin aide claimed'b' that her target map was only invoking a \xe2\x80\x9csurveyor\xe2\x80\x99s symbol,\xe2\x80\x9d not gun sights. A Tucson Tea Party leader announced that the attack on Giffords\xe2\x80\x99s office (never solved by the police) was 'b'probably caused by skateboarding kids'b'. Mike Pence, a potential G.O.P. \xe2\x80\x9cvalues\xe2\x80\x9d candidate for president, 'b'told the C-Span audience'b' that those bearing firearms at Congressional town hall meetings and Obama events (including 'b'one in Arizona that August of 2009'b') were no different from anti-Bush demonstrators \xe2\x80\x9cwaving placards.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For macabre absurdity, it would seem hard to top Newt Gingrich, who 'b'wailed'b' about leftists linking Loughner to the right 'b'as if he had not famously blamed'b' a psychotic double-murder of 1994, Susan Smith\xe2\x80\x99s drowning of her two sons in South Carolina, on \xe2\x80\x9cLyndon Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s Great Society.\xe2\x80\x9d But Representative Trent Franks, Republican of Arizona, did top Newt. On \xe2\x80\x9cMeet the Press\xe2\x80\x9d last Sunday 'b'he implored us'b' to \xe2\x80\x9ctreat each other as fellow children of God\xe2\x80\x9d without acknowledging (or being questioned about) 'b'his 2009 diatribe'b' branding Obama as \xe2\x80\x9can enemy of humanity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As the president said in Tucson, we lack not just civil discourse, but honest discourse. Much of last week\xe2\x80\x99s televised bloviation was dishonest, dedicated to the pious, feel-good sentiment that both sides are equally culpable for the rage of the past two years. To construct this false equivalency, every left-leaning Web site and Democratic politician\xe2\x80\x99s record was dutifully culled for incendiary invective. If that\xe2\x80\x99s the standard, then both sides are equally at fault  \xe2\x80\x94  rhetoric can indeed be as violent on the left as on the right.'b'But that sidesteps the issue. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t about angry blog posts or verbal fisticuffs. Since Obama\xe2\x80\x99s ascension, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen  'b'repeated incidents of political violence'b'. Just a short list would include 'b'the 2009 killing of three Pittsburgh police officers'b' by a neo-Nazi Obama-hater; last year\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'murder-suicide kamikaze attack'b' on an I.R.S. office in Austin, Tex.; and t'b'he California police shootout'b' with an assailant plotting to attack  'b'an obscure liberal foundation obsessively vilified by Beck'b'.'b'Obama said, correctly, on Wednesday that 'b'\xe2\x80\x9ca simple lack of civility\xe2\x80\x9d'b' didn\xe2\x80\x99t cause the Tucson tragedy. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t cause these other incidents either. What did inform the earlier violence  \xe2\x80\x94  including the vandalism at Giffords\xe2\x80\x99s office  \xe2\x80\x94  was 'b'an antigovernment radicalism as rabid on the right now'b' as it was on the left in the late 1960s. That Loughner was likely insane, with no coherent ideological agenda, does not mean that a climate of antigovernment hysteria has no effect on him or other crazed loners out there. Nor does Loughner\xe2\x80\x99s insanity mitigate the surge in unhinged political zealots acting out over the last two years. That\xe2\x80\x99s why so many  \xe2\x80\x94 on both the finger-pointing left and the hyper-defensive right  \xe2\x80\x94  automatically assumed he must be another of them.'b'Have politicians stoked the pre-Loughner violence by advocating that citizens pursue 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSecond Amendment remedies\xe2\x80\x9d'b' or be 'b'\xe2\x80\x9carmed and dangerous\xe2\x80\x9d'b'? We don\xe2\x80\x99t know. What\xe2\x80\x99s more disturbing is what Republican and conservative leaders have 'b'not'b' said. Their continuing silence during two years of simmering violence has been chilling.'b'A few unexpected voices have expressed alarm. After 'b'an antigovernment gunman struck'b' at Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Holocaust museum in June 2009, 'b'Shepard Smith of Fox News noted'b' the rising vitriol in his e-mail traffic and warned on air that more \xe2\x80\x9camped up\xe2\x80\x9d Americans could be \xe2\x80\x9cgetting the gun out.\xe2\x80\x9d The former Bush administration speechwriter 'b'David Frum took on the \xe2\x80\x9creckless right\xe2\x80\x9d that August'b', citing the   incident at the Giffords Safeway event. But when 'b'a Department of Homeland Security report'b' warned of far-right extremism and   attacks by \xe2\x80\x9clone wolves\xe2\x80\x9d that same summer, Gingrich 'b'called it a smear'b' and John Boehner 'b'demanded an apology'b'.'b'Last week a conservative presidential candidate, Tim Pawlenty, 'b'timidly said'b' it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be his \xe2\x80\x9cstyle\xe2\x80\x9d to use Palin\xe2\x80\x99s target map, but was savaged so viciously by his own camp that he immediately retreated. A senior Republican senator 'b'told Politico'b' that he saw the Tucson bloodbath as a \xe2\x80\x9ccautionary tale\xe2\x80\x9d for his party, yet refused to be named.'b'What are they and their peers so afraid of? No doubt that someone might reload  \xe2\x80\x94  the same fears that prompted Gabrielle Giffords to speak up, calmly but firmly, last March. Unless and until they can match her courage and speak out too, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to see what will change.'b'The house is laden with icicles. Looking out my office window, I feel as though I\xe2\x80\x99m living in the maw of some fabulous fanged beast readying to devour the rest of the day.'b'This is the day that is unimaginable in July \xe2\x80\x94 14 degrees and more than two feet of snow on the ground, a female cardinal resting among the magnolia buds, her feet tucked into her under-down. The horses think nothing of the weather, though I have trouble persuading myself of that. Yesterday, they ran bucking and kicking into a level patch of sunshine, and when Remedy lay down for a rest \xe2\x80\x94 flat-out \xe2\x80\x94 he almost disappeared beneath the snow-line. Ida curls up in the snow as cat-like as a horse can be. Nell looks like a four-legged Yeti.'b'I wade knee-deep to the chicken house. I shovel. I plow. I make great heaps of snow with the tractor, the kind I used to tunnel through as a kid. I have the illusion of shaping my environment, putting a sharp edge on the cut-bank path. I defy the elements, and they defy me, and when we\xe2\x80\x99re done, I crawl inside a sleeping bag to get the heat back in my body.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m in no rush for things to change. Partly it\xe2\x80\x99s the clarity, the way the most muted colors become more intense against the snow. It\xe2\x80\x99s also the glacial blue when light pierces the snow in the tractor-bucket raised against the sky, the berg-ish way the snow breaks off as I shovel, the avalanche that falls when I rake the roof.'b'I like the endurance this weather demands. There\xe2\x80\x99s a puritanical pleasure in carrying 50-pound bags of layer mash on my collarbone through two feet of snow, huffing and puffing. I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to like seeing the light from the chicken house almost obliterated by blowing snow at dusk. I wait for the moment when a chill settles all the way through my bones, and then I know I\xe2\x80\x99ve earned the woodstove and the sleeping bag and the next book on my pile.'b''b''b'Vows by Congressional Republicans to slash billions from the federal budget at a time when joblessness is high and the economy needs stimulus are reckless. But here is one big-ticket saving that all members of Congress should get behind: cutting the billions of dollars in farm subsidies that distort food prices, encourage overfarming and inflate the price of land.'b'The government spends $10 billion to $30 billion a year subsidizing mainly large-scale farmers. That includes: $5 billion in direct payments that are delivered regardless of what or even whether farmers plant; up to $7 billion in \xe2\x80\x9cmarketing loans\xe2\x80\x9d that effectively set a floor on crop prices; up to $4 billion to protect farmers in bad years; about $4 billion in subsidies to buy crop insurance \xe2\x80\x94 which lead to higher premiums; and more.'b'In 2008 the government committed to buy up cheap imported sugar, which could depress the price of home grown,  and sell it to ethanol producers, even at a loss.'b'This should be an easy one. But the farm lobby is not worried. Last week, the Farm Bureau Federation voted to insist that the 2012 farm bill \xe2\x80\x9cmaintain a strong \xe2\x80\x98safety net\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for farmers \xe2\x80\x94 including direct payments, insurance subsidies and the countercyclical and marketing loan programs. It said all the special pleadings should, of course, fit \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the budget framework.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'One reason the farm lobby is so confident is that it has so many good friends in Congress \xe2\x80\x94 Republicans and Democrats. The new chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Frank Lucas, of Oklahoma, has already won the Friend of the Farm Bureau award six times. Mr.  Lucas has long touted his support for ethanol subsidies, which have inflated the price of corn. Last year, he said the Obama administration was \xe2\x80\x9cout of touch with agriculture\xe2\x80\x9d for proposing sensible savings, including limiting direct payments to farmers who made over $500,000 in annual sales. More pandering to the farm lobby is out of touch with the country\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal reality and with what is good for American consumers.'b'To the Editor:'b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'If Scalia Had His Way'b',\xe2\x80\x9d by Jeffrey Rosen (Week in Review, Jan. 9), about constitutional originalism, illuminates many of the difficulties inherent in the doctrine, but he does not mention a powerful objection to its fundamental principle.'b'If one had asked the founders, \xe2\x80\x9cShould a judge 200 years hence determine the meaning of a constitutional provision by relying upon opinions of men two centuries dead \xe2\x80\x94 not because those opinions are reasonable or wise, but only because they have become traditional?,\xe2\x80\x9d I think the founders\xe2\x80\x99 reply would be obvious.'b'To surrender one\xe2\x80\x99s independent judgment to traditional authority is to ignore the essence of the Enlightenment, which demands of us that we think for ourselves.'b'Douglas O\xe2\x80\x99Keefe'b' San Francisco, Jan. 10, 2011'b''b'\xe2\x80\xa2'b'To the Editor:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cConstitutional originalism is all the rage these days,\xe2\x80\x9d  Jeffrey Rosen wrote, but the \xe2\x80\x9crage\xe2\x80\x9d is about posture, not originalism.

A slight, goateed man with black, half-framed glasses, the 35-year-old Lumumba was the first democratically chosen leader of the vast country, nearly as large as the United States east of the Mississippi, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo.'b'This treasure house of natural resources had been a colony of Belgium, which for decades had made no plans for independence. But after clashes with Congolese nationalists, the Belgians hastily arranged the first national election in 1960, and in June of that year King Baudouin arrived to formally give the territory its freedom.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is now up to you, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d he arrogantly told Congolese dignitaries, \xe2\x80\x9cto show that you are worthy of our confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Belgians, and their European and American fellow investors, expected to continue collecting profits from Congo\xe2\x80\x99s factories, plantations and lucrative mines, which produced diamonds, gold, uranium, copper and more. But they had not planned on Lumumba.'b'A dramatic, angry speech he gave in reply to Baudouin 'b'brought Congolese legislators to their feet cheering,'b' left the king startled and frowning and caught the world\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Lumumba spoke forcefully of the violence and humiliations of colonialism, from the ruthless theft of African land to the way that French-speaking colonists talked to Africans as adults do to children, using the familiar \xe2\x80\x9ctu\xe2\x80\x9d instead of the formal \xe2\x80\x9cvous.\xe2\x80\x9d Political independence was not enough, he said; Africans had to also benefit from the great wealth in their soil.'b'With no experience of self-rule and an empty treasury, his huge country was soon in turmoil. After failing to get aid from the United States, Lumumba declared he would turn to the Soviet Union. Thousands of Belgian officials who lingered on did their best to sabotage things: their code word for Lumumba in military radio transmissions was \xe2\x80\x9cSatan.\xe2\x80\x9d  Shortly after he took office as prime minister, the C.I.A., with White House approval, ordered his assassination and dispatched an undercover agent with poison.'b'The would-be poisoners could not get close enough to Lumumba to do the job, so instead the United States and Belgium covertly funneled cash and aid to rival politicians who seized power and arrested the prime minister. Fearful of revolt by Lumumba\xe2\x80\x99s supporters if he died in their hands, the new Congolese leaders ordered him flown to the copper-rich Katanga region in the country\xe2\x80\x99s south, whose secession Belgium had just helped orchestrate. There, on Jan. 17, 1961, after being beaten and tortured, he was shot. It was a chilling moment that set off street demonstrations in many countries.'b'As a college student traveling through Africa on summer break, I was in L\xc3\xa9opoldville (today\xe2\x80\x99s Kinshasa), Congo\xe2\x80\x99s capital, for a few days some six months after Lumumba\xe2\x80\x99s murder. There was an air of tension and gloom in the city, jeeps full of soldiers were on patrol, and the streets quickly emptied at night. Above all, I remember the triumphant, macho satisfaction with which two young American Embassy officials \xe2\x80\x94 much later identified as C.I.A. men \xe2\x80\x94 talked with me over drinks about the death of someone they regarded not as an elected leader but as an upstart enemy of the United States.'b'Some weeks before his death, Lumumba had briefly escaped from house arrest and, with a small group of supporters,  tried to flee to the eastern Congo, where a counter-government of his sympathizers had formed. The travelers had to traverse the Sankuru River, after which friendly territory began. Lumumba and several companions crossed the river in a dugout canoe to commandeer a ferry to go back and fetch the rest of the group, including his wife and son.'b'But by the time they returned to the other bank, government troops pursuing them had arrived. According to one survivor, Lumumba\xe2\x80\x99s famous eloquence almost persuaded the soldiers to let them go. Events like this are often burnished in retrospect, but however the encounter happened, Lumumba seems to have risked his life to try to rescue the others, and the episode has found its way into film and fiction.'b'His legend has only become deeper because there is painful newsreel footage of him in captivity, soon after this moment, bound tightly with rope and trying to retain his dignity while being roughed up by his guards.'b'Patrice Lumumba had only a few short months in office and we have no way of knowing what would have happened had he lived. Would he have stuck to his ideals or, like too many African independence leaders, abandoned them for the temptations of wealth and power? In any event, leading his nation to the full economic autonomy  he dreamed of would have been an almost impossible task. The Western governments and corporations arrayed against him were too powerful, and the resources in his control too weak: at independence his new country had fewer than three dozen university graduates among a black population of more than 15 million, and only three of some 5,000 senior positions in the civil service were filled by Congolese.'b'A half-century later, we should surely  look back on the death of Lumumba  with shame, for we helped install the men who deposed and killed him. In the scholarly journal Intelligence and National Security, Stephen R. Weissman, a former staff director of the House Subcommittee on Africa, 'b'recently pointed out'b' that Lumumba\xe2\x80\x99s violent end foreshadowed today\xe2\x80\x99s American practice of \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary rendition.\xe2\x80\x9d The Congolese politicians who planned Lumumba\xe2\x80\x99s murder checked all their major moves with their Belgian and American backers, and the local C.I.A. station chief made no objection when they told him they were going to turn Lumumba over \xe2\x80\x94 render him, in today\xe2\x80\x99s parlance \xe2\x80\x94 to the breakaway government of Katanga, which, everyone knew, could be counted on to kill him.'b'Still more fateful was what was to come. Four years later, one of Lumumba\xe2\x80\x99s captors, an army officer named Joseph Mobutu, again with enthusiastic American support, staged a coup and began a disastrous, 32-year dictatorship. Just as geopolitics and a thirst for oil have today brought us unsavory allies like Saudi Arabia, so the cold war and a similar lust for natural resources did then. Mobutu was showered with more than $1 billion in American aid  and enthusiastically welcomed to the White House by a succession of presidents; George H. W. Bush called him \xe2\x80\x9cone of our most valued friends.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This valued friend bled his country dry, amassed a fortune estimated at $4 billion, jetted the world by rented Concorde and bought himself an array of grand villas in Europe and multiple palaces and a yacht at home. He let public services shrivel to nothing and roads and railways be swallowed by the rain forest. By 1997, when he was overthrown and died, his country was in a state of wreckage from which it has not yet recovered.'b'Since that time the fatal combination of enormous natural riches and the dysfunctional government Mobutu left has ignited a long, multisided war that has killed huge numbers of Congolese or forced them from their homes. Many factors cause a war, of course, especially one as bewilderingly complex as this one. But when visiting eastern Congo some months ago, I could not help but think that one thread leading to the human suffering I saw begins with the assassination of Lumumba.'b'We will never know the full death toll of the current conflict, but many believe it to be in the millions. Some of that blood is on our hands. Both ordering the murders of apparent enemies and then embracing their enemies as \xe2\x80\x9cvalued friends\xe2\x80\x9d come with profound, long-term consequences \xe2\x80\x94 a lesson worth pondering on this anniversary.'b'To the Editor:'b'Trevor Packer of the College Board sees no immediate need to revise the Advanced Placement mathematics programs (\xe2\x80\x9c'b'Rethinking A.P.'b',\xe2\x80\x9d Education Life, Jan. 9).

But John Boehner, the speaker of the House, says that no matter how cheap the meal may seem, it will cost thousands of dollars once you take our monthly mortgage payments into account.'b'Wait a minute, you may say. How can our mortgage payments be a cost of going out to eat, when we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to make the same payments even if we stay home? But Mr. Boehner is adamant: our mortgage is part of the cost of our meal, and to say otherwise is just a budget gimmick.'b'O.K., the speaker hasn\xe2\x80\x99t actually weighed in on our plans for the evening. But he and his G.O.P. colleagues have lately been making exactly the nonsensical argument I\xe2\x80\x99ve just described \xe2\x80\x94 not about tonight\xe2\x80\x99s dinner, but about health care reform. And the nonsense wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a slip of the tongue; it\xe2\x80\x99s the official party position, laid out in charts and figures.'b'We are, I believe, witnessing something new in American politics. Last year, looking at claims that we can cut taxes, avoid cuts to any popular program and still balance the budget, I observed that Republicans seemed to have lost interest in the war on terror and shifted focus to the war on arithmetic. But now the G.O.P. has moved on to an even bigger project: the war on logic.'b'So, about that nonsense: this week the House is expected to pass H.R. 2, the 'b'Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act'b'   \xe2\x80\x94 its actual name.  But Republicans have a small problem: they claim to care about budget deficits, yet the Congressional Budget Office says that repealing last year\xe2\x80\x99s health reform would increase the deficit. So what, other than dismissing the nonpartisan budget office\xe2\x80\x99s verdict as \xe2\x80\x9ctheir opinion\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x94  as Mr. Boehner has  \xe2\x80\x94  can the G.O.P. do?'b'The answer is contained in an 'b'analysis'b'  \xe2\x80\x94 or maybe that should be \xe2\x80\x9canalysis\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x94 released by the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s office, which purports to show that health care reform actually increases the deficit. Why? That\xe2\x80\x99s where the war on logic comes in.'b'First of all, says the analysis, the true cost of reform includes the cost of the \xe2\x80\x9cdoc fix.\xe2\x80\x9d What\xe2\x80\x99s that?'b'Well, in 1997 Congress enacted a formula to determine Medicare payments to physicians. The formula was, however, flawed; it would lead to payments so low that doctors would stop accepting Medicare patients. Instead of changing the formula, however, Congress has consistently enacted one-year fixes. And Republicans claim that the estimated cost of future fixes, $208 billion over the next 10 years, should be considered a cost of health care reform.'b'But the same spending would still be necessary if we were to undo reform. So the G.O.P. argument here is exactly like claiming that my mortgage payments, which I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to make no matter what we do tonight, are a cost of going out for dinner.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s more like that: the G.O.P. also claims that $115 billion of other health care spending should be charged to health reform, even though the budget office has tried to explain that most of this spending would have taken place even without reform.'b'To be sure, the Republican analysis doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rely entirely on spurious attributions of cost  \xe2\x80\x94 it also relies on using three-card monte tricks to make money disappear. Health reform, says the budget office, will increase Social Security revenues and reduce Medicare costs. But the G.O.P. analysis says that these sums don\xe2\x80\x99t count, because some people have said that these savings would also extend the life of these programs\xe2\x80\x99 trust funds, so counting these savings as deficit reduction would be \xe2\x80\x9cdouble-counting,\xe2\x80\x9d because  \xe2\x80\x94  well, actually it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any sense, but it sounds impressive.'b'So, is the Republican leadership unable to see through childish logical fallacies? No.'b'The key to understanding the G.O.P. analysis of health reform is that the party\xe2\x80\x99s leaders are not, in fact, opposed to reform because they believe it will increase the deficit. Nor are they opposed because they seriously believe that it will be \xe2\x80\x9cjob-killing\xe2\x80\x9d (which it won\xe2\x80\x99t be). They\xe2\x80\x99re against reform because it would cover the uninsured  \xe2\x80\x94 and that\xe2\x80\x99s something they just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do.'b'And it\xe2\x80\x99s not about the money. As I tried to explain in my last column, the modern G.O.P. has been taken over by an ideology in which the suffering of the unfortunate isn\xe2\x80\x99t a proper concern of government, and alleviating that suffering at taxpayer expense is immoral, never mind how little it costs.'b'Given that their minds were made up from the beginning, top Republicans weren\xe2\x80\x99t interested in and didn\xe2\x80\x99t need any real policy analysis  \xe2\x80\x94  in fact, they\xe2\x80\x99re basically contemptuous of such analysis, something that shines through in their health care report. All they ever needed or wanted were some numbers and charts to wave at the press, fooling some people into believing that we\xe2\x80\x99re having some kind of rational discussion. We aren\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'In every twisted, wretched, ruinous relationship, there are moments so grim, flare-ups so appalling, that they offer both parties a chance to step back, take inventory, and realize that it\xe2\x80\x99s time  \xe2\x80\x94  far past time, in fact  \xe2\x80\x94  to go their separate ways.'b'For the American media and Sarah Palin, that kind of a  moment arrived last week.'b'It began just hours after the tragedy in Tucson, with a tweet from Markos \xe2\x80\x9cDaily Kos\xe2\x80\x9d Moulitsas, the \xc3\xa9minence grise of the liberal blogosphere. \xe2\x80\x9cMission Accomplished, Sarah Palin,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, linking to a map that Palin\xe2\x80\x99s PAC had put up last fall, placing targets on various Democratic districts, Gabrielle Giffords\xe2\x80\x99s included. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t take long for the media to seize on his  attack and run with it. Forget a nation\xe2\x80\x99s grief and Giffords\xe2\x80\x99s struggle to survive: What America 'b'really'b' needed, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s pundits and TV producers decided, was a noisy debate about the possible link between Jared Lee Loughner\xe2\x80\x99s crime and Palin\xe2\x80\x99s martial campaign rhetoric.'b'Given how little connection Loughner seems to have to any kind of right-wing politics, this conversation looked increasingly ridiculous by midweek, and even a little bit obscene. But instead of letting the frenzy die away, Palin decided that what the country really needed was for her to use the day set aside for mourning Loughner\xe2\x80\x99s victims to make a speech complaining about her own victimization. (Or as she put it, rather more pungently, the \xe2\x80\x9cblood libel\xe2\x80\x9d being leveled by her critics.) Which, needless to say, gave the press exactly the excuse it needed to continue its wall-to-wall Palin coverage for another 48 hours  \xe2\x80\x94  and beyond, perhaps, given that she\xe2\x80\x99s slated to appear on Sean Hannity\xe2\x80\x99s show Monday night.'b'The whole business felt less like an episode in American political history than a scene from a particularly toxic marriage \xe2\x80\x94  more \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\xe2\x80\x9d than \xe2\x80\x9cThe Making of the President.\xe2\x80\x9d The press and Palin have been at war with each other almost from the first, but their mutual antipathy looks increasingly like co-dependency: they can\xe2\x80\x99t get along, but they can\xe2\x80\x99t live without each other either.'b'For their  part, the media manage to be consistently unfair to the former Alaska governor  \xe2\x80\x94  gossipy and hostile in their reportage, hysterical and condescending in their commentary  \xe2\x80\x94  even as they follow her every move with a fascination bordering on obsession. (MSNBC, in particular, should just change its name to \xe2\x80\x9cPalin 24/7\xe2\x80\x9d and get it over with.) When commentators aren\xe2\x80\x99t denouncing her, they\xe2\x80\x99re busy building up her legend  \xe2\x80\x94  exaggerating her political acumen, overpraising her communications strategy, covering her every tweet as if she were the Viceroy of Red America, and spinning out outlandish scenarios in which she captures the White House in 2012.'b'Palin, meanwhile, officially despises the \xe2\x80\x9clamestream\xe2\x80\x9d media. But press coverage \xe2\x80\x94  good, bad, whatever  \xe2\x80\x94  is clearly the oxygen she craves. She supposedly hates having her privacy invaded, yet her family keeps showing up on reality TV. She thinks the political class is clueless and out-of-touch, but she can\xe2\x80\x99t resist responding to its every provocation. Her public rhetoric, from \xe2\x80\x9cdeath panels\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cblood libel,\xe2\x80\x9d is obviously crafted to maximize coverage and controversy, and generate more heat than light. And her Twitter account reads like a constant plea for the most superficial sort of media attention.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a grim spectacle on both sides, and last week\xe2\x80\x99s pointless controversy was a particularly low point. So let me play the relationship counselor. To the media: Cover Sarah Palin if you want, but stop acting as if she\xe2\x80\x99s the most important conservative politician in America. Stop pretending that she has a plausible path to the presidency in 2012. (She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.) Stop suggesting that she\xe2\x80\x99s the front-runner for the Republican nomination. (She isn\xe2\x80\x99t.) And every time you\xe2\x80\x99re tempted to parse her tweets for some secret code or crucial dog whistle, stop and think, 'b'this woman has fewer Twitter followers than Ben Stiller'b', and then go write about something else instead.'b'To Palin: You were an actual politician once (remember that?), but you\xe2\x80\x99re becoming the kind of caricature that your enemies have always tried to make of you. So maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s time to turn off your iPad for a while, and take a break from Facebook and Fox News. The world won\xe2\x80\x99t end if you don\xe2\x80\x99t respond to every criticism, and you might even win a few more admirers if you cultivated a lighter touch and a more above-the-fray persona. Oh, and when that reality-TV producer sends you a pitch for  \xe2\x80\x9cSarah Plus Five Plus  Kate Plus Eight,\xe2\x80\x9d  'b'just say no'b'.'b'Breaking up is hard to do, of course. But for the majority of Americans who are neither Palinoiacs nor Palinistas, here\xe2\x80\x99s the good news: If the press (including this columnist!)  and Sarah Palin can\xe2\x80\x99t quit each other, you can still quit us.'b'For years, Illinois, like so many states, pretended that it had not fallen off a budgetary cliff. It was spending too much and taking in too little revenue, but every year it would kick its problems into the next. Unable to pay its bills, it finally accepted reality last week and raised taxes on incomes and businesses \xe2\x80\x94 a first step toward getting its house in order.'b'The action was immediately ridiculed by several governors around the nation who are still pretending that they can cut their way out of the enormous shortfalls they face, without raising taxes. Wisconsin and Indiana predicted a windfall of angry corporations and residents would head their way from Illinois. Even Gov. Chris Christie, the New Jersey Republican, vowed to fly to Illinois to invite businesses there to defect to his state.'b'That makes great political theater. But businesses and voters in Illinois, and around the country, should take a closer look at the facts and figures, including their own.'b'After 22 years of not raising income taxes, Illinois saw its budget shortfall  grow to $15 billion. It had the lowest state credit rating in the nation, and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t paying its bills to hospitals and schools.'b'The Illinois tax rate was low before and remains low for big states. The income tax will rise from a flat 3 percent to a flat 5 percent. That will cause pain at the lower and middle levels of the economic scale, but the state\xe2\x80\x99s millionaires will probably stay put. (The top rate is 10.55 percent in California, 8.97 percent in New Jersey and New York, and 7.75 percent in Wisconsin.)'b'Illinois\xe2\x80\x99s corporate tax is going up to 9.5 percent from 7.3 percent, but that by itself is unlikely to send businesses packing. What businesses crave most is a stable environment in which to make profits, and Illinois was anything but stable. Businesses tend not to like it when health and education systems break down.'b'By taking this step, which will raise about $6.5 billion, the Illinois Legislature has begun to show residents and corporate leaders that it is serious about fixing the budget. It still has a lot more to do. It must brave union opposition and bring down the cost of excessive health and retirement benefits for state employees, and examine all state salaries to make sure they are in line with the private sector. It must adhere to a new system to rebuild the budget each year, based on available revenues.'b'Almost every state is in deep fiscal trouble this year, but only a few others have admitted that cutting spending will not be enough.'b'Gov. Jerry Brown of California has proposed $12.5 billion in painful cuts that will hit the poor and higher education particularly hard. He is also rightly warning voters that the pain will be much worse if they do not extend sales and income tax increases for five more years. Oregon raised income taxes at the high end last year, and Kansas and Arizona raised sales taxes.'b'In too many states, though \xe2\x80\x94 including New York, New Jersey, Maryland and Washington \xe2\x80\x94 voters or governors have rejected higher taxes on high incomes, even though those at the top have experienced a windfall at the federal level.'b'Governor Christie, who calls his state \xe2\x80\x9cbroke\xe2\x80\x9d and faces an upcoming deficit that may be more than $10 billion, has even rejected raising New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s gasoline tax, one of the 'b'lowest in the nation'b'.'b'With federal stimulus aid ending, states are in for their worst year in generations, and they cannot get out of it by either cutting or taxing alone. Illinois is figuring that out, finally. Too many other states are still in denial.'b'Last week\xe2\x80\x99s memorial service in Tucson, which began with a blessing by a professor of Yaqui Indian and Mexican heritage, showcased Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s rich diversity as well as the love and tolerance of many of its citizens.'b'Unfortunately there is another Arizona, one where its state government all too often promotes discord and intolerance. This  was painfully clear in the state\xe2\x80\x99s immigration law, which empowers the police to demand the papers of suspected illegal immigrants. And it is painfully clear in a new education law that injects nativist fears directly into the public school classroom.'b'The law, which took effect Dec. 31, bans any courses or classes that \xe2\x80\x9cpromote resentment toward a race or class of people\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cadvocate ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s new attorney general, Tom Horne, immediately used it to declare illegal a Mexican-American ethnic-studies program in the Tucson Unified School District.'b'Mr. Horne, who wrote the law when he was superintendent of public instruction, accused the program of \xe2\x80\x9cbrainwashing\xe2\x80\x9d Latino students, of teaching \xe2\x80\x9cethnic chauvinism\xe2\x80\x9d because it uses works by authors critical of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 historical relationship with Latin America and its past treatment of Latinos. He has not gone after similar programs for black, Asian or American Indian students.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to object to the portions of the law that discourage the overthrow of the government. But Mr. Horne goes way overboard in trying keep high school students from studying works like Paulo Freire\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPedagogy of the Oppressed,\xe2\x80\x9d a classic educational text, or any effort to deepen students\xe2\x80\x99 understanding of history, and their place in the world. Tucson school officials say that far from stoking teenage resentment, the program has helped students keep their grades up and stay in school.'b'The school district has been put in a bind: shut the program down or lose state financing. Eleven teachers have sued to block the law. The school board, regrettably, did not join the lawsuit.'b'Educators and parents across the state should resist this effort to clamp down on education. Justice demands it. And even this ill-considered law suggests that Mr. Horne has badly overreached. One passage reads: \xe2\x80\x9cNothing in this section shall be construed to restrict or prohibit the instruction of the Holocaust, any other instance of genocide, or the historical oppression of a particular group of people based on ethnicity, race or class.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Arizona was rightly criticized in the 1980s and early 90\xe2\x80\x99s when it refused to join the nation in declaring Martin Luther King\xe2\x80\x99s Birthday a holiday. It finally agreed in 1992, and the whole country has since traveled closer toward racial harmony. Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders shame themselves and their citizens when they preach and promote the opposite.'b'During his 30 years in prison, Cornelius Dupree Jr. twice rejected his chance for freedom because an admission of guilt for rape and robbery was the price of parole. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever your truth is, you have to stick with it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Dupree explained this month after a Texas judge exonerated him of the 1979 crime on the basis of DNA evidence kept in long-term county storage.'b'Mr. Dupree\xe2\x80\x99s freedom highlighted the fact that Dallas County, unlike so many other jurisdictions, bothered to retain DNA samples across decades. No less a factor is an exemplary change in the attitude of the district attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office. For the last four years, under the leadership of District Attorney Craig Watkins, it has cooperated in the DNA exoneration of 21 wrongly convicted citizens who lost decades of their freedom.'b'All but one were convicted on the basis of incorrect eyewitness testimony. Faulty IDs account for three  of four of the 265 convictions overturned nationally by DNA evidence, according to Barry Scheck of the Innocence Project, the advocacy group helping Mr. Dupree.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been proven that the system needs to be fixed,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Watkins declared. The former defense attorney is urging the Texas Legislature to combat a \xe2\x80\x9cconvict at all costs\xe2\x80\x9d mentality by enacting a precise protocol to curb the kind of zealous identification shortcuts taken against Mr. Dupree. State lawmakers are reported to be open to the idea. The Legislature faced up to the increase in DNA exonerations two years ago when it enacted the nation\xe2\x80\x99s most generous compensation law, providing $80,000 for each year of freedom unjustly lost.'b'Texas, with its crowded death row, has hardly been the model of criminal justice. But the lessons of the Dupree case cry out for mandating long-term storage of DNA evidence nationwide, and reform of patently unjust identification methods. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a joy to be free again,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Dupree said as a dozen other exonorees observed a new Texas tradition of gathering to greet the latest person proved innocent.'b'Bankers would love nothing more than for the rest of the world to move on and forget about the financial meltdown that tipped us into the deepest economic trough since the 1930s.'b'This, of course, will not happen anytime soon, but we would still like to offer a couple of suggestions to anxious financiers: (a) public relations management cannot do the trick, but (b) you should improve your public relations skills anyway.'b'Robert Diamond Jr., the new American chief executive of  the British bank  Barclays, is a good case in point. You might recall Barclays as one of the largest beneficiaries of the $3.3 trillion emergency programs put in place by the Federal Reserve to stop banks from collapsing \xe2\x80\x94 taking $47.9 billion in loans in one week to make sure securities firms with operations in the United States had cash to provide financing to their clients.'b'Mr. Diamond  recently told a parliamentary panel in London, \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a period of remorse and apology for banks \xe2\x80\x94  I think that period needs to be over.\xe2\x80\x9d He also said  that \xe2\x80\x9cthe question for us is: how do we put some of the blame game behind us?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Not all bankers are quite this blas\xc3\xa9. Yet even the more contrite seem to have gotten it wrong: Credit Suisse recently required its senior American employees to give 2.5 percent of their 2010 bonuses to charity. It estimates that this will raise $30 million for good causes. But a little charity from overpaid bankers is hardly going to repair the hole the crisis blasted in the world economy. And the donations, of course, will be tax deductible.'b'A burst of altruism will not restore the reputation of banking. The real issue is how to instill accountability in banking and do away with the lopsided bet in which the financial system pockets the rewards from the risks it takes and taxpayers cover the bets when they go bad.'b'This subsidy underpins banks\xe2\x80\x99 huge profitability. Today, finance captures 29 percent of the profits of the entire American private sector, up from 19 percent 30 years ago.

We think we are being cheated on a huge scale, but we should reconsider. When it comes to lost jobs, the negative impact of China\xe2\x80\x99s currency, the renminbi, is less than one might think. Adjusting the exchange rate should not take priority over more vexing issues like North Korea, Iran and bilateral trade.'b'Since China agreed to a more flexible exchange rate last summer, its currency has appreciated a measly 3.6 percent against the dollar. This is because China, just like the United States, is also worried about jobs. In going slowly on appreciation, China is giving its exporters time to adjust, thereby limiting job losses and containing social unrest.'b'Many Americans believe that the Chinese jobs being preserved by an artificially low currency come at the expense of American jobs. There are three common explanations behind this theory.'b'First, a stronger currency would increase the purchasing power of Chinese consumers and decrease the relative cost of American goods in China, spurring more Chinese to buy more American products. Second, a stronger currency increases the relative cost of Chinese goods in third markets, like Europe or Latin America. So if the renminbi appreciates, consumers in other countries will shy away from Chinese products in favor of American products. Third, a stronger currency would increase labor costs in China, making it less attractive for American companies to move jobs to China and thus keeping more people employed at home.'b'These claims, however, are more wishful thinking than actual truths. Consider the first idea, that a strengthened Chinese currency would increase the growth rate of American exports to China. From 2005 to 2008, the renminbi appreciated nearly 20 percent against the dollar. Yet, American exports to China over those three years grew at a slightly slower pace than in the previous three-year period when the renminbi did not appreciate at all (71 percent versus 89 percent).'b'This is because many of America\xe2\x80\x99s top exports to China are for capital-intensive goods like aerospace and power-generation equipment. Price is but one of several factors for these purchases, along with technology, quality and service. In addition, American companies in those industries are usually competing against European and Japanese firms rather than Chinese manufacturers. Ultimately, the dollar-euro and dollar-yen exchange rates may play more important roles in Chinese demand for American goods than the renminbi rate.'b'Second, I recently did an analysis of the top American exports to our 20 leading foreign markets, and found little evidence that an undervalued Chinese currency hurts American exports to third countries. This is mostly because there is little head-to-head competition between America and China. In less than 15 percent of top export products \xe2\x80\x94 for example, network routers and solar panels \xe2\x80\x94 are American and Chinese corporations competing directly against one another. By and large, we are going after entirely different product markets; we market things like airplanes and pharmaceuticals while China sells electronics and textiles.'b'Finally, it is unlikely that a stronger renminbi would bring many jobs back home. Instead, companies would most likely shift labor-intensive production to Vietnam, Indonesia and other low-wage countries. And in any case many high-skilled jobs will continue to flow overseas, as long as cheaper talent can be found in India and elsewhere. Only in a few industries, like biomedical devices, would a stronger Chinese currency combined with quality issues tempt American companies to keep more manufacturing at home.'b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong: China\xe2\x80\x99s currency policies have led to unhealthy artificial distortions in the Chinese and world economy. They also fuel currency wars that threaten to undermine the cooperation needed to sustain a global recovery. And while the effect on American workers is far less than imagined, workers in the developing world stand much to gain from a faster renminbi appreciation.'b'We should discuss currency issues with China, but the exchange rate should not be at the top of the bilateral agenda. The issue is best left to the Group of 20, for this is as much the rest of the world\xe2\x80\x99s problem as it is ours. Resolving our economic troubles will depend much more on reinvesting in education, transportation and other government services, basic science and applied research than on forcing China to yield on its currency.'b'Sometime early last week, a large slice of educated America decided that Amy Chua is a menace to society. Chua, as you probably know, is the Yale professor who has written a bracing critique of what she considers the weak, cuddling American parenting style.'b'Chua didn\xe2\x80\x99t let her own girls go out on play dates or sleepovers. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t let them watch TV or play video games or take part in garbage activities like crafts. Once, one of her daughters came in second to a Korean kid in a math competition, so Chua made the girl do 2,000 math problems a night until she regained her supremacy. Once, her daughters gave her birthday cards of insufficient quality. Chua rejected them and demanded new cards. Once, she threatened to burn all of one of her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s stuffed animals unless she played a piece of music perfectly.'b'As a result, Chua\xe2\x80\x99s daughters get straight As and have won a series of musical competitions.'b'In her book, \xe2\x80\x9cBattle Hymn of the Tiger Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d Chua delivers a broadside against American parenting even as she mocks herself for her own extreme \xe2\x80\x9cChinese\xe2\x80\x9d style. She says American parents lack authority and produce entitled children who aren\xe2\x80\x99t forced to live up to their abilities.'b'The furious denunciations began flooding my in-box a week ago. Chua plays into America\xe2\x80\x99s fear of national decline. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a Chinese parent working really hard (and, by the way, there are a billion more of her) and her kids are going to crush ours. Furthermore (and this Chua doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate), she is not really rebelling against American-style parenting; she is the logical extension of the prevailing elite practices. She does everything over-pressuring upper-middle-class parents are doing. She\xe2\x80\x99s just hard core.'b'Her critics echoed the familiar themes. Her kids can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly be happy or truly creative. They\xe2\x80\x99ll grow up skilled and compliant but without the audacity to be great. She\xe2\x80\x99s destroying their love for music. There\xe2\x80\x99s a reason Asian-American women between the ages of 15 and 24 have such high suicide rates.'b'I have the opposite problem with Chua. I believe she\xe2\x80\x99s coddling her children. She\xe2\x80\x99s protecting them from the most intellectually demanding activities because she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand what\xe2\x80\x99s cognitively difficult and what isn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'Practicing a piece of music for four hours requires focused attention, but it is nowhere near as cognitively demanding as a sleepover with 14-year-old girls. Managing status rivalries, negotiating group dynamics, understanding social norms, navigating the distinction between self and group \xe2\x80\x94 these and other social tests impose cognitive demands that blow away any intense tutoring session or a class at Yale.'b'Yet mastering these arduous skills is at the very essence of achievement. Most people work in groups. We do this because groups are much more efficient at solving problems than individuals (swimmers are often motivated to have their best times as part of relay teams, not in individual events). Moreover, the performance of a group does not correlate well with the average I.Q. of the group or even with the I.Q.\xe2\x80\x99s of the smartest members.'b'Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Carnegie Mellon have found that groups have a high collective intelligence when members of a group are good at reading each others\xe2\x80\x99 emotions \xe2\x80\x94 when they take turns speaking, when the inputs from each member are managed fluidly, when they detect each others\xe2\x80\x99 inclinations and strengths.'b'Participating in a well-functioning group is really hard. It requires the ability to trust people outside your kinship circle, read intonations and moods, understand how the psychological pieces each person brings to the room can and cannot fit together.'b'This skill set is not taught formally, but it is imparted through arduous experiences. These are exactly the kinds of difficult experiences Chua shelters her children from by making them rush home to hit the homework table.'b'Chua would do better to see the classroom as a cognitive break from the truly arduous tests of childhood. Where do they learn how to manage people? Where do they learn to construct and manipulate metaphors? Where do they learn to perceive details of a scene the way a hunter reads a landscape? Where do they learn how to detect their own shortcomings? Where do they learn how to put themselves in others\xe2\x80\x99 minds and anticipate others\xe2\x80\x99 reactions?'b'These and a million other skills are imparted by the informal maturity process and are not developed if formal learning monopolizes a child\xe2\x80\x99s time.'b'So I\xe2\x80\x99m not against the way Chua pushes her daughters. And I loved her book as a courageous and thought-provoking read. It\xe2\x80\x99s also more supple than her critics let on. I just wish she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so soft and indulgent. I wish she recognized that in some important ways the school cafeteria is more intellectually demanding than the library. And I hope her daughters grow up to write their own books, and maybe learn the skills to better anticipate how theirs will be received.'b'On April 22, 2008, almost exactly one year after 32 students and faculty members were slain in the massacre at Virginia Tech, the dealer who had sold one of the weapons used by the gunman delivered a public lecture on the school\xe2\x80\x99s campus. His point: that people at Virginia Tech should be allowed to carry concealed weapons on campus.'b'Eric Thompson, owner of the online firearms store that sold a .22-caliber semiautomatic handgun to the shooter, Seung-Hui Cho, did not think that his appearance at Virginia Tech was disrespectful or that his position was extreme. He felt so strongly that college students should be allowed to be armed while engaged in their campus activities that he offered discounts to any students who wanted to buy guns from him.'b'Thompson spun the discounts as altruistic. He told 'b'ABCNews.com'b', \xe2\x80\x9cThis offers students and people who might not have otherwise been able to afford a weapon to purchase one at a hefty discount and at a significant expense to myself.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The sale to Cho was not Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s only unfortunate link to a mass killer. His firm sold a pair of 9-millimeter Glock magazines and a holster to Steven Kazmierczak, a 27-year-old graduate student in DeKalb, Ill., who, on the afternoon of Feb. 14, 2008, went heavily armed into an auditorium-type lecture hall at Northern Illinois University. Kazmierczak walked onto the stage in front of a crowd of students and opened fire. He killed five people and wounded 18 others before killing himself.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ve allowed the extremists to carry the day when it comes to guns in the United States, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the dead and the wounded and their families who have had to pay the awful price. The idea of having large numbers of college students packing heat in their classrooms and at their parties and sporting events, or at the local pub or frat house or gymnasium, or wherever, is too stupid for words.'b'Thompson did not get a warm welcome at Virginia Tech. A spokesman for the school, Larry Hincker, said the fact that he \xe2\x80\x9cwould set foot on this campus\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cterribly offensive\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cincredibly insensitive to the families of the victims.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Just last week, a sophomore at Florida State University, Ashley Cowie, was shot to death accidentally by a 20-year-old student who, according to authorities, was showing off his rifle to a group of friends in an off-campus apartment complex favored by fraternity members. A second student was shot in the wrist. This occurred as state legislators in Florida are considering a proposal to allow people with permits to carry concealed weapons on campuses. The National Rifle Association thinks that\xe2\x80\x99s a dandy idea.'b'The slaughter of college students  \xe2\x80\x94  or anyone else  \xe2\x80\x94  has never served as a deterrent to the gun fetishists. They want guns on campuses, in bars and taverns and churches, in parks and in the workplace, in cars and in the home. Ammunition everywhere  \xe2\x80\x94  the deadlier, the better. A couple of years ago, a state legislator in Arizona, Karen Johnson, argued that adults needed to be able to carry guns in all schools, from elementary on up. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel like our kindergartners are sitting there like sitting ducks,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'Can we get a grip?'b'The contention of those who would like college kids and just about everybody else to be armed to the teeth is that the good guys can shoot back whenever the bad guys show up to do harm. An important study published in 2009 by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine estimated that people in possession of a gun at the time of an assault were 4.5 times more likely to be shot during the assault than someone in a comparable situation without a gun.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOn average,\xe2\x80\x9d the researchers said, \xe2\x80\x9cguns did not seem to protect those who possessed them from being shot in an assault. Although successful defensive gun uses can and do occur, the findings of this study do not support the perception that such successes are likely.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Approximately 100,000 shootings occur in the United States every year. The number of people killed by guns should be enough to make our knees go weak. Monday was a national holiday celebrating the life of the Rev.

That means fewer guns. That means stricter licensing and registration, more vigorous background checks and a ban on assault weapons. Start with that.

Over the past year, relations between Washington and Beijing have become increasingly tense and mistrustful.'b'When President Obama and President Hu Jintao of China meet at the White House on Wednesday, they must try to set a new course in which competition is carefully managed and a premium is placed on cooperation.

A poorly structured parole system would be reorganized to focus on offenders who actually present a risk to public safety.'b'Addicts would be given drug treatment to try to make them less likely to be rearrested. And there would be incentives for towns to handle low-level offenders instead of sending them into more costly state prisons.'b'Mr. Daniels devoted the last year to building a wide political consensus behind these ideas, beginning with a study from the Council of State Governments Justice Center, a prison policy group that has helped several states revise their corrections strategies.'b'In partnership with the Pew Center on the States\xe2\x80\x99 Public Safety Performance Project, the council discovered that Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s prison count had grown by 41 percent between 2000 and 2009 \xe2\x80\x94 an increase three times that of neighboring states. It also found that the increase had been caused not by violent criminals but by drug addicts \xe2\x80\x94 who needed treatment, not jail \xe2\x80\x94 and by low-level, nonviolent criminals.  Indiana, the study found, was punishing both groups much more severely than neighboring states.'b'Unless current policies were changed, the study said, the state prison population would rise by another 21 percent by 2017, forcing lawmakers to come up with an estimated $1.2 billion for new prisons. Indiana could cut its inmate count significantly and save almost all of that money if it invested a modest sum \xe2\x80\x94 about $28 million \xe2\x80\x94 in the kinds of changes that Mr. Daniels has now included in his reform package.'b'A legislative package containing these reforms has been introduced in the Indiana Legislature. If it passes, as it should, Indiana will show the nation what good things can happen when leaders apply good sense.'b'The long suffering, and underrepresented, taxpayers of the District of Columbia are properly worried about their shrinking role in the new Republican-controlled House. Tucked into the changes enacted by Speaker John Boehner is a rule depriving the district of its one bit of token voting power in Congress.'b'Washington\xe2\x80\x99s 600,000 residents are allowed by law to elect only a watchful delegate. In 2007, the Democratic leadership allowed that delegate to cast some limited committee votes. Now even that has been killed by Republicans, leaving the delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton, and the city fathers questioning whether they are heading back to the \xe2\x80\x9cplantation mentality\xe2\x80\x9d days when Congressional committees routinely undermined home rule.'b'The city came closer to democracy last year until a measure that would have given it a full voting representative was scuttled after the gun lobby attached noxious amendments gutting gun controls in the district. This has long been the fate of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s host city under the pendulum swipes of politics. Democrats enacted limited voting powers for the delegate in 1993, but Republicans killed them two years later only to see them revived when Democrats reclaimed the gavel four years ago.'b'The District of Columbia isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only target for the Republican leadership. Four territories and Puerto Rico will also lose their committee votes. The District of Columbia\xe2\x80\x99s rallying cry for full Congressional powers \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cTaxation Without Representation\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 is painfully apt. It is one we thought the self-proclaimed patriots galvanizing the House majority would instantly recognize. Apparently partisan politics, and the district\xe2\x80\x99s large number of registered Democrats, trumps principle every time.'b'As the country struggles to find meaning in the horrific Tucson shooting, another heated national debate over gun violence comes to mind: the furious reaction to the acquittal, by reason of insanity, of John Hinckley Jr., the man who tried to kill President Ronald Reagan.'b'Nearly 30 years later, Mr. Hinckley remains in a psychiatric ward, with permission in recent years to leave in his mother\xe2\x80\x99s custody for limited visits. After the acquittal, politicians across the country blamed the insanity defense for excusing a detestable and miserable young man from imprisonment. Vowing that it would boost public safety and ensure another Hinckley would not \xe2\x80\x9cget off,\xe2\x80\x9d the federal government and 38 states rewrote their laws, establishing a much more difficult standard of proof.'b'The most common test had been that a person could be found insane if the defendant \xe2\x80\x9clacks substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\xe2\x80\x9d Most of the new restrictions reduced the test to a simple question: Did the defendant not know what he or she was doing?'b'A generation later, we know this retrenchment was based on misconceptions, above all that the defense was commonly, and successfully, used. A study of eight states from 1976 to 1987 documented that the defense was employed in less than 1 percent of criminal cases and only a quarter of those defendants were acquitted by reason of insanity.'b'While the Supreme Court declared in 1983 that such an acquittal was certain proof of dangerousness, that was largely wrong as well. Half the pleas and 35 percent of the acquittals came in cases involving nonviolent offenses; 15 percent of the acquittees were accused of murder. As for insanity acquittees going free, it rarely happened. Nine of 10, whatever the offense, ended up in mental hospitals, some for much longer than they would have been imprisoned.'b'John Hinckley Jr., suicidal and haunted by violent stories from movies and novels, said he shot President Reagan to win the attention of the actress Jodie Foster and become famous. The prosecution and defense agreed that he was seriously mentally ill at the time of the shooting. The trial was about whether he was sick enough to be found insane.'b'Medicine defines illness, the law, responsibility. The fields long tried to resolve their differences scientifically. After the Hinckley verdict, politics undermined that quest.'b'To the Editor:'b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'Looking Behind the Mug-Shot Grin'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 16) notes that the facts suggest that the suspect in Tucson is struggling with a profound mental illness that many psychiatrists say is most likely paranoid schizophrenia.'b'Psychiatrists must be careful not to offer a diagnostic opinion unless they have examined the patient. This is one of the principles of medical ethics of the American Psychiatric Association.'b'The only good that can come out of tragedies like these is if we can prevent a recurrence of such episodes.

While hugely painful, that rise wasn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising given the unraveling economy. What is surprising is that recent census data show that those poverty numbers held steady in 2009, even though job loss worsened significantly that year.'b'Clearly, the sheer scale of poverty \xe2\x80\x94 15.7 percent of the country\xe2\x80\x99s population \xe2\x80\x94 is unacceptable. But to keep millions more Americans from falling into poverty during a deep recession is a genuine accomplishment that holds a vital lesson: the safety net, fortified by stimulus, staved off an even more damaging crisis.'b'Congress should take a good look at those numbers, and consider that lesson carefully, before it commits to any more slashing and burning.'b'The latest poverty figures are from the 'b'census \xe2\x80\x9calternative\xe2\x80\x9d data'b', developed in the 1990s to count income and expenses that the \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d data omit. For example, the official measure counts only cash income to gauge poverty (defined as $21,756 for a family of four in 2009). The alternative figures cited above, which closely follow criteria from the National Academy of Sciences, include noncash federal benefits, like food stamps (and set the poverty line at $24,522 for a family of four). That gives a truer picture of a family\xe2\x80\x99s economic status.'b'What analysts have found is that the antipoverty effect of government intervention in 2009 was profound. 'b'Calculations by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities'b', a liberal-leaning research group, show that specific stimulus provisions \xe2\x80\x94 including expanded federal jobless benefits, new and improved tax credits for workers and bolstered food stamps \xe2\x80\x94 kept 4.5 million people out of poverty in 2009. Only Social Security and the earned income credit did more to fight poverty.'b'The results are likely to be roughly similar in 2010 because most of the 2009 law was continued last year. The portents going forward are not good.'b'Federal aid is being scaled back, even though growth is not yet robust enough to make a sizable dent in unemployment. Late last year, Republicans blocked the extension of a successful stimulus program that had created 250,000 subsidized jobs for young people and low-income parents. They claimed the stimulus was an expensive failure, even as they pressed to renew the high-end Bush tax cuts. As part of the tax-cut deal, President Obama and Congress agreed to extend federal jobless benefits in 2011, but the checks will be $25 less a week than under the stimulus. That reduction could push an estimated 175,000 more people into poverty in 2011. The deal also included a one-year payroll tax cut that will benefit most workers, but it is less helpful to the lowest-income workers than a now-expired tax break in the stimulus.'b'With 14.5 million people still out of work, and more than 6 million of them jobless for more than six months, reducing federal help now will almost ensure more poverty later. That would impose an even higher cost on the economy and budget because ever poorer households cannot spend and consume.'b'We know it goes against the prevailing rhetoric to argue that more and better government policies are still needed to repair the economy. It is also unpopular to argue that programs that have succeeded for decades in reducing poverty, like Social Security, need to be preserved even as they are retooled for the 21st century. To do otherwise is to deny the evidence.'b'President Obama must explain to the American people that the country needs to continue relief and recovery efforts, especially programs to create jobs. Without that, tens of millions of Americans stuck in poverty will have little hope of climbing out \xe2\x80\x94 and many more could join their ranks.'b'The Roberts court is hearing a larger share of cases about economic activities that matter to big business than the Rehnquist court before it. A 'b'recent study'b' done by scholars for The Times documents that, compared with other Supreme Courts since 1953, this one is \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly more likely to produce a conservative decision\xe2\x80\x9d in those cases.'b'One reason for that, beyond the court\xe2\x80\x99s conservative tilt, may be that big business is increasingly bringing in big guns to argue their cases: former lawyers in the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s Office of the Solicitor General. So far this term, former Solicitors General Gregory Garre, Theodore Olson and Seth Waxman have argued at the court for business clients.'b'Former solicitors general used to be more likely to become professors, judges or other kinds of public servants. Now they are more likely to build corporate practices. With the exception of Justice Elena Kagan and one other, every former solicitor general for the past 15 years leads a law firm group representing business clients.'b'Of the 11 cases on the court\xe2\x80\x99s January list for oral arguments, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed briefs in seven. Last term, the chamber supported the winning side in 13 of 16 cases where it took part. As Adam Liptak 'b'reported'b' in The Times, the group attributes those results to the quality of their advocates. The biggest victory was in the Citizens United case, argued by Mr. Olson.'b'At this level, quality includes intricate knowledge of the court\xe2\x80\x99s rulings and the ability to shape arguments. Being a solicitor general certainly gives them that. Still, justices need to ask themselves whether they may unconsciously \xe2\x80\x94 and unfairly \xe2\x80\x94 defer to former  solicitors general. When Mr. Olson recently argued before the court on a case about whether medical residents should be required to pay Social Security taxes, he slyly tweaked Justice Sonia Sotomayor and got an affectionate laugh all around.'b'There is a special relationship between the solicitor general\xe2\x80\x99s office and the court. In addition to being the president\xe2\x80\x99s chief courtroom lawyer, the solicitor general is the court\xe2\x80\x99s counselor. The court regularly asks the solicitor general for guidance in cases where the government isn\xe2\x80\x99t a party, with the solicitor general expected to advocate for the interests of the United States. When former  solicitors general are in private practice, all of that must be put firmly aside.'b'On Wednesday, the court will hear arguments in a case about drug pricing, in which Lisa Blatt, a former assistant to the solicitor general, represents Astra USA, a drug maker. The company contends a health-care provider has no grounds for suing it for exceeding Medicaid price limits.

With sticks and stones, we take control of the neighborhood. We spend that night shooing away strangers and strange cars. In the morning we roam the city looking for bread and milk for our children. There is no milk to be found. Gradually, city residents become used to the state of emergency and the curfew, and begin to enjoy the free time they now have, especially since they are able to speak freely, able to openly curse and ridicule Mr. Ben Ali and his corrupt family.'b'On Monday we are told that a new \xe2\x80\x9cunity\xe2\x80\x9d government has formed. When Tunisians see that some members of the old regime have been named to cabinet posts, there is a new wave of disturbances, and people start saying that the revolution has been stolen from them.'b'On Tuesday, young people again take to the streets, demanding the dissolution of Mr. Ben Ali\xe2\x80\x99s party, the Democratic Constitutional Rally party, which has ruled Tunisia since independence in 1956. Others argue that this risks being a repeat of the purges of members of Saddam Hussein\xe2\x80\x99s Baath party in Iraq, which contributed to the insurgency there. While I agree that it may be impossible to dissolve the party without sending the country into chaos, I think we have no choice but to try.'b'There are also demonstrations at the offices of the largest opposition group over its complicity with the old regime in the new government. By the end of the day 'b'at least five ministers have stepped down'b', and nobody knows what will come next.'b'As for myself, I feel an overwhelming happiness that I will now be able to write freely. A year and a half ago, one of my novels, which describes life under oppression, was performed as a play at a cultural center here. Those of us involved were monitored constantly by the police; none of the journalists in attendance wrote reviews.'b'That is why I support the revolution and, like so many of the young people, worry that it will be stolen from us by the traitors, thieves and killers who have ruled us for far too long.'b'Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York has made transparency a very big deal. In his inaugural speech, he said that New Yorkers cannot be expected to trust their state government without \xe2\x80\x9creal transparency and real disclosure and real accountability and real ethics enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d Tell that to the Committee to Save New York.'b'Organized with Mr. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s blessing, this group of business executives has just started a television campaign to support the governor\xe2\x80\x99s agenda. But it is not disclosing all of the sources of its money.'b'Mr. Cuomo said this week that he has called for disclosure of donors to the committee \xe2\x80\x94 and all other groups organized under the same federal statute. And he said he has plans to put that disclosure requirement in a new ethics bill he intends to propose soon.'b'He is right to do so. Some nonprofit groups recoil at disclosure, particularly public interest groups whose contributors might fear retaliation. But there are more and more of these groups campaigning for a single issue \xe2\x80\x94 like more charter schools, or fewer cars in New York City. The public deserves to know who is paying the bills.'b'Most Albany veterans figure that the outcry against disclosure from these groups will convince legislators to allow the secrecy to stand. It is that very outcry that argues strongly for making disclosure happen.'b'The Committee to Save New York has revealed some of its backers and promised to register under the state\xe2\x80\x99s lobbying laws, which do require more disclosure. Kathryn Wylde from the business-related Partnership for New York City is a major player, as is Rob Speyer, a prominent real-estate executive.'b'The group was organized to help the governor fight for his forthcoming ultralean budget. When past governors have tried to cut the budget, especially in health care and education, union-backed groups have retaliated with television barrages, and, for many years, governors, both Republican and Democrat, have relented.'b'Mr. Cuomo is raising money to fight back and has said those donors will be identified as required by state law. That\xe2\x80\x99s fine, but as the purveyor of a new, transparent Albany, he should make certain that all groups \xe2\x80\x94 supporting him or opposing him \xe2\x80\x94 reveal their donors.'b'The Irish are still mesmerized by the mythical place that is America, but in the \xe2\x80\x9960s  our fascination got out of hand. I was not old enough to remember the sacrifices of the great generation who saved Europe in the Second World War, or to quite comprehend what was going on in Vietnam. But what I do remember, and cannot forget, is watching a man walk on the moon in 1969 and thinking here is a nation that finds joy in the impossible.'b'The Irish saw the Kennedys as our own royal family out on loan to America. A million of them  turned out on J.F.K.\xe2\x80\x99s homecoming to see these patrician public servants who, despite their station, had no patience for the status quo. (They also loved that the Kennedys looked more WASP than any \xe2\x80\x9cProd,\xe2\x80\x9d our familiar term for Protestant.)'b'I remember Bobby\xe2\x80\x99s rolled-up sleeves, Jack\xe2\x80\x99s jutted jaw and the message \xe2\x80\x94 a call to action \xe2\x80\x94 that the world didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be the way it was. Science and faith had found a perfect rhyme.'b'In the background, but hardly in the shadows, was Robert Sargent Shriver. A diamond intelligence, too bright to keep in the darkness. He was not Robert or Bob, he was Sarge, and for all the love in him, he knew that love was a tough word. Easy to say, tough to see it through. Love, yes, and peace, too, in no small measure; this was the \xe2\x80\x9960s but you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know it just by looking at him. No long hair in the Shriver house, or rock \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 roll. He and his beautiful bride, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, would go to Mass every day \xe2\x80\x94 as much an act of rebellion against brutal modernity as it was an act of worship. Love, yes, but love as a brave act, a bold act, requiring toughness and sacrifice.'b'His faith demanded action, from him, from all of us. For the Word to become flesh, we had to become the eyes, the ears, the hands of a just God. Injustice could, in the words of the old spiritual, \xe2\x80\x9cBe Overcome.\xe2\x80\x9d Robert Sargent sang, \xe2\x80\x9cMake me a channel of your peace,\xe2\x80\x9d and became the song.'b'Make me a channel of your peace:'b'Where there is hatred let me bring your love.'b'Where there is injury, your pardon, Lord,'b'And where there\xe2\x80\x99s doubt, true faith in you.'b'Oh, Master grant that I may never seek,'b'So much to be consoled as to console.'b'To be understood as to understand,'b'To be loved as to love with all my soul.'b'Make me a channel of your peace,'b'Where there\xe2\x80\x99s despair in life, let me bring hope.'b'Where there is darkness, only light,'b'And where there\xe2\x80\x99s sadness, ever joy.'b'The Peace Corps was Jack Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s creation but embodied Sargent Shriver\xe2\x80\x99s spirit. Lyndon Johnson declared war on poverty but Sarge led the charge. These, and the Special Olympics, were as dramatic an incarnation of the ideas at the heart of America as the space program.'b'Robert Sargent Shriver changed the world more than a few times and, I am happy to say, changed my world forever. In the late \xe2\x80\x9990s, when the Jubilee 2000 campaign \xe2\x80\x94 which aimed to cancel the debts that the poorest nations owed to the richest \xe2\x80\x94 asked me to help in the United States, I called on the Shriver clan for help and advice. What I got were those things in spades, and a call to arms like a thump in the back.'b'In the years since, Bobby Shriver \xe2\x80\x94 Sarge\xe2\x80\x99s oldest son \xe2\x80\x94 and I co-founded three fighting units in the war against global poverty: DATA, ONE and (RED). We may not yet know what it will take to finish the fight and silence suffering in our time, but we are flat out trying to live up to Sarge\xe2\x80\x99s drill.'b'I have beautiful memories of Bobby and me sitting with his father and mother at the Shrivers\xe2\x80\x99 kitchen table \xe2\x80\x94 the same team that gazed over J.F.K.\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder \xe2\x80\x94 looking over our paltry attempts at speechifying,  prodding and pushing us toward comprehensibility and credibility, a challenge when your son starts hanging round with a bleeding-heart Irish rock star.'b'Toward the end, when I visited Sarge as a frailer man, I was astonished by his good spirits and good humor. He had the room around him laughing out loud. I thought it a fitting final victory in a life that embodied service and transcended, so often, grave duty, that he had a certain weightlessness about him. Even then, his job nearly done, his light shone undiminished, and brightened us all.'b'On Wednesday, Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut announced that he won\xe2\x80\x99t be a candidate for re-election in 2012. Normally people look particularly appealing when they\xe2\x80\x99re promising to go away. This time, not so much.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help but also think about my four grandparents and the journey they traveled more than a century ago,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in his speech. \xe2\x80\x9cEven they could not have dreamed that their grandson would end up a United States senator and, incidentally, a barrier-breaking candidate for vice president.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Lieberman has reached a point in his public career when every single thing he does, including talking about his grandparents, is irritating. Last month, when he helped lead the fight for the repeal of \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d some people seemed more than a tad resentful at having to give up complaining about him for the duration of the debate. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, he wants gay people in the military,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Alex Pareene at Salon.com, \xe2\x80\x9cHe wants 'b'everyone'b' in the military.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Plus, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t really leaving. He\xe2\x80\x99s got two years of his term left, during which he will be looking for \xe2\x80\x9cnew opportunities that will allow me to serve my country.\xe2\x80\x9d Do you think that means something involving a large salary and a chance to make multitudinous TV appearances, or a Peace Corps stint in Burkina Faso? Let me see hands.'b'When he was not busy comparing himself to John Kennedy on Wednesday, Lieberman denounced partisanship. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not always fit comfortably into conventional political boxes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said proudly. This is, of course, an old theme for him, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also a cautionary tale.'b'The reason we have political parties is that the best way to get things done is by working together. Obviously, sometimes people with principles have to take an independent stand. But Lieberman\xe2\x80\x99s career has taught us how important it is to do that with a sense of humility. If you\xe2\x80\x99re continually admiring yourself as you walk away from your group, eventually people are going to feel an irresistible desire to trip you.'b'When he started in politics in Connecticut, Lieberman was a careful politician whom everybody regarded as an up-and-comer, even though he was extremely boring. But nobody realized how far he might up and come.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of guy who, when you see him in line at the supermarket, you go and get in a different line so you won\xe2\x80\x99t have to make conversation,\xe2\x80\x9d a friend from Connecticut protested, when Al Gore announced that he had chosen Lieberman to be his running mate.'b'Well, that was true of so very many vice presidents.'b'The vice presidential race was the high point of the Joe Lieberman story, even though he allowed Dick Cheney to eviscerate him in the debate. But he left it with the idea that he should be the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004. Nobody else had gotten that message.'b'Lieberman, a big supporter of the war in Iraq, expected the party\xe2\x80\x99s base to nominate a candidate who disagreed with them about the critical issue of the day, had failed at the most crucial task delegated to him during the previous presidential election and was one of the most sluggish and clich\xc3\xa9-ridden public speakers in the history of oratory.'b'He was shocked when they decided not to.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a personal rejection, but I never saw anybody take anything so personally. He became so bitter about Democratic liberals,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bill Curry, a former Connecticut comptroller and gubernatorial candidate.'b'In his re-election campaign in 2006, Lieberman, having learned nothing whatsoever, suggested that anyone who disagreed with him about the war was endangering the country. (\xe2\x80\x9cWe undermine the president\xe2\x80\x99s credibility at our nation\xe2\x80\x99s peril.\xe2\x80\x9d) He lost the Democratic nomination. More shock and outrage.'b'When he won running as an independent, it cemented his sense of exceptionalism. However, this did not seem like a trick he could pull off twice, unless both of the major parties cooperated in 2012 by once again nominating terrible candidates. (The Republican nominee in 2006 was in trouble for, among other things, using a phony name while betting at the local casinos and failing to pay his gambling debts in New Jersey.)'b'However, on Wednesday, Lieberman assured everyone that he was not stepping down because the odds of his losing the next race were astronomically high but rather because he had been reading the Old Testament and decided that to everything there is a season.'b'He will leave behind a long list of achievements, from helping to consolidate the nation\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence gathering services in a way that appears to make it more difficult to gather intelligence, to threatening to filibuster the health care reform act until it had been watered down to suit his own high principles.'b'You will find it all in my upcoming book, \xe2\x80\x9cEverything Bad Is Joe Lieberman\xe2\x80\x99s Fault.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'BEIJING'b'When Deng Xiaoping made a landmark visit to the United States in 1979, he was seated near the actress Shirley MacLaine. According to several accounts that Ms. MacLaine confirmed this week, she told Deng rhapsodically about a visit to China during the Cultural Revolution. She described meeting a scholar who had been sent to toil in the countryside but spoke glowingly about the joys of manual labor and the terrific opportunity to learn from peasants.'b'Deng growled: \xe2\x80\x9cHe was lying.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In that blunt spirit, let me offer a quick guide to some of the issues that we have put on the table during President Hu Jintao\xe2\x80\x99s state visit to Washington, at a time when Chinese-American relations are deeply strained and likely to get worse. American opinion tends to be divided between panda-huggers (\xe2\x80\x9cChina is fabulous!\xe2\x80\x9d) and panda-muggers (\xe2\x80\x9cChina is evil!\xe2\x80\x9d), but the truth lies between this yin and yang.'b''b'Trade'b' is at the heart of the tensions, and China is clearly keeping its currency artificially low (and probably will continue to do so) in an effort to preserve jobs at home. This is destabilizing the international system \xe2\x80\x94  but let\xe2\x80\x99s not exaggerate the impact on our own economy. Chinese goods mostly compete with products from Mexico, South Korea and other countries, and it is stealing jobs from those countries more than from America.'b'Trade figures also exaggerate China\xe2\x80\x99s exports. For example, China assembles iPhones, so their full value counts as Chinese exports. But, in fact, less than 4 percent of the phone\xe2\x80\x99s value is contributed by China, 'b'according to a study'b' by the Asian Development Bank Institute. A greater share is contributed by Japan, Germany, South Korea and the U.S.'b''b'Aggressive territorial claims'b' by Beijing are unnerving China\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors as well as Washington. My take is that China has a strong historical case in claiming 'b'the disputed islands'b' in the East China Sea known as the Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese. But China\xe2\x80\x99s claims to a chunk of the South China Sea are preposterous, and its belligerence is driving neighbors closer to America.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s also a real risk that Chinese harassment of American planes and ships in international waters will spark a conflict by accident. The collision of Chinese and American military aircraft in 2001 led to a crisis that was defused only because then-President Jiang Zemin was determined to preserve relations with Washington. If such an incident occurred today, President Hu would probably be unwilling or unable to resolve the crisis.'b''b'Human rights'b' are complex. Christians are persecuted less than they used to be just a few years ago, and the regime gives ordinary people much more freedom to travel and greater individual space than when I lived in China in the 1980s and 1990s.'b'That said, the Communist Party has been cracking down hard in the last few years on dissidents and ethnic minorities such as Tibetans and Uighurs. Its imprisonment of the great writer Liu Xiaobo, and 'b'its tantrum'b' after he won the Nobel Peace Prize last year, damaged China\xe2\x80\x99s image.'b'Mr. Obama must speak up: How can one Nobel Peace Prize laureate be silent when meeting the man who imprisons the next?'b''b'Support for rogue states'b', such as 'b'North Korea, Iran'b', Myanmar, Sudan and Zimbabwe, makes conflicts and nuclear proliferation more likely. But, in fairness, China has much less leverage over these countries than Americans assume. And in the last couple of months, it has played a helpful role in both Sudan and North Korea.'b''b'Chest-thumping'b', especially from the military, is poisoning Chinese-American relations. Even Xi Jinping, a pragmatist who has been chosen to replace Mr. Hu as the next supreme leader of China, gave a nasty speech in October falsely accusing the United States of using germ warfare during the Korean War. In truth, Mr. Xi seems to admire the United States  \xe2\x80\x94  he just sent his only daughter to attend Harvard as an undergraduate  \xe2\x80\x94  but he apparently feels the need to join the nationalist parade.'b'President Obama started out very conciliatory toward China, but Beijing perceived that as weakness and walked all over him. Now Mr. Obama is tougher, as he must be.'b'My take is that China is going through a period resembling the Bush era in the United States: hawks and hard-liners have gained ground in domestic politics, and they scoff at the country\xe2\x80\x99s diplomats as wimps. China\xe2\x80\x99s foreign ministry seems barely a player.'b'Domestic concerns trump all else, partly because Chinese leaders are nervous about stability and about the delicate transition to Mr. Xi and his team two years from now. A Chinese poll has found that public satisfaction is at its lowest level in 11 years, and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao upset hard-liners by calling publicly for more pluralism (he was censored).'b'The upshot is that China-Firsters  \xe2\x80\x94 Chinese versions of Dick Cheney  \xe2\x80\x94  have a greater voice. Brace yourself.'b'Greenport, N.Y.'b'THERE are many factors behind the mortgage crisis, but there is only one simple explanation for why we have failed to solve it. Any effort to help homeowners by forgiving some of their loans is said to create a moral hazard, rendering it politically toxic. But without help, homeowners continue to struggle, foreclosures continue to mount and the housing industry continues to drag down the economy.'b'Fortunately, there is a way around this problem, and it\xe2\x80\x99s similar to one we\xe2\x80\x99ve already used for the American automobile industry. If structured bankruptcies could save General Motors and Chrysler, why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cstructured foreclosures\xe2\x80\x9d save the American family \xe2\x80\x94 and stabilize a banking system that remains dangerously undermined by bad mortgage debt?'b'After all, foreclosures and bankruptcies are similar. Both are legal processes that allow primary lenders to wipe out subordinate claims and gain clear ownership of an asset, then sell it to recoup whatever value they can.'b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s one thing for a bank to take ownership of a manufacturing plant or inventory; in a foreclosure, the asset in question is also someone\xe2\x80\x99s home.'b'In this brutal process, the borrower is typically evicted, leaving neighbors living beside a vacant house and a family on the street. To make things worse, the affected family has no incentive to cooperate with the foreclosure, drawing out the process and clogging the court system.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s needed, then, is a set of incentives for borrowers to cooperate with lenders in foreclosure filings, just as G.M. and Chrysler did with their creditors in bankruptcy \xe2\x80\x94 in other words, a structured foreclosure.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s how it would work. The borrower would lose ownership of his home, but be allowed to remain as a tenant paying fair rent for a reasonable period after foreclosure, with the requirement that he cooperate in the foreclosure. He\xe2\x80\x99d pay fair market rents as published by the federal government, ensuring a clear, national standard. If the borrower couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford to pay market rent, existing federal rent-subsidy programs could be extended to help tide him over.'b'At the same time, with borrowers now working with lenders, it would be much easier to gather all the documents necessary to process the foreclosure, unclogging the sort of paperwork roadblocks that have recently encumbered the mortgage industry. Lenders would wind up owning a portfolio of income-producing property that would be readily marketable to investors.'b'True, the process could force lenders to revalue the homes at significantly lower prices than what they have on their books. Then again, such revaluation is almost inevitable in the current housing market, and instability in the banking sector could be resolved with additional government support.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s more, the plan would create a new supply of badly needed rental housing without drawing the sort of community opposition that so often accompanies proposals to build new rental properties. Same house, same family \xe2\x80\x94 but a new, financially capable owner. And by shifting many homes to rental properties, it would help thin out the country\xe2\x80\x99s oversupply of housing, which is a significant drag on the market.'b'But most important, structured foreclosures would bring sanity to a market still suffering from the delusions of the housing bubble. During that time, the usual house price-rent ratio \xe2\x80\x94 that is, what people will pay to rent a home versus the monthly mortgage fees they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to pay to buy it \xe2\x80\x94 became inflated, so that instead of houses being priced at 10 to 15 times their rent, they were selling for 20 times their rent or more.'b'Under this plan, however, struggling homeowners who are saddled with mortgages priced at those inflated values can, as renters, choose to pay fair market rents for their homes instead. Over time, this will put pressure on the rest of the housing market to return to a reasonable, sustainable price-rent ratio \xe2\x80\x94 a trend that most economists say is critical for getting the economy moving again.'b'Congress has done a good job of saving big business with structured bankruptcy plans. Now it must to use the same tool to save American homeowners.'b'A few Congressional Democrats and Republicans will be 'b'sitting next to each other'b' on Tuesday night during the State of the Union address, straying from their glowering bunkers on opposite sides of the aisle. It\xe2\x80\x99s a lovely idea, intended to show that ideological divisions do not require personal rancor. But it is essentially a gesture to the cameras, and it should not obscure what remains a wide and fundamentally deep aisle between the parties.'b'Most Democrats, for example, believe it is important to provide health insurance to the uninsured. Republicans do not. Democrats believe in using the financial powers of the government to help revive the economy. Republicans believe instead in the power of tax cuts, primarily for the wealthy. Democrats believe regulation can help protect the environment and consumers, and help avert another financial collapse. Republicans have fought virtually every proposal to regulate.'b'These debates are important and need to continue, wherever members of Congress choose to sit for the annual presidential address. There is nothing wrong with sharp ideological argument, as long as partisans do not seek to demonize their opponents and make their cases without ridicule and threats. If lawmakers really want to impress the American people with their new commitment to a joint sense of purpose, there is much they can do that is more vital than seating arrangements.'b'They can, for example, stop pushing stunt legislation. Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s vote in the House to repeal health care reform was never intended to create law; it was simply an elaborate message to the Republican base. Any voters who thought it might actually build momentum toward repeal are likely to be disappointed. Republicans are welcome to propose a detailed alternative to the law and explain to the public how it would address matters like the uninsured, pre-existing conditions and lowering the deficit. Simply saying \xe2\x80\x9cget rid of it\xe2\x80\x9d is an act of provocation by one party against the other.'b'Democrats could lower the temperature in the Senate by agreeing to new rules that make it 'b'harder to filibuster'b', even if that could put them at a disadvantage should they slip back into the minority. The right to filibuster on the most significant issues must remain, but its abuse over the last four years to obstruct virtually every nomination or piece of legislation has severely damaged comity in the Senate. Many Democrats are trying to reduce filibusters, but to get there they may have to agree to let the Republicans propose more amendments to bills, under ground rules that would put limits on endless debates.'b'There should also be agreement among both parties and both houses that the Congressional Budget Office\xe2\x80\x99s estimates of a bill\xe2\x80\x99s cost are independent and legitimate and should not be rejected 'b'simply because they are politically inconvenient.'b' Democrats have raged against the budget office in the past, and Republicans are doing so now because estimates show that the health bill would reduce the deficit by $143 billion in the first 10 years and more in the second 10 years. Selective acceptance of the most basic budgetary numbers produces cynicism in the electorate and divisiveness along the aisle.'b'There are many other Congressional actions that could also improve Washington\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere: proposing specific cuts in spending instead of threatening to force the country into default if vague spending targets are not met; reducing the use of committee subpoenas as weapons of partisan attack; ending the ability of individual senators to hold up presidential nominations.'b'All these practices have been preserved over the years because they serve the political interests of lawmakers. Mingling together next week should at least give members of Congress an opportunity to begin discussing the national interest first.'b'Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s troubles turned even more surreal over the weekend when the former dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier, known as Baby Doc, showed up in Port-au-Prince after nearly 25 years of exile. After two nights in a hotel, surrounded by sycophants and unanswered questions, Mr. Duvalier was taken into custody for four hours on Tuesday and then officially charged with embezzlement and corruption \xe2\x80\x94 an encouraging development, although theft was only one of his many crimes.'b'Mr. Duvalier, who fled the country in 1986, should also answer for his squalid legacy of disappearance, torture and murder.'b'We don\xe2\x80\x99t know where this is headed. A trial and prison? A swift escort onto the next plane? Whatever happens, we know that Mr. Duvalier has nothing to offer the country that he and his father, Fran\xc3\xa7ois Duvalier, who was known as Papa Doc, looted and brutalized for decades. Every moment that Jean-Claude Duvalier spends free in Haiti adds insult to catastrophic injury.'b'It was disturbing to see some Haitians cheering him \xe2\x80\x94 another reminder of the country\xe2\x80\x99s desperation in the wake of last year\xe2\x80\x99s devastating earthquake and the current cholera epidemic.'b'It is also encouraging to know that President Ren\xc3\xa9 Pr\xc3\xa9val was willing to act to bring Mr. Duvalier to justice. Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s justice system is weak and too often corrupt, another legacy of the Duvaliers. Whatever happens, the Pr\xc3\xa9val government and the courts must resist political passions and demands for retribution.'b'Haiti can be better than that. It already is. It has a fragile democracy, one that needs protecting. How it handles Mr. Duvalier is an important test. There can be no impunity. But the country\xe2\x80\x99s laws must be respected.'b'That isn\xe2\x80\x99t Mr. Pr\xc3\xa9val\xe2\x80\x99s only test in coming days. He must also settle the cloud surrounding Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s recent presidential elections. He should stop delaying and endorse the findings of an inquiry by the Organization of American States. Monitors sorted through the tainted residue of November\xe2\x80\x99s badly mishandled voting and found that Mirlande Manigat and Michel Martelly had finished in first and second place.

But the newly discovered letter undermines those claims and reinforces evidence of foot dragging that still has not been adequately addressed by the Vatican.'b'The letter from the papal representative rejected a 1996 decision by Dublin church leaders to respond more candidly to the suppressed scandal in Ireland by ordering that child-abuse allegations be referred for criminal investigation. The \xe2\x80\x9cstrictly confidential\xe2\x80\x9d letter from Rome \xe2\x80\x94 leaked this week amid continuing inquiries into the Irish scandal \xe2\x80\x94 emphasized the priority of in-house handling of pedophilia cases under church, not civil, law.'b'This was hardly the needed prescription for what an Irish government investigation eventually described as \xe2\x80\x9cendemic\xe2\x80\x9d abuse of thousands of children over decades by rogue priests who were routinely shielded from criminal penalties.'b'It was disclosed recently, for example, that Tony Walsh, a notorious abuser of children who was convicted and defrocked in a secret church court in Dublin in 1993, got his collar back a year later when a Vatican court believed his appeal and reinstated him as a priest. He was eventually imprisoned after raping and molesting scores of youngsters.'b'Rome officials insist that the letter from Rome is outdated, misinterpreted and superseded by tougher church rules. Unfortunately, the latest policies of the Vatican do not mandate the zero-tolerance reforms that ranking officials in the United States and elsewhere were forced to proclaim as the scandal demoralized church faithful worldwide.'b'It is commendable that Pope Benedict XVI has been apologizing and promising a firmer hand. But current Vatican policy, updated last year, offers merely a nonbinding advisory \xe2\x80\x94 not a firm mandate \xe2\x80\x94 that diocesan officials should report crimes to police.'b'This is cold comfort to worried Catholic parents or anyone else relying on the rule of law.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Amy Chua Is a Wimp'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (column, Jan. 18):'b'Undergirding Amy Chua\xe2\x80\x99s book about her strict Chinese child-rearing methods and David Brooks\xe2\x80\x99s response is the assumption that success is mainly measured by professional accomplishment.'b'But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the key question is: How can we raise our children so that they are professionally successful and achievement-oriented?'b'Maybe we should instead ask other arguably more important questions, like these: How can parents do a better job of morally educating their children?

Almost 30 percent of current bariatric surgery patients regain the weight they initially lose or have the surgery reversed. In addition, the prevalence of suicide increases markedly for bariatric surgery patients.'b'Surgery should not be viewed as the first or only choice for obese patients.

With every, mostly fragmentary, addition to the physical evidence, the picture changes. The mysteries, and the fascination, seem only to keep growing.'b'A case in point is 'b'the recent discovery'b' at Denisova Cave, in Siberia, of a finger bone, 50,000 years old. Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, based in Leipzig, Germany, have extracted the entire genome from the finger bone and found that it belongs to a previously unknown hominid they have called Denisovans.'b'Researchers will need more skeletal samples before they can say what the Denisovans looked like. But they are believed to have emerged from Africa at roughly the same time as Neanderthals \xe2\x80\x94 500,000 years ago \xe2\x80\x94 and settled much farther east. The scientists reached this conclusion by comparing Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes with the genomes of modern humans.'b'In Nature last month, 'b'they reported'b' that as much as 4.8 percent of Denisovan DNA turned up in the DNA of people living in Papua New Guinea and the nearby island of Bougainville. Given the distance between Siberia and Papua New Guinea, there\xe2\x80\x99s every possibility the Denisovans were as successful and wide ranging as Neanderthals, who settled in Europe and the Near East.'b'The story that needs updating in our minds isn\xe2\x80\x99t just the existence of another hominid. It\xe2\x80\x99s the fact that humans overlapped and interbred with both Neanderthals and with Denisovans. We carry the traces of these cousins in our genes. What is still unanswered is why we humans survived and prospered, while the Neanderthals and Denisovans disappeared. After all, Neanderthals and Denisovans had already prospered for 200,000 or 300,000 years by the time they faded away.'b'Wellesley, Mass.'b'DESPITE overwhelming evidence to the contrary, roughly one in five Americans believes that vaccines cause autism \xe2\x80\x94 a disturbing fact that will probably hold true even after the publication this month, in a British medical journal, of 'b'a report thoroughly debunking'b' the 1998 paper that began the vaccine-autism scare.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s because the public\xe2\x80\x99s underlying fear of vaccines goes much deeper than a single paper. Until officials realize that, and learn how to counter such deep-seated concerns, the paranoia \xe2\x80\x94 and the public-health risk it poses \xe2\x80\x94 will remain.'b'The evidence against the original article and its author, a British medical researcher named Andrew Wakefield, is damning. Among other things, he is said to have received payment for his research from a lawyer involved in a suit against a vaccine manufacturer; in response, Britain\xe2\x80\x99s General Medical Council struck him from the medical register last May. As the journal\xe2\x80\x99s editor put it, the assertion that the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine caused autism \xe2\x80\x9cwas based not on bad science but on a deliberate fraud.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But public fear of vaccines did not originate with Dr. Wakefield\xe2\x80\x99s paper. Rather, his claims tapped into a reservoir of doubt and resentment toward this life-saving, but never risk-free, technology.'b'Vaccines have had to fight against public skepticism from the beginning. In 1802, after Edward Jenner published his first results claiming that scratching cowpox pus into the arms of healthy children could protect them against smallpox, a political cartoon appeared showing newly vaccinated people with hooves and horns.'b'Nevertheless, during the 19th century vaccines became central to public-health efforts in England, Europe and the Americas, and several countries began to require vaccinations.'b'Such a move didn\xe2\x80\x99t sit comfortably with many people, who saw mandatory vaccinations as an invasion of their personal liberty. An antivaccine movement began to build and, though vilified by the mainstream medical profession, soon boasted a substantial popular base and several prominent supporters, including Frederick Douglass, Leo Tolstoy and George Bernard Shaw, who called vaccinations \xe2\x80\x9ca peculiarly filthy piece of witchcraft.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In America, popular opposition peaked during the smallpox epidemic at the turn of the 20th century. Health officials ordered vaccinations in public schools, in factories and on the nation\xe2\x80\x99s railroads; club-wielding New York City policemen enforced vaccinations in crowded immigrant tenements, while Texas Rangers and the United States Cavalry provided muscle for vaccinators along the Mexican border.'b'Public resistance was immediate, from riots and school strikes to lobbying and a groundswell of litigation that eventually reached the Supreme Court. Newspapers, notably this one, dismissed antivaccinationists as \xe2\x80\x9cbenighted and deranged\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chopeless cranks.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But the opposition reflected complex attitudes toward medicine and the government. Many African-Americans, long neglected or mistreated by the white medical profession, doubted the vaccinators\xe2\x80\x99 motives. Christian Scientists protested the laws as an assault on religious liberty. And workers feared, with good reason, that vaccines would inflame their arms and cost them several days\xe2\x80\x99 wages.'b'Understandably, advocates for universal immunization then and now have tended to see only the harm done by their critics. But in retrospect, such wariness was justified: at the time, health officials ordered vaccinations without ensuring the vaccines were safe and effective.'b'Public confidence in vaccines collapsed in the fall of 1901 when newspapers linked the deaths of nine schoolchildren in Camden, N.J., to a commercial vaccine allegedly tainted with tetanus. In St. Louis, 13 more schoolchildren died of tetanus after treatment with the diphtheria antitoxin. It was decades before many Americans were willing to submit to public vaccination campaigns again.'b'Nevertheless, the vaccination controversy of the last century did leave a positive legacy. Seeking to restore confidence after the deaths in Camden and St. Louis, Congress enacted the Biologics Control Act of 1902, establishing the first federal regulation of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s growing vaccine industry. Confronted with numerous antivaccination lawsuits, state and federal courts established new standards that balanced public health and civil liberties.'b'Most important, popular resistance taught government officials that when it comes to public health, education can be more effective than brute force. By midcentury, awareness efforts had proven critical to the polio and smallpox vaccination efforts, both of which were huge successes.'b'One would think such education efforts would no longer be necessary. After all, today\xe2\x80\x99s vaccines are safer, subject to extensive regulatory controls. And shots are far more numerous: as of 2010, the Centers for Disease Control recommended that every child receive 10 different vaccines. For most Americans, vaccines are a fact of life.'b'Still, according to a 2010 C.D.C. report, 40 percent of American parents with young children have delayed or refused one or more vaccines for their child. That\xe2\x80\x99s in part because vaccines have been so successful that any risk associated with their use, however statistically small, takes on an elevated significance.'b'It also doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help that, thanks to the Internet, a bottomless archive of misinformation, including Dr. Wakefield\xe2\x80\x99s debunked work, is just a few keystrokes away. All of which means the public health community must work even harder to spread the positive news about vaccines.'b'Health officials often get frustrated with public misconceptions about vaccines; at the turn of the last century, one frustrated Kentucky health officer pined for the arrival of \xe2\x80\x9cthe fool-killer\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 an outbreak of smallpox devastating enough to convince his skeptical rural constituency of the value of vaccination.'b'But that\xe2\x80\x99s no way to run a health system. Our public health leaders would do far better to adopt the strategy used by one forward-thinking federal health official from the early 20th century, C. P. Wertenbaker of the Public Health and Marine-Hospital Service.'b'As smallpox raged across the American South, Wertenbaker journeyed to small communities and delivered speech after speech on vaccinations before swelling audiences of townsfolk, farmers and families. He listened and replied to people\xe2\x80\x99s fears. He told them about the horrors of smallpox. He candidly presented the latest scientific information about the benefits and risks of vaccination. And he urged his audiences to protect themselves and one another by taking the vaccine. By the time he was done, many of his listeners were already rolling up their sleeves.'b'America\xe2\x80\x99s public health leaders need to do the same, to reclaim the town square with a candid national conversation about the real risks of vaccines, which are minuscule compared with their benefits. Why waste another breath vilifying the antivaccination minority when steps can be taken to expand the pro-vaccine majority?'b'Obstetricians, midwives and pediatricians should present the facts about vaccines and the nasty diseases they prevent early and often to expectant parents. Health agencies should mobilize local parents\xe2\x80\x99 organizations to publicize, in realistic terms, the hazards that unvaccinated children can pose to everyone else in their communities. And health officials must redouble their efforts to harness the power of the Internet and spread the good word about vaccines.'b'You can bet that Wertenbaker would have done the same thing.'b'With Hu Jintao, China\xe2\x80\x99s president, currently visiting the United States, stories about growing Chinese economic might are everywhere. And those stories are entirely true: although China is still a poor country, it\xe2\x80\x99s growing fast, and given its sheer size it\xe2\x80\x99s well on the way to matching America as an economic superpower.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s also true, however, is that China has stumbled into a monetary muddle that\xe2\x80\x99s getting worse with each passing month. Furthermore, the Chinese government\xe2\x80\x99s response to the problem  \xe2\x80\x94  with policy seemingly paralyzed by deference to special interests, lack of intellectual clarity and a resort to blame games  \xe2\x80\x94  belies any notion that China\xe2\x80\x99s leaders can be counted on to act decisively and effectively. In fact, the Chinese come off looking like, well, us.'b'How bad will it get? Warnings from some analysts that China could trigger a global crisis seem overblown. But the fact that people are saying such things is an indication of how out of control the situation looks right now.'b'The root cause of China\xe2\x80\x99s muddle is its weak-currency policy, which is feeding an artificially large trade surplus. As I\xe2\x80\x99ve emphasized in the past, this policy hurts the rest of the world, increasing unemployment in many other countries, America included.'b'But a policy can be bad for us without being good for China. In fact, Chinese currency policy is a lose-lose proposition, simultaneously depressing employment here and producing an overheated, inflation-prone economy in China itself.'b'One way to think about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening is that inflation is the market\xe2\x80\x99s way of undoing currency manipulation. China has been using a weak currency to keep its wages and prices low in dollar terms; market forces have responded by pushing those wages and prices up, eroding that artificial competitive advantage. Some estimates I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard suggest that at current rates of inflation, Chinese undervaluation could be gone in two or three years  \xe2\x80\x94  not soon enough, but sooner than many expected.'b'China\xe2\x80\x99s leaders are, however, trying to prevent this outcome, not just to protect exporters\xe2\x80\x99 interest, but because inflation is even more unpopular in China than it is elsewhere. One big reason is that China already in effect exploits its citizens through financial repression (other kinds, too, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not relevant here). Interest rates on bank deposits are limited to just 2.75 percent, which is below the official inflation rate  \xe2\x80\x94  and it\xe2\x80\x99s widely believed that China\xe2\x80\x99s true inflation rate is substantially higher than its government admits.'b'Rapidly rising prices, even if matched by wage increases, will make this exploitation much worse. It\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder that the Chinese public is angry about inflation, and that China\xe2\x80\x99s leaders want to stop it.'b'But for whatever reason  \xe2\x80\x94  the power of export interests, refusal to do anything that looks like giving in to U.S. demands or sheer inability to think clearly  \xe2\x80\x94  they\xe2\x80\x99re not willing to deal with the root cause and let their currency rise. Instead, they are trying to control inflation by raising interest rates and restricting credit.'b'This is destructive from a global point of view: with much of the world economy still depressed, the last thing we need is major players pursuing tight-money policies. More to the point from China\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, however, is that it\xe2\x80\x99s not working. Credit limits are proving hard to enforce and are being further undermined by inflows of hot money from abroad.'b'With efforts to cool the economy falling short, China has been trying to limit inflation with price controls  \xe2\x80\x94  a policy that rarely works. In particular, it\xe2\x80\x99s a policy that failed dismally the last time it was tried here, during the Nixon administration. (And, yes, this means that right now China is going to Nixon.)'b'So what\xe2\x80\x99s left? Well, China has turned to the blame game, accusing the Federal Reserve (wrongly) of creating the problem by printing too much money. But while blaming the Fed may make Chinese leaders feel better, it won\xe2\x80\x99t change U.S. monetary policy, nor will it do anything to tame China\xe2\x80\x99s inflation monster.'b'Could all of this really turn into a full-fledged crisis? If I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know my economic history, I\xe2\x80\x99d find the idea implausible. After all, the solution to China\xe2\x80\x99s monetary muddle is both simple and obvious: just let the currency rise, already.'b'But I do know my economic history, which means that I know how often governments refuse, sometimes for many years, to do the obviously right thing  \xe2\x80\x94  and especially when currency values are concerned. Usually they try to keep their currencies artificially strong rather than artificially weak; but it can be a big mess either way.'b'So our newest economic superpower may indeed be on its way to some kind of economic crisis, with collateral damage to the world as a whole. Did we need this?'b'In the spring of 2008, John McCain asked Joe Lieberman to speak on his behalf at the Republican National Convention. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I look back, I wonder about it,\xe2\x80\x9d Lieberman now says. But it seemed the natural way to help the man he deemed most qualified to be president.'b'After Barack Obama won the election, the hammer came down. Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, told Lieberman that some Democrats wanted to strip him of his chairmanship of the homeland security committee. Lieberman, an independent, said if that happened then he might not be able to vote with the Democratic caucus.'b'The decisive meeting occurred during the transition period. President Obama opposed punishing Lieberman, as did Senators Reid, Schumer, Durbin, Dodd and Salazar. The entire caucus held a debate about Lieberman\xe2\x80\x99s future with Lieberman right there in the room. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ad hominem,\xe2\x80\x9d Lieberman recalled. \xe2\x80\x9cSome people said, \xe2\x80\x98We like you Joe. We just can\xe2\x80\x99t accept this behavior.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the end, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even close. Forty-two Democratic senators voted to let Lieberman keep his chairmanship. Thirteen voted against.'b'As Ezra Klein of The Washington Post 'b'noted recently'b', this turned out to be one of the most consequential decisions Obama and Reid made. If Lieberman had not been welcomed back by the Democrats, there might not have been a 60th vote for health care reform, and it would have failed.'b'There certainly would have been no victory for \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d repeal without Lieberman\xe2\x80\x99s tireless work and hawkish credentials. The Kerry-Lieberman climate bill came closer to passage than any other energy bill. Lieberman also provided crucial support or a swing vote for the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the stimulus bill, the banking bill, the unemployment extension and several other measures.'b'So while Lieberman is loathed by many liberal activists, he has always had much better relations with Democratic practitioners. Vice President Biden sent me a heartfelt e-mail on Thursday that ended: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Senate will not be the same without Joe\xe2\x80\x99s leadership and powerful intellect. But it is his civility that will be missed the most.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe was an integral part of the Democratic caucus,\xe2\x80\x9d Reid also wrote in an e-mail, \xe2\x80\x9cand his dedication to public service, ability to work across the aisle and broad range of experience will be missed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cJoe has been a terrific senator,\xe2\x80\x9d John Kerry said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s defined himself by his conscience and beliefs.\xe2\x80\x9d Kerry acknowledged that he has often been exasperated by Lieberman, but working relationships are more meaningful, Kerry continued, because of, not despite, fierce disagreements on other issues.'b'These policy makers are judging Lieberman by the criteria Max Weber called the \xe2\x80\x9cethic of responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 who will produce the best consequences. Some of the activists are judging him by what Weber called an \xe2\x80\x9cethic of intention\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 who has the purest and most uncompromising heart.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a theory going around that Lieberman was embittered by the trauma of 2006 when Democratic primary voters in Connecticut defeated him because of his support for the Iraq war. There\xe2\x80\x99s little evidence to validate this. Lieberman has always sat crossways between the two parties and has often served as a convenient bridge, infuriating Democrats, but then serving the party\xe2\x80\x99s interests at important moments.'b'Lieberman votes with the Democrats 90 percent of the time, but he has always been a Scoop Jackson Democrat who early on broke with his party on defense issues. In the 1990s, he challenged party orthodoxy on school choice, entitlement reform and the place of religion in public life.'b'But precisely because of these independent or hawkish credentials, he\xe2\x80\x99s been able to leap in at critical moments and deliver for the party in a way no other senator could. Long before there was an Obamacare debate or the \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d repeal, Lieberman played an important  role in saving Bill Clinton from impeachment. As momentum for impeachment was growing, Lieberman gave a crucial speech on the Senate floor that scolded Clinton for his behavior but resolutely opposed removing him from office.'b'As several senior people in the Clinton White House understood immediately, Lieberman\xe2\x80\x99s speech popped the boil \xe2\x80\x94 giving people a way to register anger, without calling for Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s removal.'b'The question is whether politicians with Lieberman\xe2\x80\x99s moderate and independent profile can survive in the current political climate. \xe2\x80\x9cI have more warm relationships with Democrats in Washington than in Connecticut,\xe2\x80\x9d Lieberman acknowledges.'b'It would be nice if voters made room for a few independents like this. There have been times, like during the health care debate, when I found Lieberman\xe2\x80\x99s independence befuddling and detached from any evident intellectual moorings. But, in general, he has shown a courageous independence of mind.'b'There are plenty of team players in government who do whatever the leader says. There are too few difficult members, who have complicated minds, unusual perspectives, the toughness to withstand the party-line barrages and a practical interest in producing results.'b'Congress outlawed many of the credit card industry\xe2\x80\x99s most abusive practices in 2009. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which regulates about 4,800 state-chartered banks, recently did the same thing with the debit card industry. The banks, which are predictably crying foul, should not be allowed to evade the rules by switching to a less rigorous federal regulator.'b'Congress set an excellent model with the credit card law. It required companies to give 45 days\xe2\x80\x99 notice before raising interest rates. Late charges and other penalties must be \xe2\x80\x9creasonable and proportional.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Federal Reserve, which oversees all banks, should have taken a similar approach to the huge overdraft penalties that banks can charge on debit cards. They can come to $35 a pop \xe2\x80\x94 several times per day \xe2\x80\x94 driving customers into debt for incidental purchases as minor as a magazine or a cup of coffee. An analysis issued last year by the Center for Responsible Lending found that it was \xe2\x80\x9ccommon policy among banks\xe2\x80\x9d to process the largest transactions first, regardless of when purchases were made, to increase overdrafts.'b'The Federal Reserve took a wholly inadequate step last year when it required banks to get people to opt in to the overdraft plan before charging them fees. Some banks use deceptive practices to do this. Moreover, they almost never explain how the system works or what it will cost. As a result, low-income debit card holders are still being exposed to predations from which credit card holders are protected.'b'The new F.D.I.C. rules require banks to clearly explain overdraft costs. Most important, if a customer is charged a fee for overdrawing his account more than 6 times in a 12-month period, the bank must offer a less costly alternative, like a reasonably priced line of credit or linking the card to a savings account.'b'These regulations will bring basic fairness to the system. But banks worry about profits, and some are threatening to change their charters so they can shop for a less rigorous regulator than the F.D.I.C.'b'A race to the regulatory bottom would be a disastrous idea. Anyone who doubts that should recall what happened when the bank\xe2\x80\x99s regulator of choice, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, failed to rein in reckless mortgage lending and actually blocked the states from doing the job.'b'The Federal Reserve should adopt the F.D.I.C.\xe2\x80\x99s rules. If it does not, the Bureau of Consumer Protection, which was created by Congress last year, should make fixing the debit card rules a top priority when it starts work in six months.'b'Tunisia\xe2\x80\x99s people have achieved something rare and inspiring. Through a month of grass-roots protests, they overthrew a dictator, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. At a crucial moment, the Tunisian Army leader, Gen. Rachid Ammar, ordered his troops not to fire on their own people and then resisted the temptation to seize power for himself.'b'The long-abused citizens of other Arab autocracies have taken heart. But Tunisia\xe2\x80\x99s achievement is not yet secure. Protests continue, and the unity government  has begun fracturing: four ministers have already quit over the continued prominence of old-regime loyalists.'b'Tunisians who risked their lives are right to be skeptical. But some old-guard figures may be necessary for a smooth transition to democracy. For 23 years, Mr. Ben Ali suppressed real opposition parties and doled out posts based on loyalty. There aren\xe2\x80\x99t many outsiders with the experience to keep the country going. But Ben Ali loyalists must not monopolize power.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s good that the holdovers have now resigned from the former ruling party, but more than new labels will be needed. The main challenge facing the transition government will be to organize truly free elections. All legitimate political forces \xe2\x80\x94 including leftists and Islamists who were outlawed and exiled \xe2\x80\x94 must be free to compete. Exiled politicians must have enough time to return, regroup and make their cases to the voters.'b'Tunisia\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution calls for a vote within 60 days. A consensus seems to be developing that six months would be more realistic. We think that is about right. A shorter interval gives too much advantage to the tame opposition parties. A longer one risks squandering Tunisians\xe2\x80\x99 hopes and could be far too tempting for another strongman to decide to stay on.'b'For too long, Washington uncritically embraced Mr. Ben Ali. The Obama administration has played America\xe2\x80\x99s limited cards wisely, applauding the \xe2\x80\x9ccourage and dignity\xe2\x80\x9d of the Tunisian people as the uprising gathered force. The United States needs to follow through with technical support to help organize voter rolls and monitor the election and modest economic help to get Tunisia\xe2\x80\x99s economy running again after weeks of disruption. The brave bid from Tunisians for a better, freer life must be nurtured.'b'If the Obama administration stays the course, the Environmental Protection Agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision last week to revoke a permit for one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s biggest mountaintop-removal mining projects could be the beginning of the end of a mining practice that has caused huge environmental harm across Appalachia.'b'The decision is a tribute to the agency, which faced fierce political opposition and a victory for the West Virginians who worked long and hard to block the mine. It should also be a warning to the mining industry that the days of getting its way, no matter the cost, are over.'b'The Spruce No. 1 Mine, owned by Arch Coal, would have required dynamiting the tops off mountains over an area of 2,278 acres to reach subsurface coal seams. The resulting rubble, known as spoil, would then be dumped into the valleys and streams below \xe2\x80\x94 ruining, by the E.P.A.\xe2\x80\x99s estimate, six miles of high-quality streams and causing \xe2\x80\x9cunacceptable\xe2\x80\x9d damage to the environment.'b'Thousands of miles of streams in Appalachia have already been poisoned in this manner in clear violation of the Clean Water Act.'b'The mine received a final permit from the Army Corps of Engineers in 2007. The E.P.A. has long had the power to veto such permits but has used it only once before. This decision provoked predictably outraged responses from industry and its political friends, including West Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s two Democratic senators, John Rockefeller IV and Joe Manchin III, a former governor.'b'The Clinton and Bush administrations gave the industry much of what it wanted, but President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s E.P.A. has raised the bar. First, it agreed to review existing permits, including the Spruce Mine; then it tightened standards for new permits by insisting on a more rigorous scientific analysis of a proposed mine\xe2\x80\x99s downstream impact on fish and other aquatic life.'b'Arch Coal has vowed a court fight, which Mr. Manchin says he will support. A far better use of their energies would be to find a less destructive way to mine coal.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'More Officials Quit in Tunisia Amid Protests'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 19):'b'I am optimistic about the future of Tunisia.

But earlier this week when Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced a proposal to install meters in livery cabs and 'b'permit them to pick up street hails'b' in areas of the city that see few yellow cabs, like Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Staten Island and Upper Manhattan, he managed to take a bad situation and make it worse. While it\xe2\x80\x99s true that those areas are flagrantly underserved by yellow cabs, the new rule would hurt the taxi industry more than it would help the public.'b'As things now stand, only yellow cabs can legally pick up street hails within the five boroughs, while livery cars can respond only to radio calls. Yellow cabs have meters, while liveries use a zone pricing system. It\xe2\x80\x99s worked this way since the medallion system was introduced in 1937. Nevertheless, livery cars have been snagging street hails illegally in all five boroughs for many years. Legalizing the practice would have little effect \xe2\x80\x94 except to hit yellow cab drivers in the wallet.'b'As I know from my own experience, working behind the wheel of a yellow cab is far from easy. What with traffic snarls, high prices for leasing a cab with a medallion, gas costs, fare beaters and credit card fees, it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to make ends meet. And on top of all that are the challenges posed by the livery drivers. I was routinely cursed at by these guys when I insisted on picking up passengers they were trying to poach. It was important to stick up for myself and to protect my domain \xe2\x80\x94 the street hail. Otherwise I\xe2\x80\x99d be going home poor at the end of each shift. In one instance I\xe2\x80\x99ll never forget, on Hudson Street in Greenwich Village, an angry car service driver pelted me with a handful of pennies through my open window.'b'Competition for street hails is now more cutthroat than ever, and every cabby has to struggle and strategize for every fare. Despite what most New Yorkers may think, outside of rush hour and weekend nights, cabbies spend most of their time cruising, looking hopefully for anyone with a hand up (which explains why, when you\xe2\x80\x99re merely waving to a friend, five cabs might skid to a stop in front of you).'b'As an unintended consequence of the new rule, the city could see an increase in fare refusals. The vast majority of street hails occur in Manhattan, so chances are that a cabby \xe2\x80\x94 who pays up to $150 per shift to lease his cab \xe2\x80\x94 won\xe2\x80\x99t ever want to leave that little island, since it means he usually has to double back without a passenger, a plight called \xe2\x80\x9cdeadheading.\xe2\x80\x9d By further lowering a yellow cab\xe2\x80\x99s odds of picking up a street hail in, say, Brooklyn or Queens, the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s new rule would only make drivers less willing to ever enter a bridge or tunnel.'b'And, still, the livery cabs that do ply the streets of Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have many passengers to pick up on the street, because these boroughs have relatively little pedestrian traffic. This is what led to the rise of the radio-dispatched livery industry in the first place. What works in busy Manhattan doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily work in the other boroughs.'b'Rather than legalize a practice that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t truly benefit the public, the mayor should make other, better changes in the way the wild and woolly livery car industry is regulated. Long accustomed to determining prices as they go, livery car drivers are notorious for price-gouging. A car service driver recently demanded that I pay $3 more than the normal fare for a trip within Brooklyn, because, he claimed, there was an extra fee for driving in snow. (There is no such thing.)'b'In a yellow cab, the meter ensures that no driver ever makes such a claim. Outfitting all of the city\xe2\x80\x99s for-hire vehicles with meters that run at the same rate would be one step in the right direction. It would at least prevent outer-borough passengers from being so brazenly cheated.'b'When he announced the proposed changes in the livery cab rules during his State of the City speech, Mayor Bloomberg emphasized \xe2\x80\x9csimplicity,\xe2\x80\x9d but in truth his fix for a relatively small problem would only further complicate an already messy industry. The proposed rule may be an effort to quiet all those post-blizzard complaints from the neglected outer boroughs. But unless the mayor is prepared to alter the very nature of the taxi industry, it\xe2\x80\x99s an empty gesture.'b'Congress really has been looking a little more civil. Not quite Athens in the age of Pericles, but it\xe2\x80\x99s very possible that this year we\xe2\x80\x99ll get through the State of the Union address without anybody jumping up to scream insults at the president.'b'Going for baby steps.'b'The Senate has had no comity issues whatsoever because everybody went home after a single meeting early this month under rules that require time to come to a halt. It\xe2\x80\x99s officially still the first day of the year in Harry Reid Land, demonstrating once again how closely the United States Senate resembles the second season of the original \xe2\x80\x9cStar Trek.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But the House has been busy. First, the members read the Constitution out loud, which gave us a welcome opportunity to recall the time last fall that John Boehner gave a speech in which he bragged that he carried the document everywhere, pulled it out of his pocket, waved it around, and then started to recite passages from the Declaration of Independence.'b'Then came the first bill of the year, which directed the Government Printing Office to stop producing hundreds of copies of bills and resolutions that people can just look up online.'b'It passed unanimously! Who says Republicans and Democrats can\xe2\x80\x99t work together? True, since the entire House printing budget is only about $7 million a year, this is not going to make much of an impact on the deficit. But trees will be saved, waste paper reduced and Washington parks will no longer be littered with fluttering resolutions commemorating National Frozen Food Day.'b'Good start, guys.'b'Then, of course, the new Republican majority took their symbolic vote to repeal the health care reform law. The debate really wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that bad. In a welcome break from the past, the Republicans refrained from claiming that God was personally rooting for the collapse of Obamacare. And while the Democrats said that people would die if the law was repealed, they did not suggest that this would make the Republicans happy.'b''b' I\xe2\x80\x99m picking up good vibrations ... ...'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9cI look forward to working with my friends not only on the right but also my colleagues on the left to craft a bill that\xe2\x80\x99s going to work for the American people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sean Duffy, a new Republican from Wisconsin. He is the one who used to be in the reality show \xe2\x80\x9cThe Real World.\xe2\x80\x9d He met his wife on another reality show, \xe2\x80\x9cRoad Rules All-Stars,\xe2\x80\x9d and they now have six children.'b'I believe Sean Duffy is the progenitor of a new breed of American politicians who will begin their careers by being chosen to live, on camera, with a bunch of strangers in a large apartment, or competing for valuable prizes on a remote island, or losing enormous amounts of weight on national television. Then they can announce their candidacy for Congress.'b'No longer will it be necessary to go to law school. Actually, Duffy did both, but he is like one of those cross-species babies in science-fiction movies who pave the way for a whole new life form.'b'When they weren\xe2\x80\x99t being polite to one another, the Democrats spent much of the debate time holding up pictures of seriously ill constituents who would lose their health coverage if the law went away, while Republicans made their victims out of small business.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI want to tell you about the owner of the Pizza Hut in Headland, Ala., who will be forced to close his doors due to the costs associated with this law,\xe2\x80\x9d warned Martha Roby, one of the freshmen who defeated an incumbent Democrat and, therefore, got special first-day positioning.'b'The new law\xe2\x80\x99s opponents don\xe2\x80\x99t generally say in so many words that they\xe2\x80\x99re fighting for employers\xe2\x80\x99 God-given right to refuse to provide health insurance for their workers. But that seems to be the bottom line.'b'The worst moment for the Democrats came when one of their own, Representative Steve Cohen of Tennessee, broke the march toward civil discourse by comparing the Republican talking points to Nazi propaganda. This was during a brief speech in which he also managed to work in the term \xe2\x80\x9cblood libel.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The only possible consolation for his fellow party members was that in this week\xe2\x80\x99s competition for worst remark by a politician, Cohen was pitted against the new governor of Alabama, who announced in his Martin Luther King Day speech that any constituent who had not accepted Jesus Christ as his savior was \xe2\x80\x9cnot my brother.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That would be worse, particularly if you were a Jew or a Muslim living in Birmingham.'b'But, all in all, not a bad record. Maybe civility will become a serious trend. Everything would be better. All the screaming heads would lose their cable TV shows to be replaced by a bunch of pleasant House members who can talk both about the issues, and their plans to appear on \xe2\x80\x9cSurvivor CCLV.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It was like reading fiction. Scott Stossel, in his book, \xe2\x80\x9cSarge: The Life and Times of Sargent Shriver,\xe2\x80\x9d described a harrowing World War II sea battle that erupted off Guadalcanal on the night of Nov. 14, 1942:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe foremast was hit. Electrical fires erupted continuously, all around Shriver. Whole gun crews were killed by flying shells. The ship began to slow down, and more Japanese rounds ripped across the deck, killing an officer in the radar plotting room. Three rounds exploded in another battle station, killing a half dozen more men. Steam lines were severed, and the hot, hissing steam scalded numerous sailors. Ladders between decks got knocked out, making putting out fires and attending to the growing scores of wounded much more difficult. Shriver himself was wounded when metal shrapnel from an explosion lodged itself in his shoulder, a wound for which he was later to be awarded a Purple Heart.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It was such a different time, an era when it was considered shameful for men to run and hide when their nation was at war. Now we send other people\xe2\x80\x99s children off to war willy-nilly, and the rest of us go shopping. (At least until someone steeped in the business philosophy of Neutron Jack Welch takes our jobs away.)'b'R. Sargent Shriver, one of America\xe2\x80\x99s great good men, died this week at the age of 95. He was best known as the brother-in-law of John F. Kennedy. Married for 56 years to Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s sister, Eunice, who died in 2009, he was also the father of Maria Shriver, the former television personality who is married to Arnold Schwarzenegger. That Mr. Shriver was not better known for his own extraordinary accomplishments, and for his rock-solid commitment to the ideals that this nation ought to stand for, is not just unfortunate, but discouraging.'b'He was the founding director of the Peace Corps, the signature success of Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s New Frontier. He founded Head Start, created the Job Corps and Legal Services for the Poor, and gave us Volunteers in Service to America, which was the domestic version of the Peace Corps. He served as president and chairman of the Special Olympics, which was founded by Eunice Shriver. Indefatigable and unrepentantly idealistic, Mr. Shriver may have directly affected more people in a positive way than any American since Franklin Delano Roosevelt.'b'He was the flip side of the cruelty and ugliness that has come to dominate so much of American public life. The U.S. has once again fallen into the hands of the forces who, rather than trying to help, would relieve the middle class and the poor of every last shred of economic security. Not only have millions been thrown out of work, but the squeeze is on to prevent them from getting the safety net assistance that might cushion the awful blow of joblessness.'b'Public services are being dismantled throughout the republic in the name of austerity  \xe2\x80\x94  school systems, libraries, police forces, transportation services, and so on. Any talk of raising taxes on the rich is verboten. Shared sacrifice? Not if you\xe2\x80\x99re wealthy.'b'Sargent Shriver had a different view of America  \xe2\x80\x94  warmer, richer and more humane. A young Bill Moyers, who joined Mr. Shriver at the Peace Corps and eventually became its deputy director, said a crucial component of the corps was Mr. Shriver\xe2\x80\x99s deep commitment to the idea of America \xe2\x80\x9cas a social enterprise ... of caring and cooperative people.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s an example: In 1964, as leader of the Office of Economic Opportunity in the Johnson administration, Mr. Shriver came across studies that showed connections between poor nutrition, lower I.Q. scores and arrested social and emotional development. He wondered whether early childhood intervention \xe2\x80\x9ccould have a beneficial effect on the children of poor people.\xe2\x80\x9d Head Start followed in incredibly short order.'b'Mr. Shriver was the point man, the driving force of Lyndon Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s war on poverty. Between 1964 and 1968, nearly one of every three poor Americans left the poverty rolls, the largest drop in a four-year period ever recorded. Mr. Shriver\xe2\x80\x99s idealism was not of the dreamy sort. It was geared toward concrete results.'b'He was also a fighter for the rights and dignity of black people and other ethnic minorities. It was Mr. Shriver who suggested that John Kennedy, during his campaign for the presidency, make a phone call to Coretta Scott King, expressing his concern and offering assistance at a time when her husband, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., had been sentenced to a four-month prison term at hard labor for a bogus traffic-related arrest in Georgia.'b'Real courage, idealism, a commitment to service and a willingness to sacrifice  \xe2\x80\x94  Sargent Shriver had all of that and more. In an interview several years ago, he told me, \xe2\x80\x9cWe made an effort during that time to find out what was true, and what was needed by way of improvement.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'President Obama is under renewed pressure from his base to demonstrate that he is, indeed, a principled man of unwavering conviction rather than a pliant political reed willingly bent and bowed by ever-shifting winds.'b'This time the issue is gun control.'b'Pre-presidency, Obama had been 'b'a strong supporter'b' of gun-control initiatives. Since then, however, he has remained curiously quiet on the issue in general and following the Tucson shooting in particular.'b'The question now is: which Obama will show up at the State of the Union?'b'Obama, the politician, must be hesitant. He\xe2\x80\x99s enjoying 'b'a surge'b' 'b'in the polls'b' following a successful lame-duck session of Congress in which a few concessions bought substantial gains. And his handling of the shooting seemed to strike the right balance with 'b'the overwhelming majority'b' of Americans. He\xe2\x80\x99s on a roll!'b'Furthermore, according to 'b'a 2005 Gallup poll'b', gun owners are almost twice as likely to be white as nonwhite, are more than three times as likely to be male as female and are more likely to live in the South and Midwest than in the East or West. Yes, you guessed it: This fits the profile of the voters Obama has lost and needs to win back if he wants to be re-elected.'b'And no one wants to upset the powerful gun-rights lobby, whose campaign-finance clout dwarfs that of the gun-control lobby. According to data from the nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog group the Center for Responsive Politics, 'b'the gun-rights lobby'b' has contributed more than $24 million in election cycles from 1990 to 2010. About 85 percent went to Republicans. By comparison, 'b'the gun-control lobby'b' donated less than $2 million in the same period, mostly to Democrats.'b'That said, Obama the gun-control supporter surely knows how anomalous we are among comparable nations. We are a violent society whose intense fealty to firearms has deadly consequences. Sensible restrictions on the most dangerous weapons could go a long way toward making us safer.'b'According to 2005 data from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, a comparison of member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development for which data were available showed that the U.S. is in a league of its own, and not in a good way. We have nearly 9 guns for every 10 people, and about 9 out of every 10 of our homicides are committed with one of those guns. No other country even comes close.'b'At the moment, there is popular support for more restrictions. According to 'b'a NBC/Wall Street Journal survey'b', 52 percent of Americans asked believed that laws covering the sale of guns should be made more strict. Will Obama seize the sentiment? This is a test of character: Will the president choose what is right over what is convenient and speak out for what he believes in?'b'Next week we will see which Obama emerges: a stalwart of conviction, an exemplar of expediency or someone still stuck in the ambiguous middle of conciliation and pseudocourage.'b'In the mid-1970s, New York City was in such deep financial trouble that the state basically took charge. Albany\xe2\x80\x99s lawmakers mandated important reforms, including modernizing the city budget system so that it is clear, transparent and professional. They decided against such changes for their own operations, which helps explain why the state is now the one in big trouble.'b'Mayor Michael Bloomberg wants Albany to return control to the city. In Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s State of the City address, he told lawmakers that it was time to \xe2\x80\x9clet us manage ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d Given the city\xe2\x80\x99s clear progress, and Albany\xe2\x80\x99s clear failings, that makes sense to us.'b'Mr. Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s No. 1 priority this year is pension reform, including restoring the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s power to negotiate pensions for city workers.'b'The way it works now, the mayor negotiates with a union on salaries, health benefits and work rules. But the State Legislature \xe2\x80\x94 ever willing to pander to powerful union leaders \xe2\x80\x94 negotiates pensions, one of the city\xe2\x80\x99s biggest long-term obligations. The city\xe2\x80\x99s pension costs have jumped from $1.5 billion in 2001 to $7 billion this year. Mr. Bloomberg rightly argues that the city can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to go on this way.'b'The mayor cannot renegotiate current pension deals, but he wants to stop paying holiday bonuses of $12,000 each year to police and fire retirees at a cost of $200 million per year. He is mainly focusing on pensions for new, nonuniformed employees. Mainly, he wants to push the retirement age from 55 or 57 years to 65 as a first step. The unions are already pushing back. But the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s proposal is closer to what happens in the private sector and counts as a good start on future savings.'b'Mr. Bloomberg has made clear that he won\xe2\x80\x99t wait for Albany. He has threatened layoffs. And, in the speech, he vowed that \xe2\x80\x9cI will not sign a contract with salary increases unless they are accompanied by reforms in benefit packages that produce the savings we need.\xe2\x80\x9d That has a better chance of working if Gov. Andrew Cuomo vows to veto any sweeteners passed by the Legislature after those negotiations.'b'The mayor also wants the city to administer its own tax collection. Right now it pays the state more than $80 million annually to do it. He wants to be freed of state procurement rules and shed some of the state\xe2\x80\x99s costly and byzantine civil service rules. Albany has demonstrated time and again that it can\xe2\x80\x99t run its own business. It is time to let New York City take care of itself.'b'After months of rancor, China is suddenly talking up cooperation on North Korea, the economy, and other difficult issues. There are several possible explanations for the change in tone \xe2\x80\x94 and, we hope \xe2\x80\x94 substance.'b'Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s bullying has alienated pretty much everyone out there, and China\xe2\x80\x99s leaders may have finally figured that out. The Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s recent tough talk, coupled with President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s pomp-filled welcome this week of President Hu Jintao, were also clear reminders of the cost of alienating the United States and the benefits of getting along.'b'Mr. Hu appeared eager to make his American hosts happy, pledging to work to resolve differences over market access and the protection of intellectual property. He also came bearing gifts. The White House announced $45 billion worth of American export deals to China, which it said would support 235,000 jobs. Many of these deals had been reached as far back as three years ago, but Mr. Hu and Mr. Obama were eager to claim credit.'b'It is too early to know how far China is really prepared to go, but Mr. Hu made several potentially significant concessions. He said the country would now audit government agencies\xe2\x80\x99 software purchases and publish their results in an attempt to end their widespread use of pirated software. And he signaled that his government is willing to temper the most controversial aspects of its \xe2\x80\x9cindigenous innovation\xe2\x80\x9d plan to favor domestic companies in government procurement deals.'b'The plan, as initially conceived, only allowed Chinese state entities to buy certain technology products if their patents were developed and registered in China, excluding foreign suppliers. According to the White House, China dropped the registration requirement and agreed government procurement would not be based \xe2\x80\x9con where the goods\xe2\x80\x99 or services\xe2\x80\x99 intellectual property is developed or maintained,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cthere will be no discrimination against innovative products made by foreign suppliers operating in China.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If these policies change, it could defuse some of the biggest sources of tension in the growing economic relations between China and the United States.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s even a modicum of good news on China\xe2\x80\x99s artificially cheap currency, the renminbi. Beijing has made a lot of promises, but is still refusing to let the renminbi rise by much. But higher Chinese inflation means that \xe2\x80\x94 in real terms \xe2\x80\x94 it is appreciating at a rate of about 10 percent a year, which is helping American exports.'b'President Hu was also more accommodating than usual on North Korea and publicly acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9ca lot still needs to be done in China in terms of human rights.\xe2\x80\x9d On both those issues, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take verify over trust. Mr. Hu could start by releasing Liu Xiaobo, the pro-democracy activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner.'b'At Washington\xe2\x80\x99s urging, China finally expressed concern over North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s recently unveiled uranium enrichment plant. It still has not denounced North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s torpedoing of a South Korean warship. As the North\xe2\x80\x99s main supplier of fuel and food, China may be the only country that can rein in Pyongyang. American officials said that, in private talks, Mr. Hu agreed to try \xe2\x80\x94 but only after Mr. Obama warned that the United States may have to redeploy its military forces in Asia to protect itself from the North\xe2\x80\x99s belligerence.'b'It is far too early to assume that the Chinese government has decided to turn a new strategic leaf. But it is clearly taking a second look at things. Regular contact is essential. Cajoling and flattery may also help. The lesson of the last few months is that they need to be backed up with regular, firm pushes in the right direction.'b'The final report from the presidential commission investigating the gulf oil spill rightly warns that government regulation alone can\xe2\x80\x99t prevent another such disaster. The blowout reflected industrywide weaknesses, not just BP\xe2\x80\x99s, it said. And what is needed is a \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental transformation\xe2\x80\x9d of industry practices putting a far higher premium on safety.'b'Among its proposed reforms, the commission is urging the oil industry to create a nonprofit safety institute to share best practices \xe2\x80\x94 and to bring pressure on individual companies known to cut corners. The nuclear industry set up one after the Three Mile Island disaster in 1979, and it has done its job well.'b'Bob Graham, a co-chairman of the committee, noted recently that other oil companies had been aware of BP\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cvulnerability\xe2\x80\x9d to accidents but \xe2\x80\x9chad no mechanism to deal with it.\xe2\x80\x9d That may be a charitable way of describing corporate indifference; in any case, an institute would provide such a mechanism while, one can hope, elevating the notion of safety as a collective responsibility.'b'So far, industry hasn\xe2\x80\x99t said much about the commission\xe2\x80\x99s report beyond the usual corporate-speak about the need to operate in \xe2\x80\x9can environmentally sound manner.\xe2\x80\x9d Its main lobbying group, the American Petroleum Institute, appears determined to stick to business as usual.'b'Its first reaction to the report was to complain that nobody had given it credit for developing its own set of safety regulations years ago. It has also suggested that \xe2\x80\x94 with just a few improvements \xe2\x80\x94 the oil companies could safely begin exploring previously off-limits areas in the Atlantic and eastern Gulf of Mexico.'b'The commission came down hard on the institute, arguing that the group\xe2\x80\x99s ability to serve as an advocate for drilling safety is compromised by its lobbying role and that it has long resisted federal rules whenever they threatened to make operations more costly.'b'There are some reforms only Congress can make, like raising the liability limits for spills. The White House, which could not pry an oil spill bill from a Democratic Senate, will have to work even harder now that Republicans control the House.'b'Yet industry\xe2\x80\x99s role is crucial. To earn the privilege to drill for oil in public waters, it must engage in what the commission calls an \xe2\x80\x9cinternal reinvention.\xe2\x80\x9d Months after the gulf disaster, there are few signs that the oil companies or their lobbyists get it.'b'In Batavia, Ill. \xe2\x80\x94 just west of Chicago \xe2\x80\x94 you can walk along trails through a thousand-acre restored prairie filled with rare species like compass plant and rattlesnake master. From the edge of the prairie, you can see, as well, a four-mile ring of concrete and steel. That is the berm above the Tevatron, a high-energy subterranean racetrack for particle beams and the heart of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, or Fermilab.'b'Since 1983, scientists have been using the Tevatron to create spectacular collisions between subatomic particles whose ghostly traces have helped reveal the fundamental constituents of matter, like the top quark, discovered in 1995. The Department of Energy, which runs Fermilab, has now announced that for budgetary reasons it will be shutting down the Tevatron, which costs about $50 million a year to run, in late 2011.'b'The Tevatron has been superseded by the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva, which is designed to operate at energies up to seven times higher. The two colliders have been in a race to find unequivocal evidence of the Higgs boson, a hypothetical elementary particle whose existence would help clarify and confirm the current theory of particle physics.'b'There are about 1,200 physicists doing experiments at the Tevatron, and many think shutting it down is a bad idea, especially given the problems with the Large Hadron Collider. It is currently working at half its potential energy level and is scheduled to shut down for repair and upgrades in 2012.'b'Physics is an international pursuit. Fermilab is home to physicists from all over the world, and other experiments will still take place there, as will work with the Large Hadron Collider. Yet it\xe2\x80\x99s lamentable to see the end of an era of high-energy particle experiments in America that defined the threshold of our understanding of matter.'b'To the Editor:'b'Bob Herbert is to be commended for highlighting the need for legislation to reduce the risk of further tragedies from handguns in this country (\xe2\x80\x9c'b'Helpless in the Face of Madness'b',\xe2\x80\x9d column, Jan. 15).'b'I spent more than 30 years in the Foreign Service.

But the latest \xe2\x80\x9cTrue Grit\xe2\x80\x9d juggernaut also has something to say about  Americans yearning at a trying juncture in our history  \xe2\x80\x94  much as it did the first time around.'b'The original film opened at Radio City Music Hall on July 3, 1969, the same day that antiwar protestors incited a melee at the adjoining Rockefeller Center, shutting down Fifth Avenue. In that climate, the movie\xe2\x80\x99s success was hardly foreordained. The previous year, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Green Berets,\xe2\x80\x9d Wayne\xe2\x80\x99s jingoistic Vietnam potboiler, had divided audiences, been ridiculed by the press  and shunned by the Oscars. The Western, like the war movie, was seen as a dying genre, usurped by darker and ever more violent takes on frontier mythology like the 1967 \xe2\x80\x9cBonnie and Clyde\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wild Bunch,\xe2\x80\x9d which opened just a week before \xe2\x80\x9cTrue Grit.\xe2\x80\x9d July of \xe2\x80\x9969 would also bring \xe2\x80\x9cEasy Rider,\xe2\x80\x9d the iconic \xe2\x80\x9960s dope-and-biker movie in which Dennis Hopper, who played a villain in \xe2\x80\x9cTrue Grit,\xe2\x80\x9d would reinvent himself as an era\xe2\x80\x99s archetypal cultural antihero. The \xe2\x80\x9cEasy Rider\xe2\x80\x9d ad copy ran: \xe2\x80\x9cA man went looking for America. And couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find it anywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Such was the dyspeptic mood of a nation deep into a fruitless war and a year after a summer of assassinations and riots. Yet \xe2\x80\x9cTrue Grit\xe2\x80\x9d was warmly received, including by the Times critic, Vincent Canby, who put it in a year-end list of bests dominated by such antiestablishment fare as \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wild Bunch,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cEasy Rider,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMidnight Cowboy\xe2\x80\x9d (that year\xe2\x80\x99s Best Picture Oscar winner) and the ultimate anti-Western, Andy Warhol\xe2\x80\x99s sexually transgressive \xe2\x80\x9cLonesome Cowboys.\xe2\x80\x9d Canby described \xe2\x80\x9cTrue Grit\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9ca classic frontier fable that manages to be most entertaining even when it\xe2\x80\x99s being most reactionary.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He was right. Its story and themes could hardly have been more retro. A 14-year-old girl from Yell County, Ark., named Mattie Ross hires Rooster to help track down an outlaw who  murdered both her father and a Texas state senator before fleeing into Choctaw territory. Though Mattie is a stickler for the law, she\xe2\x80\x99s not averse to frontier justice if that\xe2\x80\x99s required to avenge her dad. But to the grizzled old Rooster\xe2\x80\x99s dismay, the girl insists on joining him on the trail to make sure the job gets done.'b'Like classic Hollywood Westerns before it, \xe2\x80\x9cTrue Grit\xe2\x80\x9d in all its iterations has an elegiac lilt. Uncivilized hired guns like Rooster may have helped tame the West and dispatched bad guys, but they were also capable of lawlessness and atrocities. As a young Confederate soldier, Rooster had joined in the 1863 Lawrence, Kan., massacre. Ultimately, law, religion and domestic institutions like marriage  \xe2\x80\x94  which Rooster failed at   \xe2\x80\x94 had to prevail if America was to grow up. The Matties had to outlive the Roosters. And so they did. For a weary mainstream 1969 audience, and not just a reactionary one, the restoration of order in \xe2\x80\x9cTrue Grit,\xe2\x80\x9d inevitably to be followed by Rooster\xe2\x80\x99s ride off into the sunset, was a heartening two-hour escape from the near-civil-war raging beyond the theater\xe2\x80\x99s walls.'b'In 2010, expectations for the new \xe2\x80\x9cTrue Grit\xe2\x80\x9d may have been lower than they were for the first. The Western has once again been written off as an endangered species. The Coens\xe2\x80\x99 critically admired filmmaking has never generated blockbuster box office. An added  indignity was 'b'the complete shutout'b' of \xe2\x80\x9cTrue Grit\xe2\x80\x9d from Golden Globe nominations  \xe2\x80\x94  a measure of a movie\xe2\x80\x99s advance buzz, if nothing else.'b'Nonetheless, it is already 'b'the biggest draw of any Coen brothers film'b' \xe2\x80\x94  poised to 'b'at least double'b' the business of \xe2\x80\x9c'b'No Country for Old Men'b',\xe2\x80\x9d their biggest previous hit. Revealingly, I think, it is attracting 'b'an even larger audience than \xe2\x80\x9cThe Social Network,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' a movie of equal quality with reviews to match and more timely cultural cachet. It turns out that \xe2\x80\x9cTrue Grit\xe2\x80\x9d is as much an escape for Americans now as it was in the Vietnam era.'b'Our age  is hardly identical to that one, whatever the resonances between the Afghanistan and Vietnam wars, and whatever our own bouts of domestic violence. The new \xe2\x80\x9cTrue Grit\xe2\x80\x9d took off before the Tucson cataclysm in any event, and the movie\xe2\x80\x99s broad appeal, like the demographics of its audience, transcends our running right-left debate. What is most stirring about \xe2\x80\x9cTrue Grit\xe2\x80\x9d today  \xe2\x80\x94  besides the primal father-daughter relationship that blossoms between Rooster and Mattie  \xe2\x80\x94  is its unalloyed faith in values antithetical to those of the 21st century America so deftly skewered, as it happens, in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Social Network.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At its core, the new \xe2\x80\x9cTrue Grit\xe2\x80\x9d is often surprisingly similar to the first, despite the clashing sensibilities of their directors (Henry Hathaway, a studio utility man, did the original) and the casting of an age-appropriate Mattie (Hailee Steinfeld) in lieu of the 21-year-old Kim Darby of 1969. But what leaps out this time, to the point of seeming fresh, is the fierce loyalty of the principal characters to each other (the third being a vain Texas Ranger, played by Matt Damon) and their clear-cut sense of morality and justice, even when the justice is rough. More than the first \xe2\x80\x9cTrue Grit,\xe2\x80\x9d the new one emphasizes Mattie\xe2\x80\x99s precocious, almost obsessive preoccupation with the law. She is forever citing law-book principles, invoking lawyers and affidavits, and threatening to go to court. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must pay for everything in this world one way or another,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'says Mattie'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing free except the grace of God.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That kind of legal and moral cost-accounting seems as distant as a tintype now. The new \xe2\x80\x9cTrue Grit\xe2\x80\x9d lands in an America that\xe2\x80\x99s still not recovered from a crash where many of the  reckless perpetrators of  economic mayhem deflected any accountability and merely moved on to the next bubble, gamble or ethically dubious backroom deal. When Americans think of the law these days, they often think of a system that can easily be gamed by the rich and the powerful, starting with  those who pillaged Lehman Brothers, A.I.G. and Citigroup and left taxpayers, shareholders and pensioners in the dust. A virtuous soul like Mattie would be crushed in a contemporary gold rush even if (or especially if) she fought back with the kind of civil action so prized by the 19th-century Mattie.'b'Talk about Two Americas. Look at \xe2\x80\x9cThe Social Network\xe2\x80\x9d again after seeing \xe2\x80\x9cTrue Grit,\xe2\x80\x9d and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see two different civilizations, as far removed from each other in ethos as Silicon Valley and Monument Valley. While \xe2\x80\x9cSocial Network\xe2\x80\x9d fictionalizes Mark Zuckerberg, it mines the truth of an era  \xe2\x80\x94  from the ability of the powerful and privileged to manipulate the  system to the collapse of loyalty as a prized American virtue at the top of that economic pyramid.'b'In contrast to Mattie\xe2\x80\x99s dictum, no one has to pay for any transgression in the world it depicts. Zuckerberg\xe2\x80\x99s antagonists, Harvard classmates who accuse him of intellectual theft, and his allies, exemplified by a predatory venture capitalist, sometimes seem more entitled and ruthless than he is. The blackest joke in Aaron Sorkin\xe2\x80\x99s priceless script is that Lawrence Summers, a Harvard president who would later moonlight as a hedge fund consultant, might intervene to arbitrate any ethical conflicts. You almost wish  Rooster were around to get the job done.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Social Network\xe2\x80\x9d is nothing if not the true sequel to \xe2\x80\x9cWall Street.\xe2\x80\x9d The director, David Fincher (no less brilliant than the Coens), makes the atmosphere almost as murky and poisonous as that of his serial killer movies, \xe2\x80\x9cSeven\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cZodiac.\xe2\x80\x9d In \xe2\x80\x9cSocial Network,\xe2\x80\x9d the landscape is  Cambridge, Mass., but we might as well be in the pre-civilized Wild West. Instead of thieves bearing guns, we have thieves bearing depositions. Instead of actual assassinations, we have character assassinations by blog post. In place of an honorable social code, we have a social network presided over by a post-adolescent billionaire 'b'whose business card reads'b' \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m CEO  ... Bitch!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This hits too close to home. No one should have been surprised that those looking for another America once again have been finding it in \xe2\x80\x9cTrue Grit.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It is widely believed in Washington that there is no chance the gun lobby and the new Republican majority in the House would ever permit passage of the modest ideas for tightening America\xe2\x80\x99s absurdly lax gun laws that have surfaced since the massacre in Tucson.'b'That may be true, but it is no reason for supporters of reasonable gun regulation not to put up a fight. Nor is it an excuse for the lack of principled presidential leadership on this issue. We are still waiting for President Obama to fulfill his promises on gun safety.'b'Mr. Obama ran for the White House calling for the restoration of the ban on assault weapons that Congress irresponsibly let expire in 2004. He has not pursued that goal, and so far, his voice is missing even from the call for less ambitious but necessary changes in gun laws. The country needs Mr. Obama to put his support behind a two-pronged approach that is directly relevant to the dynamics of gun violence we all saw at play in Tucson.'b'It begins with a proposed ban on the big volume ammunition magazines that added to the carnage not just in Arizona but also a long line of other mass shootings, including at Columbine High School and Virginia Tech. Even former Vice President Dick Cheney, a staunch gun rights advocate, said last week that it might be time to reinstate the magazine-size rule, which was part of the discarded assault weapons ban. That would save lives without interfering with hunters or violating any constitutional right.'b'Mr. Obama ought to tell that to Congress and the public in his State of the Union address this week. The National Rifle Association will counter that Americans need high-capacity clips for self-defense. We\xe2\x80\x99d like to hear how many times in the real world the life of an American, other than a police officer or a combat soldier, was endangered because of an inability to fire 30 shots in rapid succession without reloading. What we do know about is the grim, repetitive reality of mass shootings.'b'The pending gun agenda also includes plugging dangerous holes in the background check system to make it harder for people with emotional and drug abuse problems, like the Tucson shooter, to obtain weapons. Despite eroding public support for more strict rules, like a handgun ban, there is broad agreement on the need to keep guns from getting into the wrong hands.'b'Although facing a likely primary challenge from the right when he runs for re-election next year, Senator Richard Lugar, Republican of Indiana, voiced his continued support for banning assault weapons in a recent interview with Bloomberg News.'b'Another Republican, Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, opposes banning the enlarged magazines. But  on \xe2\x80\x9cMeet the Press\xe2\x80\x9d last Sunday, Mr. Coburn expressed an interest in a bipartisan effort to create a new legal standard to \xe2\x80\x9cmake sure people who are mentally ill cannot get and use a gun.\xe2\x80\x9d His interest in finding common ground is encouraging even though for the moment, at least, the fix is unclear.'b'One thing that could be usefully addressed is that many state records on disqualifying involuntary commitments and adjudicated mental instability are not being submitted to the federal background check system. Records of drug abuse or addiction also rarely make it into the system, according to Mayors Against Illegal Guns, Mayor Michael Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s gun policy group.'b'Asked last week about the administration\xe2\x80\x99s positions on these matters, Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said the White House was focused on \xe2\x80\x9cthe important healing process.\xe2\x80\x9d That is part of the president\xe2\x80\x99s duties. So is protecting public safety.'b'If the federal government is going to end homelessness among veterans in five years, as Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki has vowed to do, then it will have to find a way to help the hard cases. These are the long-term street people \xe2\x80\x94 men mostly, many fragile in mind or body, often addicted to alcohol or drugs. They shuttle from shelter to street to emergency room, burning up caregivers\xe2\x80\x99 energy and social-service dollars.'b'A new program in Los Angeles seeks to break that cycle for a small number of the most troubled veterans using a strategy known as \xe2\x80\x9chousing first.\xe2\x80\x9d This approach, which has been successfully used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for nearly a decade, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t wait for people to sober up or get a job before they are given a place to stay. A permanent home, provided through a Section 8 voucher, instead becomes the anchor that makes all the rest possible: addiction services, therapy, sobriety, a steady job.'b'Critics worry that the vouchers come with no strings attached, so the incentive for positive change disappears. The numbers tell a different story. Federal officials reported a 30 percent drop in homelessness from 2005 to 2007, crediting the \xe2\x80\x9chousing first\xe2\x80\x9d programs. But the downturn has since hit hard, and new crops of soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan are returning to a brutal job market. Veterans currently make up an estimated 13 percent of the people in America\xe2\x80\x99s shelters. There are believed to be more than 17,000 homeless veterans in Los Angeles County alone.'b'Despite the size of the problem, there is nowhere near enough money these days for ambitious programs. The Senate adjourned last year without passing a bill to increase V.A. financing for homeless services by $50 million a year. Advocates are promising to be creative and keep trying.'b'The Los Angeles pilot, called Vets to Home Project 60, for the 60 people it aims to help over the next two years, comes with no new funds, just new coordination among Veterans Affairs, Los Angeles County and several small nonprofit organizations. Organizers say that this is the first time these agencies have worked together this way toward one focused goal. We hope it works, and proves worthy of rolling out nationwide to meet the great unmet need.'b'In the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 thumbs up-or-down version of lawmaking, the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, is targeting for extinction the publicly subsidized presidential campaign finance system adopted in the wake of the Watergate scandals.'b'Mr. Cantor wants to kill off the program \xe2\x80\x94 rather than update its limits to meet the costs of modern campaigns. He says it is necessary for budget cutting. We suspect his real motive is to give an even bigger voice to big-money contributors in presidential campaigns.'b'The majority leader has made a show of soliciting taxpayer gripes on his blog and presenting them directly on the floor, as if he were the M.C. of a dance marathon. He appears determined to bypass the House\xe2\x80\x99s entire committee hearing system, just as the Republicans did last week when they voted to repeal the nation\xe2\x80\x99s new health care law. Why bother to review and refine?'b'President Obama should be the first politician to object. He was, regrettably, the first presidential nominee to entirely forgo the public subsidy system in favor of a bonanza in small-dollar Internet donations. Mr. Obama argued that he had no choice since the finance system was \xe2\x80\x9cbroken,\xe2\x80\x9d but he also vowed to fight for its repair.'b'The time for that fight is at hand. There are good proposals to update the subsidy formulas and take into account the virtue of small-dollar donors attracted via the Internet. A workable system is all the more necessary now that politics is plunging deeper into unlimited, secretive campaign donations after the Supreme Court gutted decades of sensible controls.'b'Killing a system that helped hold down campaign spending and defend the nation against the buying and selling of political office is the last thing that should be on the agenda of the new House majority.'b'In Commack, on Long Island, a little graveyard lies surrounded by chain-link fence and buried in snow. Inside are nine headstones, some from the 1800s, many cracked and tilted, under spindly trees. 'b'Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight, and all the air a solemn stillness holds \xe2\x80\x94 'b'save where the orange work cart clatters by, laden with Sheetrock and tubs of joint compound.'b'This is the Burr family cemetery, deep in the suburbs east of New York City, and right in the middle of a Home Depot parking lot, hard by Modell\xe2\x80\x99s, Famous Footwear, Old Navy and Staples. Once Indians roamed pleasant woods here, then it was farmland, property of the well-to-do Burrs, who came from England in 1630. They tilled the soil, ran a hotel, bred horses and buried their dead near the corner of Larkfield Road and Jericho Turnpike.'b'Then the suburbs filled in. If you asked for directions to the fabled hole in the suburban soul, you might end up here, where the emptiness has been wrapped in the tightest gauze of retail. How good, then, to find wrinkles in time that crack the asphalt\xe2\x80\x99s smoothness, places where a few human dead have resisted the insult of being paved over and forgotten.'b'Web searches turn up such stranded graveyards 'b'all over the country'b' \xe2\x80\x94 Oklahoma, Georgia, Tennessee.

The content of advertising does not dictate how or where we present the news.'b'There are exceptions, of course. If an ad for Brand X is on the same page as a story about Brand X, we will make an effort to move one of them. But the certainty of that happening is dependent on a number of factors: the flow of news that day, the geometry of the page and the advertisement, and even the size of the paper (which has an impact on where color pages fall).'b'The determining factor in the story placement is where it best serves readers: Is a story in the section where it belongs? If it runs with a related story, is there room for both? Is there enough space for a photograph that goes with the story?

To put it bluntly, the basic business proposition is a stark conflict of purposes.'b'For this reason, newspaper managements (including The Times\xe2\x80\x99s) recognize the need to keep the news department and advertising department separate, and even limit communication between the two.

(I have just finished reading 'b'a post by Stanley Fish'b' in which he links to Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s page for Martha Nussbaum\xe2\x80\x99s new book. Paul Krugman also does this frequently on his blog.) By automatically linking to Amazon, The Times is favoring one retailer of books over all others. I own an independent bookstore, and you are sending business to our competition for no reason having to do with journalism.'b'These links are not purely informational, they are commercial; if you want purely informational links, they are available at publishers\xe2\x80\x99 Web sites.

But before we envision a new Middle East remade in the manner of Europe 1989, it is worth cataloguing the pivotal ways in which Tunisia is unique.'b'Start with a map of classical antiquity, which shows a concentration of settlements where Tunisia is today, juxtaposed with  the relative emptiness that characterizes modern-day Algeria and Libya. Jutting out into  the Mediterranean close to Sicily, Tunisia has been the hub of North Africa not only under the Carthaginians and Romans, but under the Vandals, Byzantines, medieval Arabs and Turks. Whereas Algeria and Libya were but vague geographical expressions until the coming of European colonial map makers, Tunisia is an age-old cluster of civilization.'b'Even today, many of the roads in the country, particularly in the north, were originally Roman ones. For 2,000 years, the closer to Carthage (roughly the site of Tunis, the capital, today), the greater the level of development. Because urbanization in Tunisia started two millenniums ago, tribal identity based on nomadism \xe2\x80\x94 which, as the medieval historian Ibn Khaldun says, has always disrupted political stability \xe2\x80\x94 is correspondingly weak.'b'After the Roman general Scipio defeated Hannibal in 202 B.C. outside modern-day Tunis, he dug a demarcation ditch, or fossa regia, that marked the extent of civilized territory. The fossa regia remains relevant. Still visible in places, it runs from Tabarka on Tunisia\xe2\x80\x99s northwestern coast southward, and then turns directly eastward to Sfax, another Mediterranean port. The towns beyond that line have fewer Roman remains, and today tend to be poorer and less developed, with historically higher rates of unemployment.'b'The town of Sidi Bouzid, where the recent revolt started when a vendor of fruit and vegetables set himself on fire, lies just beyond Scipio\xe2\x80\x99s line. Tunisia is less part of the connective tissue of Arab North Africa than a demographic and cultural island bordered by sea and desert, with upwardly mobile European aspirations.'b'Tunisia has a relatively large middle class because of something so obvious it goes unremarked upon: it is a real state, with historical and geographical legitimacy, where political arguments are about budgets and food subsidies, not  the extremist ideologies that have plagued its neighbors, Algeria and Libya. It is a state not only because of the legacy of Rome and other empires, but because of human agency, in the person of Habib Bourguiba, one of the   lesser-known great men of the 20th century.'b'Bourguiba was the Arab Ataturk, who ruled Tunisia in a fiercely secular style for its first three decades after independence from France in the mid-1950s. Rather than envision grandiose building projects or a mighty army, Bourguiba devoted generous financing to birth control programs, rural women\xe2\x80\x99s literacy and primary-school education. He cracked down on the wearing of the veil, actually tried to do away with Ramadan, and advocated normalizing relations with Israel more than a decade before  Anwar Sadat of Egypt went to Jerusalem. Yes, he was an authoritarian, but the  result of his rule was that Tunisia, with moderate political tendencies and no serious ethnic or sectarian splits, has been poised since the 1980s for a democratic experiment.'b'In 1987, while faced by an Islamic rising,  Bourguiba became too infirm to rule, and was replaced by his former interior minister, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali,  essentially a security boss with little vision, much like the Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak. Mr. Ben Ali\xe2\x80\x99s strategy was to keep order, which largely meant killing and torturing Islamists and other dissidents.'b'But before we dismiss Mr. Ben Ali entirely, we should keep in mind that for many years he presided over a growing economy and middle class, with progress penetrating to the areas beyond the fossa regia. What happened was classic development theory: rising expectations along with uneven economic growth that led to political upheaval. Unlike Bourguiba, who was always revered as the man who led the country to independence, Mr. Ben Ali had no particular cachet to save him, despite an outrageous personality cult, and his extended family was famously corrupt.'b'Because Bourguiba insisted that the army remain small and apolitical, it is now the most trusted institution in the country. Indeed, the Tunisian Army is a benign Leviathan that may well ensure public order and thus allow for the tumult of democracy.'b'Nevertheless, despite all these advantages of history, prosperity and stability, Tunisia\xe2\x80\x99s path forward is treacherous. As for other benighted countries in the Arab world \xe2\x80\x94 the ones that many observers hope will be shaken to the core by Tunisia\xe2\x80\x99s revolt \xe2\x80\x94 they are in far worse shape.'b'Egypt has been effectively governed by military emergency law since 1952, with Islamic militants waiting in the wings for any kind of opportunity, even as the country is rent by tensions between its majority Muslims and Coptic Christian minority. Algeria and Libya have neither the effective institutions nor the venerable tradition of statehood that Tunisia has. Libya, should Muammar el-Qaddafi fall, would likely be much more of a mess than Tunisia post-Ben Ali.'b'Then there is Lebanon, with its vicious communalisms, and Syria, which has the potential to break up the way Yugoslavia did in the 1990s, given its regionally defined sectarian divisions. Syria held three free elections from  1947 to  1954  that all broke down along sectarian and regional lines, and the military regimes that have followed in Damascus did nothing to prepare their people for another bout of democracy.'b'As for Iraq, once the dictator was removed, tens of thousands \xe2\x80\x94 and perhaps  hundreds of thousands \xe2\x80\x94  died in sectarian and ethnic violence. Often, the worse the dictator, the worse the mess after he is toppled. There have been many comparisons between Tunisia 2011 and Europe 1989, but the idea that the coming of democracy in the Middle East won\xe2\x80\x99t have far more disruptions than occurred in Eastern Europe following the collapse of Communism seems na\xc3\xafve.'b'And there are plenty of reasons to think we are not on the cusp of a democratic avalanche. The Iranian Revolution of 1979 began as a revolt against the tyranny of the shah, but ended with a theocratic regime that was even worse. The seizure of the Grand Mosque at Mecca the same year by Islamic radicals might have brought a tyranny far worse than that of monarchial Saudi Arabia. In any event, it was put down and so remained a localized revolt. The Cedar Revolution in 2005 in Lebanon was stillborn.'b'There are some promising factors. For one, Arabic-language cable television makes the Middle East a virtual community, so that an event in one part of the region can more easily affect another part. It\xe2\x80\x99s worth hoping that Tunisia\xe2\x80\x99s secular Jasmine Revolution can seed similar uprisings in a restive Middle East that has undergone vast economic and social change, but suffers under the same sterile national security regimes that arose half a century ago.'b'Still, as the situation evolves in Tunis, and as we watch other Arab capitals expectantly, we would do well to focus less on what unites these places than on what divides them. Just as Tunisia\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances are unique, so are those in all the other countries. The more we focus on the particularities of each place, the less surprised we will be by political developments.'b'Another thing to keep in mind: in terms of American interests and regional peace, there is plenty of peril in democracy. It was not democrats, but Arab autocrats,  Anwar Sadat of Egypt and King Hussein of Jordan,  who made peace with Israel. An autocrat firmly in charge can make concessions more easily than can a weak, elected leader \xe2\x80\x94 just witness the fragility of Mahmoud Abbas\xe2\x80\x99s West Bank government. And it was democracy that brought the extremists of Hamas to power in Gaza. In fact, do we really want a relatively enlightened leader like King Abdullah in Jordan undermined by widespread street demonstrations? We should be careful what we wish for in the Middle East.'b'QUITE a coincidence: In January 1961, Robert F. Kennedy, newly appointed as attorney general of the United States, orchestrated the first concentrated attack on the American Mafia. Almost to the day 50 years later,'b' the government swept up more than 120  people'b' in a smorgasbord of racketeering indictments, mainly in the New York area.'b'It was described as the largest single-day assemblage of Mafiosi defendants in America. The arrests, however, underline a sobering message: despite half a century of law enforcement campaigns, New York\xe2\x80\x99s Cosa Nostra (\xe2\x80\x9cOur Thing\xe2\x80\x9d) continues to prosper. This is often because some change \xe2\x80\x94 usually either shifting priorities for law enforcement or improved strategy on the part of the new criminal bosses \xe2\x80\x94 gives the mob breathing space to rebuild.'b'Since the birth of the American Mafia in 1931, New York has been its crown jewel. While other major cities and regions were limited to one family, or borgata, New York was afflicted with five powerful ones, now known as the Bonanno, Colombo, Gambino, Genovese and Luchese groups. (There is also a satellite unit, the DeCavalcantes, in New Jersey.)'b'In the decades after the passage of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations laws of 1970, the F.B.I. and the Justice Department eliminated or severely weakened all 20-odd families in other cities and regions. In New York, the hierarchies of the five families were thought to have been pretty much destroyed by the so-called Commission Case in the mid-1980s and other investigations. By the end of the last century, prosecutors and F.B.I. officials all too frequently proclaimed that even the mob\xe2\x80\x99s sacred stronghold in New York was crushed.'b'As they did to so many aspects of American life, however, the 9/11 attacks radically transformed things. Until 9/11, the F.B.I. had two top priorities: counterespionage and the mob. But in the early 2000s the Justice Department dropped Cosa Nostra investigations as a priority, reassigning hundreds of agents to antiterrorist units.'b'In New York, the linchpin in the F.B.I.\xe2\x80\x99s crusade against wise guys, the number of agents and Police Department investigators assigned to battling the five families in combined task forces declined to about 100 from a high point of 450. Last week\xe2\x80\x99s indictments demonstrated how effectively the borgatas had regrouped.'b'Federal officials, as recently as five years ago, boasted that the New York Mafia had been expelled from its main bastions: private garbage carting, the garment center, the construction industry, waterfront cargo and control of key unions. But the current indictments tell a different tale \xe2\x80\x94 most allege that the mob was behind corrupt construction deals and waterfront shakedowns through infiltration of unions.'b'The sweeping arrests also reflect a major change in Mafia strategy. There were no celebrity names reminiscent of former kingpins like John J. Gotti or Vincent Gigante, known as \xe2\x80\x9cChin.\xe2\x80\x9d The alleged bosses are virtually unknown outside of law enforcement circles. Like the dons of the 1930s and 1940s, they maintained low profiles and, unlike the flamboyant Mr. Gotti, were presumably aware they were running secret organizations.'b'This is not to say the arrests don\xe2\x80\x99t indicate progress. It\xe2\x80\x99s encouraging that law enforcement is still able to overcome the Mafia\xe2\x80\x99s code of silence, or omert\xc3\xa0. The racketeering statutes\xe2\x80\x99 threat of severe prison sentences, including life behind bars, is reported to have spurred many low- and middle-ranked mobsters to turn informant.'b'Nonetheless, even if we drive the criminals out of their traditional corruption rackets, it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely to be an obituary for the mob. Sports bookmaking and loan-sharking, the Mafia\xe2\x80\x99s symbiotic bread-and-butter staples, will continue to flourish and provide seed money for other criminal endeavors.'b'There are several reasons for this. High-end gamblers prefer wagering with the mob rather than with state-authorized gambling operations like Off-Track Betting, where you have to pay taxes on your winnings. Moreover, the mob is adept at running bookmaking mills and, even when arrests occur, sentences are rarely harsh.'b'The timing of the government crackdown, which included some raids on gambling networks, might put a crimp into an exceptionally profitable venture for the mob \xe2\x80\x94 the Super Bowl next month. A study by the New York Police Department\xe2\x80\x99s Organized Crime Control Bureau 20 years ago estimated that more than $1 billion was wagered on the Super Bowl with mob-linked bookies in the New York area.'b'Another huge money-producer, loan-sharking, is customarily a partnership with illegal gambling. Compulsive bettors in debt to a bookie frequently have recourse only to a loan shark for quick cash. Hard economic times can be a bonanza for mob lenders. They learned during the Great Depression that honest business owners will seek usurious loans when banks are reluctant to finance small- and medium-sized enterprises.'b'Above all, though, the mob\xe2\x80\x99s ability to survive is a legacy from Charles (Lucky) Luciano. He was a brilliant criminal executive who created the framework, culture and ground rules for the American Mafia 80 years ago. Luciano realized that other ethnic gangs were loosely organized, usually involved in just one type of crime and easily obliterated when their leaders were imprisoned. Hence his cardinal principle: the organization \xe2\x80\x94 the family \xe2\x80\x94 was supreme and not reliant on a single individual or one racket. Whenever a boss or a capo was removed, a replacement would be waiting in the wings to keep the loot flowing.'b'So, while the unveiling of the indictments last week by Attorney General Eric Holder was a sharp warning that the Mafia was again on the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s radar screen, we should bear in mind the mob\xe2\x80\x99s previous Lazarus-like revivals. The removal of the current crop of Mafia barons will probably engender a new generation of mobsters. There have always been, and always will be, ambitious, greedy wise guys who are willing to risk long prison sentences for the power and riches glittering before them. The Mafia is wounded, but not fatally.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not an idiot: Now that the Republicans hold the House, only wishful thinkers and the deeply delusional expect to see any movement on the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender legislative agenda this year or next. Nevertheless, President Obama should address gay rights in his State of the Union speech this week, and he should tackle the biggest, most meaningful right of them all: the right to marry.'b'When he was a candidate for the Illinois State Senate in 1996, Mr. Obama told a gay publication that he supported \xe2\x80\x9c'b'legalizing same-sex marriages'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d Twelve years later, right about the time he decided to run for president, he came out against marriage equality. But, as the president likes to say, \xe2\x80\x9cThe arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice.\xe2\x80\x9d Where a Gallup poll in 1996 found that just 27 percent of the nation supported equal marriage rights for same-sex couples, a CNN poll last summer found that 'b'a majority now supports marriage equality'b'.'b'The president \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps after introducing Daniel Hernandez Jr., the openly gay intern credited with saving Representative Gabrielle Giffords\xe2\x80\x99s life \xe2\x80\x94 should declare that the trend is clear: this country increasingly believes that Mr. Hernandez and other lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans should have all the same rights and responsibilities as other citizens.'b'Gay Americans are eventually going to win on marriage just like we won on military service, the president should tell Congress, so why not save everyone on both sides of the debate a lot of time, trouble and money by approving the entire gay rights agenda? Send the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, the Student Non-Discrimination Act, the Uniting American Families Act and the repeal of the odious Defense of Marriage Act to his desk for his signature.'b'He can assure the lawmakers that, yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s something in it for Americans who disapprove of homosexuality too.'b'Social conservatives long to raise their children in a country where they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to hear about homosexuality every time they turn on the news. I\xe2\x80\x99d like raise my son in a country like that too. And guess what? In countries like Canada \xe2\x80\x94 where the fight over gay rights is essentially over, where there is gay marriage, open military service and employment protections \xe2\x80\x94  homosexuality hardly ever makes the front pages of newspapers. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing much to report.'b'Conservatives can\xe2\x80\x99t get rid of us, but they can hear less from and about us. They just have to bend toward justice.'b'P RESIDENT OBAMA will have to devote a big part of his State of the Union address to the economy, but which economy?'b'Corporate profits are up, in part because of reduced costs, especially payrolls, so jobs and wages remain in the doldrums. People with lots of financial assets or who are deemed \xe2\x80\x9ctalent\xe2\x80\x9d by large companies are enjoying a solid recovery, but most Americans continue to struggle. In order for the public to understand what must be done, Mr. Obama has to be clear about what has happened and why.'b'The Great Recession accelerated trends that started three decades ago: outsourcing abroad, automating work, converting full-time employees to temps and contractors, undermining unions and getting wage and benefit concessions from remaining workers.'b'Mr. Obama should point out that the United States economy is now more than twice the size it was in 1980, but the real median wage has barely budged; that in the late 1970s, the richest 1 percent of Americans got about 9 percent of total income, while by the start of the Great Recession the richest received more than 23 percent; that wealth is now even more concentrated. And the economy is bogged down because most Americans, unable to borrow as before, no longer have the purchasing power to get it moving again.'b'The president should make it clear that corporations aren\xe2\x80\x99t to blame; they\xe2\x80\x99re meant to make profits. Nor is it the fault of the rich who have played by the rules. But he should stress that a future with no jobs or lousy jobs for most Americans is not sustainable \xe2\x80\x94 not even for American corporations, whose long-term profitability depends on broad-based domestic demand.'b'The solution is to give average Americans a better economic deal. For starters, he should propose to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit (essentially, a wage subsidy) all the way up through the middle class. And he should suggest making the tax system more progressive: The rate on the $50,000 to $90,000 income bracket should be cut to 10 percent; on the $90,000 to $150,000 bracket, to 20 percent; on the $150,000 to $250,000 bracket, to 30 percent. Make up the revenue by increasing taxes on the $250,000 to $500,000 bracket, to 40 percent; from $500,000 to $5 million, to 50 percent; and anything over $5 million, to 60 percent. Tax capital gains the same as ordinary income.'b'In addition, he should call for strengthening unions by increasing penalties on employers who illegally deter them. And he should make college affordable by allowing federal loans to be repaid as 10 percent of earnings for the first 10 years of full-time employment.'b'Most important, he should make it clear these measures would be good for everyone. Rich Americans would do better with a smaller share of a rapidly growing economy than with a large share of one stuck in a deep hole.'b'WITH the Tucson shootings still in the news, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance President Obama will discuss gun control in his speech. How he does it could mean progress or stalemate on the issue.'b'Over the last few weeks, gun-control advocates have focused on banning the type of high-capacity clips that the police say was used by the man accused in the Tucson shootings, Jared Loughner. But even timely efforts to ban particular kinds of weapons face long odds politically, and historically have less success in reducing crime.'b'To get something done with a skeptical Congress, the president ought to shift the focus from the instruments of violence to the perpetrators by calling for a substantial increase in the number of people who are listed by the F.B.I. as barred from purchasing guns.'b'This year, the government will conduct about 14 million background checks on prospective firearm buyers. Only about 200,000, or just over 1 percent, will be denied permission to buy.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s more, while the F.B.I. database, the 'b'National Instant Criminal Background Check System'b', has nearly 6.5 million records of prohibited buyers, two-thirds are simply the names of undocumented immigrants, who as a group constitute just 1 percent of those who were denied a gun.'b'In contrast, the entire prohibited-buyer database holds just 2,092 names of drug abusers, and only one of every 5,000 prospective buyers in 2010 was denied for reasons of mental instability.'b'A big part of the problem is that people who should be on the list, like those diagnosed with severe mental-health problems, are often left off, either because of bureaucratic hurdles or because several states are slow to report them to the federal government. According to a report by the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, New Jersey submitted just eight names in 34 months from 2008 to 2010, compared with 60,677 from Texas.'b'The president should therefore call for several additions to the database: names on the terrorist watch list, military recruits who fail drug tests and patients ordered to undergo mental-health treatment, if their doctor or family requests they be added. He should also demand that reluctant states supply court records on mentally incapacitated residents.'b'An approach aimed at the person, not the gun, has a real chance of winning bipartisan support.'b''b' 'b''b'THE past year was a sobering one for American educators, as we learned that the United States is falling farther behind in  international student rankings. To his credit, President Obama put forward a plan for change that hit the mark, a brilliant stroke that even the \xe2\x80\x9cabolish the Department of Education\xe2\x80\x9d crowd had to admire. Race to the Top, the competitive grant program that harnesses stimulus dollars to drive reform, convinced a surprising number of governors and legislators from both parties to pay the entrance fee by proving they could strengthen their education laws.'b'Twelve states improved their evaluation tools so that they can identify effective teachers and make sure they are prized in the classroom. Six states reversed policies that had made it impossible to use student achievement to evaluate classroom teachers. And 27 broadened their public charter school laws, giving parents more choices and reminding everyone that competition in education is a good thing.'b'Now, with a slow-moving economic recovery and no more federal stimulus dollars to spend, rumors are flying that in some cities 15  percent to 20 percent of teachers may face layoffs. Of course, states and school districts will look for other ways to cut costs. But when they have no other options, most principals are required to lay off the newest teachers rather than the least effective ones.'b'In his State of the Union address, President Obama should call for a federal law that would require states to help parents ascertain whether their children are getting the high-quality instruction they need to prepare for college and the work force. Parents who find that their children are not being taught by an effective teacher in a successful school should have the right to vote with their feet by choosing a different school.'b'Now that 12 of the 50 states have laws that allow school administrators to consider teacher effectiveness in making layoff decisions, one in four children in America stand to benefit. President Obama must make an all-out effort to help the other three.'b'PRESIDENT OBAMA must use his State of the Union speech to make clear his commitment to two economic imperatives: accelerating job growth and controlling the federal deficit. He must persuade Americans that we do not have a choice between the two. We have to do both, and we have to get the timing right.'b'That means pushing hard for faster job creation, but also warning about looming federal deficits and their threat to prosperity. It means promising to work actively with Congress to control the rising debt.'b'Pivoting to deficit reduction is not me-tooing the Republicans. The pivot would have been necessary even if the Democrats had won. Fiscal responsibility is not about smaller government; it is about paying for the government we want.'b'Drastically cutting spending right now, as some Republicans advocate, would destroy jobs. But continued borrowing at projected rates will lead to a debt crisis, soaring interest rates and a plummeting dollar that could precipitate a deeper recession and destroy even more jobs. The president must get this danger across.'b'Mr. Obama must also expose the fallacy that rising debt can be controlled by cutting spending alone. True, we must reduce low-priority discretionary spending, both defense and domestic; slow the projected growth of Medicare and Medicaid; and restore Social Security to fiscal soundness. But we also need to care for an aging population and invest in the skills, research and modern infrastructure that power economic growth.'b'To pay those bills we will need more revenues. The president should rally both parties around serious tax reform that slashes most tax exclusions and deductions, lowers rates for most people and raises more money.'b'The president must use his speech to urge support for immediate action on a multiyear deficit reduction plan. America\xe2\x80\x99s future prosperity and global power are on the line. Only the president can exert the budgetary leadership that will avert economic disaster.'b''b' 'b''b'FACING a public focused on economic revival, a hostile House and the lowest level of voter concern in a long while on human-driven climate change, President Obama could easily punt on energy this Tuesday. But this would actually be the ideal time for him to introduce an 'b'energy quest'b' as a keystone 21st-century American imperative. Only by expanding our menu of nonpolluting energy choices can we hope to ameliorate a variety of social, geopolitical, climatic and economic risks facing the country and the world.'b'Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s first step should not be to announce a predetermined list of policies to transform our energy system, but to use his State of the Union address to commence a yearlong American conversation on the merits and shape of such an effort. Modeled on the president\xe2\x80\x99s health care summit meeting last February, this conversation would play out in public televised events attended by the president or his cabinet, along with politicians, experts, scientists and American workers, in places ranging from the White House to coal country, from the grounds of a potential site for a new nuclear reactor to the boiler room of a primary school looking to cut emissions and energy bills.'b'The result, by the next January address, would be an action plan endorsed by business and by some of the 'b'dozens of Nobelists'b' who have been lobbying the White House to renew American investment in relevant areas of science after decades of bipartisan neglect.'b'Parts of the plan could well be supported by the array of liberals and libertarians seeking an end to market-distorting 'b'energy subsidies'b', perhaps even by some of the conservatives seeing the patriotic merits in a revenue-neutral gasoline tax. And the effort itself would challenge proponents of the status quo, either in Congress or in the public, to demonstrate why acting to fill the global energy gap is a bad idea.'b''b' 'b''b''b''b'G IVEN  the deep divide on health care reform in the courts, the Congress and the country, the long-term viability of this historic achievement depends in part on President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s ability to reduce the tension and seek common ground. In his State of the Union message, he should say something like this:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has been one of my proudest achievements. Every American\xe2\x80\x99s quality of life will improve as a result of its passage. Yet the recent 'b'vote in the House to repeal this law'b' is a clear indication of the great differences over the proper role of government in health care.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn spite of these differences, both parties recognize that the trend of rising costs and declining access to health insurance is unsustainable. The growing burden of our health care bill is straining family and government budgets. We cannot close our federal deficit or remain economically competitive in the world unless we find ways to limit health care costs.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are united in our goal to build a high-performance, high-value health care system with lower costs, greater access and better quality. We all understand that we must do a better job in confronting obesity, chronic illness and excessive paperwork in health care. And we share the belief that health care in America will always work best as a partnership between government and the private sector.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us build on what unites us \xe2\x80\x94 by constructing marketplaces for health insurance that offer greater choice at less cost; creating organizations that coordinate care efficiently and bring down the unacceptable rate of medical mistakes; continuing to encourage scientists to find new ways to prevent and cure disease; and empowering cities and counties to develop new solutions to the perplexing problems of health care in America now.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo that end, I propose that we create a bipartisan commission to examine the best ways to carry out, oversee and, where appropriate, revise the health care reform law. Made up of members of Congress, governors and members of my administration, this commission would provide invaluable guidance and solutions going forward.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe key to our success will always be to find ways to do it together.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b' 'b''b'THE revolt in Tunisia has thrown both that nation\xe2\x80\x99s dictator, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, and the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s democracy-promotion policy onto the ash heap of history. The revolt undermined \xe2\x80\x94 indeed, destroyed \xe2\x80\x94 two years of effort in Washington to move toward a policy of \xe2\x80\x9cengagement\xe2\x80\x9d with hostile and repressive regimes.'b'The price for this policy has been paid by men and women from China to Russia to Iran to Egypt to Venezuela, who had expected a louder voice and a firmer helping hand from the United States. Now, watching the Tunisians try to move from a rapacious dictatorship to a stable democratic system, the president should say that in Tunisia, and everywhere else, we will side with those working to build democracies.'b'The president needn\xe2\x80\x99t admit error \xe2\x80\x94 he can stick with the old \xe2\x80\x9cengagement\xe2\x80\x9d trope \xe2\x80\x94 but he must shift his focus from sclerotic regimes to movements, parties and brave people seeking political freedom. Mr. Obama should give an account of the visit last week by President Hu Jintao of China that explains why he, the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner, accorded every possible honor to the jailer of the 2010 winner, Liu Xiaobo. Clearly, the only moral defense would be a statement allying himself henceforth with the Chinese people and their century-and-a-half-old struggle to combine modernization with freedom. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a matter of official dialogues about human rights with Chinese officials, but of constant pressure.'b'President Obama has also talked of a desire to \xe2\x80\x9creset\xe2\x80\x9d relations with Russia. He should start by acknowledging that its rulers seem determined to roll back every gain in freedom made since the collapse of the Soviet Union.'b'The president should also clarify that our ultimate goal for Iran is not a nuclear deal with the ayatollahs but freedom for its people under a government they choose in honest elections. Mr. Obama should explain that a stable peace is not the product of deals with dictators but of free peoples working for common goals. He must get over his allergy to what George W. Bush called the freedom agenda, for it has been the agenda of many presidents of his own party as well.'b''b'With President Obama poised to deliver his second State of the Union address on Tuesday, the Op-Ed editors asked politicians, journalists and experts in various fields what they would like to hear him say.'b''b'To the Editor:'b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'Budget Worries Push Governors to Same Mind-Set'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 17) emphasized governors\xe2\x80\x99 bold spending cuts, which is half of their leadership role, but de-emphasized their timidity to raise revenues, the other half.'b'Most produced more honest budgets and exposed huge shortfalls, but offered only draconian cuts.

It\xe2\x80\x99s been far too long since the House expanded to keep up with population growth and, as a result, it has lost touch with the public and been overtaken by special interests.'b'Indeed, the lower chamber of Congress has had the same number of members for so long that many Americans assume that its 435 seats are constitutionally mandated.'b'But that\xe2\x80\x99s wrong: while the founders wanted to limit the size of the Senate, they intended the House to expand based on population growth. Instead of setting an absolute number, the Constitution merely limits the ratio of members to population. \xe2\x80\x9cThe number of representatives shall not exceed one for every 30,000,\xe2\x80\x9d the founders wrote. They were concerned, in other words, about having too many representatives, not too few.'b'When the House met in 1789 it had 65 members, one for every 60,000 inhabitants (including slaves as three-fifths of a person). For well over a century, after each census Congress would pass a law increasing the size of the House.'b'But after the 1910 census, when the House grew from 391 members to 433 (two more were added later when Arizona and New Mexico became states), the growth stopped. That\xe2\x80\x99s because the 1920 census indicated that the majority of Americans were concentrating in cities, and nativists, worried about of the power of \xe2\x80\x9cforeigners,\xe2\x80\x9d blocked efforts to give them more representatives.'b'By the time the next decade rolled around, members found themselves reluctant to dilute their votes, and the issue was never seriously considered again.'b'The result is that Americans today are numerically the worst-represented group of citizens in the country\xe2\x80\x99s history. The average House member speaks for about 700,000 Americans. In contrast, in 1913 he represented roughly 200,000, a ratio that today would mean a House with 1,500 members \xe2\x80\x94 or 5,000 if we match the ratio the founders awarded themselves.'b'This disparity increases the influence of lobbyists and special interests: the more constituents one has, the easier it is for money to outshine individual voices. And it means that representatives have a harder time connecting with the people back in their districts.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s needed, then, is a significant increase in the size of the House by expanding the number, and shrinking the size, of districts. Doing so would make campaigns cheaper, the political value of donations lower and the importance of local mobilizing much greater.'b'Smaller districts would also end the two-party deadlock. Orange County, Calif., might elect a Libertarian, while Cambridge, Mass., might pick a candidate from the Green Party.'b'Moreover, with additional House members we\xe2\x80\x99d likely see more citizen-legislators and fewer lifers. In places like New York or Chicago, we would cross at least one Congressional district just walking a few blocks to the grocery store. Our representatives would be our neighbors, people who better understood the lives and concerns of average Americans.'b'More districts would likewise mean more precision in distributing them equitably, especially in low-population states. Today the lone Wyoming representative covers about 500,000 people, while her lone counterpart in Delaware reports to 900,000.'b'The increase would also mean more elected officials working on the country\xe2\x80\x99s business, reducing the reliance on unaccountable staffers. Most of the House\xe2\x80\x99s work is through committees, overseeing and checking government agencies.'b'With more people in Congress, House committee members could see to this critical business themselves \xe2\x80\x94 and therefore be more influential, since a phone call from an actual member is a lot more effective than a request from the committee staff.'b'True, more members means more agendas, legislation and debates. But Internet technology already provides effective low-cost management solutions, from Google Documents to streaming interactive video to online voting.'b'The biggest obstacle is Congress itself. Such a change would require the noble act \xe2\x80\x94 routine before World War I but unheard of since \xe2\x80\x94 of representatives voting to diminish their own relative power.'b'So if such reform is to happen, it will have to be driven by grassroots movements. Luckily, we are living in just such a moment: the one thing Move On and the Tea Party can agree on is that the Washington status quo needs to change. So far this year, that has meant shrinking government. But in this case, the best solution might just be to make government \xe2\x80\x94 or at least the House of Representatives \xe2\x80\x94 bigger.'b'President Obama unveiled 'b'a promising new theme'b' on Friday when he toured a factory in Schenectady, N.Y., and began talking about the desperate need to foster competitiveness and innovation in the pursuit of American jobs. The real test of his commitment to that cause in the second half of his term will come on Tuesday in his State of the Union address. He will have to make his case in the face of a newly strengthened and shrill Republican Party, determined to dismantle government\xe2\x80\x99s most fundamental role in fighting the recession.'b'A stunning glimpse of that recalcitrance was revealed last week when a group representing two-thirds of House Republicans 'b'proposed cutting $2.5 trillion'b' from discretionary federal spending over the next decade, in ways that would only make joblessness far worse. For the first time, party lawmakers showed just where their radical cuts would be, and it was immediately clear that they would throw thousands of federal, state and private employees out of work.'b'That kind of extremism gives the president a renewed opportunity to delineate forcefully the contrast with his own plans, and the largely unheralded accomplishments of his first two years.'b'The top of his agenda should be explaining to the public why job creation and growth are more important than short-term spending cuts, and why those two paths are incompatible. Now is the time for a full-throated statement about the need for federal investment in infrastructure, education and state aid. He should capitalize on his new team of business-oriented advisers to explain which industries he believes will provide the jobs, and show what he is prepared to do to foster that growth.'b'Clearly, though, a plan for long-term deficit reduction is vital to economic security. Mr. Obama has a chance to make clear how he plans to build in the years to come on cuts he has already proposed. But he cannot be drawn into the Republican game of choosing from a menu of ill-advised quick fixes. This is not an area where the difference can be split, or a few pre-emptive reductions can palliate the hunger on the right.'b'There is no point in even bringing up Social Security outside of a long-term and comprehensive budget debate. A moment for negotiation on the near-term budget will arrive, but it does not have to begin with sacrificial offerings from the podium. Mr. Obama is expected to propose a restructured tax code, but that important goal can only be reached in the context of raising more revenue to close chronic deficits.'b'The president may be able to find some rare common ground with Republicans on reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (now known as No Child Left Behind). Any new act will undoubtedly provide more flexibility for states and local districts to meet federal standards, but must maintain its commitment to pursuing equity for minority schools, along with a tough measurement system for teachers and schools.'b'We hope Mr. Obama dares to offer solutions on immigration, standing on the side of assimilation and earned citizenship. On the environment, he must stand firm against a coming Republican attack on the Clean Air Act and its authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants like smog, soot and mercury.'b'Overseas, the speech should explain why Afghanistan, alarmingly unstable after a decade of war, is important to American security and how he intends to reach a minimally acceptable outcome. He also needs to address his plans for forging better cooperation with Pakistan, where  Qaeda and Taliban leaders are based.'b'Beyond the usual laundry list, however, the president will have to balance inspiration \xe2\x80\x94 the kind Americans saw in abundance in his Tucson remarks \xe2\x80\x94 with feisty confidence in his fundamental principles. The midterm election showed how strongly voters hungered for lost leadership on the economy. Mr. Obama has it within him to stand up to the forces of governmental destruction and begin restoring confidence in his leadership.'b'During oral argument about Montana v. Wyoming this month, the Supreme Court was doing something rare: it was in session as a trial court and its task was to decide how to divvy up water from tributaries to the Yellowstone River.'b'The Constitution gives the court \xe2\x80\x9coriginal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d in cases \xe2\x80\x9caffecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party,\xe2\x80\x9d as in the water case. These cases have a musty aura, but the opposite is true. They are an example of how the court\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the Constitution is persistently evolving, with few paying any attention.'b'The case of Marbury v. Madison arose on the original docket. Chief Justice John Marshall declared there that Congress couldn\xe2\x80\x99t enlarge or reduce the court\xe2\x80\x99s original jurisdiction. For 200 years, however, Congress has basically reduced it, giving lower courts authority to hear suits in nearly all of these areas.'b'The Supreme Court has not complained, but it has retained exclusive authority to resolve what it has called \xe2\x80\x9cdelicate and grave\xe2\x80\x9d disputes between states. Even in those matters, though, the court frequently rejects cases on the fuzzy grounds that  they aren\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The salient reason for this retreat is the mismatch between what the court is equipped to do and what original cases require. Chief Justice William Rehnquist was blunt about saying the court \xe2\x80\x9ccannot sit to receive evidence or conduct trials.\xe2\x80\x9d Despite that, the court continues to do what it has since 1791: it relies on delegates known as special masters to collect evidence and recommend how the court should rule.'b'The issue in Montana v. Wyoming is about how to interpret the 60-year-old Yellowstone River Compact among Montana (downstream), Wyoming (upstream) and North Dakota (not involved in the case).'b'Montana says the compact guarantees it enough water to meet the needs of users with rights as of 1950. Wyoming says the compact allows it to take the same amount of water it did then, as long as users put it to the same use \xe2\x80\x94 even if better technology allows the state to make better use of the water so less flows back to the river and is available for Montana.'b'The special master, Barton Thompson Jr., a Stanford law professor, agrees with Wyoming, and his view makes good sense. The compact sets the amount of water that can be diverted, not consumed. As long as the water Wyoming takes isn\xe2\x80\x99t wasted, it\xe2\x80\x99s that state\xe2\x80\x99s to use. At the hearing, some justices seemed taken aback by the either-or choice. Justice Stephen Breyer asked, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no way to read this contract \xe2\x80\x94 this compact \xe2\x80\x94 so it\xe2\x80\x99s share and share alike?\xe2\x80\x9d Still, a majority of the justices are likely to agree with Professor  Thompson.'b'Education officials across the country are increasingly focused on the two critical reform tasks: developing more effective teacher evaluation systems and speeding up the glacial pace of disciplinary hearings for teachers charged with misconduct. The American Federation of Teachers, the country\xe2\x80\x99s second-largest teachers\xe2\x80\x99 union, has wisely chosen to work with state legislatures and local school districts to help shape these new systems rather than try to block them.'b'Last week the union\xe2\x80\x99s president, Randi Weingarten, released a plan for speeding up disciplinary hearings that is a good starting point for more discussion. Developed by Kenneth Feinberg, the arbitration specialist, the plan  calls for strictly limiting the process \xe2\x80\x94 from complaint to resolution \xe2\x80\x94 to 100 days. Right now a hearing can drag on for months or years, with the attendant stiff legal fees.'b'In many districts, teachers can now be investigated for vaguely worded charges like \xe2\x80\x9cmoral turpitude\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cconduct unbecoming\xe2\x80\x9d that are often difficult to define and difficult to prosecute or defend against. The plan would give teachers and school systems more protection by establishing a clear set of charges \xe2\x80\x94 such as improper use of force, sexual abuse or refusal to obey rules \xe2\x80\x94 along with a strict set of deadlines for submissions of evidence and arguments.'b'The unions and state legislatures also need to press forward on developing evaluation systems that take student performance into account and that allow school systems to reward excellent teaching while steering ineffective teachers out of the field.'b'Ms. Weingarten has shown strong leadership in this area, and is well ahead of the National Education Association, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest teachers\xe2\x80\x99 union. But many members of her union are resistant to the idea of accountability systems, which they say can be far too easily manipulated.'b'The states are already charging ahead in this area. If the unions want to have input, they need to  quickly come up with a legitimate proposal of their own.'b'Time zones are laid out longitudinally and, with a few exceptions, the clock changes by an hour for every 15 degrees you move east or west. But the length of the day \xe2\x80\x94 the time the sun spends above the horizon \xe2\x80\x94 varies by latitude and the farther north you go in winter, the less daylight there is. That explains why many Scots are upset with a bill making its way through Parliament that could institute permanent daylight saving time throughout all of Britain.'b'The bill proposes an \xe2\x80\x9canalysis of the potential costs and benefits of advancing time by one hour for all, or part of, the year.\xe2\x80\x9d The thought behind it is that the country might be better off, in overall mood and energy use, with lighter afternoons and darker mornings. All well and good in London, argue the Scots. But in the north of Scotland \xe2\x80\x94 only a few degrees south of the Arctic Circle \xe2\x80\x94 that change could mean winter sunrises as late as 10 a.m., a dismal prospect.'b'Scotland and England will surely settle this difference as peaceably as they\xe2\x80\x99ve settled most of their differences since the 14th century. But this dispute is a reminder of a world we\xe2\x80\x99ve nearly forgotten, before the spread of railways in the late 19th century, the adoption of daylight saving time in the early 20th century, and well before the 1999 invention of the cesium clock that now keeps official time.'b'Time was utterly local once. Noon came when the sun was at its meridian, towns a few dozen miles apart kept different times, and most people had no need to reckon with intervals as short as a minute. In our split-second, coordinated world, the only place time is still kept that old-fashioned way is in all the rest of nature.'b'Last week, the Republican Party proved that it has the votes to repeal health care reform \xe2\x80\x94 but only in the House of Representatives. (Unfortunately for conservatives, the Senate and the White House also have a say in the matter.) The House vote on Wednesday may be remembered as a first step toward actual repeal, or as a futile exercise in fist-shaking. It all depends on whether Republicans can find a strategy for undoing the health care legislation that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t involve an immediate frontal assault.'b'One option is for Congressional Republicans to hold hearings, stage more symbolic votes, and hope that the 2012 election delivers them a Senate majority, a new occupant in the White House and a chance at full repeal. But of course there\xe2\x80\x99s no guarantee that Obama will be defeated  \xe2\x80\x94  and even if he is, by 2013 health care reform may be more entrenched, and the Democratic Party more united than ever in its determination to defend it. (The filibuster, lately a Republican weapon, could become the means by which supporters of Obamacare ensure that it endures.)'b'Another option would be to attack the law piecemeal by going after its least popular provisions  \xe2\x80\x94  the new taxes, the Medicare cuts and the fine for Americans who don\xe2\x80\x99t buy insurance. This strategy might be good short-term politics but  would do little to lay the groundwork for an actual conservative alternative. Worse, in the unlikely event that the piecemeal attacks succeeded, Obamacare would be transformed from a notionally deficit-neutral bill into a straightforward budget-buster. And heightening a program\xe2\x80\x99s contradictions in the hopes that it falls apart is an approach better suited to Marxists than conservatives.'b'What Republicans need is a different kind of incremental approach, one that uses the strongest conservative critiques of the health care bill as a framework for a reform of the reform. If Obama is defeated in 2012, this framework could easily be adapted into a full scale repeal-and-replace effort. But in the event that he\xe2\x80\x99s re-elected, it would offer a Republican Congress a blueprint for improving the law without doing away with it entirely.'b'Here are three such conservative critiques: first, that Obamacare entrenches the'b' very model of health care financing'b'that drove costs sky-high to begin with  \xe2\x80\x94  a model in which every insurance plan has to be comprehensive, every significant payment is made by a third party, and consumers have no idea what their treatments actually cost.'b'Second, the new subsidies for the uninsured are so expansive that they may 'b'encourage employers to stop offering insurance'b' altogether, offloading their employees into the new health care exchanges and swiftly overwhelming the federal budget.'b'Third, the mandate to buy health insurance infringes on American liberties: never before has Washington required that private citizens purchase a particular product from a particular set of private companies.'b'To address the first problem, Republicans should work to deregulate the new health care exchanges, so that high-deductible, catastrophic coverage can be purchased as easily as comprehensive plans. To address the second, they should propose capping the subsidies for the uninsured, so that they don\xe2\x80\x99t dramatically exceed the value of the existing tax subsidy for employer-provided insurance.'b'The mandate is a harder puzzle, since it works in tandem with the requirement  \xe2\x80\x94  popular enough to have many Republican supporters  \xe2\x80\x94  that insurers cease denying coverage to customers with pre-existing conditions. If you repealed the mandate without repealing that requirement, people could simply wait until they were sick to buy insurance, driving everyone\xe2\x80\x99s prices up.'b'But Republicans could propose dealing with the same problem in a less coercive way. 'b'One alternative'b' would establish limited enrollment periods (every two years, for instance) when people with pre-existing conditions could buy into the new exchanges without being denied coverage. Anyone who failed to take advantage wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to get coverage for a pre-existing condition until the next enrollment period arrived. This would reduce the incentive to game the system, without directly penalizing Americans who decline to buy insurance.'b'None of these changes would be as sweeping and satisfying as repealing the health care bill outright. And many 'b'conservatives are loath'b' to send President Obama anything that he might actually sign, lest he use the cover of bipartisanship to evade responsibility for health care reform\xe2\x80\x99s unpopularity.'b'But in the unlikely event that the president did embrace a reform of the reform, conservatives would have an opportunity to transform Obamacare from within. With the right changes, the new health care law could expand access to insurance in a more cost-effective, less coercive and more market-oriented way. Which is to say, it could become the kind of reform that conservatives claim to have been looking for all along.'b'To the Editor:'b'Regarding President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union address on Tuesday night, at a time when the nation\xe2\x80\x99s sense of itself and our mission may be changing, the context of the president\xe2\x80\x99s remarks should be the role of the federal government in maintaining a sane society.'b'By that I mean a just society that looks after its disadvantaged, educates its children, ensures access to health care for all Americans, and gives the middle class as well as the wealthy a voice in the public conversation and a stake in an expanding economy.'b'Until we\xe2\x80\x99re clear about what to expect of our government, and how our president sees its role, the debate about its proper size will remain a partisan shouting match.'b'David Kernis'b'\nTrumbull, Conn., Jan. 23, 2011'b''b'\xc2\x95'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Obama to Press Centrist Agenda in His Address'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 23):'b'Where does Jim Kessler, the co-founder of the centrist organization Third Way, get the idea that President Obama is \xe2\x80\x9cmoving from the left to the center\xe2\x80\x9d?

Much of this is directly attributable to the I.H.R.C. and its partners, which finance and implement rehabilitation and resettlement projects.'b'Health care initiatives valued at $202 million, including a state-of-the-art hospital and a national health facility, are under way.

On a frigid afternoon, a prostitute lingers in the shadow of the elevated train tracks, waiting restlessly for customers. Husks of long-closed factories stand amid thigh-high winter wheat. Streams of garbage flow down the streets, as if both the people and the city government had agreed to forsake the effort of propriety.'b'In recent months, this neighborhood has also been terrorized by a killer who choked and raped his victims in the area\xe2\x80\x99s ubiquitous abandoned houses and vacant lots. If only these deserted places could be charged as accomplices to the so-called Kensington Strangler\xe2\x80\x99s three murders and two sexual assaults, and for aiding and abetting the drug use and prostitution that have caused so many of the neighborhood\xe2\x80\x99s problems. But the empty lots with their discarded furniture and ghetto kudzu and the weather-beaten houses with boarded-up windows won\xe2\x80\x99t be going anywhere soon.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s been nearly 30 years since James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling published their broken windows theory, positing that the torn social fabric that allows for vandalism also encourages other kinds of crime and disinvestment in a neighborhood. The theory validated the inclination to improve the built environment first, in the hopes that once a sense of confidence has been restored other aspects of an engaged community will follow. And in places on the cusp of gentrification or economic recovery, like certain New York areas in the \xe2\x80\x9990s, quality-of-life campaigns have been proven to clean up the streets and reduce crime.'b'Indeed, as gentrification has slowly crept northward in Philadelphia, Kensington residents have gained some hope from a newly branded arts corridor, a few rejuvenated parks and street improvements, all thanks to the efforts of an invaluable local community development corporation. But this scattershot approach has failed to create the kind of holistic change needed in this neighborhood \xe2\x80\x94 or its counterparts in St. Louis, Cleveland, Detroit and Baltimore.'b'Many cities have also sought to transform undeveloped lots into green space and urban agriculture. It\xe2\x80\x99s a natural fit and, again, in Kensington a full city block has been converted from an industrial brownfield to an admirably active farm. But land-based strategies that try to reinvent this vacant lot or that blighted ground do little to stem the larger social trends that created the spatial problem in the first place.'b'Philadelphia, like many Rust Belt cities, was so deeply hurt by the loss of manufacturing that began in the 1950s that it has yet to recover. Gone were the jobs that even high-school dropouts could leverage to achieve stable lives, and with them went the housing stock. Today, we are left with a city where the number of jobs requiring postsecondary education has grown, while more than 60 percent of Philadelphia\xe2\x80\x99s adults read at a sixth grade level or below, creating a miserable mismatch that leaves both employers and the unemployed in need.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why any plan to mitigate the vacant property crisis must not only include innovative urban planning, but also try to restore employment opportunities. We need to literally build jobs on neglected and undeveloped land.'b'There are a number of organizations in Philadelphia that provide models for dealing with vacancy and joblessness as intertwined problems. For example, the Job Opportunity Investment Network, a public-private partnership, supports workforce training programs that have a hyperlocal impact.'b'One such program is the West Philadelphia Skills Initiative, which  provides low-skill residents with intensive education and then matches graduates with jobs at the prestigious universities and medical centers within walking distance of their homes. While the jobs help people leave poverty behind, they ensure that the new wealth created remains in their neighborhoods, helping stabilize these downtrodden communities.'b'Roots to Re-Entry enrolls convicts in a horticulture vocational and life-skills training program that, upon their release, leads to landscaping jobs.  Part of the training includes growing organic food that is donated to Philadelphia\xe2\x80\x99s neediest, showing how this work can nourish impoverished neighborhoods.'b'Such programs can teach residents the skills they need to reimagine the urban voids they encounter every day. Cities, in turn, should partner with neighborhood groups to determine the most suitable abandoned buildings and lots for development, luring companies and projects that would employ newly retrained residents.'b'Strategies that deal with vacant spaces by generating new paths to employment aim to do more than fixing broken windows ever could. They seek to change the dynamics of the local economy by creating better communities, not just prettier ones, where abandoned properties are viewed as job sites rather than crime scenes waiting to happen.'b'GABRIELLE GIFFORDS\xe2\x80\x99S remarkable recovery from a  bullet to her head has provided a heartening respite from a national calamity. Representative Giffords\xe2\x80\x99s husband 'b'describes her as a \xe2\x80\x9cfighter,\xe2\x80\x9d'b'  and no doubt she is one. Whether her recovery has anything to do with a fighting spirit, however, is another matter entirely.'b'The idea that an individual has power  over his health has a long history in American popular culture. The \xe2\x80\x9cmind cure\xe2\x80\x9d movements of the 1800s were based on the premise that we can  control our well-being. In the middle of that century, Phineas Quimby, a philosopher and healer, popularized the view that illness was the product of mistaken beliefs, that it was possible to cure yourself by correcting your thoughts. Fifty years later, the New Thought movement, which  the psychologist and philosopher William James called \xe2\x80\x9cthe religion of the healthy minded,\xe2\x80\x9d expressed a very similar view: by focusing on positive thoughts and avoiding negative ones, people could banish illness.'b'The idea that people can control their own health has persisted  through Norman Vincent Peale\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPower of Positive Thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d in 1952, to  a  popular book today, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Secret,\xe2\x80\x9d by Rhonda Byrne, which teaches that to achieve good health all we have to do is to direct our requests to the universe.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s true that in some respects we do have control over our health. By exercising, eating nutritious foods and not smoking, we reduce our risk of heart disease and cancer. But the belief that a fighting spirit helps us to recover from injury or illness goes beyond healthful behavior. It reflects the persistent view that personality or a way of thinking can raise or reduce the likelihood of illness.'b'The psychosomatic hypothesis, which was popular in the mid-20th century, held that repressed emotional conflict was at the core of many physical diseases: Hypertension was the product of the inability to deal with hostile impulses. Ulcers were caused by unresolved fear and resentment. And women with breast cancer were characterized as being sexually inhibited,   masochistic and unable to deal with anger.'b'Although modern doctors have rejected those beliefs, in the past 20 years, the medical literature has increasingly included studies examining the possibility that positive characteristics like optimism, spirituality and being a compassionate person are associated with good health. And books on the health benefits of happiness and positive outlook continue to be best sellers.'b'But there\xe2\x80\x99s no evidence to back up the idea that an upbeat attitude can  prevent any illness or help someone recover from one more readily. On the contrary,  a recently completed  study of nearly 60,000 people in Finland and Sweden  who were followed for almost 30 years 'b'found no significant association'b' between personality traits and the likelihood of developing or surviving cancer. Cancer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care if we\xe2\x80\x99re good or bad, virtuous or vicious, compassionate or inconsiderate. Neither does heart disease or AIDS or any other illness or injury.'b'And while we may be able to point anecdotally to a Gabrielle Giffords as an example of how a fighting spirit improves medical outcome, other people with a spirit just as strong die \xe2\x80\x94 think of Elizabeth Edwards, for example. And many patients who employ negative thinking nevertheless recover from illness every day. We want good things to happen to good people and this desire blinds us to evidence to the contrary.'b'But such beliefs have implications for how we regard people who are ill. If people are insufficiently upbeat after a cancer diagnosis or inadequately \xe2\x80\x9cspiritual\xe2\x80\x9d after a diagnosis of AIDS, are we to assume they have willfully placed their health at risk? And if they fail to recover, is it really their fault? The incessant pressure to be positive imposes an enormous burden on patients whose course of treatment doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go as planned.'b'Very early in my career, I participated in a study of young women who were hospitalized and awaiting the results of  biopsies to determine if they had cervical cancer. While I was interviewing one of my patients, the biopsy results of the woman in the next bed came back to her \xe2\x80\x94 negative. The fortunate woman\xe2\x80\x99s father, who was there with her, said in relief: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re good people. We deserve this.\xe2\x80\x9d It was a perfectly understandable response, but what should my patient have said to herself when her biopsy came back positive? That she got cancer because she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a good person?'b'It is difficult enough to be  injured or gravely ill. To add to this the burden of guilt over a supposed failure to have the right attitude toward one\xe2\x80\x99s illness is unconscionable. Linking health to personal virtue and vice not only is bad science, it\xe2\x80\x99s bad medicine.'b'Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ve been invited to a Burns Supper Tuesday, an annual feast given to celebrate the birth of the Scottish poet Robert Burns on Jan. 25, 1759. We have never experienced a Burns supper in Scotland, where the traditional entree, haggis \xe2\x80\x94 a sheep sausage encased in a sheep\xe2\x80\x99s stomach \xe2\x80\x94 is a delicacy. In America, when the haggis makes its entrance, guests reach for the whiskey, which is also traditional at Burns suppers.'b'The point of the celebration, of course, is Burns\xe2\x80\x99s poetry, especially verses from his \xe2\x80\x9cPoems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect,\xe2\x80\x9d which was published in 1786 and made Burns instantly famous. These are wonderful poems, but the dialect is full of thorns and brambles.'b'Like the haggis, it may pose little problem to historically minded Scottish readers. When Americans rise to recite the songs of Robert Burns, it is a workout for parts of the tongue and throat that are rarely used in modern American English. To the listeners, it is nearly as intelligible as Chaucer read aloud in his middle English.'b'We like the idea of celebrating poetry with food and ritual, but we need some events that come a little more naturally to the American palate.'b'Perhaps a ceremonial breakfast of the cold plums from \xe2\x80\x9cThis Is Just to Say\xe2\x80\x9d on Sept. 17, the birthday of William Carlos Williams. Perhaps the tea and cakes and ices (peaches optional) from \xe2\x80\x9cThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\xe2\x80\x9d on Sept. 26, T. S. Eliot\xe2\x80\x99s birthday. Or perhaps, best of all, an afternoon of the concupiscent curds in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Emperor of Ice Cream\xe2\x80\x9d on Aug. 2, which is the day Wallace Stevens died.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Autism Fraud'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 13):'b'The latest British Medical Journal paper about autism and vaccines, which provides evidence that the initial report linking autism and vaccines was fraudulent, and the media coverage that ensued, miss an important point: Until science discovers the causes of autism and explains its dramatic increase, parents will continue to reach their own conclusions and desperately try a wide range of treatments, whether there is evidence to support them or not.'b'The answer is not to look to the past and look for blame, but rather to look to the future. We need increased research financing directed toward rigorous science that can provide the answers that parents are looking for and deserve. Until this happens, we will continue to wallow in controversy, and people with autism and families will continue to struggle with autism on their own.'b'Geraldine Dawson'b'\nChief Science Officer, Autism Speaks'b'\nNew York, Jan. 13, 2011'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Inadequate Fight Against Drugs Hampers Russia\xe2\x80\x99s Ability to Curb H.I.V.'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Memo From Russia, Jan. 17):'b'Russia could benefit from our experiences in New York City dealing with drug addicts.'b'Twenty-three years ago, I helped create one of the first H.I.V./AIDS prevention and care programs in the United States for injecting drug users.

Angell'b'\nDirector,  World Resources Report'b'\nWorld Resources Institute'b'\nWashington, Jan. 18, 2011'b''b''b''b'Duane Clarridge burst onto the public stage in the mid-1980s for his role in the Iran-Contra scandal. The scheme involved selling weapons to Iran and using the proceeds to fund rebels trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan government. A career officer in the Central Intelligence Agency, Mr. Clarridge, known to virtually everyone as Dewey, was indicted for lying to Congress about the operation but was pardoned by President George H.W. Bush before his trial was finished.'b'Unfortunately, the experience doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have taught him a lesson or chastened him one bit. Mr. Clarridge, 78, is still organizing spy missions of questionable legality and seeking to interfere with foreign governments, this time from his poolside perch in San Diego.'b'As'b' reported by Mark Mazzetti on Sunday in The Times'b', for two years, Mr. Clarridge has fielded operatives in Afghanistan and Pakistan. They gather information on militants, Taliban leaders and Kabul\xe2\x80\x99s ruling class and make reports to military officials and private sector hard-liners, including Oliver North, another Iran-Contra alumni, who is now a television commentator.'b'Initially, Mr. Clarridge operated under a Defense Department contract arranged by a civilian employee who is now under criminal investigation. After the Pentagon ended his financing last May, he turned to private donors. Among his exploits: trying to discredit President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan by \xe2\x80\x9cproving\xe2\x80\x9d he is a drug addict \xe2\x80\x94 a charge American officials flatly deny.'b'There are serious questions about whether some of his activities may violate the so-called Neutrality Act, which bars private citizens from actively undermining a foreign government. What we do know is that there should be no place in our democracy for this kind of rogue operation.'b'Outsourcing functions in a war zone to private gunslingers is dangerous and invites abuse. Mr. Clarridge long ago proved that he will do pretty much anything to advance his agenda, no matter the cost to the national interest. The Justice Department should investigate and the Pentagon should make clear to military commanders that his reports should not be sought or relied on.'b'President Obama will be talking about economic growth and competitiveness in the State of the Union address Tuesday night. It will be interesting to see if he talks about it in the standard way or in a visionary way.'b'The conventional way would be fine \xe2\x80\x94 expanding exports, reforming education, adjusting corporate tax rates to help firms compete. But it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t really give the country what it hungers for. The country wants a more precise vision of what a thriving America is going to look like in the 21st century. It also wants Obama to define, once and for all, his vision of government\xe2\x80\x99s role.'b'A visionary speech might begin with the fact that America\xe2\x80\x99s position in the world is changing. In the 20th century, America was the Big Dog nation. We had more money, more resources and more skilled labor, and we could outcompete our rivals by dominating the inputs and the outputs \xe2\x80\x94 by pouring in more talent, greater investments and more resources.'b'In the 21st century, the U.S. will no longer be the Big Dog. Human capital will be more broadly dispersed. There will be an array of affluent nations fully engaged in the global economy. Therefore, competitiveness will be more about organizing relationships than amassing force. To thrive, America will have to be the crossroads nation where global talent congregates and collaborates.'b'Parents in middle-class nations around the world should want to send their kids to American colleges. Young strivers should dream of working in Hollywood or Silicon Valley. Entrepreneurs from Israel to Indonesia should be visiting venture-capital firms in San Francisco or capital markets in New York. Global engineers should want to learn the plastics techniques in Akron and retailers should learn branding and distribution in Bentonville and Park Slope.'b'In this century, economic competition between countries is less like the competition between armies or sports teams (with hermetically sealed units bashing or racing against each other). It\xe2\x80\x99s more like the competition between elite universities, who vie for prestige in a networked search for knowledge. It\xe2\x80\x99s less: \xe2\x80\x9cWe will crush you with our efficiency and might.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s more: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have the best talent and the best values, so if you want to make the most of your own capacities, you\xe2\x80\x99ll come join us.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The new sort of competition is all about charisma. It\xe2\x80\x99s about gathering talent in one spot (in the information economy, geography matters more than ever because people are most creative when they collaborate face to face). This concentration of talent then attracts more talent, which creates more collaboration, which multiplies everybody\xe2\x80\x99s skills, which attracts more talent and so on.'b'The nation with the most diverse creative hot spots will dominate the century.'b'If this is the nature of competitiveness, what is the role for government? Well, government will be a bit like the administration of a university. A university president is nominally the head of the institutions. He or she lives in the big house. But everybody knows a university president is a powerful stagehand.'b'The professors, the researchers, the tutors, the coaches and the students are the real guts of a university. They handle the substance of what gets done. The administrators play vital but secondary roles. They build the settings. They raise money. They recruit and do marketing. They help students who are stumbling.'b'The administrators couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly understand or control the work in the physics or history departments. They just try to gather talent, set guidelines and create an atmosphere where brilliance can happen.'b'So it is with government in an innovation economy. Entrepreneurs, corporate executives, line workers and store managers handle the substance of the economy. Government tries to nurture settings where brilliance can happen.'b'First, government establishes an overall climate, with competitive tax rates and predictable regulations and fiscal balance. Tax rates don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be rock bottom. Companies will pay more if there are other amenities to compensate. But everything should be structured to nurture new business formation.'b'Then government actively concentrates talent. City governments are used to thinking in this way, while national governments lag. For example, Robert Steel, the deputy mayor of New York City, gave an excellent speech on Dec. 16 on how to build a bioscience center in Brooklyn and how to build an engineering center on Staten Island or Roosevelt Island. The speech was about using government to build hubs.'b'Finally, the government has to work aggressively to reduce the human capital inequalities that open up in an innovation economy. That means early and constant interventions so everybody has a chance to participate.'b'President Obama exists because his father was drawn to study in the United States. Obama embodies America\xe2\x80\x99s nascent role as the crossroads nation. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see if he can describe the next phase of American greatness.'b'If there\xe2\x80\x99s a better government program than Social Security, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know what it is.'b'It has gone a long way toward eliminating poverty among the elderly. Great numbers of them used to live and die in ghastly, Dickensian conditions of extreme want. Without Social Security today, nearly half of all Americans aged 65 or older would be poor. With it, fewer than 10 percent live in poverty.'b'The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities tells us that close to 90 percent of people 65 and older get at least some of their family income from Social Security. For more than half of the elderly, it provides the majority of their income. For many, it is the only income they have.'b'When you see surveillance videos of some creep mugging an elderly person in an elevator or apartment lobby, the universal reaction is outrage. But when the fat cats and the ideologues want to hack away at the lifeline of Social Security, they are treated somehow as respectable, even enlightened members of the society.'b'We need a reality check. Attacking Social Security is both cruel and unnecessary. It needs to stop.'b'The demagogues would have the public believe that Social Security is unsustainable, that it is some kind of giant contributor to the federal budget deficits. Nothing could be further from the truth. As the Economic Policy Institute has explained, Social Security \xe2\x80\x9cis emphatically not the cause of the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s long-term deficits, since it is prohibited from borrowing and must pay all benefits out of dedicated tax revenues and savings in its trust funds.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Franklin Roosevelt couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been clearer about the crucial role of the payroll taxes used to finance Social Security. They gave the beneficiaries a \xe2\x80\x9clegal, moral and political right\xe2\x80\x9d to collect their benefits, he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWith those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my Social Security program.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There has always been feverish opposition on the right to Social Security. What is happening now, in a period of deficit hysteria, is that this crucial retirement program is being dishonestly lumped together with Medicare as an entitlement program that is driving federal deficits. Medicare costs are a serious problem, but that\xe2\x80\x99s because of the nightmarish expansion of health care costs in general.'b'Beyond Medicare, the major drivers of the deficits are not talked about so much by the fat cats and demagogues because they were either responsible for them, or are reaping gargantuan benefits from them, or both. The country is drowning in a sea of debt because of the obscene Bush tax cuts for the rich, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that have never been paid for and the Great Recession.'b'Mugging the nation\xe2\x80\x99s grandparents by depriving them of some of their modest, hard-earned Social Security retirement benefits is hardly an answer to the nation\xe2\x80\x99s ills. And, believe me, those benefits are modest. The average benefit is just $14,000 a year, which is less than the minimum wage would pay. With employer-provided pensions going the way of the typewriter and pay telephones, the income from Social Security is becoming more precious by the day.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have Social Security, we\xe2\x80\x99d have to invent it right now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Roger Hickey, co-director of the Campaign for America\xe2\x80\x99s Future. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly suited to the terrible times we\xe2\x80\x99re going through. Hardly anyone has pensions anymore. People\xe2\x80\x99s private savings have taken a huge hit, and home prices have been hit hard. So the private savings that so many seniors and soon-to-be seniors have counted on have just been wiped out.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSocial Security is still there, and it\xe2\x80\x99s still paying out retirement benefits indexed to wages. It\xe2\x80\x99s the one part of the retirement stool that is working.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The deficit hawks and the right-wingers can scream all they want, but there is no Social Security crisis. There is a foreseeable problem with the program\xe2\x80\x99s long-term financing, but it can be fixed with changes that do no harm to its elderly beneficiaries. One obvious step would be to raise the cap on payroll taxes so that wealthy earners shoulder a fairer share of the burden.'b'The alarmist rhetoric should cease. Americans have enough economic problems to worry about without being petrified that their Social Security benefits will be curtailed. A Gallup poll taken recently found that 90 percent of Americans ages 44 to 75 believed that the country was facing a retirement crisis. Nearly two-thirds were more fearful of depleting their assets than they were of dying. The fears about retirement are well placed  \xe2\x80\x94  most Americans do not have enough to retire on. But there should be no reason to believe that Social Security is in jeopardy.'b'The folks who want to raise the retirement age and hack away at benefits for ordinary working Americans are inevitably those who have not the least worry about their own retirement. The haves so often get a perverse kick out of bullying the have-nots.'b'The Republicans have vowed to \xe2\x80\x9crepeal and replace\xe2\x80\x9d President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s historic health care reform law. Now that House Republicans have muscled through a symbolic repeal bill, they will have to deliver their own alternative plan. Don\xe2\x80\x99t expect much.'b'There are many more slogans than details. But it is already clear that their approach would do almost nothing to control skyrocketing health care costs and would provide little help to the 50 million uninsured Americans.'b'When Republican leaders talk of reducing medical costs they really mean reducing insurance premiums for some people, primarily by letting the young and healthy buy insurance in states that allow the sale of skimpy policies. That won\xe2\x80\x99t help older and less healthy people and would probably drive up their premiums as they flock to states whose regulations guarantee them coverage.'b'The Republicans have offered no coherent plan for slowing the rapid rise in medical costs that is driving up insurance premiums, Medicare and Medicaid costs, and the federal deficit. The reform law, by contrast, has multiple provisions for changing the delivery of health care in ways that should reduce costs.'b'As for the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 calls to reduce waste and fraud in Medicare, reform the medical malpractice system, and expand high-risk pools to cover people with pre-existing conditions, most of these ideas are already in the reform law. They could surely be strengthened if both parties worked together.'b'Even as it denounces reform at every turn, the Republican leadership has figured out that many Americans want the many consumer protections that come with the new law. So, once reform is repealed, the leaders are vowing to reinstate such provisions as letting young people stay on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 plans until age 26, preventing insurers from canceling policies after people become sick, and barring insurers from placing caps on what they will pay.'b'The problem is that such requirements will drive up the cost of insurance unless they are paired with a mandate (or comparable prod) requiring that everyone buy insurance so that healthy people offset the costs of less healthy beneficiaries. Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s the same mandate the Republicans have vowed to overturn.'b'Many Republicans have also vowed to restore more than $130 billion worth of unjustified subsidies to private Medicare Advantage plans that is needed to help pay for the expansion of coverage under health care reform.'b'In coming weeks, expect to see a lot more posturing on issues that might energize the party\xe2\x80\x99s conservative base or poll well with people made skittish by months of Republican exaggerations about the new reform law. They have already introduced bills making it even harder for insurance policies in new insurance exchanges to cover abortions, never mind that the law already has incredibly strict provisions.'b'The Party of No will also try to use its new control of the House to block implementation of reform by withholding money needed to hire people to write necessary regulations. The House Republican Study Committee has proposed legislation that would prohibit using money in the annual budget to carry out any provision of the law or to defend it in court.'b'The Republicans need to explain how they plan to address the problems of covering the uninsured, wrestling down medical costs and controlling the deficit. Just saying no isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough.'b'At the Supreme Court last week, Justice Antonin Scalia summed up what he and other justices seemed to consider the least bad outcome in a difficult case: \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me you call the game off.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The game in this case is a multibillion-dollar contract the government made in 1988 with General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas to build a stealth aircraft, the A-12 Avenger. The issue before the court in General Dynamics Corporation v. United States is whether the government can use the state-secrets privilege to avoid explaining why it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t share classified technology with them. Two weeks before the companies were supposed to deliver an initial A-12 prototype, they reported it would be delayed a year or more. Six months later, the government canceled the contract, saying the companies had defaulted. The contractors\xe2\x80\x99 primary defense was that the government caused the delay by not sharing information with them, and they insist they should be paid for work done before the contract was ended.'b'If the court favors the government\xe2\x80\x99s argument, the government will collect $2.9 billion \xe2\x80\x94 $1.35 billion it claims it\xe2\x80\x99s owed under the contract, plus 20 years of interest. If the contractors prevail, they will collect $2.6 billion \xe2\x80\x94 $1.2 billion to cover \xe2\x80\x9cactual costs\xe2\x80\x9d plus interest.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to see why Justice Scalia sought what he called \xe2\x80\x9ca \xe2\x80\x98go away\xe2\x80\x99 principle of jurisprudence,\xe2\x80\x9d with no more money changing hands. But that would require ignoring the trouble with the state-secrets privilege.'b'In the name of fighting terrorism, under President George W. Bush, it became a doctrine used far too frequently to cover up illegal and embarrassing acts. The Obama administration has adopted the Bush policies virtually wholesale, protecting the government from accounting for its misdeeds by denying even a day in court to their victims \xe2\x80\x94 like Maher Arar, the Canadian victim of mistaken identity who was arrested and flown to Syria to be tortured. It\xe2\x80\x99s essential for the justices to address the privilege\xe2\x80\x99s faults.'b'In a 1953 ruling in United States v. Reynolds about the deaths of civilians in a military plane crash, the court first recognized and upheld the privilege, agreeing the government could withhold a report about the crash because there was \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable danger\xe2\x80\x9d that information about secret electronic equipment would be disclosed. The privilege has since been broadened and overused. As a lower court said in the General Dynamics case, the government has used the privilege \xe2\x80\x9cfor tactical purposes\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9can unfair advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The court should narrow the privilege to what it was in Reynolds, a limited basis for the government not to disclose a piece of evidence so it can\xe2\x80\x99t be invoked to dismiss entire claims or cases. The court should also rule that trial judges faced with claims of privilege must examine the evidence to ensure they are convinced about the risk to national security from disclosure.'b'The evidence in the Reynolds case has since been declassified. We know that if the trial judge had looked at the \xe2\x80\x9cprotected\xe2\x80\x9d report, he would have found proof only of Air Force negligence that caused the plane\xe2\x80\x99s crash. There was no mention of military intelligence. In Reynolds, the government hoodwinked the Supreme Court. The court should honor the gravity of real state secrets by assuring that other kinds of information can\xe2\x80\x99t be hidden behind this privilege.'b'To the Editor:'b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'Take a Test to Really Learn, Research Suggests'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (news article, Jan. 21):'b'What a boon this piece of research seems to be for those who believe that the primary mission of classrooms is test preparation.

Kellner'b'\nMember of Assembly'b'\nAlbany, Jan. 18, 2011'b''b''b'Washington'b'IT has lately become the accepted wisdom that the Middle East peace process is dead, finished, kaput. This belief has been reinforced by Al Jazeera\xe2\x80\x99s release this week of some 1,600 documents that are said to 'b'describe the inside workings of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations'b' in 2008.'b'The arguments claiming that the peace process is dead come from all corners: Some contend that the Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the West Bank, is ineffectual or illegitimate. Some say the asymmetry of power between Israel and the Palestinians is simply too great for a genuine compromise. Some insist the conflict is driven by unabated anti-Semitic incitement on the part of the Palestinians, or by irredeemable Israeli racism.'b'Other arguments are more specific. Some analysts feel that the real problem is that the Palestine Liberation Organization has become trapped by the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s quest for a settlement freeze, which has prevented direct negotiations with Israel. Still another argument points out that Gaza, which has no future independent of the rest of Palestine, remains under the boot of the brutal fundamentalists of Hamas, rendering the P.L.O. incapable of delivering a final status agreement for the whole of the Palestinian people.'b'It is also argued that the threat of a nuclear Iran, and the support to Hamas and other extremists provided by Tehran, makes a deal impossible. And many observers have noted that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, perched atop a governing coalition that is both internally argumentative and habitually intransigent, has not provided much confidence in the chances of even a provisional compromise, especially as settlers continue to build in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.'b'There are large elements of truth to many of these observations. Yet there are other, more heartening, trends that have gone largely unnoticed. And there are indeed palatable steps that both the Israelis and the Palestinians could take, separately but simultaneously \xe2\x80\x94 call it joint unilateralism \xe2\x80\x94 that could help revive the peace process.'b'We tend to forget, amid the welter of commentary about Palestinian incitement and Israeli belligerence, that we have recently seen startling shifts in both Israeli and Palestinian attitudes on the need for compromise. The Palestinian Authority government, led by President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, two of the most conscientious and sober-minded leaders the Palestinian people have had, continues to push forward a remarkable state-building program, and has been innovative in working against violence and incitement.'b'In Israel, the shift is also startling. Prime Minister Netanyahu \xe2\x80\x94 the leader of the Likud Party, which was previously the guardian of the ideology of territorial maximalism \xe2\x80\x94  has openly endorsed the creation of an independent Palestine. A majority of Knesset members plainly realize the necessity of a two-state solution. (Even Israel\xe2\x80\x99s truculent foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, has said that he was 'b' \xe2\x80\x9cready to quit my settlement home to make peace.\xe2\x80\x9d'b')'b'Mr. Netanyahu, in a quiet way, has also encouraged a greater normalization of life on the West Bank. On his watch, the overall pace of settlement growth has slowed, especially when compared with previous Labor Party-led governments during the years of the Oslo peace process. He allowed the Palestinian flag to be raised in his private residence during a formal meeting with Mr. Abbas, and now employs the diplomatic term \xe2\x80\x9cWest Bank\xe2\x80\x9d instead of the biblical term \xe2\x80\x9cJudea and Samaria.\xe2\x80\x9d He has also 'b'condemned an initiative'b' offered by a group of Orthodox rabbis that sought to forbid Jews from selling or renting homes to non-Jews.'b'But it is on the Palestinian side that change has been the most notable. Gaza, of course, remains an intractable problem, since no peace treaty will end the conflict so long as Hamas is in power and loyal to the uncompromising Muslim Brotherhood ideology it espouses.'b'The West Bank, however, has lately been the scene of undeniably impressive developments. The new, highly professional Palestinian Authority security forces have restored order in formerly anarchic cities like Jenin and Nablus. The resulting calm has spurred a high level of investment and improved the quality of life for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. It is almost impossible for those of us who saw firsthand the violence and chaos of the intifada that began in 2000 to quite believe the extent of positive change in the cities of the West Bank.'b'It is, in part, the high level of Palestinian security cooperation with Israel \xe2\x80\x94 involving intelligence sharing and on-the-ground measures \xe2\x80\x94 that has reduced violence so significantly. According to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s internal security agency, the Shin Bet, 2010 was Israel\xe2\x80\x99s most terror-free year in a decade. This has prompted Israel to remove many checkpoints from roads used by Palestinians, allowing for greater mobility, which also encourages economic growth. (The calm has also helped spur Israel\xe2\x80\x99s economy to new heights.) Still, Israeli incursions into Palestinian Authority-controlled territory have been damaging to the authority, and should be carried out only for essential security reasons, not political ones.'b'The Palestinian Authority in the last three years has completed more than 1,700 community development programs across the West Bank, and built 120 schools, three hospitals and 50 health clinics. Prime Minister Fayyad has created what is probably the most transparent public finance system in the Arab world. The court system is being reformed (though it is still susceptible to corruption) and it has seen a jump in the number of criminal prosecutions. Around 1,000 miles of roads have been paved and 850 miles of water pipes have been installed. The Palestinians of the West Bank are finally beginning to build their state.'b'But this project is as fragile as it is vital for the international community, and especially for Israel. Its future as a Jewish democratic state depends on the creation of a peaceful, democratic and stable Palestinian state by its side.'b'There are a number of steps that Israel could take to help Palestinian moderates. They are, in the main, not overly onerous, and not irreversible should Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security be newly threatened. But they could have a galvanizing effect on the attitudes of Palestinians who doubt the possibility of reaching a two-state solution.'b'Mr. Netanyahu, who acknowledges the effectiveness of the Palestinian security forces, could allow these forces to develop advanced counterterrorism capacities, which they do not now possess. This would carry some obvious risks, but also some obvious benefits: the sine qua non of governance is the provision of basic security, and meaningful security cooperation is the most powerful argument against the idea that an independent Palestinian state would be a threat to Israel.'b'Prime Minister Netanyahu could also cede control of more West Bank land to the Palestinian Authority. It is crucial that the Palestinian government be allowed to rule in areas that are generally understood to be part of the future Palestinian state.'b'And though Mr. Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s interest in Palestinian economic development is commendable, the notion that \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic peace,\xe2\x80\x9d as he terms it, is a substitute for a comprehensive, negotiated agreement is wrongheaded. This is a political conflict, and a political conflict requires a political solution. The term \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic peace\xe2\x80\x9d also suggests to Palestinians that Israel is set on depriving them of their right to national self-determination, and has caused some Palestinians to misread the authority\xe2\x80\x99s state-building program as an instrument of Israeli government manipulation and control.'b'Of course, no Palestinian state will emerge on a West Bank blanketed with settlements, and the future of the larger, more far-flung settlements must ultimately be decided by a negotiated agreement. However, a modified and limited, but very public and systematic, withdrawal of settlers from remote or particularly confrontational settlements, especially from the so-called outposts that even Israel considers illegal, would have a powerful effect on Palestinian perceptions about Israel\xe2\x80\x99s long-term intentions.'b'WE do not expect Israel to unilaterally withdraw both its military and the settlers from the West Bank, particularly given the consequences of Ariel Sharon\xe2\x80\x99s flawed unilateral disengagement from Gaza, which ultimately led to the rise of Hamas. No doubt Israeli troops will remain in control of settlements until there is a negotiated withdrawal, whether it occurs in one stroke or in stages. But we believe even a modest effort by Israel to reverse the pattern of settlement growth could strongly improve conditions for negotiations \xe2\x80\x94 and improve Israel\xe2\x80\x99s sinking image.'b'It should also go without saying that the forced removal of Palestinians from their homes in East Jerusalem to make way for settlers simply cannot continue. Mr. Sharon\xe2\x80\x99s Gaza plan was flawed, but the insight that brought it about (one shared by his successor, Ehud Olmert) was acute: Israel has no future as the occupier of Palestinians who don\xe2\x80\x99t agree to be occupied. One hopes that Mr. Netanyahu shares that insight, although one must also recognize that politically he has every incentive to remain ambiguous.'b'There are important steps the Palestinians can take, as well, that would create a more positive atmosphere for negotiations. Last August, Prime Minister Fayyad pledged, in a widely broadcast speech, to use the West Bank\xe2\x80\x99s public education system to combat religious and political fanaticism. And while many Hamas-influenced imams and schoolteachers in the West Bank have been removed from the state payroll, incitement and indoctrination continue. The Palestinian Authority should follow through on Mr. Fayyad\xe2\x80\x99s promise, and the rest of the world should support this with as much financial and technical assistance as possible.'b'Things have been further complicated in recent weeks as several Latin American states have recognized the Palestinians and upgraded the diplomatic status of their missions. Many Israelis are discomfited by this. The P.L.O. should be as clear as possible that these efforts do not constitute an end-run around an American-brokered negotiated agreement, but are an adjunct to both negotiations and the state-building program.'b'The best Israeli response to these initiatives would be to institute confidence-building measures that demonstrate that the key to Palestinian independence does not lie with Chile and Bolivia, but with Israel and the United States. Palestinians understand, of course, that at the end of the day, their independence depends on one country, Israel, more than any other, since it is Israel that controls the land that would comprise their state.'b'THERE are, however, Palestinian initiatives that are completely counterproductive. Continued threats to unilaterally declare independence are pointless and provocative. Support for boycotts against all Israeli products and companies also serve only to convince Israel and its supporters that the Palestinians seek its elimination. Israel is a member of the United Nations and must not be delegitimized. It is understandable that Palestinians are supporting boycotts of products made in settlements, however, since the settlements are illegitimate and must not be legitimized.'b'There are two other steps that the Israelis and Palestinians could take that could reignite hope. The first would see the end of obfuscation about long-term intentions. Both sides need to emphasize their commitment to a genuine two-state solution with an independent, sovereign Palestine living alongside Israel in peace and security. Ambiguity on this point for cynical political purposes is destroying confidence on both sides in the capacity of the other to compromise. At least since the Camp David talks of 2000, both parties have argued one line in public and another behind closed doors, an unhappy tactic that has been underscored by Al Jazeera\xe2\x80\x99s release of the alleged diplomatic documents.'b'Polls show that a majority of Israelis and Palestinians say they both want a two-state solution, but also say they believe the other side is lying. Peace will not come if politicians refuse to prepare their citizens for it through clear and consistent language. Officially produced Israeli and Palestinian advertisements and maps that depict Israel as Palestine and vice versa must also be put to an end.'b'The other step is even more difficult to achieve, because it requires the softening of hearts. In 1997, a Jordanian soldier murdered seven Israel schoolgirls who were on an outing on an island in the Jordan River. King Hussein of Jordan crossed the border and visited the families of the girls to apologize for their deaths. In Israeli eyes, this simple act of compassion transformed the king from an enemy into a hero.'b'Imagine, then, what would happen if Mahmoud Abbas were to visit Israel and tell Israelis he acknowledges that they have national and historical rights on the land between the Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea, and that he understands their suffering. And imagine what would happen if Benjamin Netanyahu were to visit Ramallah, acknowledge Palestinian suffering and also Palestinian national and historical rights, particularly to a country of their own, on their native land.'b'The two of us have been following the Middle East peace talks for years, and we are not na\xc3\xafve about the chances for peace. We disagree on a dozen aspects of this conflict, which is not surprising for an Arab and a Jew. But we also know that giving up or walking away is not an option, because the alternative to compromise is the abyss.'b'Senate Democrats now have a rare opportunity to reduce the abuse of the filibuster and increase the chances that the people\xe2\x80\x99s work actually gets done. Instead, they are close to an agreement on a watered-down package of changes that will have only a modest effect on the chamber\xe2\x80\x99s gridlock.'b'Over the last four years, Republicans have more than doubled the number of filibusters from the previous period, requiring 60-vote supermajorities for virtually every measure to move forward. In most, a single senator has raised an objection, bringing progress to a halt.'b'A group of Democratic senators \xe2\x80\x94 led by Tom Udall of New Mexico and Jeff Merkley of Oregon \xe2\x80\x94 came up with 'b'a reasonable proposal'b' to reduce this practice while preserving the minority\xe2\x80\x99s right to wage a fight. It would require 10 senators to start a filibuster and then speak continuously on the floor to keep it going. If an issue is important enough to block, then senators should be willing to work for it and explain themselves to the public.'b'Democrats could have passed this rule change with a simple-majority vote. But Senate aides say several Democrats are afraid the new rules will put them at a disadvantage should their party fall to a minority. That misses a much more important point. The rules need to be changed not to cripple one party or the other but to improve the efficiency of the Senate no matter who is in power. There is no excuse for even routine budgets and spending bills to languish for lack of 60 votes.'b''b'The agreement being negotiated'b' by the leadership of both parties would at least make it harder to block presidential nominations with anonymous holds and would reduce the number of positions needing Senate confirmation \xe2\x80\x94 welcome changes.'b'The two parties are also expected to reach a \xe2\x80\x9chandshake agreement\xe2\x80\x9d to cut back on filibusters and allow the minority party a greater chance to offer amendments to bills. But such agreements can easily fall apart in the chamber\xe2\x80\x99s charged environment.'b'Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, said Tuesday that the matter would be settled shortly. That means there is still a chance for the Senate to adopt real rules, allowing majority votes to prevail in most circumstances and reserving delaying tactics for unusual cases. Without this reform, the Senate will remain dysfunctional.'b'A court hearing this month in Manhattan turned on a subject that has mostly been missing in the legal response to former President George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s abusive detention policies: some measure of accountability.'b'The focus of the hearing before Judge Alvin Hellerstein of Federal District Court was not torture itself but the Central Intelligence Agency\xe2\x80\x99s deliberate destruction in 2005 of dozens of videotapes made three years earlier showing the brutal interrogation of high-level terrorism suspects, including the simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding. At the time, the agency had been ordered by Judge Hellerstein to preserve the tapes.'b'They were part of the evidence being sought in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union under the Freedom of Information Act seeking details of prisoner mistreatment. Their destruction was seen as so egregious that the Bush administration felt compelled to order a special investigation when it was disclosed.'b'In November, the special prosecutor handling that investigation, John Durham, decided against bringing criminal charges against any C.I.A. official. No details of his decision were provided, leaving it unclear why those involved were not charged with any crime.'b'Now Judge Hellerstein is grappling with a way to respond with appropriate firmness to the flouting of his order. At the Jan. 14 hearing, he wondered aloud about the value and appropriateness of civil contempt sanctions. But he also expressed a desire for a resolution that recognizes the gravity of the action by C.I.A. officials and makes a recurrence less likely.'b'The C.I.A.\xe2\x80\x99s decision to destroy the tapes \xe2\x80\x94 rather than submit them to the judge for a decision on whether to order their public release \xe2\x80\x94 was a serious affront to the court and the rule of law. A contempt order is not a perfect remedy, but it would at least provide some official acknowledgment that what the C.I.A. did was wrong. The agency\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer suggested the government pay the A.C.L.U.\xe2\x80\x99s legal fees. That would be deeply inadequate.'b'News that Borders, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s second-largest book chain after Barnes &amp; Noble, is teetering on the brink of a bankruptcy filing has made book publishers even more nervous about their online future.'b'The recording industry, which preceded books\xe2\x80\x99 move online by about a decade, sold $7.7 billion worth of music in 2009, down from $14.3 billion in 2000. Electronic books are much easier to pirate than songs and movies \xe2\x80\x94 a fact made clear when Dan Brown\xe2\x80\x99s blockbuster \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lost Symbol\xe2\x80\x9d was downloaded illicitly more than 100,000 times within days of hitting stores in 2009.'b'Despite all that, we are happy to say that it\xe2\x80\x99s far too early to kiss book publishing goodbye. E-book sales more than doubled in the first 11 months of last year \xe2\x80\x94 to about 8 percent of total sales. E-readers are flying off the shelves, and overall book sales are holding up as the paper-based industry transitions to the digital age, increasing 3.5 percent in the first 11 months of 2010.'b'The resilience of the book business may be because of demographics. Like jazz, which is less prone to illicit downloads than hip-hop, books cater to older, less Internet-savvy customers. Publishers also avoided the recording industry\xe2\x80\x99s mistake of wasting precious time suing customers and have rightly focused on promoting cheap and easy ways for them to download books legally.'b'Books, as a cultural product, face important pressures. The pursuit of blockbusters by big publishers and retailers means that potential readers are exposed to a narrower set of titles. Americans have more choices on how to spend their spare time. Some argue that the short texts usually found on the Internet are changing readers\xe2\x80\x99 habits, perhaps reducing our attention spans.'b'Yet for all the fear of reading\xe2\x80\x99s demise, books have survived similar challenges before. Over the last 50 years, books have had to contend with television, then cable, VCRs, DVDs, PCs, laptops, iPods, iPhones and iPads. Despite all these diversions, Americans spend a larger share of their budgets on books today than they did in 1960. Though book sales have declined slightly in the last 10 years as a share of consumer spending, they have still grown more than 15 percent over the period, after accounting for inflation. And Nooks, Kindles and the like might actually help books gain a wider following by taking the bookstore to the customer.'b'This nation faces huge problems \xe2\x80\x94 putting millions of Americans back to work, investing to compete in a 21st-century global economy and wrestling down a long-term budget deficit that threatens everyone\xe2\x80\x99s future.'b'Ever since the 2010 campaign, we have heard precious little in the way of serious solutions \xe2\x80\x94 mostly just smoke-and-mirrors spending cuts from Republicans and their usual clamor for more tax cuts for the wealthy.'b'Tuesday night\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union address was President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s chance to rise above that pinched vision, to help Americans understand that while government cannot do everything, it is indispensable in reviving the economy, spurring innovation, educating Americans and keeping them healthy and making the nation competitive globally.'b'Mr. Obama took on those issues, and the Republicans, squarely. Rebutting their single-minded focus on slashing discretionary domestic spending, Mr. Obama said we have to \xe2\x80\x9cstop pretending\xe2\x80\x9d that cutting this kind of spending \xe2\x80\x9calone will be enough.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The speech was a chance for Mr. Obama to talk about the need for government investment in highways and railroads, schools and new, clean-energy industries. And we were encouraged that Mr. Obama set national goals in these areas \xe2\x80\x94 85 percent of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s energy should come from clean energy by 2035; 80 percent of Americans should have access to high-speed rail within 25 years; and 98 percent should have access to high-speed wireless within five years.'b'These are grand, and expensive, ideas, and it was vital that Mr. Obama talked about the need to pay for new spending.'b'He proposed eliminating taxpayer subsidies for oil companies, for example, to help pay for his clean-energy initiative. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed,\xe2\x80\x9d the president said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut they\xe2\x80\x99re doing just fine on their own. So instead of subsidizing yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s energy, let\xe2\x80\x99s invest in tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Obama also is calling for extending his proposed three-year freeze on some discretionary programs to five years. The White House said that would create $400 billion in savings over 10 years \xe2\x80\x94 a deep cut at a bad time, but far saner than Republican calls to slash spending so deeply that it would surely cripple the recovery.'b'The White House said Mr. Obama needed to make some proposal like that to remain in the debate. That is likely true. But he also made clear that there is no long-term solution without cutting military spending and mandatory spending on Medicare and Social Security.'b'He made a strong case for ending the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy when they expire in two years. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore we take money away from our schools or scholarships away from our students, we should ask millionaires to give up their tax break,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s important, but letting high-end tax breaks expire won\xe2\x80\x99t raise enough revenue to pay for needed investments or reduce long-term deficits. Mr. Obama proposed to simplify both the corporate income tax and the personal income tax, but he did not call for raising other taxes. Americans may not want to hear that taxes have to go up, but until Mr. Obama and other political leaders are willing to say so, credible deficit reduction will remain out of reach.'b'Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s speech offered a welcome contrast to all of the posturing that passes for business in the new Republican-controlled House. On Tuesday, House Republicans pushed through a resolution calling for reducing spending on domestic programs to 2008 levels. In a fragile economy, cutting spending on transportation, education, scientific research, food safety and childhood nutrition will do huge damage.'b'At times Tuesday night, Mr. Obama was genuinely inspiring with a vision for the country to move forward with confidence and sense of responsibility.

A sophisticated half-megabyte of computer code apparently accomplished what a half-decade of United Nations Security Council resolutions could not.'b'This new form of warfare has several implications that are only now becoming apparent, and that will define the shape of what will likely become the next global arms race \xe2\x80\x94 albeit one measured in computer code rather than firepower.'b'For one thing, the Stuxnet attack highlights the ambiguous boundaries of sovereignty in cyberspace. Promoting national security in the information age will, from time to time, cause unpredictable offense to the rights and interests of innocent people, companies and countries.'b'Stuxnet attacked the Iranian nuclear program, but it did so by maliciously manipulating commercial software products sold globally by major Western companies. Whoever launched the assault also infected thousands of computers in several countries, including Australia, Britain, Indonesia and the United States.'b'This kind of collateral damage to the global civilian realm is going to be the norm, not the exception, and advanced economies, which are more dependent on advanced information systems, will be at particular risk.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s more, offensive and defensive information warfare are tightly, insidiously coupled, which will significantly complicate military-industrial relations.'b'The expertise needed to defend against a cyberattack is essentially indistinguishable from that needed to make such an attack. The Stuxnet programmers are reported to have exploited proprietary information that had been voluntarily provided to the American government by Siemens, that German company that makes data-and-control programs used in nuclear power facilities \xe2\x80\x94 including Iran\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'Siemens did this to help Washington build up its ability to fend off cyberattacks. Will Siemens and other companies think twice next time the American government calls? Probably. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s true or not, as far as the rest of the world is concerned, the United States is now in the business of offensive information warfare, along with China, Israel and Russia, among others.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to imagine, then, the splintering of the global information technology industry into multiple camps according to their willingness to cooperate with governments on security matters. We can already see this happening in the telecommunications industry, where companies promote their products\xe2\x80\x99 resistance to government intrusion. At the same time, other companies might see an advantage to working closely with the government.'b'Stuxnet also raises sticky and perhaps irresolvable legal questions. At present there is no real legal framework for adjudicating international cyberattacks; even if victims could determine who was responsible, their governments have few options outside of diplomatic complaints and, perhaps, retaliation in kind. An international entity that could legislate or enforce an information warfare armistice does not exist, and is not really conceivable.'b'A similar question exists within the United States. Under American law the transmission of malicious code is in many cases a criminal offense. This makes sense, given the economy\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on information networks, the sensitivity of stored electronic data and the ever-present risk of attack from viruses, worms and other varieties of malware.'b'But the president, as commander in chief, does have some authority to conduct offensive information warfare against foreign adversaries. However, as with many presidential powers to wage war and conduct espionage, the extent of his authority has never been enumerated.'b'This legal ambiguity is problematic because such warfare is far less controllable than traditional military and intelligence operations, and it raises much more complex issues of private property, personal privacy and commercial integrity.'b'Therefore, before our courts are forced to consider the issue and potentially limit executive powers, as they did after President Harry Truman tried to seize steel plants in the early 1950s, Congress should grant the White House broad authority to wage offensive information warfare.'b'By explicitly authorizing these offensive operations in appropriate, defined circumstances, a new statute would strengthen the president\xe2\x80\x99s power to provide for the common defense in cyberspace. Doing so wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t answer all the questions that this new era of warfare presents. But one thing is sure: as bad as this arms race will be, losing it would be even worse.'b'VANCOUVER, British Columbia'b'IN January 1986, Basit and Amjad Alvi, sibling programmers living near the main train station in Lahore, Pakistan, wrote a piece of code to safeguard the latest version of their heart-monitoring software from piracy. They called it Brain, and it was basically a wheel-clamp for PCs. Computers that ran their program, plus this new bit of code, would stop working after a year,  though they cheerfully provided three telephone numbers, against the day. If you were a legitimate user, and could prove it, they\xe2\x80\x99d unlock you.'b'But in the way of all emergent technologies, something entirely unintended happened. The Alvis\xe2\x80\x99 wheel-clamp was soon copied by a certain stripe of computer hobbyist, who began to distribute it, concealed within various digital documents that people might be expected to want to open. Because almost all these booby-trapped files went out on floppy disks, 'b'the virus spread at a pre-Internet snail\xe2\x80\x99s pace'b'.'b'Still, it did wreak a certain amount of low-grade havoc, freezing computers across the world. The hobbyists did it because they could, or to proudly demonstrate that they could, or to see what would happen, or simply because they thought it was neat.'b'This proved hellishly embarrassing for the Alvi brothers, whose three telephone numbers were often inadvertently included in the files, and eventually they had to cut all three lines. There were far too many angry callers, mainly from the United States and Britain. In short, the road to our present universe teeming with viruses, worms and Trojan horses was paved, a quarter-century ago this month, with the Alvi brothers\xe2\x80\x99 good intentions of securing their intellectual property.'b'At the time, I found it surprising that these virus-writers were apparently amateurs, civilians. I had imagined computer viruses as strategic military weapons, the business of governments, not practical jokers. Viruses might be sometimes purloined by specialist criminals looking for a big score but were never something one could cobble together at home.'b'But precisely the opposite happened. Virus-writers seemed, at least at first, to be in it for anything but money. The outcome was simply vandalism, as dull as someone smashing out the light fixtures in a bus shelter. Random bits of software or pieces of equipment would temporarily quit functioning. Random strangers were anonymously discommoded. Somewhere, I assumed, someone had a rather abstract giggle.'b'I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t impressed, however arcane the know-how that was required. But I was embarrassed at how thoroughly I\xe2\x80\x99d missed this in my fiction: the pettiness of most virus-writing, the banality of the result. I had never depicted, much less imagined, anyone doing anything as pointlessly ill-intentioned. (I began to try, on the margins of my work, to remedy that oversight, if only for the sake of naturalism.)'b'Last fall, when I learned of the 'b''b'Stuxnet'b' attack on the computers running 'b'Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program'b''b', I briefly thought that here, finally, was the real thing: a cyberweapon purpose-built by one state actor to strategically interfere with the business of another.'b'But as more details emerged, it began to look less like something new and more like a piece of hobbyist \xe2\x80\x9cstreet\xe2\x80\x9d technology, albeit one expensively optimized for a specific attack. The state actor \xe2\x80\x94 said to be Israel, perhaps working with the United States, though no one is sure \xe2\x80\x94 had simply built on the unpaid labor of generations of hobbyist vandals.'b'Stuxnet isn\xe2\x80\x99t spectacularly original, as computer worms go, and those Iranian systems aren\xe2\x80\x99t terribly exotic. They\xe2\x80\x99re like ours. As a result, I expect we\xe2\x80\x99ll see a wave of unpleasant backwash, with military money and technology beefing up the code, the digital DNA, of the descendants of Brain.'b'Any hobbyist worth his or her salt will, in turn, be admiring the Stuxnet code that shut down the Iranian centrifuges, looking to imitate and improve on it. And non-state players, from digital vandals to terrorists, will be casting an appraising eye, if they haven\xe2\x80\x99t already, at the computers that monitor and control more ordinary but nonetheless critical systems: water treatment and distribution, sewage, oil and gas pipelines, electrical transmission lines, 'b'wind farms'b' and nuclear power plants.'b'Should the lights go out in our online bus shelters one day, or some critical control system go spectacularly awry, it may in a sense, however distantly, be because Israel found a way to shut down Iran\xe2\x80\x99s centrifuges. But in another way it will be the result of a bright idea two brothers once had, in the vicinity of Lahore Railway Station, to innocently clamp a digital pirate\xe2\x80\x99s wheel.'b'To the Editor:'b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'Glaxo\xe2\x80\x99s Legal Problems Lead to New $3.4 Billion Charge'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Business Day, Jan. 18) discussed the problems with the drugs Avandia and Paxil, both of which I prescribed for my patients in the past.

To enhance the sense of persecution, she stood in front of the photograph of Marines raising the flag at Iwo Jima and said that if they could \xe2\x80\x9cbeat back a totalitarian aggressor,\xe2\x80\x9d then present-day Americans too could \xe2\x80\x9cproclaim liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It was hard to reconcile those remarks with the actual speech delivered by the man implicitly accused of being the new totalitarian. President Obama called for some relatively modest investments in clean energy, education and infrastructure. He asked only the wealthiest taxpayers, along with the oil companies, to make financial sacrifices, and he called for corporate tax reform. He proposed a freeze on most discretionary spending and acknowledged the need for long-term rethinking of Social Security and other entitlement programs to cut the deficit. He even vowed to veto earmarks. These were proposals squarely in the tradition of previous addresses by Democratic \xe2\x80\x94 and Republican \xe2\x80\x94 presidents.'b'What really distinguished Mr. Obama from the three Republican leaders on display in a single night was not the specifics in the speech. It was the cheerful assertion that if the United States is to regain its footing in the world, it will be government that stands it upright. In surprisingly sunny terms considering the struggle about to begin, he said it was government that had unleashed the engineering of the Space Age and the Internet era. It will be government, he said, that prepares good teachers, makes college affordable, and provides incentives for businesses to hire.'b'The three Republicans portrayed government as a grim juggernaut that kills jobs and dreams and even, in Ms. Bachmann\xe2\x80\x99s nightmarish vision, enforces light-bulb standards. The only dream they presented was to cut and cut again. Mr. Obama cannot avoid the path toward eventual deficit reduction, but he is more likely than the doomsayers to persuade the nation to join him on the journey.'b' 'b''b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'One Small Revolution'b',\xe2\x80\x9d by Robert D.

Nor was it an overzealous mayor angering conservatives by pulling down Christmas decorations. Rather, it was a prominent bishop, Thomas Olmsted, stripping St. Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix of its affiliation with the Roman Catholic diocese.'b'The hospital\xe2\x80\x99s offense? It had terminated a pregnancy to save the life of the mother. The hospital says the 27-year-old woman, a mother of four children, would almost certainly have died otherwise.'b'Bishop Olmsted initially 'b'excommunicated a nun'b', Sister Margaret McBride, who had been on the hospital\xe2\x80\x99s ethics committee and had approved of the decision. That seems to have been a failed attempt to bully the hospital into submission, but it refused to cave and continues to employ Sister Margaret. Now the bishop, in effect, is excommunicating the entire hospital  \xe2\x80\x94  all because it saved a woman\xe2\x80\x99s life.'b'Make no mistake: This clash of values is a bellwether of a profound disagreement that is playing out at many Catholic hospitals around the country. These hospitals are part of the backbone of American health care, amounting to 15 percent of hospital beds.'b'Already in Bend, Ore., last year, a bishop ended the church\xe2\x80\x99s official relationship  with St. Charles Medical Center for making tubal ligation sterilizations available to women who requested them. And two Catholic hospitals in Texas halted tubal ligations at the insistence of the local bishop in Tyler.'b'The National Women\xe2\x80\x99s Law Center has just issued 'b'a report'b' quoting doctors at Catholic-affiliated hospitals as saying that sometimes they are forced by church doctrine to provide substandard care to women with miscarriages or ectopic pregnancies in ways that can leave the women infertile or even endanger their lives. More clashes are likely as the church hierarchy grows more conservative, and as hospitals and laity grow more impatient with bishops who seem increasingly out of touch.'b'Catholic hospitals like St. Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s that are evicted by the church continue to operate largely as before. The main consequence is that Mass can no longer be said in the hospital chapel. Thomas C. Fox, the editor of National Catholic Reporter, noted regretfully that a hospital with deep Catholic roots like St. Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s now cannot celebrate Mass, while 'b'airport chapels'b' can. Mr. Fox added: \xe2\x80\x9cOlmsted\xe2\x80\x99s moral certitude is lifeless, leaving no place for compassionate Christianity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To me, this battle illuminates two rival religious approaches, within the Catholic church and any spiritual tradition. One approach focuses upon dogma, sanctity, rules and the punishment of sinners. The other exalts compassion for the needy and mercy for sinners  \xe2\x80\x94  and, perhaps, above all, inclusiveness.'b'The thought that keeps nagging at me is this: If you look at Bishop Olmsted and Sister Margaret as the protagonists in this battle, one of them truly seems to me to have emulated the life of Jesus. And it\xe2\x80\x99s not the bishop, who has spent much of his adult life as a Vatican bureaucrat climbing the career ladder. It\xe2\x80\x99s Sister Margaret, who like so many nuns has toiled for decades on behalf of the neediest and sickest among us.'b'Then along comes Bishop Olmsted to excommunicate the Christ-like figure in our story. If Jesus were around today, he might sue the bishop for defamation.'b'Yet in this battle, it\xe2\x80\x99s fascinating how much support St. Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital has had and how firmly it has pushed back  \xe2\x80\x94  in effect, 'b'pounding 95 theses'b' on the bishop\xe2\x80\x99s door.

On Wednesday, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called publicly on Mr. Mubarak to make reforms and not to block peaceful protests. The administration needs to persuade him to accept the legitimacy and urgency behind the protests and begin talking to opposition groups. Egypt needs change. A peaceful transition would be best for everyone.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Rise of Chinese Cheneys'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (column, Jan. 20):'b'We take issue with Nicholas D. Kristof\xe2\x80\x99s depiction of the status of the Senkaku Islands, which are clearly an inherent territory of Japan. The Japanese government formally incorporated the Senkaku Islands in January 1895 after confirming that they had been uninhabited and not under the control of any other country. Since then the Senkaku Islands have continuously remained as an integral part of the Japanese territory.'b'The Senkaku islands were neither part of Taiwan nor part of the Pescadores Islands, which were ceded to Japan from China in accordance with the Treaty of Shimonoseki in May 1895. Accordingly, the islands were not included in the territory that Japan renounced in accordance with the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty after World War II.'b'Under the peace treaty, the islands had been placed under the United States administration until 1971, when the administrative rights over the islands reverted to Japan. It was not until the latter half of 1970, when the possibility of the existence of petroleum resources on the East China Sea came to the surface, that Chinese and Taiwanese authorities began to raise questions regarding the Senkaku Islands.'b'Satoru Satoh'b'\nPress Secretary'b'\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs of Japan'b'\nTokyo, Jan. 24, 2011'b''b''b''b'This week in Washington, Senator 'b'Frank Lautenberg'b' of New Jersey introduced three very modest gun regulation bills, including one making it more difficult to sell guns to people on the terror watch list.'b'Meanwhile, in Salt Lake City, the State Legislature is considering a bill to honor the Browning M1911 pistol by making it the official state firearm.'b'Guess which idea has the better chance of passage? Can I see a show of hands? Oh, you cynics, you!'b'Yes, a committee in the Utah House of Representatives voted 9 to 2 this week to approve a bill that would add the Browning pistol to the pantheon of official state things, along with the bird (seagull), rock ('b'coal'b') and dance (square). Also, although it really has nothing to do with this discussion, I have to mention that the Utah Legislature has provided its citizens with an official state cooking pot, and it is the Dutch oven.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis firearm is Utah,\xe2\x80\x9d Representative Carl Wimmer, the Browning bill\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor, told The Salt Lake Tribune. He is an energetic-looking guy with a huge forehead who has only been in office four years yet has, according to one of his videos, \xe2\x80\x9csponsored and passed some of the most significant pieces of legislation in Utah history.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Capitol observers say the Browning bill has an excellent chance of becoming law. Meanwhile, Lautenberg will be lucky to get a hearing. The terror of the 'b'National Rifle Association'b' is so pervasive that 'b'President Obama'b' did not want to poison the mood of his 'b'State of the Union address'b' by suggesting that when somebody on the terror watch list tries to buy a gun, maybe we should do an extra check.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut people are now commenting on the fact that the president didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it in his speech. That hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened for years,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul Helmke of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, whose job really does require an inordinate amount of optimism.'b'Lautenberg\xe2\x80\x99s bills are extremely mild, and no one seems eager to argue in public against the one that would end easy access to 30-bullet magazines that allow someone with a semiautomatic pistol to mow down a parking lot full of people in a matter of seconds. Instead, they just refuse to come to the phone or toss out platitudes.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe people that are going to commit a crime or are going to do something crazy aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to pay attention to the laws in the first place. Let\xe2\x80\x99s fix the real problem. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a mentally deranged person who had access to a gun that should not have had access to a gun,\xe2\x80\x9d said Senator Tom Coburn on \xe2\x80\x9cMeet the Press.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Another of Lautenberg\xe2\x80\x99s bills would tighten a loophole in current law so a mentally deranged person who should not have access to guns could not go to a gun show and buy one without the regular security check. But never mind.'b'On Monday, the Utah State Capitol celebrated Browning Day, honoring John Moses Browning, native son and maker of the nominee for Official State Firearm. There were speeches, a proclamation, a flyover by a National Guard helicopter, and, of course, a rotunda full of guns. \xe2\x80\x9cWe recognize his efforts to preserve the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d Gov. Gary Herbert said, in keeping with what appears to be a new Republican regulation requiring all party members to mention the Constitution at least once in every three sentences.'b'It is generally not a good policy to dwell on the strange behavior of state legislators since it leads to bottomless despair. If I wanted to go down that road, I\xe2\x80\x99d give you Mark Madsen, a Utah state senator who tried to improve upon the Browning Day celebrations by suggesting they be scheduled to coincide with Martin Luther King Day since \xe2\x80\x9cboth made tremendous contributions to individual freedom and individual liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s a symptom of a new streak of craziness abroad in the land, which has politicians scrambling to prove not just that they are against gun regulation, but also that they are proactively in favor of introducing guns into every conceivable part of American life. National parks. Schools. Bars. Airports.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is abundant research suggesting in cities where more people own guns, the crime rate, especially the murder rate, goes down,\xe2\x80\x9d Utah\xe2\x80\x99s new United States senator, Mike Lee, told CNN.'b'Actually, there\xe2\x80\x99s a ton of debate about this, which is hard to resolve given the fact that, as Michael Luo reported in The Times, the N.R.A.\xe2\x80\x99s crack lobbyists have managed to stop almost all federal financing for scientific research on gun-related questions. But Lee has definitely made the list of most creative commentators on these matters, ever since he dismissed calls for a calmer political rhetoric after the Tucson massacre by arguing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe shooter wins if we, who\xe2\x80\x99ve been elected, change what we do just because of what he did.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Feel free to say whatever you like about the senator\xe2\x80\x99s thinking.

Groups representing only the consumers who receive these services do not have the kind of funds the unions, providers of health care or groups like the Committee to Save New York (save New York? save big business) to mount such campaigns.'b'Yes, we write policy papers and letters, and meet with the governor\xe2\x80\x99s staff, but who do you think has the most weight \xe2\x80\x94 those who spend millions to protect their business interests or those who need to find the funds for a single trip to Albany?'b'Cynthia Rudder'b'\nNew York, Jan. 18, 2011'b''b''b'The writer is director of special projects, Long Term Care Community Coalition.'b''b'With the exception of 'b'Bank of America'b', the big banks were profitable in 2010, according to year-end reports filed earlier this month. But even standout results \xe2\x80\x94 like JPMorgan Chase\xe2\x80\x99s profit surge or Citigroup\xe2\x80\x99s first full-year profit since the financial crisis \xe2\x80\x94 were underwhelming on closer inspection.'b'One reason, as Eric Dash 'b'recently explained'b' in The Times, is that profits reported at many banks, including Chase, were boosted by large withdrawals of money from reserves set aside to cover losses. To get a truer picture of a bank\xe2\x80\x99s condition, you would need to look at the banks\xe2\x80\x99 actual revenue, unaffected by loss reserves.'b'Industrywide, those revenues are off 17 percent from their peak before the financial crisis in 2007, according to Foresight Analytics, a research firm. The latest figures for the biggest banks \xe2\x80\x94 Bank of America, Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs \xe2\x80\x94 all show declining revenue from the prior year, from a 3 percent drop at Chase for 2010 to a 13 percent slide at Goldman.'b'The declines are worrisome to the extent that they reflect the weak economy, with businesses unable to expand and borrowers sidelined by unemployment and damaged credit histories. Looked at more broadly, however, reduced revenues should be the norm even after the economy has recovered because a system that is truly safer and more fair will inevitably produce slower revenue growth. That may be disappointing to bankers and some investors, but it would be a sign of progress.'b'In the run-up to the financial crisis, bank revenues and profits were driven by reckless trading and dubious lending. Curbing those abuses through the Dodd-Frank reform law and other new rules \xe2\x80\x94 in effect, reducing risk in the system \xe2\x80\x94 will cut into revenue.'b'For now, regulations governing capital levels, derivatives, credit cards and other products and activities, are in the early stages of development and implementation and have only begun to hit revenue. But if the reforms, taken together, do indeed reduce riskiness to the point that another crisis is unlikely, the banks will make less money, especially in the near term, as they\xe2\x80\x99re forced to alter their approaches. As that happens, the banks and their investors will undoubtedly clamor for relief from \xe2\x80\x9coverly burdensome\xe2\x80\x9d regulation. House Republicans are already vowing to dismantle financial reform.'b'Unless lawmakers and regulators stand firm, financial reform will fail. We were encouraged to hear President Obama push back in the 'b'State of the Union address'b', saying that he would not hesitate to enforce consumer protections and other rules in the reform law.'b'Dodd-Frank recognized that outsize bank profits depended on outsize risks and attempts to diminish that threat. If it works, the banks will still be big and multitasking, but not the money makers they once were. That would be a small price to pay for a more stable system.'b'Fifteen years ago, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit flouted 'b'Supreme Court'b' law when it struck down affirmative action at the University of Texas Law School. Last week, in an act of redemption, the appellate court upheld an admissions plan for undergraduates at the University of Texas at Austin that takes race into account to encourage diversity. The plan was adopted after the Supreme Court again approved affirmative action in higher education in 2003.'b'Like many other universities, the University of Texas values diversity\xe2\x80\x99s many educational benefits. Students educated in a diverse university are better prepared for a diverse work force and for helping bring about what the Supreme Court called the dream of \xe2\x80\x9cone nation, indivisible.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When the Fifth Circuit said the university couldn\xe2\x80\x99t consider race in admissions in 1996, Texas passed the Top 10 Percent Law that used geographic diversity as a proxy for race. Any resident graduating in the top tenth of a high school class is assured admission to a state university. Four-fifths of the places in each University of Texas at Austin class have been for Top 10 students.'b'For the remaining fifth, the university assesses applicants individually through grades, test scores and so on. But it also looks at other factors, including socio-economic background and race. Students admitted this way turn out to be more competitive, not less. The average SAT score of these students at the university is higher than that of Top 10 students automatically admitted.'b'Two unsuccessful white applicants challenged this method, saying it discriminated against them because of their race. Rejecting the claim, the Fifth Circuit explained why the selective method is successful and why the Top 10 plan hasn\xe2\x80\x99t met the university\xe2\x80\x99s diversity goal although it has admitted a lot of minority students.'b'As Judge Patrick Higginbotham wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cthose minority students remain clustered in certain programs\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 education and social work \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9climiting the beneficial effects of educational diversity.\xe2\x80\x9d While Top 10 plans successfully increase minority enrollment, some high schools don\xe2\x80\x99t prepare students well to meet requirements of the more demanding majors at the university.'b'When the Supreme Court said universities could consider race in admissions, it said they could do that, not that they had to. This ruling should give confidence to all universities about seeking diversity and merit.'b'To the Editor:'b'Parents would welcome with relief and eagerness the public conversation about vaccine risks and rewards that Michael Willrich suggests (\xe2\x80\x9c'b'Why Parents Fear the Needle'b',\xe2\x80\x9d Op-Ed, Jan. 21).

Mr. Hariri is the son of Rafik Hariri, a former prime minister whose assassination in February 2005 is the basis for soon-to-be-expected indictments by the United Nations Special Tribunal for Lebanon.'b'Although the new prime minister, Najib Mikati, didn\xe2\x80\x99t need Mr. Fattoush\xe2\x80\x99s support to defeat Saad Hariri \xe2\x80\x94 the militant Shiite movement Hezbollah and the Parliament\xe2\x80\x99s largest single bloc of Christians, headed by Gen.

Not only had he been an ally of Saad Hariri\xe2\x80\x99s, but he had just days before received a widely publicized 'b'visit from the United States ambassador, Maura Connelly'b', in his home district.'b'That a small-time figure known for his political horse-trading would spurn a superpower\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to retain his vote for its man provides an exclamation point on just how poorly Washington\xe2\x80\x99s policy of \xe2\x80\x9cmaximalism\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 applying sporadic bouts of pressure on its allies while refusing to sincerely negotiate with its adversaries \xe2\x80\x94 has fared in Lebanon and the Middle East as a whole. The Obama administration is going to need a very different approach when it comes to dealing with the \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d Lebanon.'b'Unfortunately, though, such a change will be far more difficult today than it would have been just six years ago, when Hezbollah had its political back against the wall, lacking support outside its Shiite base and the insurance of Syrian troops in the country.'b'In April of that year, Hezbollah went so far as to send one of its affiliated politicians, Trade Hamade, to meet with State Department officials to work out a modus vivendi. He left Washington empty-handed: the Bush administration believed that American influence  was on the rise in Lebanon and that Hezbollah could be cornered into agreeing to disarmament before any substantive negotiations.'b'Instead of undermining Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s political support by broadening alliances with pro-American figures in Lebanon and addressing the concerns held by many Lebanese \xe2\x80\x94 the sentiment that Israel still occupied Lebanese territory in the south, that there were Lebanese in Israeli jails and that the country needed a stronger national defense \xe2\x80\x94 the Bush administration cultivated a narrow set of local allies and pursued a \xe2\x80\x9cwith us or against us\xe2\x80\x9d strategy aimed at eliminating Hezbollah.'b'Sadly, it took this policy less than a year to result in a botched Israeli invasion that killed and wounded thousands of Lebanese citizens and gave Hezbollah unprecedented popularity in the region.'b'Today, Syria has regained much of its hegemony in the country \xe2\x80\x94 this time without the cost of stationing troops \xe2\x80\x94 and is again at the center of regional politics. Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s military capacity, by all accounts, has soared, and many of its leaders seem to harbor the dangerous belief that they can decisively win a \xe2\x80\x9cfinal\xe2\x80\x9d confrontation with Israel. The Party of God has also deftly maintained and even expanded its political alliances \xe2\x80\x94 including one with about half the Christians in the country \xe2\x80\x94 that gave it the power to change the government this week by constitutional means.'b'Perhaps most frustratingly, Hezbollah has largely succeeded in undermining the legitimacy of the United Nations tribunal in the Arab and Islamic worlds. In this effort it had unintentional American help. As 'b'a recent report from the International Crisis Group'b' put it, the manner in which the investigation was established, \xe2\x80\x9cpushed by two Western powers with clear strategic objectives\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the United States and France \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9ccontaminated\xe2\x80\x9d the process.'b'So, what can the United States do to reverse Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s new momentum? Its options are limited. Given the change of government, Congress may well try to cut off all aid to Lebanon and the Lebanese Army. The Obama administration will likely reiterate its support for the tribunal and push for any indictments of Hezbollah figures. But neither step would have much of an impact on Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s core calculations or desires.'b'Hezbollah will continue to increase its military power, edging ever closer to what Israeli officials have called a \xe2\x80\x9credline\xe2\x80\x9d of capabilities that would prompt Israel to mount a major \xe2\x80\x9cpre-emptive\xe2\x80\x9d attack. Such a move would, as it was in 2006, be devastating for Lebanon, probably for Israel and certainly for United States interests in the region, not least because Hezbollah would likely survive and even gain new adherents among those affected by Israeli strikes on Lebanese infrastructure and civilian areas.'b'Still, there is a way for Washington to stake out a reasonable, nonviolent alternative: by pushing for the immediate revival of peace talks between Syria and Israel. Eleven years ago, a peace agreement between the two countries that would have included the disarmament of Hezbollah fell apart, largely because the Israeli prime minister at the time, Ehud Barak, found it too politically difficult to hand over to Syria the last few hundred yards of shoreline around the northeast corner of the Sea of Galilee bordering the Golan Heights.'b'Although a new deal on the Golan would not lead to the end of Hezbollah in the immediate term, it would contain the movement\xe2\x80\x99s ability and desire to use violence, as Syria would need to commit to cutting off the supply routes by which Iranian (and Syrian) weapons are now smuggled into Lebanon. Militarily weakened, and without Syrian or much domestic political backing to continue in its mission to liberate Jerusalem, Hezbollah would find it extremely difficult to threaten Israel\xe2\x80\x99s northern border.'b'Certainly some Israelis see the benefits of such a deal. Ilan Mizrahi, a former deputy chief of the Mossad and national security adviser to former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, told an interviewer recently that on his first day on the job, he recommended that Mr. Olmert make a deal with Syria because it would 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cchange the security situation in the Middle East.\xe2\x80\x9d'b' He said he still believed that.'b'When asked if a pullout might create a threat to Israel along the Golan, Mr. Mizrahi answered: \xe2\x80\x9cOur chief of staff doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think so. Our head of intelligence, military intelligence, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think so ... the best Israeli generals are saying we can negotiate it, so I believe them.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Would pressuring Israel into a full withdrawal from the Golan be politically difficult for President Obama? Surely \xe2\x80\x94 as it would be for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. But given the alternatives for Lebanon, Israel and the United States, anything less would be merely setting up temporary roadblocks to an impending regional disaster.'b'President Obama is smart to extend an olive branch to American businesses. Our economic success depends on businesses investing, growing and creating new jobs. From expanding exports to improving infrastructure, government and businesses share important goals.'b'From a purely pragmatic political standpoint, reaching an entente with corporate leaders will make it easer to defuse the hostility he has faced. Some of it has been purely partisan and ideological, from groups like the United States Chamber of Commerce, which deployed millions to unseat Democrats in the Congressional elections last year.'b'Still, Mr. Obama must take care not to let his agenda be taken over entirely by corporate interests. They do not belong to the only constituency he serves.'b'Appointing William Daley to be a business-friendly White House chief of staff seems a good idea; so does drafting Jeffrey Immelt of General Electric to lead his Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. It\xe2\x80\x99s fine to promise to weed out stupid business regulations, though past administrations that have done the same have found that most of the regulations aren\xe2\x80\x99t stupid.'b'But Mr. Obama should keep in mind that the interests of corporations and their bosses are not necessarily always aligned with those of the country. All he needs to do is look at the pile of uninvested cash on which nonfinancial businesses are sitting \xe2\x80\x94 nearly $2 trillion \xe2\x80\x94 while the national unemployment rate remains above 9 percent.'b'Satisfying business interests can be tricky. Mr. Obama wants, for example, to reduce the 35 percent top corporate tax rate. That might sound like music to corporate ears, but it could easily run into powerful opposition. That\xe2\x80\x99s because the president has rightly linked the reduction in the marginal tax rate to closing the loopholes in the tax code that allow many corporations to pay much less in taxes than they should.'b'Despite the high corporate tax rate, taxes on corporate income only raise an amount equal to 2.1 percent of the gross domestic product. That is way below the 3.5 percent of G.D.P. raised, on average, across the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. It puts the United States near the bottom of industrial nations. Even the most promising areas for cooperation \xe2\x80\x94 like increasing exports \xe2\x80\x94 are tricky. Business groups are right to urge the administration to obtain Congressional approval for the trade agreements with Colombia and Panama that were signed during the administration of George W. Bush. But Mr. Obama has been unwilling to face down trade unions and has placed the deals on the back burner.'b'President Obama should bring his party on board and pass the trade agreements. He should consult closely with business on his plans to invest in public infrastructure. But this is a two-way street. Some business lobbying groups have fought Mr. Obama on ideological, not policy grounds, opposing major initiatives tooth and nail, including health care reform. As Mr. Obama reaches out to them, corporate interest groups must abandon the politics of division and gridlock and reach back out to him.'b'Lebanon\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'next prime minister'b', Najib Mikati, owes his job to Hezbollah. That is regrettable and dangerous. It will heighten Lebanon\xe2\x80\x99s divisions, antagonize Western donors (including the United States) and complicate the work of the international tribunal set up to try the killers of Rafik Hariri, a former prime minister.'b'The problem is not inevitably Mr. Mikati, who served as prime minister in 2005. During his first administration, Lebanon authorized a preliminary international investigation into the Hariri assassination. In those days, Mr. Mikati was not beholden to Hezbollah.'b'We hope he can still find ways to put Lebanon\xe2\x80\x99s interests first and dare Hezbollah to challenge him. He now says that he will make no move against the tribunal \xe2\x80\x9cwithout full Lebanese consensus.\xe2\x80\x9d No such consensus exists or is likely to emerge. The tribunal remains Lebanon\xe2\x80\x99s best hope for accountability and justice.'b'Hezbollah began as an Iranian-sponsored terrorist group. It has since become a skillful player in electoral politics. But it refuses to accept the rules of a constitutional, parliamentary government. It maintains a heavily armed militia and uses threats of renewed civil war to coerce less powerful groups to support its political aims.'b'The country\xe2\x80\x99s previous prime minister, Saad Hariri, resisted that intimidation for months, refusing Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s demands that Lebanon repudiate the international tribunal investigating his father\xe2\x80\x99s murder. Hezbollah believed, probably correctly, that the tribunal would indict some of its members for that crime. Indictments have now been filed, but they still remain sealed.'b'Mr. Hariri remains the leader of Lebanon\xe2\x80\x99s Sunni Muslims, whom no government can afford to ignore. His supporters must stand firm but avoid violence. Mr. Mikati (a Sunni) should calm Sunni fears by naming a cabinet dominated by technocrats, not Hezbollah militants. He must insist that Hezbollah respect Lebanon\xe2\x80\x99s laws and refrain from threats. And he must honor Lebanon\xe2\x80\x99s international obligations, including compliance with a much-violated United Nations Security Council resolution barring the flow of arms to Hezbollah through Syria.'b'If Mr. Mikati lives up to these responsibilities, Washington should continue to aid nonsectarian Lebanese institutions, like the national army. (The United States has given $1.2 billion in economic and military aid over the past five years). If the new government allows Hezbollah to turn those institutions to its own sectarian ends, Washington will have to end that support.'b'The Hariri tribunal, an international body, must continue its work. The United States, the European Union and Saudi Arabia should pick up some of the costs previously paid by Lebanon. Since Tunisia\xe2\x80\x99s so-called Jasmine Revolution, we have heard a lot of talk from the Arab world about ending impunity and reasserting the rule of law. That is exactly what the Hariri tribunal aims to do.'b'Capital punishment means lethal injection. The administration of a barbiturate as part of a fatal dose of drugs is meant to render a convict unconscious before other drugs stop his or her breathing and heart so the execution can somehow be construed by a judge as being neither cruel nor unusual.'b'Sodium thiopental is at the heart of this story. A fast-  and short-acting general anesthetic, it has been used to put convicts under and make executions methodical. For more than a year, however, a shortage of the drug has widened the gap between the reality of carrying out executions and support for them in American law. In October, a majority of the Supreme Court wrongly insisted there was no evidence that the shortage had any bearing on whether an execution can be done constitutionally. Now the evidence is impossible to ignore.'b'We strongly oppose capital punishment on many grounds. Even with judicial blessing, the conduct of executions in this country is a shambles. In Arizona and Georgia, the sodium thiopental used in executions has possibly been ineffective and almost certainly been illegal. It came from Dream Pharma, an unlicensed British supplier, 'b'run from a driving school'b'. The batches carried a date of 2006. They were likely made by a company in Austria that went out of business. The drug is said to be effective for only a year. As a foreign-made drug without approval by the Food and Drug Administration, it is prohibited by federal statute.'b'The F.D.A. initially suspected the drug from Dream Pharma of being adulterated or mislabeled and refused to let it be imported. Then it let the drug enter the country \xe2\x80\x94 but with the warning that the agency hadn\xe2\x80\x99t reviewed the drug\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cidentity, safety, effectiveness, purity or any other characteristics.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This month, the F.D.A. stated: \xe2\x80\x9cReviewing substances imported or used for the purpose of state-authorized lethal injection clearly falls outside of F.D.A.\xe2\x80\x99s explicit public health role.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the meantime, the only American manufacturer of sodium thiopental \xe2\x80\x94 formerly described as F.D.A.-approved \xe2\x80\x94 has 'b'announced it will no longer make the drug'b'. It planned to produce the drug in Italy, but the Italian government has said it won\xe2\x80\x99t permit the drug\xe2\x80\x99s export for use in executions.'b'When it reaffirmed the constitutionality of capital punishment three years ago, a splintered Supreme Court said it believed lethal injection carried neither \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d nor \xe2\x80\x9cobjectively intolerable\xe2\x80\x9d risk of inflicting serious harm. How can the justices be confident in that conclusion now?'b'Every Thursday my gurus, Mr. Burke and Mr. Hamilton, get together at the Heavenly Rest to drink and talk politics. Mr. Burke prefers a whiskey and water, while Mr. Hamilton likes a good strong Sex on the Beach. This week, they ended up talking about President Obama.'b''b'Burke:'b' I congratulate you. Your president is most prudent and wise. He has decided to focus on three things: education reform, infrastructure investment and scientific innovation. He\xe2\x80\x99s not wasting money on desperate schemes to pump up the employment rate before the next elections. He\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about the long-term prosperity of the nation.'b'Moreover, his State of the Union address demonstrated an admirable sense of moderation and continuity. His competitiveness initiatives build intelligently on the ones Bill Clinton spoke of in 1996 and the ones George W. Bush mentioned in 2006. They also demonstrate an exquisite realism. With your nation so divided, he has plucked out the proposals on which there is some agreement. By working together on these things now, your leaders can establish the trust necessary to tackle bigger and tougher issues during Obama\xe2\x80\x99s second term.'b''b'Hamilton:'b' You\xe2\x80\x99re mad, Burke! Obama has completely misread the national situation. The United States is careening toward disaster. The deficit this year is the highest in history: $1.48 trillion. In a mere eight years, the national debt will hit 90 percent of G.D.P. Interest payments alone on the debt will be $1 trillion! And he goes before the country with nostalgic happy talk and decides to spend the next two years treading water?'b'He pats himself on the back for a spending freeze projected to save $400 billion over 10 years. That\xe2\x80\x99s an infinitesimal sliver of the $45 trillion the government will be spending over that time.'b'Is he aware of the national bankruptcy rushing ever closer? Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he see that the nation wants a fundamental change in Washington, not a few more tax credits for solar panels?'b'Obama is going to go down in history as the Nero who fiddled as Rome burned. He reformed health care without changing the ruinous incentives that were bankrupting the system. He submitted budgets that hastened the national collapse. The Republicans accuse him of being a socialist, but, the fact is, he\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Status Quo.'b''b'Burke:'b' My dear sir. He\xe2\x80\x99s an officeholder, not a think-tank Johnny. I know intellectuals are perpetually exercised by the crisis du jour, but the current deficits are not really that big. A tad more revenue and a normal bit of spending restraint will take care of them. Besides, look at Japan and Europe. They\xe2\x80\x99re in much worse fiscal shape. The world is happy to keep lending you money.'b'Obama has to deal with the country as it is. The electorate does not want entitlement cuts, which is why even the Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t dare mention the word \xe2\x80\x9cMedicare\xe2\x80\x9d except to promise even more money for it. Do you know how many Republican activists support Medicare reforms? According to a survey by Conservative Home, it is 3 percent!'b'I\xe2\x80\x99d say Obama is a practical realist, building gradually on America\xe2\x80\x99s present prosperity, not venturing out rashly in the grip of some abstract plan.'b''b'Hamilton:'b' You vastly underestimate the structural problems leading to slowing growth rates, higher unemployment and higher inequality. I advise you to read Tyler Cowen\xe2\x80\x99s new e-book, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Great Stagnation,\xe2\x80\x9d in which he argues that Americans have already picked the low-hanging economic fruit and now face an entirely set of difficult decisions. You also underestimate the dysfunction of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s government.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re in the middle of a global race to see who can most intelligently reform the welfare state. The Simpson-Bowles commission put everything on the table, and far from seizing the opportunity to lead a national discussion on big things like fundamental tax and entitlement reform, he gave them the most cursory of mentions.'b'Besides, where is his vision? Is his entire philosophy encapsulated in the phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cLight Rail?\xe2\x80\x9d Does he realize that by being so modest he is ceding all momentum to the Republicans in Congress?'b''b'Burke:'b' Ideologies are for theoreticians. President Obama will emerge as the mature moderate while the Republicans will seem unstable and dangerous. He will talk about realistic concrete improvements, like higher teacher salaries, while the Republicans will talk of unpopular and devastating spending cuts that never materialize. He will be optimistic while they will offer austerity and alarm. Have you seen that only 34 percent of Americans approve of the G.O.P. agenda, according to a PSRA/Pew poll.'b''b' Hamilton:'b' You are wrong. Obama talks of a Sputnik moment as if NASA were a model for the future. He will be regarded as the embodiment of a government that is no longer working. As the unemployment rate hovers around 9 percent, and as problems accumulate, he will come to realize that he has sealed his doom.'b'At a mid-January meeting of the Sherlock Holmes Society in London \xe2\x80\x94 held in the Members\xe2\x80\x99 Dining Room at the House of Commons, no less \xe2\x80\x94 the English writer Anthony Horowitz announced that he has been commissioned by the Conan Doyle Estate  to write a new novel featuring the venerable detective. According to Mr. Horowitz\xe2\x80\x99s publisher, the title is a \xe2\x80\x9cclosely guarded secret\xe2\x80\x9d and the prologue is \xe2\x80\x9cunder lock and key.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We find this curious. The Conan Doyle Estate has gone through several owners before being sold back to a company of Doyle heirs, but copyright in the Holmes stories has nearly come to an end. (In Britain, all of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\xe2\x80\x99s Holmes books are in the public domain. In the United States, only the last \xe2\x80\x94 and least important \xe2\x80\x94 volume, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Casebook of Sherlock Holmes,\xe2\x80\x9d is still under copyright.) And any writer can write a new story featuring the characters of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.'b'The Conan Doyle Estate describes itself as the \xe2\x80\x9conly company associated with the family\xe2\x80\x9d and offers \xe2\x80\x9ca unique seal of approval\xe2\x80\x9d bearing the profiles of Holmes and Watson. But there is no reason why an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d 21st-century Holmes story will be any better or more authentic \xe2\x80\x94 whatever that means in this case \xe2\x80\x94 than an \xe2\x80\x9cunofficial\xe2\x80\x9d one.'b'Mr. Horowitz is a well-regarded TV writer and author of the Alex Rider series of children\xe2\x80\x99s books. His Holmes will surely be recognizably Holmes, and Mr. Horowitz may well write a ripping yarn. We certainly hope so. We\xe2\x80\x99re glad, nonetheless, that literary estates of this kind \xe2\x80\x94 corporate extensions of a familial association, with a seal of approval \xe2\x80\x94 don\xe2\x80\x99t antedate the 20th century.

Does anyone care if  the president wore a suit by the presidential tailor Georges de Paris on Tuesday night? Of course not. His speech, and issues like job creation, tax cuts, 'b'climate change'b' and gun control, are more pressing than his fashion choices.'b'But let\xe2\x80\x99s be honest, many of us want to discuss 'b'the first lady\xe2\x80\x99s dress,'b' too: Did it fit well? Was the color right? Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t she wear a belt? Whether she likes it or not, her message of optimism and inclusiveness is often transmitted through her appearance. Many of her predecessors put their political and social causes first: Lady Bird Johnson kept America beautiful, Nancy Reagan just said no, Hillary Clinton pushed for health care. 'b'Michelle Obama'b' herself fights against childhood obesity. But more than any first lady since Jacqueline Kennedy, she also captures our attention with her fashion.'b'As a result, everyone becomes a fashion critic when Mrs. Obama makes an appearance in the House of Representatives chamber or on the North Portico steps. The fashion commentary follows her even on less formal occasions, as when she strides across the South Lawn or steps off  'b'Air Force One'b'. Beige leggings? Hiking shorts? Bare feet? Every body part and frock elicits an opinion.'b'Just last week her choice to wear a British-designed 'b'red organza dress'b' for the state dinner honoring Hu Jintao, the Chinese president, caused a furor  among fashion industry leaders. Oscar de la Renta, Diane von Furstenberg and the Council of Fashion Designers of America all weighed in, saying they were a little disappointed with the first lady for not supporting the American garment industry.

The optimism, glamour and accessibility that she communicates through her style of dressing transcends cultural borders and economic boundaries. Yes, she is sometimes an ambassador for American designers, but more important, she is an ambassador for the self-possession that defines American style.'b'Maybe she chose not to promote a specific American brand at the state dinner last week, but she certainly promotes a healthy sense of enjoyment and individuality in fashion. With her brio and idiosyncratic clothing choices, Mrs. Obama has rewritten the dress code for women who work. We wear cardigans now instead of always jackets, flats instead of impossibly high platform heels. We have a little fun with fashion, even to the point of being more frivolous.'b'And, most important, we dress for ourselves, something the first lady does so effortlessly it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine that there had ever been any dress code for her position. With her  floral prints and hula hoops, she\xe2\x80\x99s not afraid to flaunt her femininity \xe2\x80\x94 so why should the rest of us be?'b'No matter what hopes we pin on her husband, or disappointments we suffer, Americans look to Michelle Obama to set the emotional tone of his administration.

But her decision to wear an American-designed dress  doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it easier for American designers to sell more clothes in the Chinese market.'b'After all the discussion of the red dress at the state dinner, Mrs. Obama stepped into the House chamber on Tuesday for the State of the Union address in a silvery-white sheath by the American designer Rachel Roy. Its color and simplicity signaled fresh beginnings \xe2\x80\x94 as did 'b'that inaugural gown'b' she wore in January two years ago. For this there was not so much criticism. Only a lot of American women silently thinking about where they might find a simple, pale sheath dress.'b'Both President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, in power for three decades, and Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen, in power for 23 years, should have seen this coming. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x94 or didn\xe2\x80\x99t care. Both countries share similar pressures: huge numbers of young people without jobs, growing outrage over abusive security forces, corrupt leaders, repressive political systems.'b'Their people are right to demand more from their governments. The status quo is unsustainable and the result, perhaps inevitable, has been an explosion of protests and rioting in the streets of both countries.'b'Egypt, with Mr. Mubarak in charge, is an American ally and a recipient of nearly $1.5 billion in aid annually. It is the biggest country in the Arab world and was the first to make peace with Israel. Yemen is home to a dangerous Al Qaeda affiliate and has given the United States pretty much free rein to go after the extremists.'b'All of which leaves Washington in a quandary, trying to balance national security concerns and its moral responsibility to stand with those who have the courage to oppose authoritarian rulers. American officials must already be wondering what will happen to the fight against Al Qaeda if Mr. Saleh is deposed. And what will happen to efforts to counter Iran and promote Arab-Israeli peace if Mr. Mubarak is suddenly gone?'b'We won\xe2\x80\x99t try to game Yemen\xe2\x80\x99s politics. Even in Egypt, it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to know who might succeed Mr. Mubarak. He has made sure that there is no loyal opposition and little in the way of democratic institutions.'b'In the past, Washington has often pulled its punches on human rights and democracy to protect unholy security alliances with dictators, like Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines. There came a time when it was obvious that the Marcos tie was damaging American security interests and President Ronald Reagan \xe2\x80\x94 along with a people power revolution \xe2\x80\x94 played a role in easing him peacefully out of power.'b'Whether that point comes with Mr. Mubarak is now up to him. So far, he has shown arrogance and tone-deafness. He has met the spiraling protests with spiraling levels of force and repression. On Friday, in a sign more of weakness than strength, the government shut down Internet access and cellphone service. The protestors were undeterred.'b'Early Saturday, Mr. Mubarak ordered all of his ministers to resign and said his new government would accelerate reforms. He would be far more persuasive if he lifted the communications blackout, reeled in his security forces, allowed credible candidates to compete for president this year, and ensured a free and fair election.'b'Cables released by WikiLeaks show that the Obama administration has been privately pushing Mr. Mubarak to wake up, release jailed dissidents and pursue reforms.

The mayor of Omaha, Jim Suttle, is one.

She was passed over in a try for a minor post in House leadership.'b'Yet, at her invitation, Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court came trotting over to the Capitol to lecture the House freshmen this week about the true meaning of the Constitution. And she makes the leaders who snubbed her quake with terror. What if she rallies her fellow Tea Partiers into a rebellion over, say, raising the debt limit, and the economy collapses?'b'She does have a history of single-mindedness. Back when Bachmann was a state senator in Minnesota, her colleagues complained that they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a budget done because she insisted on bringing everything to a screeching halt to argue about same-sex marriage. It was a controversy marked by her usual flair. \xe2\x80\x9cIn 2005, she claimed to have been held against her will in a restaurant bathroom by two critics of an amendment banning same-sex marriage; they said they\xe2\x80\x99d merely buttonholed her to talk,\xe2\x80\x9d reported The Minneapolis Star Tribune in a profile. \xe2\x80\x9cThen foes claimed that Bachmann hid behind some bushes to spy on a gay-rights rally; she said she was merely checking the turnout.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Bushes aside, Bachmann is a much more serious person than Palin, whose response to the State of the Union address was to focus on the title, \xe2\x80\x9cWinning the Future.\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cThere were a lot of W.T.F. moments throughout that speech.\xe2\x80\x9d) If Palin and Bachmann were your co-workers, Palin would be the one sneaking out early to go bowling, while Bachmann would stay late to reorganize the office seating chart to reflect her own personal opinion of who most deserves to be near the water cooler.'b'History is superimportant to Bachmann, who claims that she left the Democratic Party when she was a college senior, after reading \xe2\x80\x9cBurr,\xe2\x80\x9d Gore Vidal\xe2\x80\x99s caustic historical novel. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was kind of mocking the founding fathers, and I just thought \xe2\x80\x98what a snot,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Bachmann told The Star Tribune. It was, she said, a transformational moment so critical to her worldview that she can still remember what she was wearing. (\xe2\x80\x9cA tan trench coat, blue pin-striped shirt, like a tailored shirt, and dress slacks.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not everybody who switches political parties over a historical novel, but Bachmann\xe2\x80\x99s vision of the past is the core to her ideology. The men who created the Constitution were perfect heroes, so infallible that they fully understood the right to bear arms would someday include semiautomatic pistols capable of firing 30 bullets in 10 seconds.'b'Last week, Bachmann was in Iowa, setting off alarm bells about her possible presidential ambitions and delivering a speech in which she claimed that the founding fathers had \xe2\x80\x9cworked tirelessly\xe2\x80\x9d to eradicate slavery. She then cited John Quincy Adams, who was not a founding father.'b'Bachmann is not a zealous fact-checker, as we learned when she claimed the president\xe2\x80\x99s trip to India would cost the taxpayers $200 million a day, based on an Indian newspaper report quoting an unnamed provincial official. In the real world, many founders, like Thomas Jefferson, expressed reservations about slavery but still kept hundreds of slaves, who were the basis of their personal wealth. Others, like John Adams, never owned slaves and opposed the institution but compromised on the matter of all men actually being created equal in order to bring the southern states into the union. And not a single one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence envisioned in any way, shape or form a democracy in which people of Michele Bachmann\xe2\x80\x99s gender would sit in the halls of Congress.'b'But Bachmann was speaking to the lore of the far right, which strips the founding fathers of their raw, fallible humanity and ignores the fact that, in some ways, we\xe2\x80\x99re wiser.'b'Maybe she\xe2\x80\x99ll make Sarah Palin look good.'b'President Obama made history on Tuesday.'b'It was only the second time since Harry S. Truman\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union address in 1948 that such a speech by a Democratic president did not include a single mention of poverty or the plight of the poor.'b'The closest Obama got to a mention was his confirmation for \xe2\x80\x9cAmericans who\xe2\x80\x99ve seen their paychecks dwindle or their jobs disappear\xe2\x80\x9d that, indeed, \xe2\x80\x9cthe world has changed. The competition for jobs is real.\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they appreciated that.'b'The only other Democrat not to mention poverty in the speech was Jimmy Carter in 1980, but even he was able to squeeze in one reference to at least a portion of the poor and disenfranchised, stressing the continuation of jobs programs to \xe2\x80\x9cprovide training and work for our young people, especially minority youth.\xe2\x80\x9d (Carter did mention the poor in a written version that he submitted to Congress.)'b'John F.

Those were his widest margins of victory of any 'b'income group'b' and helped to propel him to victory.)'b'He talked at length about education (the most inspiring part of the speech) and about civility and his repackaged bromides of global competitiveness and investments in the future. And, of course, there were cautious mentions of programs that benefit seniors and the need to protect and secure them. Can\xe2\x80\x99t forget the plea to the old people.'b'Protecting programs for seniors strikes the right chord morally and politically, but the data show that seniors are not the ones feeling the majority of the pain these days.'b'According to 'b'data from the Census Bureau'b', the percent of people ages 18 to 64 who were living in poverty in 2009 was higher than it had been in any year since 1959, while the percent of seniors living in poverty was lower than it had been in any year since at least 1959.'b'(By the way, voters over 65 were the only age group that Obama lost in 2008.)'b'I, for one, refuse to believe that this is an either-or proposition. We can make smart choices about protecting seniors and supporting younger Americans in need at the same time. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have to ignore the Annies among us to court the Miss Daisys.'b'For the poor, this is the Obama Conundrum. He was obviously the best choice in 2008. And judging by the current cast of Republican presidential contenders, he could well be the best choice in 2012. But does that give him license to obviate his moral responsibility to his electoral devotees? Can and should they take his snubs as a necessary consequence of political warfare as he makes every effort to tack back to the middle and reconnect with those whose opinion of him vacillates between contempt on a bad day and sufferance on a good one? Does keeping him in the White House dictate keeping them in the shadows?'b'And things could get even worse for the poor if the president feels the need to cut too many deals with the new Republican-led House in order to appear more centrist.'b'According to Brian Miller, the executive director of the nonpartisan and Boston-based group United for a Fair Economy and co-author of 'b'the group\xe2\x80\x99s report'b' entitled \xe2\x80\x9cState of the Dream 2011: Austerity for Whom?\xe2\x80\x9d released earlier this month, \xe2\x80\x9causterity measures based on the conservative tenets of less government and lower taxes will ratchet down the standard of living for all Americans, while simultaneously widening our nation\xe2\x80\x99s racial and economic divide.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As Miller put it, deficits that tax cuts for the rich helped to create \xe2\x80\x9care being used to justify a host of austerity measures that will harm Americans of all races but will hit blacks and Latinos the hardest.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'According to Miller, \xe2\x80\x9cWith 42 percent of blacks and 37 percent of Latinos lacking the funds to meet minimal household expenses for even three months should they become unemployed, cutting public assistance programs will have devastating impacts on black and Latino workers.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'(Obama won 95 percent of the black vote and 67 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2008.)'b'Even as my respect for this president as a shrewd politician has begun to rebound, my faith in him as a fervent crusader for the poor and disenfranchised has taken yet another nose dive.

Unfortunately, this was not before some national newspapers, pregnancy experts and celebrities with questionable credentials (Kim Kardashian!) indulged in zero-evidence rhetoric attributing Memphis\xe2\x80\x99s nonexistent crisis to everything from adolescent stupidity to the MTV program \xe2\x80\x9cTeen Mom.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'After refuting the rumors, Memphis officials soberly connected the city\xe2\x80\x99s relatively high rate of pregnant teenagers to long-term hardships like poverty and family abuse, including childhood rape. As in most cities, Memphis\xe2\x80\x99s teenage pregnancies are heavily concentrated in poor neighborhoods; in Memphis\xe2\x80\x99s case, in just three of its ZIP codes. But by then pundits and cable news anchors had moved on \xe2\x80\x94 no one\xe2\x80\x99s going to get a talk show booking or Lifetime movie script sticking to the facts.'b'In any case, the performance of the Memphis officials and the press was a huge improvement over what we saw in Gloucester, Mass., in 2008. That circus started when workers at the Gloucester High School clinic asserted there had been a huge \xe2\x80\x9cspike\xe2\x80\x9d in teenage motherhood that was the result of a baby-raising \xe2\x80\x9cpact\xe2\x80\x9d among girls at the school.'b'The scandal made an international news splash \xe2\x80\x94 even leading to a reaction against the movie \xe2\x80\x9cJuno\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 but no pact was ever uncovered. Massachusetts Department of Health figures showed no spike in Gloucester teenage motherhood in 2008; actually, the numbers were lower than those of a decade earlier.'b'Yet, even as solid statistics and surveys show sharp declines among teenagers in problems like crime, violent death, rape, pregnancy, school dropout, dating violence, depression and other consistently measured troubles, the news media continue to press alarming claims of new epidemics of bullying, \xe2\x80\x9ccyberbullying,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chooking up,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csexting,\xe2\x80\x9d dating violence, violence by girls, gay suicide, depression, narcissism, materialism, dumbness and other vaguely defined trends.

For example, when the percentage of teenage women giving birth briefly rose from 2005 to 2007, sex-education advocates and abstinence-only promoters rushed to blame each other, and sexed-up popular culture, for the supposed crisis. Neither side noted the inconvenient reality that the births had increased most significantly among 18- and 19-year-olds, and were unchanged among the younger teenagers supposedly most affected by warring school curriculums.'b'And, naturally, neither side had a good explanation when teenage births dropped in 2008 and 2009 to the lowest levels since World War II, or why birth declines over the last 20 years among both teenagers and adults have occurred only among married couples, not the unwed ones who usually are the targets of sex education campaigns.'b'While it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear whether teenagers today have more sex with each other and with adult partners than occurred in previous generations, they do seem to handle sex better. Crime reports from the F.B.I. and victimization surveys from the Bureau of Justice Statistics show that rape, sexual violence and dating violence have plummeted among young people. Centers for Disease Control statistics indicate that rates of pregnancy, birth, abortion and sexually transmitted disease among teenagers are much lower than in past generations.'b'Today 15 million American children and teenagers live in poverty. A quarter-million are confirmed victims of  physical and sexual abuse every year, usually inflicted by parents. The hyping of fake trends and anecdotal panics may seem harmless, but it distracts us from acting on the serious crises facing our most disadvantaged young people.'b'ANY lingering doubts about Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s determination to appropriate Ronald Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s political spirit evaporated just before the State of the Union. No American brand is 'b'more associated with Reagan than General Electric'b', and it was that corporation\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive, Jeffrey Immelt, who 'b'popped up as the president\xe2\x80\x99s new wingman'b' when the White House rolled out its latest jobs initiative on Jan. 21. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s  'b'speech on Tuesday'b', with its celebration of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s can-do capitalist ingenuity, moved him still closer to Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s sweet spot as a national cheerleader. The president even offered a remix of the old Reagan-era G.E. jingle \xe2\x80\x9cWe bring good things to life\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x94  now traded up to the grander \xe2\x80\x9cWe do big things.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Obama\xe2\x80\x99s rhetorical Morning in America is exquisitely timed to coincide with the Gipper\xe2\x80\x99s centennial  \xe2\x80\x94  and, of course, the unacknowledged start of his own 2012 re-election campaign. It\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable how completely the G.O.P. has ceded the optimism of its patron saint to the president just as the country prepares for a deluge of Reaganiana. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s post-New Year\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'surge past a 50 percent approval rating'b'  \xe2\x80\x94  well ahead of both Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s and Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s comeback trajectories after their respective midterm shellackings  \xe2\x80\x94  may have only just begun.'b'There was no drama to Obama\xe2\x80\x99s address  \xe2\x80\x94  just a unifying theme, at long last, as he reasserted the role of government in rebooting and rebuilding the country for a new century and putting Americans back to work. The president wisely left any theatrics to his adversaries, and, as always, they were happy to oblige.'b'This time we were spared a \xe2\x80\x9cYou lie!\xe2\x80\x9d But once Obama segued into a rambling laundry list and the \xe2\x80\x9cprom night\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'bipartisan photo ops'b' lost their comic novelty, the night\xe2\x80\x99s storyline inevitably shifted to the reliable diva antics of Michele Bachmann, the founder of the 'b'House\xe2\x80\x99s Tea Party Caucus'b'. For all the Republican male establishment\xe2\x80\x99s harrumphing, it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t derail her plan to hijack the party\xe2\x80\x99s designated State of the Union response with one of her own. More Katherine Harris than Sarah Palin, Bachmann is far 'b'more riveting television bait'b' than Paul Ryan, the bland congressman officially assigned the Bobby Jindal memorial slot after the New Jersey governor Chris Christie was savvy enough 'b'to take a pass'b'.'b'The G.O.P. grandees\xe2\x80\x99 'b'consternation was palpable'b'. Earlier in the day 'b'Bachmann had dispatched an e-mail'b' announcing that her speech would be carried live by Fox News. But when the time came, Fox relegated the live feed to its Web site, forcing viewers 'b'to scurry to CNN'b', of all places, and delaying its own television recap until after prime time in the East. Rupert Murdoch\xe2\x80\x99s other major organ, The Wall Street Journal, toed the same line, burying Bachmann\xe2\x80\x99s speech 'b'in a half-sentence in its print edition'b' the next morning. By then, John Boehner, seconding 'b'the disdain of Eric Cantor'b', was 'b'telling reporters'b' that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t watched Bachmann because of \xe2\x80\x9cother obligations.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What were they all afraid of? The answer cuts to the crux of the right\xe2\x80\x99s plight less than three months after its supposed restoration. Having sold itself in 2010 as the uncompromising champion of Tea Party-fueled fiscal austerity, the enhanced G.O.P. caucus arrived in Washington in 2011 to discover that most Americans prefer compromise to confrontation and favor balanced budgets  in name only.'b''b'A CNN poll this month'b' found that just one American in five regards deficit reduction as pressing enough to justify cuts to Social Security and Medicare. Only one in four would choose balancing the budget if it meant reducing education programs. Indeed, 'b'a new Gallup poll'b' reveals that there\xe2\x80\x99s exactly one category of government spending that a majority of voters favors slicing  \xe2\x80\x94  foreign aid (which amounts to some 1 percent of the budget). Incredible as it sounds, even current government outlays to science, the arts, farmers and antipoverty programs still enjoy 50 percent-plus support.'b'Bachmann, like such other newly empowered Tea Party tribunes as Rand Paul and Jim DeMint, rattles G.O.P. leaders because she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pull punches in specifying how she would wield an ax. The only public opinion she cares about is that of her  base. But as it turned out, Bachmann specified no cuts on Tuesday night, if only because she was too busy attacking Obama with unreconstructed pre-Tucson vitriol. In the end, her substance differed little from Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s. She chastised government spending six times (vs. 'b'Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s 13'b'), and, like him, mentioned the twin federal money pits  \xe2\x80\x94  Social Security and Medicare  \xe2\x80\x94  not once. For a night anyway, these G.O.P. fiscal hawks were actually less forthright about entitlements than the Democratic president, who at least paid lip service to someday finding \xe2\x80\x9ca bipartisan solution to strengthen Social Security.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This couldn\xe2\x80\x99t last  \xe2\x80\x94  and didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Within 48 hours, other congressional Republicans were filling in some of the blanks left by Bachmann and Ryan, from 'b'privatizing Medicare'b' to eliminating 'b'the government agency that regulates product safety'b'. Perhaps the fresh crop of G.O.P. revolutionaries has been too busy revisiting 1776 to study the history of Newt Gingrich\xe2\x80\x99s swaggering revolution of 1995. In January of that year, 49 percent of Americans approved and 22 percent opposed the incoming Republican Congress\xe2\x80\x99s plans, according to the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll at the time. But as soon as the plans\xe2\x80\x99 details emerged, 'b'those numbers started to flip'b'. By October 35 percent approved of G.O.P. policies and 45 percent did not. That was a month 'b'before 'b'the first of the two government shutdowns that put Clinton back on top.'b'But in 2011, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the revelation of cuts to specific popular programs that threatens to turn Americans against the Republican Congress. New polls show that Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t even buy the principles behind these specifics. To hear the G.O.P. wail about it, you\xe2\x80\x99d think the entire country was obsessed with the federal debt  \xe2\x80\x94  cited 12 times in Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s under-11-minute speech. But only 18 percent of Americans chose the deficit as a top priority for Washington 'b'in the most recent NBC/Journal survey'b' and only 14 percent did 'b'in the New York Times/CBS News poll'b'. Job creation was by far the top choice  \xe2\x80\x94  at 43 percent (Times/CBS) and 34 percent (NBC/Journal).'b'Health care was a low-ranked priority too in those polls. And for all the right\xe2\x80\x99s apocalyptic rants about the national horror of   \xe2\x80\x9cObamacare,\xe2\x80\x9d most polls continue to show that Americans are evenly divided about the law and that only a small minority favors its complete repeal (only one in four Americans 'b'in the latest Associated Press/GfK survey'b'). The surest indicator that voters are not as inflamed about either the deficit or \xe2\x80\x9cObamacare\xe2\x80\x9d as the right keeps claiming can be found in Karl Rove\xe2\x80\x99s Wall Street Journal musings. To argue that Americans share his two obsessions, Rove now is reduced to citing polls from either Fox or a Brand X called Resurgent Republic, which he 'b'helpfully identifies'b' as \xe2\x80\x9ca group I helped form.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Obama must be laughing about how the party that spent a year hammering him for focusing on health care over jobs is now committing the same supposed sin. And one can only imagine his astonishment on Tuesday night, when the G.O.P. respondents to his speech each played Jimmy Carter to his Reagan by offering a grim double-feature of malaise and American decline. Hardly had the president extolled record corporate profits and a soaring stock market in his selectively rosy spin on the economy, than Ryan, who has the television manner of a solicitous funeral home director, was darkly warning that America 'b'could be the next Greece'b'. Bachmann channeled Glenn Beck to argue that we are living in a nascent police state where government \xe2\x80\x9ctells us which light bulbs to buy\xe2\x80\x9d (G.E.\xe2\x80\x99s, presumably).'b'The most revealing moment in either Republican response, though, came from Ryan, who, as chairman of the House Budget Committee, implicitly threatened another government shutdown, or catastrophic fiscal meltdown, if the House majority doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get its way. \xe2\x80\x9cThe president is now urging Congress to increase the debt limit,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with distaste, referring to the vote required possibly as soon as March to allow the Treasury to keep paying its bills. Should the House majority hold that vote hostage to its vision of the budget, it will throw the markets into turmoil and upend our still-embryonic recovery.'b'It tells you all you need to know about Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s tilt to the right  that, for all his professed disapproval of increasing the debt limit during an Obama administration, he 'b'voted to do so'b' 'b'twice'b' himself during the  gushing deficits of the Bush years. Funny he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention that Tuesday night. It tells you all you need to know about the G.O.P.\xe2\x80\x99s overall tilt to the right that not just the Tea Party is making barely veiled threats to play dangerous political games with the debt limit. 'b'Mitch McConnell'b' and 'b'Cantor did so'b' last weekend, as have 'b'a plethora of potential 2012 presidential candidates'b', from Tim Pawlenty to Gingrich. The Bachmann-Beck-Palin tail is now firmly wagging the Republican dog.'b'Like virtually every other week since the shellacking, the State of the Union week was another salutary one for Obama. But the state of the union itself could yet be in the hands of radicals whose eagerness to see the president fail is outstripped only by their zeal to make an ideological point, even if it forces America into default.'b'WASHINGTON'b'There are other historic bromances in the news. King George VI and Lionel Logue. Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin. LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.'b'But rarely has there been a partnership that rocked the world the way the Chicago odd couple did. The lean, neat One and the hefty, messy one accomplished what seemed impossible: Getting a black man the nation\xe2\x80\x99s worst job, as The Onion memorably put it.'b'So it was a parting of sweet sorrow this weekend for The Brand and The Keeper of The Brand.'b'The unsentimental Barack Obama and the sentimental David Axelrod said goodbye Friday night over an intimate dinner in the White House residence. (Along with their wives.)'b'The adviser will return to Chicago  \xe2\x80\x94  to his family; his beloved deli, Manny\xe2\x80\x99s; the re-election ramp-up; and to his pal, Rahm. Obama and Axelrod agreed the West Wing team had gotten too insular. \xe2\x80\x9cAs one of my colleagues said, the White House is a bit like working in a submarine: it\xe2\x80\x99s better to come up for air,\xe2\x80\x9d Axelrod recalled Friday in his small office in a White House consumed with Cairo fires and pelted with Washington snow.'b'The 55-year-old former newspaperman and political consultant became an early muse to the young poet who bewitched a nation. It was a coup de foudre for the idealistic strategist. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve not made any bones about my feelings about him,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, when asked if he\xe2\x80\x99s too adoring. Robert Gibbs jokingly dubbed Axe \xe2\x80\x9cthe guy who walks in front of the president with rose petals.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But once Obama got deluged with a torrent of presidential crises, the poetry stopped, and the adviser in charge of the message got some blame.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, we were too prosaic,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe all got sort of dragged down, you know; we were a triage unit. I think all of us have been guilty of neglecting that really important part of the presidency, where you\xe2\x80\x99re operating in the world of ideals and values and vision.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He continued: \xe2\x80\x9cThere were a lot of hands on the words, a lot of concern about every nuance. And it is true that this is a place where an errant clause can send markets tumbling and armies marching, and you\xe2\x80\x99re always aware of that.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The vaunted change gave way to the usual logrolling. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was, so, you need this guy\xe2\x80\x99s vote and therefore, perhaps we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t emphasize that issue because they will be less apt to support us on the recovery plan and the country could slip into a depression,\xe2\x80\x9d Axelrod said.'b'The president recaptured some inspirational force in Tucson, his heart clearly touched by 9-year-old Christina Green. Her parents told Obama that their daughter had gotten interested in politics partly because she was drawn to him.'b'The president is \xe2\x80\x9chappier\xe2\x80\x9d taking a more optimistic, big-picture approach, Axelrod said, noting, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s in the zone in which he\xe2\x80\x99s most comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Packing boxes leaned against the office wall. David Plouffe, a more orderly, reserved type \xe2\x80\x94 a man who shows his affection for Obama by studying the turnout models for Congressional swing districts \xe2\x80\x94 is moving in Monday.'b'Though Axe can wax endlessly about Washington\xe2\x80\x99s wayward ways, he admitted to friends that it\xe2\x80\x99s harder leaving than he thought, and he plunged into bon voyage parties and dinners. Asked about the cascade of \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive\xe2\x80\x9d exit interviews he was giving, he warned drolly: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t turn on the Shopping Network!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe White House is like fantasy camp for him,\xe2\x80\x9d said his charming assistant, Eric Lesser. \xe2\x80\x9cHe could go to an Afghan war council in the Situation Room, meet Sandy Koufax and have a baseball signed, and have lunch with Caroline Kennedy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Axelrod\xe2\x80\x99s final Friday began with Lesser bringing the usual oatmeal. (Now that the boss has lost 25 pounds, Lesser permits him a sprinkling of brown sugar again.) Pointing to some \xe2\x80\x9cvictimized\xe2\x80\x9d ties hanging on the door, the strategist noted: \xe2\x80\x9cThe one thing I learned on this job is, don\xe2\x80\x99t eat your oatmeal standing up.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The avid punster offered a parting pun at the 8:30 a.m. meeting \xe2\x80\x94 urging everyone to \xe2\x80\x9cplow forward\xe2\x80\x9d on a plan for genetically produced alfalfa.'b'Axelrod is not tech-savvy. There was that time he was in such a rush for an early campaign bus that he mistook a bar of hotel soap for his BlackBerry, later pulling the soap out of a pocket to check his e-mails. And the time he killed a BlackBerry with glaze from a donut.'b'So it was a surprise Friday when he said he was going to open a Twitter account so he could \xe2\x80\x9cleap into the debate from time to time.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I asked Axelrod what he\xe2\x80\x99d like to steal on the way out. Nodding toward the Oval Office, he replied conspiratorially, \xe2\x80\x9cHe has the Emancipation Proclamation in there. That would be a nice going-away present.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Singapore'b'I am in the Gan Eng Seng Primary School in a middle-class neighborhood of Singapore, and the principal, A. W. Ai Ling, has me visiting a fifth-grade science class. All the 11-year-old boys and girls are wearing junior white lab coats with their names on them. Outside in the hall, yellow police tape has blocked off a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime scene\xe2\x80\x9d and lying on a floor, bloodied, is a fake body that has been murdered. The class is learning about DNA through the use of fingerprints, and their science teacher has turned the students into little C.S.I. detectives. They have to collect fingerprints from the scene and then break them down.'b'I missed that DNA lesson when I was in fifth grade. When I asked the principal whether this was part of the national curriculum, she said no. She just had a great science teacher, she said, and was aware that Singapore was making a big push to expand its biotech industries and thought it would be good to push her students in the same direction early. A couple of them checked my fingerprints. I was innocent  \xe2\x80\x94  but impressed.'b'This was just an average public school, but the principal had made her own connections between \xe2\x80\x9cwhat world am I living in,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwhere is my country trying to go in that world\xe2\x80\x9d and, therefore, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat should I teach in fifth-grade science.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I was struck because that kind of linkage is so often missing in U.S. politics today. Republicans favor deep cuts in government spending, while so far exempting  Medicare, Social Security and the defense budget. Not only is that not realistic, but it basically says that our nation\xe2\x80\x99s priorities should be to fund retirement homes for older people rather than better schools for younger people and that we should build new schools in Afghanistan before Alabama.'b'President Obama just laid out a smart and compelling vision of where our priorities should be. But he did not spell out how and where we will have to both cut and invest  \xe2\x80\x94  really intelligently and at a large scale  \xe2\x80\x94  to deliver on his vision.'b'Singapore is tiny and by no means a U.S.-style democracy. Yet, like America, it has a multiethnic population  \xe2\x80\x94  Chinese, Indian and Malay  \xe2\x80\x94  with a big working class. It has no natural resources and even has to import sand for building. But today its per capita income is just below U.S. levels, built with high-end manufacturing, services and exports. The country\xe2\x80\x99s economy grew last year at 14.7 percent, led by biomedical exports. How?'b'If Singapore has one thing to teach America, it is about taking governing seriously, relentlessly asking: What world are we living in and how do we adapt to thrive. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re like someone living in a hut without any insulation,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Tan Kong Yam, an economist. \xe2\x80\x9cWe feel every change in the wind or the temperature and have to adapt. You Americans are still living in a brick house with central heating and don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be so responsive.\xe2\x80\x9d And we have not been.'b'Singapore probably has the freest market in the world; it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in import tariffs, minimum wages or unemployment insurance. But it believes regulators need to make sure markets work properly  \xe2\x80\x94 because they can\xe2\x80\x99t on their own  \xe2\x80\x94  and it subsidizes homeownership and education to give everyone a foundation to become self-reliant. Singapore copied the German model that strives to put everyone who graduates from high school on a track for higher education, but only about 40 percent go to universities. Others are tracked to polytechnics or vocational institutes, so the vast majority graduate with the skills to get a job, whether it be as a plumber or a scientist.'b'Explained Ravi Menon, the Permanent Secretary of Singapore\xe2\x80\x99s Ministry of Trade and Industry: \xe2\x80\x9cThe two \xe2\x80\x98isms\xe2\x80\x99 that perhaps best describe Singapore\xe2\x80\x99s approach are: pragmatism  \xe2\x80\x94  an emphasis on what works in practice rather than abstract theory; and eclecticism  \xe2\x80\x94  a willingness to adapt to the local context best practices from around the world.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It is a sophisticated mix of radical free-market and nanny state that requires sophisticated policy makers to implement, which is why politics here is not treated as sports or entertainment. Top bureaucrats and cabinet ministers have their pay linked to top private sector wages, so most make well over $1 million a year, and their bonuses are tied to the country\xe2\x80\x99s annual G.D.P. growth rate. It means the government can attract high-quality professionals and corruption is low.'b'America never would or should copy Singapore\xe2\x80\x99s less-than-free politics. But Singapore has something to teach us about \xe2\x80\x9cattitude\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x94  'b'about taking governing seriously and thinking strategically'b'. We used to do that and must again because our little brick house with central heating is not going to be resistant to the storms much longer.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is real puzzlement here about America today,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kishore Mahbubani, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause we learned all about what it takes to build a well-functioning society from you. Many of our top officials are graduates of the Kennedy School at Harvard. They just came back home and applied its lessons vigorously.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Americans are infatuated with guns. And when you\xe2\x80\x99re infatuated, you sometimes can\xe2\x80\x99t think straight. Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s why, three weeks after the Tucson shootings that shook the nation, we\xe2\x80\x99re still no closer to banning oversize magazines like the 33-bullet model allegedly used there. Maybe it will help clarify issues if we imagine an alternate universe  \xe2\x80\x94 one in which Americans exhibit their toughness not with assault weapons but with assault vehicles, a world in which our torrid libertarian passion is not for our guns but for our cars. That alternate universe might look like this:'b''b'The powerful National Automobile Association warned today that vehicle regulation, such as a ban on assault vehicles, would be \xe2\x80\x9cthe first step toward totalitarianism.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAutos don\xe2\x80\x99t kill people,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Hank Magic, a N.A.A. spokesman. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople kill people.\xe2\x80\x9d  As part of a campaign against auto registration, the N.A.A. has started selling new bumper stickers: \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll register my car when they pry the steering wheel from my cold, dead fingers.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The N.A.A. defends assault vehicles as essential for self-defense and also \xe2\x80\x9cloads of fun.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Taken aback by the furor, the White House denied any interest in banning assault vehicles or registering all vehicles. The White House said that the president was considering more modest steps, such as banning repeat drunken drivers from the roads, prohibiting televisions mounted on the steering wheel and curbs on lethal car accessories that serve no transportation purpose \xe2\x80\x94 such as bayonets mounted on the front and back bumpers.'b'Mr. Magic warned: \xe2\x80\x9cNow the White House is trying to prevent Americans from enjoying themselves and defending themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d He cited a driver in Florida in 1997 who had been threatened by a carjacking but was able to impale the attacker on his bumper. \xe2\x80\x9cBumper bayonets save lives,\xe2\x80\x9d he asserted.'b'The president also distanced himself from a proposed Transportation Department directive that would curb private tanks on the basis that they are damaging roads and, with road rage on the rise, sometimes rolling over other vehicles. The N.A.A. has denounced the proposal, warning: \xe2\x80\x9cWithout tanks, how can we keep our children safe?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe solution is more tanks, not fewer tanks,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Magic told a rally yesterday. \xe2\x80\x9cIf tanks are banned, then only criminals will have tanks!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Auto safety advocates say that tens of thousands of lives could be saved annually if the president and Congress would register vehicles, require seat belts and require licenses to drive cars. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s tough because our country\xe2\x80\x99s history is steeped in automobiles,\xe2\x80\x9d said one advocate. \xe2\x80\x9cBut with political leadership, we can rise above that, as every other civilized country in the world has done.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'O.K., O.K. That\xe2\x80\x99s the end of our alternate history. In reality, of course, we have taken a deadly product \xe2\x80\x94 motor vehicles \xe2\x80\x94 and systematically made them quite safe. Scientists have figured out how to build roads so as to reduce accidents and have engineered innovations such as air bags to reduce injuries. Public campaigns and improved law enforcement have reduced drunken driving, and graduated licenses for young people have reduced accident rates as well. The death rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled has fallen by almost three-quarters since the early 1970s, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.'b'The trade-off is that we have modestly curbed individual freedom, but we save tens of thousands of lives a year. That\xe2\x80\x99s a model for how we should approach guns as a public health concern.'b'Granted, the Second Amendment complicates gun regulation (I accept that the framers intended for state militias, and possibly individuals, to have the right to bear flintlocks). But even among those favoring a broader interpretation, the Second Amendment hasn\xe2\x80\x99t prevented bans on machine guns. There are still lines to be drawn, and a prohibition on 33-bullet magazines would be a useful place to start.'b'If we treat guns as we do cars and build a public health system to address them, here\xe2\x80\x99s what we might do: finance more research so that we have a better sense of which gun safety policies are effective (for example, do gun safes or trigger locks save lives?); crack down on gun retailers who break laws the way we punish stores that sell cigarettes to kids; make serial numbers harder to erase; make gun trafficking a law enforcement priority; limit gun purchases to one per person per month; build a solid database of people who are mentally ill and cannot buy firearms; ban assault weapons; and invest in new technologies to see if we can design \xe2\x80\x9csmart guns\xe2\x80\x9d that require input of a code or fingerprint to reduce accidents and curb theft.'b'Particularly after a tragedy like Tucson, why can\xe2\x80\x99t we show the same maturity toward firearms that we show toward vehicles  \xe2\x80\x94  and save some of the 80 lives a day that we lose to guns?'b'House Republicans are preparing to push through restrictions on federal financing of abortions far more extreme than previously proposed at the federal level. Lawmakers who otherwise rail against big government have made it one of their highest priorities to take the decision about a legal medical procedure out of the hands of individuals and turn it over to the government.'b'Their primary bill \xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cNo Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 is so broad that it could block insurance coverage for abortions for countless American women.'b'The anti-abortion forces almost derailed health care reform last year over whether people could buy policies that cover abortion on new insurance exchanges. The compromise embedded in the reform law sets up a hugely complicated plan to segregate an individual\xe2\x80\x99s premium payments from the government subsidies. It is so burdensome that it seems likely to discourage insurers from offering any abortion coverage at all on the exchanges.'b'But anti-abortion lawmakers are not satisfied. The new bill, introduced by Christopher Smith, a New Jersey Republican, would bar outright the use of federal subsidies to buy any insurance that covers abortion well beyond the new exchanges.'b'The tax credits that are encouraging small businesses to provide insurance for their workers could not be used to buy policies that cover abortions. People with their own policies who have enough expenses to claim an income tax deduction could not deduct either the premiums for policies that cover abortion or the cost of an abortion. People who use tax-preferred savings accounts to pay medical costs could not use the money to pay for an abortion without paying taxes on it.'b'The only tax subsidy left untouched is the exclusion that allows workers whose premiums are subsidized by their employers to avoid paying taxes on the value of the subsidy. Many, if not most, employer-sponsored insurance plans cover abortions. There would have been a huge political battle if workers were suddenly told they had to pay taxes on the benefit or change their policies.'b'The Smith bill also would take certain restrictions on federal financing for abortions that now must be renewed every year and make them permanent. It would allow federal financing of abortions in cases of \xe2\x80\x9cforcible\xe2\x80\x9d rape but not statutory or coerced rape, and in cases where a woman is in danger of death from her pregnancy but not of other serious health damage. It would free states from having to provide abortions in such emergency cases.'b'A separate Republican bill would deny federal funds for family planning services to any organization that provides abortions. It is aimed primarily at Planned Parenthood\xe2\x80\x99s hundreds of health centers, which also provide many other valuable services. No federal money is used for the abortions. This is a reckless effort to cripple an irreplaceable organization out of pure politics.'b'Pressure by regulators is having an effect on consumer privacy on the Internet.'b'Last week, Google and Mozilla announced new software for their Web browsers that would allow consumers to permanently opt out of the online tracking used by many advertisers to follow online activities, build consumer profiles and deliver tailored ads.'b'The move follows efforts by some of the largest Internet advertisers and data trackers \xe2\x80\x94 including Google and Yahoo \xe2\x80\x94 to offer consumers an easy way to opt out of tracking on their sites. Microsoft said it would offer a feature (dropped last year) that would allow surfers using Internet Explorer to block some monitoring efforts.'b'Last year, the Federal Trade Commission recommended ways to protect online privacy, including giving consumers a clear, simple way to opt out of data tracking \xe2\x80\x94 something akin to the do-not-call registry.'b'Hoping to pre-empt action from a Congress in which privacy protection is one of the very few items with strong bipartisan support, companies involved in online advertising have rushed to issue their own proposals.'b'The efforts are welcome. The fact that Google and Mozilla get most of their revenue from online advertising is a strong rebuttal to claims that allowing consumers to opt out of tracking would undermine ad-driven businesses and endanger the free Internet.'b'Still, these initiatives fall short of what is ultimately needed. The privacy plug-in for Google\xe2\x80\x99s Chrome browser merely lets users opt out permanently from tracking by companies from the coalition of companies that already allow surfers to opt out. It allows them to keep their opt-out settings even if they clear their cookies.'b'Mozilla\xe2\x80\x99s feature, which will be added to new versions of its Firefox browser, will broadcast users\xe2\x80\x99 preference not to be tracked to the Web sites they visit and the tracking companies that deliver cookies from these sites. But it will be up to these companies to comply with customers\xe2\x80\x99 wishes. Many advertising networks that offer opt-outs still track surfing, just not for marketing.'b'To close these loopholes, Congress should require all advertising and tracking companies to offer consumers the choice of whether they want to be followed online to receive tailored ads, and make that option easily chosen on every browser.'b'Well before the end, the government\xe2\x80\x99s color-coded alert system was eroding into a macabre laugh line for the modern age of terrorism. Were people standing beltless in their socks actually hearing the airport announcements when the risk estimate mostly shuttled between yellow (Elevated) and orange (High)?'b'The five-color code is going the way of cold war survival biscuits. Homeland Security officials decided that it ultimately lacked credibility and clarity to the point of sapping rather than bolstering public confidence.'b'By the end of April it will be replaced with a more focused \xe2\x80\x94 color-free \xe2\x80\x94 system that promises to point authorities to specific threats while alerting the public through the news and social media (Watch Out! in 140 characters).'b'The change is a reminder of how rooted if not routine the terrorism era has become. The code was instituted by presidential order in March 2002 and its effectiveness was instantly debated. Some critics suspected the alerts were manipulated for political ends. Others said it made them think of M&amp;M candies or the Great Oz\xe2\x80\x99s ever-shifting horse of a different color.'b'If not color, what? Music? No, the Kremlin has devalued Tchaikovsky to a mere town coup crier.'b'So the code passes into the realm of trivia questions. Which of the five colors of risk were never used? The two lowest: blue (Guarded) and green (Low). When did the highest alert \xe2\x80\x94 red (Severe) \xe2\x80\x94 have to be flashed? On Aug. 10, 2006, for airline flights heading from Britain after terrorist threats deemed credible. Domestic flights were kept at orange. The code worked that way: it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite one color fits all.'b'The colors tended more toward the emotional than informational, particularly on the eve of major travel holidays.'b'The replacement remains to be proved as the era unfortunately goes forward. At least the color code message was never less than, we\xe2\x80\x99re all in this together.'b'San Diego'b'THE long-awaited Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission report, finally published on Thursday, was supposed to be the economic equivalent of the 9/11 commission report. But instead of a lucid narrative explaining what happened when the economy imploded in 2008, why, and who was to blame, the report is a confusing and contradictory mess, part rehash, part mishmash, as impenetrable as the collateralized debt obligations at the core of the crisis.'b'The main reason so much time, money and ink were wasted \xe2\x80\x94 politics \xe2\x80\x94 is apparent just from eyeballing the report, or really the three reports. There is a 'b'410-page volume'b' signed by the commission\xe2\x80\x99s six Democrats, 'b'a leaner 10-pronged dissent'b' from three of the four Republicans, and a nearly 100-page 'b'dissent-from-the-dissent'b' filed by Peter J. Wallison, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. The primary volume contains familiar vignettes on topics like deregulation, excess pay and poor risk management, and is infused with populist rhetoric and an anti-Wall Street tone. The dissent, which explores such root causes as the housing bubble and excess debt, is less lively. And then there is Mr. Wallison\xe2\x80\x99s screed against the government\xe2\x80\x99s subsidizing of mortgage loans.'b'These documents resemble not an investigative trilogy but a left-leaning essay collection, a right-leaning PowerPoint presentation and a colorful far-right magazine. And the confusion only continued during a press conference on Thursday in which the commissioners had little to show and nothing to tell. There was certainly no Richard Feynman dipping an O ring in ice water to show how the space shuttle Challenger went down.'b'That we ended up with a political split is not entirely surprising, given the structure and composition of the commission. Congress shackled it by requiring bipartisan approval for subpoenas, yet also appointed strongly partisan figures. It was only a matter of time before the group fractured. When Republicans proposed removing the term \xe2\x80\x9cWall Street\xe2\x80\x9d from the report, saying it was too pejorative and imprecise, the peace ended. And the public is still without a full factual account.'b'For example, most experts say credit ratings and derivatives were central to the crisis. Yet on these issues, the reports are like three blind men feeling different parts of an elephant. The Democrats focused on the credit rating agencies\xe2\x80\x99 conflicts of interest; the Republicans blamed investors for not looking beyond ratings. The Democrats stressed the dangers of deregulated shadow markets; the Republicans blamed contagion, the risk that the failure of one derivatives counterparty could cause the other banks to topple. Mr. Wallison played down both topics. None of these ideas is new. All are incomplete.'b'Another problem was the commission\xe2\x80\x99s sprawling, ambiguous mission. Congress required that it study 22 topics, but appropriated just $8 million for the job.  The pressure to cover this wide turf was intense and led to infighting and resignations.  The 19 hearings themselves were unfocused, more theater than investigation.'b'In the end, the commission was the opposite of Ferdinand Pecora\xe2\x80\x99s famous Congressional investigation in 1933. Pecora\xe2\x80\x99s 10-day inquisition of banking leaders was supposed to be this commission\xe2\x80\x99s exemplar. But Pecora, a former assistant district attorney from New York, was backed by new evidence of widespread fraud and insider dealings, shocking documents that the public had never seen or imagined. His fierce cross-examination of Charles E. Mitchell, the head of National City Bank, Citigroup\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor, put a face on the crisis.'b'This commission\xe2\x80\x99s investigation was spiritless and sometimes plain wrong. Richard Fuld, the former head of Lehman Brothers, was thrown softballs, like \xe2\x80\x9cCan you talk a bit about the risk management practices at Lehman Brothers, and why you didn\xe2\x80\x99t see this coming?\xe2\x80\x9d Other bankers were scolded, as when Phil Angelides, the commission\xe2\x80\x99s chairman, admonished Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, for practices akin to \xe2\x80\x9cselling a car with faulty brakes and then buying an insurance policy on the buyer of those cars.\xe2\x80\x9d But he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t back up this rebuke with new evidence.'b'The report then oversteps the facts in its demonization of Goldman, claiming that Goldman \xe2\x80\x9cretained\xe2\x80\x9d $2.9 billion of the A.I.G. bailout money as \xe2\x80\x9cproprietary trades.\xe2\x80\x9d Few dispute that Goldman, on behalf of its clients, took both sides of trades and benefited from the A.I.G. bailout. But a Goldman spokesman told me that the report\xe2\x80\x99s assertion was false and that these trades were neither proprietary nor a windfall. The commission\xe2\x80\x99s staff apparently didn\xe2\x80\x99t consider Goldman\xe2\x80\x99s losing trades with other clients, because they were focused only on deals with A.I.G. If they wanted to tar Mr. Blankfein, they should have gotten their facts right.'b'Lawmakers would have been wiser to listen to Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, who in early 2009 proposed a bipartisan investigation by the banking committee. That way seasoned prosecutors could have issued subpoenas, cross-examined witnesses and developed cases.  Instead, a few months later, Congress opted for this commission, the last act of which was to coyly recommend a few cases to prosecutors, who already have been accumulating evidence the commissioners have never seen.'b'There is still hope. Few people remember that the early investigations of the 1929 crash also failed due to political battles and ambiguous missions. Ferdinand Pecora was Congress\xe2\x80\x99s fourth chief counsel, not its first, and he did not complete his work until five years after the crisis. Congress should try again.'b'IN 2010, the United States and its allies continued to shift the military focus from Iraq and to Afghanistan. American troop levels in Iraq fell by half, from more than 100,000 troops in January to under 50,000. In Afghanistan, a surge of mainly United States troops brought numbers to roughly 140,000, from near 100,000 at the beginning of the year. As shown in the chart (based on data from the Pentagon, 'b'icasualties.org'b' and American allies), in 2010 there were 696 fatalities in Afghanistan and 56 in Iraq.'b'The death total in Iraq was the lowest of any year in the war by a significant margin, down by 85 from 2009. Nearly two-thirds of the deaths there were not related to combat, and most of the hostile deaths occurred in isolated incidents. Though overall violence levels in Iraq have not improved markedly over the last year, they at least seem fairly stable as Iraqi security forces take on more of the burden.'b'The fighting in parts of Afghanistan was intense, and 198 more allied troops died there than in 2009. Many of the fatalities occurred in Helmand Province, where some 15,000 American and NATO troops began a major offensive in February; homemade bombs and small-arms fire caused the vast majority of the casualties. While 2010 finished as the deadliest year of the war effort thus far, there is no question that Afghan and Western troops have made great strides in stabilizing the insecure provinces in the south and east of the country.'b'NPR was 'b'reporting definitively'b' that Representative Gabrielle Giffords had been shot dead, but 'b'The Associated Press'b' was holding off. The lines into the A.P. offices, recalled A.P.\xe2\x80\x99s executive editor, 'b'Kathleen Carroll,'b' were buzzing with complaints: where was The A.P. on this story? How could it let NPR beat it?'b'Meanwhile, the lines into the New York Times offices were hot as well, said Greg Brock, senior editor/standards: where was The Times on this story?'b'No doubt, the pressure to report the latest news was intense immediately after 'b'the shootings in Tucson on Jan. 8.'b' The difference between The A.P. and The Times on this occasion, though, was that The A.P. held off and was right, while The Times eventually jumped in with an online report of Ms. Giffords\xe2\x80\x99s death, and was wrong.'b'The mistake, quickly corrected, happened because of a breach in The Times\xe2\x80\x99s editing defenses as it worked to cover the story quickly from a distance. The episode dramatizes an important philosophical choice that editors face in an era that has transformed the way formerly old-media organizations like The Times handle and deliver the news.'b'While it\xe2\x80\x99s true that in the bygone era of print-only newspapers, editors sometimes had to make tough on-deadline calls about the accuracy of their reporting ('b'\xe2\x80\x9cDewey Defeats Truman\xe2\x80\x9d comes to mind'b'), the reality is that digital news delivery on a continuous cycle drastically increases the volume and the difficulty of these decisions.'b'Organizations, like The Times, that have built their reputations on authoritativeness now must ask themselves: How much of our reputation should we lay on the line in the name of being first in breaking news, or at least not being a laggard?'b'This decision \xe2\x80\x94 whether to be first or most authoritative \xe2\x80\x94 is a portentous one, some believe, and is likely to define the future reputations of news organizations. Others, including 'b'Bill Keller'b', The Times\xe2\x80\x99s executive editor, say this is a false dichotomy: it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to do both.'b''b'Tim McGuire'b', an academic and a former president of the 'b'American Society of Newspaper Editors,'b' is doubtful about having it both ways. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is becoming a choice: Am I going to be first? Is that going to be my brand, or am I going to be the credible one?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am not sure you can do both,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. McGuire, who teaches at Arizona State University\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cI am pretty sure you cannot. I am convinced that in this day you are not going to be able to be all things to all people.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to be both. Take it from The A.P., which has its own people in 300 locations globally and therefore is better positioned than any other news organization to have boots on the ground when news breaks. Ms. Carroll, its executive editor, warns that when you get something wrong, typically in a breaking news situation, \xe2\x80\x9cpeople remember for 130,000 years. Everybody remembers that we killed Bob Hope before he was dead.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That said, news organizations cannot bring themselves, it seems, to eschew the twin goals \xe2\x80\x94 arguably incompatible goals \xe2\x80\x94 of being first and most credible. Even Ms. Carroll said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to be able to do both.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s in the blood, it seems. I sought out television journalists to get perspective on this journalistic credo, in part because television has been dealing with the challenge of immediate news much longer than its print counterparts, which, thanks to the Internet, are now in the always-on news-breaking mode as well.'b''b'Brian Bracco,'b' a veteran news director who is now 'b'Hearst Television\xe2\x80\x99s'b' vice president for news, put it this way: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s our nature \xe2\x80\x94 to be there first, to report it first, to let our audience know what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Journalists are competitive; their nerve endings burn with a compulsion to beat rivals to a story. They operate on a belief that audiences flock to whoever can move first with breaking news. Yet everyone I talked to \xe2\x80\x94 including Mr. Bracco and others who place value on being first \xe2\x80\x94 cautioned that it\xe2\x80\x99s always better to be second and right than first and wrong.'b'One who takes the thought further is 'b'Aaron Brown,'b' the CNN anchor who rode herd over coverage of the 9/11 attacks and is now a professor at the Cronkite School.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy first reaction to my print brethren these days is, welcome to my world,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Mr. Brown said experience had taught him that, in the early moments, sources are often wrong. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the chaos of a breaking story,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9call of us who have dealt with it, if we are honest with ourselves, have to ask ourselves: Are we sure? Because we all have been burnt, every one of us.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In Mr. Brown\xe2\x80\x99s view, the rush to publish is misplaced. \xe2\x80\x9cWe mistake our own urgency for the urgency viewers feel,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI just don\xe2\x80\x99t think they feel that. I think they would say to us, we would rather you took another minute and got it right.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To bring this back around to The Times, Mr. Keller, the executive editor, weighs in with the view that the tension between speed and accuracy is \xe2\x80\x9creal but exaggerated.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEvery mistake is a mistake too many,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote me in an e-mail message, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we do not make many serious mistakes because a) reporters are told that while delivering the news in a timely fashion is valuable, getting it right is more important than getting it first, and b) editors are told to filter out information that we don\xe2\x80\x99t think is sufficiently backed up.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Dan Gillmor,'b' an influential writer on digital news and the author of 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMediactive,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' agreed that The Times should \xe2\x80\x9cnot shy away\xe2\x80\x9d from competing hard in the breaking news arena. His formula for sustaining credibility is to carefully label what is known and what is not certain, an approach that Mr. Keller subscribes to.'b'Put me down as a skeptic. It\xe2\x80\x99s understandable, given the gung-ho mentality that journalists adopt, to want to blow right by the choice \xe2\x80\x94 to try to be both first and most credible. But for The Times, which arguably brings the top-rated brand for authoritativeness to this battlefront, the approach is fraught with danger.'b'The Times, unlike The A.P., does not have its own people in 300 locations worldwide. It must rely, more than The A.P. does, on other news organizations for boots on the ground in the early moments of a story. It is better resourced for considered, in-depth coverage than it is for breakneck news delivery.'b'The Times has more to lose than anyone else if, next time, it is the one that kills off Bob Hope prematurely.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'A Fighting Spirit Won\xe2\x80\x99t Save Your Life'b',\xe2\x80\x9d by Richard P.

A recent review by Dr. I. S.

Anti-abortion forces have been trying to take advantage of the 2007 ruling in which the Supreme Court upheld a federal ban on a particular method of abortion.'b'In 2010, more than 600 measures were introduced in state legislatures to limit access to abortion and some 34 secured passage, according to tallies by Naral Pro-Choice America and the Center for Reproductive Rights. November\xe2\x80\x99s elections made the outlook even bleaker.'b'Twenty-nine governors are considered solidly anti-abortion, up from 21 before the election. In 15 states, both the legislature and the governor are anti-abortion, compared with 10 last year. This math greatly increases the prospect of extreme efforts to undermine abortion access with Big Brother measures that require physicians to read scripts about fetal development and provide ultrasound images, and that impose mandatory waiting periods or create other unnecessary regulations.'b'Such restrictions, combined with a persistent atmosphere of intimidation and violence, have taken a grievous toll on the fundamental right protected by Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that recognized a woman\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional right to make her own child-bearing decisions. Eighty-seven percent of counties have no abortion provider, according to the Guttmacher Institute.'b'For the moment, most state legislatures are preoccupied with budget crises, so the next abortion battles are still taking shape. However, there are at least two areas where anti-abortion forces will be active in 2011.'b'The first is the fight over health insurance. The second is the expanding effort to ban later abortions.'b'Reigning Supreme Court precedent restricts the government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to bar abortions prior to the point considered to be the earliest a fetus could survive outside the womb, around 22 to 26 weeks after conception.'b'Nebraska enacted a law last year directly challenging the viability standard. The statute, which went into effect in October, bans abortions 20 weeks after conception. It includes a very narrow exception for a woman\xe2\x80\x99s life and physical health, and lacks any exception for the discovery of severe fetal anomalies. Copycat laws are now pending in other states.'b'About 90 percent of abortions take place in the first trimester, but that does not excuse some states\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to require women to continue pregnancies after a tragic fetal diagnosis or pregnancies that result from rape or incest. The objective is to provide the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s conservative majority with a new vehicle for further tampering with Roe v. Wade\xe2\x80\x99s insight that the decision about whether to terminate a pregnancy is best left to women and their doctors pre-viability.'b'Americans who support women\xe2\x80\x99s reproductive rights and oppose this kind of outrageous government intrusion need to respond with rising force and clarity to this real and immediate danger.'b'Cairo'b'ON Friday, the \xe2\x80\x9cday of rage,\xe2\x80\x9d I was in the streets with the protesters. Friends and I participated in a peaceful demonstration that started at the Amr Ibn al-As Mosque in Old Cairo near the Church of St. George. We set off chanting, \xe2\x80\x9cThe people want the regime to fall!\xe2\x80\x9d and we were greeted with a torrent of tear gas fired by the police. We began to shout, \xe2\x80\x9cPeaceful, Peaceful,\xe2\x80\x9d trying to show the police that we were not hostile, we were demanding nothing but our liberty. That only increased their brutality. Fighting began to spread to the side streets in the ancient, largely Coptic neighborhood.'b'A friend and I took shelter in a small alleyway, where we were warmly welcomed. The locals warned us not to try to escape to the metro station, and pointed us toward a different escape route; many of them even joined the protests. Eventually, a man drove us in his own car to safety.'b'Clearly, the scent of Tunisia\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cjasmine revolution\xe2\x80\x9d has quickly reached Egypt. Following the successful expulsion in Tunis of the dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, the call arose on Facebook for an Egyptian revolution, to begin on Jan. 25. Yet the public here mocked those young people who had taken to Twitter and Facebook to post calls for protest: Since when was the spark of revolution ignited on a pre-planned date? Had revolution become like a romantic rendezvous?'b'Such questions abounded on social networking sites; but even cynics \xe2\x80\x94 myself included \xe2\x80\x94 became hopeful as the calls continued to circulate. In the blink of an eye, the Twitter and Facebook generation had successfully rallied hundreds of thousands to its cause, across the nation. Most of them were young people who had not been politically active, and did not belong to the traditional circles of the political opposition. The Muslim Brotherhood is not behind this popular revolution, as the regime claims. Those who began it and organized it are seething in anger at police cruelty and the repression and torture meted out by the 'b'Hosni Mubarak'b' regime.'b'And, from the outset, the government decided to deal with the people with the utmost violence and brutality in the hope that the Tunisian experience would not be repeated. For days now, tear gas has been the oxygen Egyptians have inhaled. So much was in the air that there are reports of small children and the elderly having suffocated on the fumes in their homes. The security forces in Cairo started by shooting rubber bullets at the protesters, before progressing onto live ammunition, ending dozens of lives.'b'In Suez, where the demonstrations have been tremendously violent, live ammunition was used against civilians from the first day. A friend of mine who lives there sent me a message saying  that, Thursday morning, the city looked as if it had emerged from a particularly brutal war: its streets were burned and destroyed, dead bodies were strewn everywhere; we would never know how many victims had fallen to the police bullets in Suez, my friend solemnly concluded.'b'After having escaped from Old Cairo on Friday, my friends and I headed for Tahrir Square, the focal point of the modern city and site of the largest protests. We joined another demonstration making its way through downtown, consisting  mostly of young people. From a distance, we could hear the rumble of the protest in Tahrir Square, punctuated by the sounds of bullets and screams. Minute by painstaking minute, we protesters were gaining ground, and our numbers were growing. People shared Coca-Cola bottles, moistening their faces with soda to avoid the effects of tear gas. Some people wore masks, while others had sprinkled vinegar into their kaffiyehs.'b'Shopkeepers handed out bottles of mineral water to the protesters, and civilians distributed food periodically. Women and children leaned from windows and balconies, chanting with the dissidents. I will never forget the sight of an aristocratic woman driving through the narrow side streets in her luxurious car, urging the protesters to keep up their spirits, telling them that they would soon be joined by tens of thousands of other citizens arriving from different parts of the city.'b'After several failed attempts to break through the security checkpoints and get to Tahrir Square, we sat in a cafe to rest. Three officers from the regime\xe2\x80\x99s Central Security Forces, all in civilian clothing, sat down next to us. They appeared to be completely relaxed, as though they were impervious to the sounds of bullets and shouting, or to the numbers of wounded and dead Egyptians being reported on Al Jazeera, which was being broadcast on the coffee shop\xe2\x80\x99s television. They and their colleagues were all over the city, spying on their countrymen.'b'Hour by hour on Friday evening, the chaos increased. Police stations and offices of the ruling National Democratic Party were on fire across the country. I wept when news came that 3,000 volunteers had formed a human chain around the national museum to protect it from looting and vandalism. Those who do such things are certainly highly educated, cultivated people, neither vandals nor looters, as they are accused of being by those who have vandalized and looted 'b'Egypt'b' for generations.'b'The curfew meant that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t return home, so I spent the night at a friend\xe2\x80\x99s house near the Parliament building and Interior Ministry, one of the most turbulent parts of the city. That night, the sound of bullets was unceasing. We watched from the window as police  shot with impunity at the protesters and at a nearby gas station, hoping, perhaps, for an explosion. Despite all of this and despite the curfew, the demonstrations did not stop, fueled by popular fury at President Mubarak\xe2\x80\x99s slowness to address the people and, a few hours later, indignation at the deplorable speech he finally gave.'b'On Saturday morning, I left my friend\xe2\x80\x99s house and headed home. I walked across broken glass strewn in the streets, and I could smell the aftermath of the fires that had raged the night before. The army, called in by the regime to put down the protests, was everywhere. I tried first to cross over to Tahrir Square, in order to see for myself whether the museum was safe. A passer-by told me that the army was forbidding people from entering the square, and that shots were being fired. I asked him, anxiously, \xe2\x80\x9cIs the army shooting at the demonstrators?\xe2\x80\x9d He answered, confidently: \xe2\x80\x9cOf course not. The Egyptian army has never fired a shot against an Egyptian citizen, and will not do so now.\xe2\x80\x9d We both openly expressed our wish for that to be true, for the army to side with the people.'b'NOW that army troops were monitoring the demonstrations, the police force had completely disappeared from the streets, as if to taunt people with the choice between their presence and chaos. Armed gangs have mushroomed across the city, seeking to loot shops and terrorize civilians in their homes. (Saturday night, a gang tried to rob the building where I have been staying, but was unable to break in.) Local volunteers have formed committees to stand up to the criminals, amidst an overwhelming feeling that the ruling regime is deliberately stoking chaos.'b'Late Saturday, as I headed toward Corniche Street on the Nile River, I walked through a side street in the affluent Garden City neighborhood, where I found a woman crying. I asked her what was wrong, and she told me that her son, a worker at a luxury hotel, had been shot in the throat by a police bullet, despite not being a part of the demonstrations. He was now lying paralyzed in a hospital bed, and she was on her way to the hotel to request medical leave for him. I embraced her, trying to console her, and she said through her tears, \xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot be silent about what has happened. Silence is a crime. The blood of those who fell cannot be wasted.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I agree. Silence is a crime. Even if the regime continues to bombard us with bullets and tear gas, continues to block Internet access and cut off our mobile phones, we will find ways to get our voices across to the world, to demand freedom and justice.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'No Sign They Get It'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 22):'b'The good news is that \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness as usual\xe2\x80\x9d for the United States oil and natural gas industry means that we are building on nearly a century of commitment to safe and reliable operations.

There are no easy fixes left.'b'Mr. Cuomo has vowed to balance the budget without borrowing or using any of the accounting gimmicks that helped dig New York into this hole. That\xe2\x80\x99s good news.'b'But we are skeptical of his no-new-taxes pledge and his promise to let a surcharge on high earners expire. Extending that one tax until the end of 2012 would add an estimated $2 billion to the budget in the coming fiscal year and $4 billion the following year.'b'Without additional revenue, all of the $10 billion will have to come from spending cuts \xe2\x80\x94 a reduction of more than 10 percent  for  the state\xe2\x80\x99s projected $92.3 billion operating 'b'budget'b'. Half of that goes to schools and 'b'Medicaid'b' and other health care. So the state\xe2\x80\x99s most vulnerable citizens \xe2\x80\x94 the poor, the sick, the elderly and schoolchildren \xe2\x80\x94 will inevitably bear the largest burden.'b'Is there room to cut? Yes. New York spends more per pupil on education and more per enrollee on Medicaid than nearly any other state. Salaries and benefits for state employees outstrip the private sector.'b'In some cases, such as parts of the Medicaid program, the services are better and would be worth the investment in easier times. In too many cases, those higher costs are the result of Albany\xe2\x80\x99s profligacy and its eagerness to reward unions and other special interests.'b'New York also ranks at or near the top of various surveys of tax burdens. The tax system needs to be reviewed, but there is no way to deal with the budget crises \xe2\x80\x94 near-term and long-term \xe2\x80\x94 without higher taxes.'b'\xc2\x95'b'We need to live within our means. The challenge is to find ways to cut spending equitably and limit the disruption to essential services and the damage to the state\xe2\x80\x99s future. Living within our means also requires finding equitable sources of additional revenue.'b'Mr. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s budget for fiscal year 2011-12 is due Tuesday. The Legislature must approve a final budget by April 1. That is not a lot of time. Politicians and voters need to use it well, carefully reviewing and debating policy decisions. Here are some of the issues to consider:'b''b'THE NUMBERS'b' New York State has a frustratingly opaque budgeting process, but as of November, the state  budget office was predicting a breakdown that includes: $24 billion for health care, mainly Medicaid; $23 billion for K-12 education; $17 billion for state employee salaries and benefits; $6.5 billion for local government grants; and $3.4 billion for welfare and other social services.'b'Mr. Cuomo wants to streamline government and we will certainly hear a lot more about reducing waste, fraud and abuse. These are admirable goals, but there is no way to find $10 billion in savings without making significant cuts from the biggest-ticket items.'b''b'MEDICAID 'b'New York\xe2\x80\x99s Medicaid program\xe2\x80\x94 the joint state-federal health insurance for the poor \xe2\x80\x94 is expected to spend far more than any other state\xe2\x80\x99s, including the programs in California and Texas, which have much larger populations.'b'In part that is due to the high cost of medical care around New York City. But New York\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility terms and benefits are some of the most generous in the nation. It ranks near the top in providing \xe2\x80\x9coptional benefits,\xe2\x80\x9d such as dental coverage and long-term care. And it spends more than any other state per enrollee on care for the elderly and disabled.'b'Any cuts must try to minimize harm to patients and communities. Unfortunately, cuts in Medicaid could be almost three times as painful as other cuts: if Albany cuts $2 billion, local governments automatically cut at least $750 million and New York  will lose $2.75 billion in federal funds, for a total reduction of $5.5 billion.'b'The best place to look for savings is  in programs for the elderly and the disabled; as a quarter of the enrollees, they receive almost three-quarters of total Medicaid spending. Some is acute care in hospitals, but a lot is long-term care in nursing homes, clinics and at home, where spending is rising rapidly.'b'The state may need to restrict allowed home visits, placing an even greater burden on families. More long-term care patients must be moved into managed care plans. To save money right now, Albany will likely have to cut the reimbursement rates to hospitals and other institutions. It will need to focus on well-paid providers, without endangering safety-net hospitals.'b'New York could get some additional help next year from Washington if it is aggressive about applying for demonstration grants to test cost-saving approaches under the 'b'health care reform'b' law. If they work, they could also bring lasting improvements to the program.'b''b'EDUCATION 'b'New York\xe2\x80\x99s average per pupil cost of more than $15,000 is well above the national average of about $11,000. In student achievement, the state trails Massachusetts and Maryland, which spend significantly less. That means New York has two challenges: it must address the quality of instruction and the high costs.'b'Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature must first acknowledge the historical inequity of education financing \xe2\x80\x94 and guarantee that the poorest districts will feel the least pain. For decades, Albany has starved poor school districts while lavishing money on wealthy districts.'b'Under a court ruling, Albany in 2007 adopted a new, needs-based funding formula intended to distribute an additional $7 billion over several years to poor and chronically underfinanced districts. The money was distributed for two years, frozen in the third year and cut significantly last year.'b'This year, the wealthiest school districts should bear much of the burden,  and poor districts should  be protected as much as possible.'b'Last year\xe2\x80\x99s cuts cost New York City about $440 million in education funds. The Ilion school district, in upstate Herkimer County, is another that has been long neglected, and last year\xe2\x80\x99s loss of about $450,000 in state aid hit particularly hard. The district had to lay off 3 of its 145 teachers and did not replace two others who retired. The superintendent worries that he might have to lay off as many as 10 additional teachers this year.'b'Ilion is doing many of the right things to cut costs. It buys office and payroll services from a consortium and is exploring a merger with three other districts. Even the most ambitious savings pale when compared with the burden of salaries and benefits, which make up about 75 percent of Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s costs.'b'Ilion\xe2\x80\x99s problems are deeper than those of many other districts, but the underlying choices are the same. Savings can be found through streamlining and other creative reforms. But with 75 percent of all local education budgets going to pay for teachers\xe2\x80\x99 salaries and benefits, that is where much of the money will have to be found.'b'The unions may have to accept a salary freeze, and even then layoffs may be inevitable. (Last year, the state lost 9,000 of its 220,000 teachers due to the budget cuts.) Teachers will have to agree to pay more into their pensions and health insurance plans, and to raise the retirement age to 65.'b'Governor Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s call for a 2 percent cap on property taxes will make a bad situation even worse. It would make it impossible for districts \xe2\x80\x94 unless voters overrode the cap \xe2\x80\x94 to raise more local school aid at the very time that  the state is cutting its contribution. The Legislature should reject the idea.'b''b'PERSONNEL'b' Mr. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s proposed salary freeze for many of the state\xe2\x80\x99s 236,000 workers could save at least $200 million next year. Unions are resisting. Freezes are a painful fact of life across the private sector these days. And, thanks to their powerful unions, state workers have gotten raises worth more than 13 percent since 2007.'b'New York will never get its fiscal house in order unless it deals with employees\xe2\x80\x99 extremely generous benefits. By 2013, the average total compensation \xe2\x80\x94 salary, pension contribution and health insurance contribution \xe2\x80\x94 for a state employee will be $102,000.'b'While private-sector workers pay about 20 percent of the cost of individual health insurance coverage on average, state employees contribute only 10 percent.'b'Pension benefits are even more out of line. Until 2009, most employees contributed 3 percent to their pensions, but only for the first decade of employment. In 2009 lawmakers required new employees to contribute 3 percent every year, but that contribution is still less than half of what most other states require. New York also has lower retirement ages and higher disability rates than most states and is one of only three in the country to count overtime in calculating pension benefits.'b'The state must insist on higher contributions by all its workers to pensions and health insurance, a lower ceiling on the amount of overtime counted in pension calculations and wage increases in line with those in the economy at large.'b''b'REVENUES 'b'In his State of the State address, Governor Cuomo said that New York has \xe2\x80\x9cthe worst business tax climate in the nation, period.\xe2\x80\x9d That was a reference to New York\xe2\x80\x99s last-place position in a tally by one research group, the Tax Foundation. Other tallies yield different results. Even using that ranking, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to prove that businesses in New York are at a huge competitive disadvantage, especially since neighboring New Jersey ranked 48 and Connecticut ranked 47, while South Dakota and Alaska were first and second.'b'More important, taxes generally rank behind education, infrastructure and other criteria when businesses decide where to locate. Trying to balance the budget solely with cuts \xe2\x80\x94 in education and essential services \xe2\x80\x94 will make New York even less attractive.'b'With the economy still struggling this is not the time to impose major new taxes. There are some that can bring in a good chunk of revenue, without doing damage.'b'As we said, New York would get an estimated $2 billion of additional revenue in the upcoming fiscal year if it extended the personal income tax surcharge that applies to couples making more than $300,000 and individuals making over $200,000. (A couple with two school-age children and taxable income of $350,000 would pay $3,500 more. A couple making $1 million, with two children and typical deductions, would pay about $20,500 more.)'b'Wealthy families got a generous break from Washington with the extension of the 'b'Bush-era tax cuts'b'. Mr. Cuomo should extend New York\xe2\x80\x99s surcharge for two more years. Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature should also be looking for other sources of revenue. A penny-per-ounce tax on sugary sodas could raise an estimated $465 million in the first fiscal year. This is a no-brainer.'b'The governor also needs to order a systematic review of nearly $29 billion in state tax credits and other breaks. Some are necessary to encourage investment and development, but others stay on the books year after year without any analysis of their value. Why, for example, do sellers of precious metal bullion and coins get a tax break that cost the state $185 million in 2010? Doing away with about 5 percent of these deals would bring in nearly $1.5 billion.'b'None of these choices will be easy. Governor Cuomo has set up several commissions to recommend ways to cut costs and streamline government. We hope the process will promote an honest, transparent debate. New York can\xe2\x80\x99t go on this way any longer.'b'\xc2\x95'b''b'This is the first in a series of editorials about the fiscal crisis in New York State and in other states around the country. 'b''b'Last Saturday, reported The Financial Times, some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful financial executives were going to hold  a private meeting with finance ministers in Davos, the site of the World Economic Forum. The principal demand of the executives, the newspaper suggested, would be that governments \xe2\x80\x9cstop banker-bashing.\xe2\x80\x9d Apparently bailing bankers out after they precipitated the worst slump since the Great Depression isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough \xe2\x80\x94 politicians have to stop hurting their feelings, too.'b'But the bankers also had a more substantive demand: they want higher interest rates, despite the persistence of very high unemployment in the United States and Europe, because they say that low rates are feeding inflation. And what worries me is the possibility that policy makers might actually take their advice.'b'To understand the issues, you need to know that we\xe2\x80\x99re in the midst of what the International Monetary Fund calls a \xe2\x80\x9ctwo speed\xe2\x80\x9d recovery, in which some countries are speeding ahead, but others \xe2\x80\x94 including the United States \xe2\x80\x94 have yet to get out of first gear.'b'The U.S. economy fell into recession at the end of 2007; the rest of the world followed a few months later. And advanced nations \xe2\x80\x94 the United States, Europe, Japan \xe2\x80\x94 have barely begun to recover. It\xe2\x80\x99s true that these economies have been growing since the summer of 2009, but the growth has been too slow to produce large numbers of jobs. To raise interest rates under these conditions would be to undermine any chance of doing better; it would mean, in effect, accepting mass unemployment as a permanent fact of life.'b'What about inflation? High unemployment has kept a lid on the measures of inflation that usually guide policy. The Federal Reserve\xe2\x80\x99s preferred measure, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, is now running below half a percent at an annual rate, far below the informal target of 2 percent.'b'But food and energy prices \xe2\x80\x94 and commodity prices in general \xe2\x80\x94 have, of course, been rising lately. Corn and wheat prices rose around 50 percent last year; copper, cotton and rubber prices have been setting new records. What\xe2\x80\x99s that about?'b'The answer, mainly, is growth in emerging markets. While recovery in advanced nations has been sluggish, developing countries \xe2\x80\x94 China in particular \xe2\x80\x94 have come roaring back from the 2008 slump. This has created inflation pressures within many of these countries; it has also led to sharply rising global demand for raw materials. Bad weather \xe2\x80\x94 especially an unprecedented heat wave in the former Soviet Union, which led to a sharp fall in world wheat production \xe2\x80\x94 has also played a role in driving up food prices.'b'The question is, what bearing should all of this have on policy at the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank?'b'First of all, inflation in China is China\xe2\x80\x99s problem, not ours. It\xe2\x80\x99s true that right now China\xe2\x80\x99s currency is pegged to the dollar. But that\xe2\x80\x99s China\xe2\x80\x99s choice; if China doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like U.S. monetary policy, it\xe2\x80\x99s free to let its currency rise. Neither China nor anyone else has the right to demand that America strangle its nascent economic recovery just because Chinese exporters want to keep the renminbi undervalued.'b'What about commodity prices? The Fed normally focuses on \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d inflation, which excludes food and energy, rather than \xe2\x80\x9cheadline\xe2\x80\x9d inflation, because experience shows that while some prices fluctuate widely from month to month, others have a lot of inertia \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s the ones with inertia you want to worry about, because once either inflation or deflation gets built into these prices, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get rid of.'b'And this focus has served the Fed well in the past. In particular, the Fed was right not to raise rates in 2007-8, when commodity prices soared \xe2\x80\x94 briefly pushing headline inflation above 5 percent \xe2\x80\x94 only to plunge right back to earth. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to see why the Fed should behave differently this time, with inflation nowhere near as high as it was during the last commodity boom.'b'So why the demand for higher rates? Well, bankers have a long history of getting fixated on commodity prices. Traditionally, that meant insisting that any rise in the price of gold would mean the end of Western civilization. These days it means demanding that interest rates be raised because the prices of copper, rubber, cotton and tin have gone up, even though underlying inflation is on the decline.'b'Ben Bernanke clearly understands that raising rates now would be a huge mistake. But Jean-Claude Trichet, his European counterpart, is making hawkish noises \xe2\x80\x94 and both the Fed and the European Central Bank are under a lot of external pressure to do the wrong thing.'b'They need to resist this pressure. Yes, commodity prices are up \xe2\x80\x94 but that\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to perpetuate mass unemployment. To paraphrase William Jennings Bryan, we must not crucify our economies upon a cross of rubber.'b'To the Editor:'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Thorny Path to a National Black Museum'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 23):'b'I am certain that establishing the National Museum of African American History and Culture will be a continuing challenge for all who are involved.

'b''b'As the world ponders the fate of 'b'Egypt'b' after 'b'Hosni Mubarak'b', Americans should ponder this: It\xe2\x80\x99s quite possible that if Mubarak had not ruled Egypt as a dictator for the last 30 years, the World Trade Center would still be standing.'b'This is true even though Mubarak\xe2\x80\x99s regime has been a steadfast U.S. ally, a partner in our counterterrorism efforts and a foe of Islamic radicalism. Or, more aptly, it\xe2\x80\x99s true because his regime has been all of these things.'b'In \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Looming Tower'b',\xe2\x80\x9d his history of 'b'Al Qaeda'b', Lawrence Wright raises the possibility that \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s tragedy on September 11 was born in the prisons of Egypt.\xe2\x80\x9d By visiting imprisonment, torture and exile upon Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s Muslim Brotherhood, Mubarak foreclosed any possibility of an Islamic revolution in his own country. But he also helped radicalize and internationalize his country\xe2\x80\x99s Islamists, pushing men like Ayman Al-Zawahiri  \xe2\x80\x94  Osama bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s chief lieutenant, and arguably the real brains behind Al Qaeda  \xe2\x80\x94  out of Egyptian politics and into the global jihad.'b'At the same time, Mubarak\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Washington has offered constant vindication for the jihadi worldview. Under his rule, Egypt received more American dollars than any country besides Israel. For many young Egyptians, restless amid political and economic stagnation, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a short leap from hating their dictator to hating his patrons in the United States. One of the men who made this leap was an architecture student named Mohamed Atta, who was at the cockpit when American Airlines Flight 11 hit the World Trade Center.'b'These sound like good reasons to welcome Mubarak\xe2\x80\x99s potential overthrow, and the end to America\xe2\x80\x99s decades-long entanglement with his drab, repressive regime. Unfortunately, Middle Eastern politics is never quite that easy. The United States supported Mubarak for so long because of two interrelated fears: the fear of another Khomeini and the fear of another Nasser. Both anxieties remain entirely legitimate today.'b'The first fear everyone understands, because we\xe2\x80\x99re still living with the religious tyranny that Ayatollah Khomeini   established in Iran in 1979, in the wake of a spontaneous revolution not unlike the one currently sweeping Cairo and Alexandria.'b'The second fear is less immediately resonant, because Gamal Abdel Nasser is now 40   years in the grave. But the last time a popular revolution in the land of the pharaohs overthrew a corrupt regime, the year was 1952, Nasser was the beneficiary  \xe2\x80\x94  and Washington lived to rue the day he came to power.'b'Nasser was not an Islamist: he was a secular pan-Arabist socialist, which in the 1950s seemed to put him on history\xe2\x80\x99s cutting edge. But under his influence, Egypt became an aggressively destabilizing force in Middle Eastern politics. His dream of a unified Arab world helped inspire convulsions and coups from Lebanon to Iraq. He fought two wars with Israel, and intervened disastrously in Yemen. His army was accused of using poison gas in that conflict, a grim foreshadowing of Saddam Hussein\xe2\x80\x99s domestic tactics. And his 'b'pursuit of ballistic missiles'b'  was a kind of dress rehearsal for today\xe2\x80\x99s Iranian nuclear brinkmanship  \xe2\x80\x94  complete with a covert Israeli campaign to undermine his weapons programs.'b'The memory of Nasser is a reminder that even if post-Mubarak Egypt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t descend into religious dictatorship, it\xe2\x80\x99s still likely to lurch in a more anti-American direction. The long-term consequences of a more populist and nationalistic Egypt might be better for the United States than the stasis  of the Mubarak era, and the terrorism that it helped inspire. But then again they might be worse. There are devils behind every door.'b'Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t like to admit this. We take refuge in foreign policy systems: liberal internationalism or realpolitik, neoconservatism or noninterventionism. We have theories, and expect the facts to fall into line behind them. Support democracy, and stability will take care of itself. Don\xe2\x80\x99t meddle, and nobody will meddle with you. International institutions will keep the peace. No, balance-of-power politics will do it.'b'But history makes fools of us all. We make deals with dictators, and reap the whirlwind of terrorism. We promote democracy, and watch Islamists gain power from Iraq to 'b'Palestine'b'. We leap into humanitarian interventions, and get bloodied in Somalia. We stay out, and watch 'b'genocide'b' engulf Rwanda. We intervene in Afghanistan and then depart, and watch the Taliban take over. We intervene in Afghanistan and stay, and end up trapped there, with no end in sight.'b'Sooner or later, the theories always fail. The world is too complicated for them, and too tragic. History has its upward arcs, but most crises require weighing unknowns against unknowns, and choosing between competing evils.'b'The only comfort, as we watch Egyptians struggle for their country\xe2\x80\x99s future, is that some choices aren\xe2\x80\x99t America\xe2\x80\x99s to make.'
